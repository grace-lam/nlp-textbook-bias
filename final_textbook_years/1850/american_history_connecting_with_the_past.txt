432 chapter 16 largely free were below them.
apaches navajos and others some captured in war and enslaved for a fixed time others caste system men an women wh had voluntarily left their own tribes were at the bottom.
they were known as genizaros indians without tribes and they had become in many ways part of spanish society.
this caste system reflected how the spanish empire in america was preoccupied with racial ancestry almost every group in the southwest not just spanish and indians but several categories of mulattoes and mestizos people of mixed race as well had a clear place in an elaborate social hierarchy.
the most widespread indian presence in the west was the plains indians a diverse group of tribes and language groups.
some tribes formed alliances with one an plains indians other others were in constant conflict.
some lived sedentary lives as farmers others were highly nomadic hunters.
despite their differences however the tribes shared some traits.
their cultures were based on close and extended family networks and on an intimate relationship with nature.
tribes which sometimes numbered several thousand were generally subdivided into bands of up to 500 men and women.
each band had its own governing council but the community had a decision making process in which most members participated.
within each band tasks were divided by gender.
womens roles were largely domestic and artistic raising children cooking gathering roots and berries preparing hides and creating many of the impressive artworks of tribal culture.
they also tended fields and gardens in those places where bands remained settled long enough to raise crops.
men worked as hunters and traders and supervised the religious and military life of the band.
most of the plains indians practiced a religion centered on a belief in the spiritual power of the natural world of plants and animals and the rhythms of the days and the seasons.
economic importance of the buffalo many of the plains tribes including some of the most powerful tribes in the sioux nation subsisted largely through hunting buffalo.
riding small but powerful horses descendants of spanish stock the tribes moved through the grasslands following the herds.
permanent settlements were rare.
when a band halted it constructed tepees as temporary dwellings when it departed it left the landscape almost completely undisturbed a reflection of the deep reverence for nature that was central to indian culture and religion.
the buffalo or bison provided the economic basis for the plains indians way of life.
its flesh was their principal source of food and its skin supplied materials for clothing shoes tepees blankets robes and utensils.
buffalo chips dried manure m provided fuel buffalo bones became knives and arrow tips buffalo tendons formed the strings of bows.
the plains indians were proud and aggressive warriors scooled in warfare from their frequent and usually brief skirmishes with rival tribes.
the male members of each tribe were in effect a warrior class.
they competed with one another to develop reputations for fierceness and bravery as both hunters and soldiers.
by the early nineteenth century the sioux had become the most powerful tribe in the missouri river valley and had begun expanding west and south until they dominated much of the plains.
the plains warriors proved to be the most formidable foes white settlers encountered.
but the tribes also suffered from several serious weaknesses that in the end made it impossible for them to prevail.
one weakness was the inability of the various tribes and often even of the bands within tribes to unite against white aggression.
they were seldom able to draw together a coalition large enough to counter white power.
they were also frequently distracted from their battles with whites by conflicts among the tribes themselves.
at buffalo chase the painter george catlin captured this scene of plains indians in the 1830s hunting among the great herds of buffalo which provided the food and materials on which many tribes relied.
private collection the bridgeman art library j the conquest of the far west 433 times tribal warriors faced white forces who were being assisted by guides and even fighters from other usually rival tribes.
even so some tribes were able to overcome their divisions and unite effectively for a time.
by the mid nineteenth century for example the sioux arapaho and cheyenne had indian forged a powerful alliance that dominated weaknesses t ie northern plains.
but there remained other important ecological and economic weaknesses of the western tribes in their contest with white society.
indians were tragically vulnerable to eastern infectious diseases.
smallpox epidemics for example decimated the pawnees in nebraska in the 1840s and many of the california tribes in the early 1850s.
and the tribes were of course at a considerable disadvantage in any long term battle with an economically and industrially advanced people.
they were in the end outmanned and outgunned.
hispanic new mexico for centuries much of the far west had been part of first the spanish empire and later the mexican republic.
although the lands the united states acquired in the 1840s did not include any of mexicos most populous regions considerable numbers of mexicans did live in them and suddenly became residents of american territory.
most of them stayed.
spanish speaking communities were scattered throughout the southwest from texas to california.
all of them were transformed in varying degrees by the arrival of anglo american migrants and equally important by the expansion of the american capitalist economy into the region.
for some spanish speaking westerners the changes created opportunities for greater wealth.
but for most it meant an end to the communal societies and economies they had built over many generations.
in new mexico the centers of spanishspeaking society were the farming and trading communities the spanish had established in the seventeenth century see p 17.
descendants of the original spanish settlers and more recent migrants from mexico lived alongside the pueblo indians and some american traders and engaged primarily in cattle and sheep ranching.
there was a small aristocracy of great landowners whose estates radiated out from the major trading center at santa fe.
and there was a large population of spanish later mexican peasants who worked on the great estates farmed small plots of their own or otherwise scraped out a subsistence.
there were also large groups of indian laborers some enslaved or indentured.
when the united states acquired title to new mexico in the aftermath of the mexican war general stephen kearnywho had commanded the american troops in the region during the conflict tried to establish a territorial government taos indian rebellion that excluded the established mexican ruling class the landed aristocrats from around santa fe and the most influential priests.
he drew most of the officials from among the approximately 1 000 anglo americans in the region ignoring the more than 50 000 hispanics.
there were widespread fears among hispanics and indians alike that the new american rulers of the region would confiscate their lands and otherwise threaten their societies.
in 1847 taos indians rebelled they killed the new governor and other anglo american officials before being subdued by u s army forces.
new mexico remained under military rule for three years until the united states finally organized a territorial government there in 1850.
by the 1870s the government of new mexico was dominated by one of the most notorious of the many territorial rings that sprang up in the west in the years before statehood.
these were circles of local anglo businesspeople and ambitious politicians with access to federal money who worked together to make the territorial government mutually profitable.
in santa fe the ring used its influence to gain control of over 2 million acres of land much of which had long been in the possession of the original mexican residents of the territory.
the old hispanic elite in new mexico had lost much of its political and economic authority.
even without its former power and despite the expansion of anglo american settlement hispanic society in new mexico survived and grew.
the u s army finally did what the hispanic residents had been unable to accomplish for 200 years it broke the power of the navajo apache and other tribes that had so often harassed the residents of new mexico and had prevented them from expanding their society and commerce.
the defeat of the tribes led to substantial hispanic migration into other areas of the southwest and as far north as colorado.
most of the expansion involved peasants and small tradespeople who were looking for land or new opportunities for commerce.

chapter 16 hispanic societies survived in the southwest in part because they were so far from the centers of english speaking society that anglo american migrants and the railroads that carried them were slow to get there.
but resistance mexican americans in the region also fought at times to preserve control of their societies.
in the late 1880s for example mexican peasants in an area of what is now nevada successfully fended off the en croachment of english speaking cattle ranchers.
but by then such successes were already the exception.
the anglo american presence in the southwest grew rapidly once the railroads established lines into the region in the 1880s and early 1890s.
with the railroads came extensive new ranching farming and mining.
the expansion of economic activity in the region attracted a new wave of mexican immigrants perhaps as many as 100 000 by 1900 who moved across the border which was unregulated until world war i in search of work.
but the new immigrants unlike the earlier hispanic residents of the southwest were coming to a society in which they were from the beginning subordinate to anglo americans.
the english speaking proprietors of the new enterprises restricted most mexicans to the lowest paying and least stable jobs.
hispanic california and texas in california spanish settlement began in the eighteenth century with a string of christian missions along the pacific coast.
the missionaries and the soldiers who accompanied them gathered most of the coastal indians into their communities some forcibly and some by persuasion.
the indians were targets of the evangelizing efforts of the missionaries who baptized more than 50 000 of them.
but they were also a labor force for the flourishing and largely self sufficient economies the missionaries created the spanish forced most of these laborers into a state of servitude little different from slavery.
the missions had enormous herds of cattle horses sheep and goats most of them tended by indian workers they had brickmakers blacksmiths weavers and farmers most of them indians as well.
few of the profits of the mission economy flowed to the workers.
in the 1830s after the new mexican government had begun reducing the power of the church the mission society largely collapsed despite strenuous resistance from the missionaries themselves.
in its place emerged a secular of mission mexican aristocracy which controlled a society chain of large estates some of them former missions in the fertile lands west of the sierra nevada.
for them the arrival of anglo americans before and after the civil war was disastrous.
so vast were the numbers of english speaking immigrants that the californios as the hispanic residents of the state were known had little power to resist the onslaught.
in the central and northern parts of the state where the anglo population growth was greatest the californios experienced a series of defeats.
english speaking prospectors organized to exclude them sometimes violently from the mines during the gold rush.
many californios also lost ir lands either through corrupt business deals or through outright seizure sometimes with the help of the courts and often through simple occupation by squatters.
years of litigation by the displaced hispanics had very little effect on the changing distribution of landownership.
in the southern areas of california where there were at first fewer migrants than in other parts of the state some mexican landowners managed to hang on for a time.
the booming anglo communities in the north of the state created a large market for the cattle that southern rancheros were raising.
but a combination of reckless expansion growing indebtedness and a severe drought in the 1860s devastated the mexican ranching culture.
by the 1880s the hispanic aristocracy in california had largely ceased to exist.
increasingly mexicans and mexican americans became part of the lower end of the states working class clustered in barrios in los angeles or elsewhere or becoming migrant farmworkers.
even small landowners who managed to hang on to their farms found themselves unable to raise livestock as the once communal grazing lands fell under the control of powerful anglo ranchers.
the absence of herding destroyed many family economies and by forcing farmers into migrant work displaced much of the peasantry.
a similar pattern of dispossession occurred in texas where many mexican landowners lost their land after the territory joined the united states see pp.
this occurred as a result of fraud coercion and the inability of even the most substantial mexican ranchers to compete with the enormous emerging anglo american ranching kingdoms.
in 1859 mexican resentments erupted in an armed challenge to american power a raid on a jail in brownsville led by the rancher juan cortina who freed all the mexican prisoners in declining si e but such resistance had little long status of term effect.
cortina continued to harass hispanics anglo communities in texas until 1875 but the mexican government finally captured and imprisoned him.
as in california mexicans in southern texas who constituted nearly three quarters of the population there became an increasingly impoverished working class relegated largely to unskilled farm or industrial labor.
on the whole the great anglo american migration was less catastrophic for the hispanic population of the west than it was for the indian tribes.
indeed for some hispanics it created new opportunities for wealth and station.
for the most part however the late nineteenth century saw the destruction of mexican americans authority in a region they had long considered their own and it saw the movement of large numbers of hispanics both longtime residents of the west and more recent immigrants into an impoverished working class serving the expanding capitalist economy of the united states.
the chinese migration at the same time that ambitious or impoverished europeans were crossing the atlantic in search of opportunities in the new world many chinese crossed the pacific in hopes of better lives than they could expect in their own poverty stricken land.
not all came to the united states.
many chinese moved the conquest of the far west 435 to hawaii australia south and central america south africa and even the caribbean some as coolies indentured servants whose condition was close to slavery.
a few chinese had come to california even before the gold rush see pp.
351 352 but after 1848 the flow increased dramatically.
by 1880 more than 200 000 chinese had settled in the united states mostly in california where they constituted nearly a tenth of the population.
almost all came as free laborers.
for a time white americans welcomed the chinese as a racism conscientious hardworking people.
in 1852 the governor of california called them one of the most worthy classes of our newly adopted citizens and called for more chinese immigration to swell the territory s inadequate labor force.
very quickly however white opinion turned hostile in part because the chinese were so industrious and successful that some white americans began considering them rivals even threats.
the experience of chinese immigrants in the west became therefore a struggle to advance economically in the face of racism and discrimination.
in the early 1850s large numbers of chinese immigrants worked in the gold mines and for a time some of them enjoyed considerable success.
but opportunities for chinese to prosper in the mines were fleeting.
in 1852 the california legislature began trying to exclude the chinese from gold mining by enacting a foreign miners tax which also helped exclude mexicans.
a series of other laws in the 1850s were designed to discourage chinese emigration to the territory.
gradually the effect of the discriminatory laws the hostility of white miners and the declining profitability of the surface mines drove most chinese out of prospecting.
those who remained in the mountains became primarily hired workers in the mines built by corporations with financing from the east.
these newer mines which extended much deeper into the mountains than the transcontinental railroad this complicated trestle ra lroad.
it gives some indication of the enormous engineering challenges t e rai roa construction by the union pacific was one of many large spans necessary for the completion of the transcontinental un er cons overcome.
universal history archive uig the bridgeman art library 436 chapter 16 building the transcontinental railroad individual prospectors or small self financed groups had been able to go replaced the early smaller operations.
as mining declined as a source of wealth and jobs for the chinese railroad employment grew.
beginning in 1865 more than 12 000 chinese found work building the transcontinental railroad.
in fact chinese workers formed 90 percent of the labor force of the central pacific and were mainly responsible for construction of the western part of the new road.
the company preferred them to white workers because they had no experience of labor organization.
they worked hard made few demands and accepted low wages.
many railroad workers were recruited in china by agents for the central pacific.
once employed they were organized into work gangs under chinese supervisors.
work on the central pacific was arduous and often dangerous.
as the railroad moved through the mountains the company made few concessions to the difficult conditions and provided its workers with little protection from the elements.
work continued through the winter and many chinese tunneled into snowbanks at night to create warm sleeping areas for themselves.
the tunnels frequently collapsed suffocating those inside but the company allowed nothing to disrupt construction.
chinese laborers however were not always as docile as their employers imagined them to be.
in the spring of 1866 5 000 chinese railroad workers went on strike demanding higher wages and a shorter workday.
the company isolated them surrounded them with strikebreakers and starved them.
the strike failed and most of the workers returned to their jobs.
in 1869 the transcontinental railroad was completed.
thousands of chinese were now out of work.
some hired themselves out on the vast new drainage and irrigation projects in the agricultural valleys of central california.
some became common agricultural laborers picking fruit for low wages.
some became tenant farmers often on marginal lands that white owners saw no profit in working themselves.
some managed to acquire land of their own and establish themselves as modestly successful truck farmers.
increasingly however chinese immigrants flocked to cities.
by 1900 nearly half the chinese population of california lived establishment urban areas by far the largest single of chinese community was in san francisco.
chinatowns much of community life there and in other chinatowns throughout the west revolved around powerful organizations usually formed by people from a single clan or community in china that functioned as something like benevolent societies to address common social and financial issues and filled many of the roles that political machines often served in immigrant communities in eastern cities.
they were often led by prominent merchants.
in san francisco the leading merchants known as the six companies often worked together to advance their interests in the city and state.
these organizations became in effect employment brokers unions arbitrators of disputes defenders of the community against outside persecution and dispensers of social services.
they also organized the elaborate festivals and celebrations that were such a conspicuous and important part of life in chinatowns.
other chinese organizations were secret societies known as tongs some of the tongs were violent criminal organizations involved in the opium trade and prostitution.
few people outside the chinese communities were aware of their existence except when rival tongs engaged in violent conflict or tong wars as occurred frequently in san francisco in the 1880s.
life was hard for most urban chinese in san francisco and elsewhere.
the chinese usually occupied the lower rungs of the employment ladder working as common laborers servants and unskilled factory hands.
some established their own small businesses especially laundries.
they moved into this business not because of experience there were few commercial laundries in china but because they were excluded from so many other areas of employment.
laundries could be started with very little capital and required only limited command of english.
by the 1890s chinese constituted over two thirds of all the laundry workers in california many of them in shops they themselves owned and ran.
the relatively small number of chinese women fared even worse.
during the earliest chinese migrations to california virtually all the women who made the journey did so because they had been sold into prostitution.
as late as 1880 nearly half the chinese women in california were prostitutes.
both anglo and chinese reformers tried to stamp out the prostitution in chinatowns in the 1890s but more effective than their efforts was the growing number of chinese women in america.
once the sex ratio became more balanced chinese men were more likely to seek companionship in families.
anti chinese sentiments as chinese communities grew larger and more conspicuous in western cities anti chinese sentiment among white residents became increasingly strong.
anti coolie clubs emerged in the anti coolie 1860s and 1870s.
they sought a ban on clubs employing chinese and organized boy cotts of products made with chinese labor.
some of these clubs attacked chinese workers in the streets and were suspected of setting fire to factories in which chinese worked.
such activities reflected the resentment of many white workers toward chinese laborers for accepting low wages and thus undercutting union members.
as the political value of attacking the chinese grew in california the democratic party took up the call.
so did the workingmens party of california created in 1878 by denis kearney an irish immigrant which gained significant political power in the state largely on the basis of its hostility to the chinese.
by the mid 1880s anti chinese agitation and violence had spread up and down the pacific coast and into other areas of the west.
but anti chinese sentiment did not rest on economic grounds alone.
it rested on cultural and racial arguments as well.
for example the reformer henry george a critic of capitalism and a champion of the rights of labor see p 472 described the the conquest of the far west 437 a chinese family in san francisco like many other americans chinese families liked to pose for photograph portraits in the late nineteenth century.
and like many other immigrants they often sent such pictures back to relatives in china.
this portrait of chun duck chin and his seven year old son chun jan yut was taken in a studio in san francisco in the 1870s.
both father and son appear to have dressed up for the occasion in traditional chinese garb and the studio which likely took many such portraits of chinese families provided a formal chinese backdrop.
the son is holding what appears to be a chicken perhaps to impress relatives in china with the family s prosperity.
national archives and records administration chinese as products of a civilization that had failed to progress that remained mired in barbarism and savagery.
they were therefore unassimilable and should be excluded.
in 1882 congress responded to the political pressure and the growing violence by passing the chinese exclusion act chinese which banned chinese emigration to the exclusion act united states for ten years and barred chinese already in the country from becoming naturalized citizens.
support for the act came from representatives from all regions of the country.
it reflected the growing fear of unemployment and labor unrest throughout the nation and the belief that excluding an industrial army of asiatic laborers would protect american workers and help reduce class conflict.
congress renewed the law for another ten years in 1892 and made it permanent in 1902.
it had a dramatic effect on the chinese population which declined by more than 40 percent in the forty years after its passage.
the chinese in america did not accept the new laws quietly.
they were shocked by the anti chinese rhetoric that lumped them together with african americans and resistance indians.
they were they insisted descendants of a great and enlightened civilization.
how could they be compared to people who knew nothing about the relations of society.
white americans they said did not protest the great waves of immigration by italians the most dangerous of men one chinese american said or irish or jews.
they are all let in while chinese who are sober are duly law abiding clean educated and industrious are shut out the six companies in san francisco organized strenuous letter writing campaigns and filed suit in federal court.
their efforts had little effect.
migration from the east the great wave of new settlers in the west after the civil war came on the heels of important earlier migrations.
california and oregon were both already states of the union by 1860.
there were large and growing anglo american and african american communities in texas which had entered the union as a state in 1845 and had been part of the confederacy during the war.
and from texas and elsewhere traders farmers and ranchers had begun to establish anglo american outposts in parts of new mexico arizona and other areas of the southwest.
but the scale of the postwar migration dwarfed everything that had preceded it.
in previous decades the settlers had come in thousands.
now they came in millions spreading throughout the vast western territories into empty and inhabited lands alike.
most of the new settlers were from the established anglo american societies of the eastern united states but substantial numbers more than 2 million between 1870 and 1900 were foreign born immigrants from europe scandinavians germans irish russians czechs and others.
settlers were attracted by gold and silver deposits by the shortgrass pastures for cattle and sheep and ultimately by the sod of the plains and the meadowlands of the mountains which they discovered were suitable for farming or ranching.
settlement was also encouraged by the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 and the construction of the many subsidiary lines that spread out from it.
the land policies of the federal government also encouraged settlement.
the homestead act of 1862 permitted settlers to homestead buy p ots acres for a small fee if they act occupied the land they purchased for five years and improved it.
the homestead act was intended as a progressive measure.
it would give a free farm to any american who needed one.
it would be a form of government relief to people who otherwise might have no prospects.
and it would help create new markets and new outposts of commercial agriculture for the nations growing economy.
but the homestead act rested on a number of mispercep tions.
the framers of the law had assumed that mere possession of land would be enough to sustain a farm family.
they had not recognized the effects of the increasing mechanization of agriculture and the rising costs of running a farm.
moreover they 1 438 chapter 16 sodbusters as farmers moved onto the great plains in nebraska and other states on the agrarian frontier their first task was to cut through the sod that covered the land to get to soil in which they could plant crops.
the sod itself was so thick and solid that some settlers including the summers family of west custer county nebraska pictured here in 1888 used it to build their houses.
the removal of the sod made cultivation of the plains possible it also removed the soils protective covering and contributed to the great dust storms that plagued the region in times of drought.
nebraska state historical society had made many of their calculations on the basis of eastern agricultural experiences that were inappropriate for the region west of the mississippi.
a unit of 160 acres was too small for the grazing and grain farming of much of the great plains.
although more than 400 000 homesteaders stayed on homestead act claims long enough to gain title to their land a much larger number abandoned the region before the end of the required five years unable to cope with the bleak life on the windswept plains and the economic realities that were making it difficult for families without considerable resources to thrive.
not for the last time beleaguered westerners looked to the federal government for solutions to their problems.
in response to their demands congress increased the homestead allotments.
the timber culture act 1873 permitted homesteaders to receive grants of 160 additional acres if they planted 40 acres of trees on them.
the desert land act 1877 provided that claimants could buy 640 acres at 1 25 an acre provided they irrigated part of their holdings within three years.
the timber and stone act 1878 which presumably applied to nonarable land authorized sales at 2 50 an acre.
these laws ultimately made it possible for individuals to acquire as much as 1 280 acres of land at little cost.
some enterprising settlers got much more.
fraud ran rampant in the administration of the acts.
lumber mining and cattle companies by employing dummy registrants and using other illegal devices seized millions of acres of the public domain.
political organization followed on the heels of settlement.
after the admission of kansas as a state in 1861 the remaining government assistance territories of washington new mexico utah and nebraska were divided into smaller units that would presumably be easier to organize.
by the close of the 1860s territorial governments were in operation in the new provinces of nevada colorado dakota arizona idaho montana and wyoming.
statehood soon followed.
nevada became a state in 1864 nebraska in 1867 and colorado in 1876.
in 1889 north and south dakota montana and washington won admission wyoming and idaho entered the next year.
congress denied utah statehood until its mormon leaders convinced the government in 1896 that polygamy the practice of a man having more than one wife at a time had been abandoned.
at the turn of the century only three territories remained outside the union.
arizona and new mexico were excluded because their scanty white populations remained minorities in the territories because their politics were predominantly democratic in a republican era and because they were unwilling to accept admission as a single state.
oklahoma formerly indian territory was opened to white settlement and granted territorial status in 1889 1890.
the changing western economy among the many effects of the new wave of anglo american settlement in the far west was a transformation of the regions economy.
the new american settlers tied the west firmly to the conquest of the far west 439 the growing industrial economy of the east and of much of the rest of the world.
mining cutting and selling timber ranching commercial farming and many other economic activities relied on the east for markets and for capital.
some of the most powerful economic institutions in the west were great eastern corporations that controlled mines ranches and farms.
labor in the west as commercial activity increased many farmers ranchers and miners found it necessary to recruit a paid labor force not an easy task for those far away from major population centers and unable or unwilling to hire indian workers.
the labor shortage of the region led to higher wages for workers than were typical in most areas of the east.
but working conditions were often arduous and job security was almost nonexistent.
once a railroad was built a crop harvested a herd sent to market a mine played out hundreds and even thousands of workers could find themselves suddenly unemployed.
competition from chinese immigrants whom employers could usually hire for considerably lower wages than they had to pay whites also forced some anglo americans out of work.
communities of the jobless gathered in the regions few cities in mining camps and elsewhere other unemployed people moved restlessly from place to place in search of work.
those who owned no land were highly mobile mostly male and seldom married.
indeed the west had the highest percentage of single adults 10 percent of any region in the country one reason why single women found working in dance halls and as prostitutes among the most readily available forms of employment.
despite the enormous geographic mobility in western society actual social mobility was limited.
many limited social a f mobility americans thought of the west as a land of limitless opportunity but as in the rest of the country advancement was easiest and most rapid for those who were economically advantaged to begin with.
studies of western communities suggest that social mobility in most of them was no greater than it was in the east.
and the distribution of wealth in the region was little different from that in the older states as well.
even more than in many parts of the east the western working class was highly multiracial.
english speaking whites worked alongside african americans and immigrants from southern and eastern europe as they did in the east.
even more they worked with chinese filipinos mexicans and indians.
but the workforce was highly stratified along racial lines.
in almost every area of the western economy white workers whatever their ethnicity occupied the upper tiers of employment management and skilled labor.
the lower tiers people who did unskilled and often arduous work in the mines on the railroads or in agriculture consisted overwhelmingly of nonwhites.
reinforcing this dual labor system was a set of racial assumptions developed and sustained largely by white employers.
chinese mexicans and filipinos they argued were genetically racially stratified working class or culturally suited to manual labor.
because they were smaller than many anglo americans those who promoted these racist stereotypes argued they could work better in deep mines than whites.
because they were accustomed to heat they could withstand arduous work in the fields better than whites.
because they were unambitious and unconcerned about material comfort they would accept low wages and live in conditions that white people would not tolerate.
these racial myths served the interests of employers above all but white workers tended to embrace them too.
that was in part because the myths supported a system that reserved whatever mobility there was largely for whites.
an irish common laborer might hope in the course of a lifetime to move several rungs up the occupational ladder.
a chinese or mexican worker in the same job had no realistic prospects of doing the same.
the arrival of the miners life cycle of a mining boom one of the great economic boons in the far west after the gold rush was a result of the mineral rich region of mountains and plateaus where settlers hoped to make quick fortunes by finding precious metals.
the life span of this mining boom was relatively brief.
it began in earnest around 1860 and flourished until the 1890s.
then it abruptly declined.
news of a gold or silver strike in an area usually began with a stampede reminiscent of the california gold rush of 1849.
individual prospectors would exploit the first shallow deposits of ore largely by hand with pan and placer mining.
after these surface deposits dwindled corpora tions moved in to engage in lode or quartz mining which dug deeper beneath the surface.
then as those deposits dwindled commercial mining either disappeared or continued on a restricted basis and ranchers and farmers moved in and established a more permanent economy.
the first great mineral strikes since the california gold rush occurred just before the civil war.
in 1858 gold was discovered in the pikes peak district of what would soon be the territory of colorado the following year 50 000 prospectors stormed in from california the mississippi valley and the east.
denver and other mining camps blossomed into cities overnight.
almost as rapidly as it had developed the boom ended.
after the mining frenzy died down corporations notably the guggenheim interests revived some of the profits of the gold boom and the discovery of silver near leadville supplied a ew source of mineral wealth.
while the colorado rush of 1859 was still in progress news of another strike drew miners to nevada.
gold lodeck had een fund in e washoe district but the most valuable ore in the great comstock ode first discovered in 1858 by henry comstock and other eins was silver.

in a remote esert without railroad transportation the territory produced no upplies of its own and everything from food and machinery to 440 chapter 16 colorado boomtown the colorado silver boom began in 1879 bringing many people into the newly admitted state in search of opportunity.
by the 1890s with dwindling silver deposits many recently wealthy communities went bust.
time life pictures getty images whiskey had to be shipped from california to virginia city carson city and other gold rush settlements and towns.
when the first placer or surface deposits ran out california and eastern capitalists bought the claims of the pioneer prospectors and began to use the more difficult process of quartz mining which enabled them to retrieve silver from deeper veins.
for a few years these outside owners reaped tremendous profits from 1860 to 1880 the nevada lodes yielded bullion worth 306 million.
after that the mines quickly played out.
the next important mineral discoveries came in 1874 when gold was found in the black hills of southwestern dakota territory.
prospectors swarmed into the area until surface resources faded and corporations took over.
one enormous company the homestake came to dominate the fields.
in the long run other less glamorous natural resources proved more important to the development of the west than gold and silver.
the great anaconda copper mine launched by william clark in 1881 marked the beginning of an industry that would remain important to montana for many decades.
in other areas mining operations had significant success with lead tin quartz and zinc.

the map also shows the areas in which ghost towns mining communities abandoned by their residents once production ceased proliferated.
what impact did mining have on the population of the west.
the conquest of the far west 441 gender imbalance the conditions of mine life in the boom period the presence of precious minerals the vagueness of claim boundaries the cargoes of gold being shipped out attracted outlaws and bad men operating as individuals or gangs.
when the situation became intolerable in a community those members interested in order began enforcing their own laws through vigilante committees an unofficial system of social control used earlier in california.
vigilantes were unconstrained by the legal system.
some vigilantes continued to operate as private law enforcers after the creation of regular governments.
men greatly outnumbered women in the mining towns and younger men in particular had difficulty finding female companions of comparable age.
those women who did gravitate to the new communities often came with their husbands and their activities were generally although not always confined to the same kinds of domestic tasks that eastern women performed.
single women or women whose husbands were earning no money did choose or find it necessary to work for wages at times as cooks laundresses and tavernkeepers.
and in the sexually imbalanced mining communities there was always a ready market for prostitutes.
the thousands of people who flocked to the mining towns in search of quick wealth and who failed to find it often remained as wage laborers in corporate mines after the boom period.
working conditions were almost uniformly terrible.
the corporate mines were deep and extremely hot with temperatures often exceeding 100 degrees fahrenheit.
some workers died of heatstroke or of pneumonia a result of experiencing sudden changes of temperature when emerging from the mines.
poor ventilation meant large accumulations of poisonous carbon dioxide which caused dizziness nausea and headaches.
lethal dusts stayed in the stagnant air to be inhaled over and over by the miners many of whom developed silicosis a disabling disease of the lungs as a result.
there were frequent explosions cave ins and fires and there were many accidents with the heavy machinery the workers used to bore into the earth.
in the 1870s before technological advances eliminated some of the dangers one worker in every thirty was disabled in the mines and one in every eighty was killed.
that rate fell later in the nineteenth century but mining remained one of the most dangerous and arduous working environments in the united states.
the cattle kingdom another important element of the changing economy of the far west was cattle ranching.
the open range the vast grasslands of the public domain provided a huge area on the great plains where cattle raisers could graze their herds free of charge and unrestricted by the boundaries of private farms.
the western cattle industry was mexican and texan by ancestry.
long before citizens of the united states invaded the southwest mexican ranchers had devel mexican oped the techniques and equipment that rig1ns cattlemen and cowboys of the great plains later employed branding a device known in all frontier areas where stock was common roundups roping and the gear of the herders their lariats saddles leather chaps and spurs.
americans in texas adopted these methods and carried them to the northernmost ranges of the cattle kingdom.
texas also had the largest herds of cattle in the country the animals were descended from imported spanish stock wiry hardy longhorns and allowed to run wild or semiwild.
from texas too came small muscular broncos or mustangs well suited to the requirements of cattle country.
at the end of the civil war an estimated 5 million cattle roamed the texas ranges.
early in 1866 some texas cattle ranchers began driving their combined herds as many as 260 000 cattle north to sedalia missouri on the missouri pacific railroad.
traveling over rough country and beset by outlaws indians and property conscious farmers the caravan suffered heavy losses.
only a fraction of the animals arrived the cattle kingdom c 1866 1887 cattle ranching and cattle drives are among the most romanticized features of the nineteenth century west.
but they were also hardheaded businesses made possible by the growing eastern market for beef and the availability of inexpensive transportation to take cattle to urban markets.
what brought an end to the open range.
442 chapter 16 in sedalia.
but the drive proved that cattle could be driven to distant markets and pastured along the trail and that they would even gain weight during the journey.
this earliest of the long drives in other words established the first tentative link between the isolated cattle breeders of south and west texas and the booming urban markets of the east.
the drive laid the groundwork for the explosion of the cattle kingdom market facilities grew up at abilene kansas on the kansas pacific railroad and for years the town reigned as the railhead chisholm t ie catt e kingdom.
between 1867 and trail 1871 cattlemen drove nearly 1 5 million head up the chisholm trail to abilene a town that when filled with rampaging cowboys at the end of a drive rivaled the mining towns in rowdiness.
but by the mid 1870s agricultural development in western kansas was eating away at the open range land at the same time that the supply of animals was increasing.
cattlemen therefore had to develop other trails and other market outlets farther west dodge city and wichita in kansas ogallala and sidney in nebraska cheyenne and laramie in wyoming miles city and glendive in montana.
a long drive was a spectacular sight and not surprisingly it became the most romanticized and mythologized aspect of life in the west.
it began with the spring or calf roundup.
the cattlemen rounded up stock from the open range herds containing the stock of many different owners with only their brands to distinguish them from one another.
the combined herds usually numbering from 2 000 to 5 000 head moved out.
cowboys representing each of the major ranchers accompanied them.
most of the cowboys in the early years were veterans of the confederate army.
the next largest group consisted of african americans more than half a million of them.
they were more numerous than white northerners or mexicans and other foreigners.
they were usually assigned such jobs as wrangler herdsman or cook.
every cattleman had to have a permanent base from which to operate and so the ranch emerged.
a ranch consisted of the employer s dwelling quarters for employees and a tract of grazing land.
in the early years of the cattle kingdom most ranches were small since so much of the grazing occurred in the vast open areas that cattlemen shared.
but as farmers and sheep breeders began to compete for the open plains ranches became larger and more clearly defined cattlemen gradually had to learn to raise their stock on their own fenced land.
farmers fnesters from the east threw fences around their claims blocking trails and breaking up the open range.
a series of range wars between sheepmen and cattlemen between ranchers and farmers erupted out of the tensions between these competing groups resulting in significant loss of life and extensive property damage.
accounts of the lofty profits to be made in the cattle business it was said that an investment of 5 000 would return 45 000 in four years tempted eastern english and scottish capital to the plains.
increasingly the structure of the cattle economy became corporate in one year twenty corporations with a combined capital of 12 million were chartered in wyoming.
the inevitable result of this frenzied speculative expansion was that the ranges already diminished by the railroads and the farmers became overstocked.
there was not enough grass to support the crowding herds or sustain the long drives.
finally nature intervened.
two severe winters in 1885 1886 and 1886 1887 with a searing summer between them stung and scorched the plains.
hundreds of thousands of cattle died streams and grass dried up princely ranches and costly investments disappeared in a season.
the open range industry never recovered the long drive disappeared for good.
railroads displaced the trail as the route to cowboys on a long drive the long drive not only provided cattle for the eastern market it also created communities of men who spent much of their lives on the trail working for ranchers tending cattle.
these cowboys were mostly young unmarried men including many african americans.
most of them later settled down with families but many agreed with the former cowboy charles goodknight who wrote years later all in all my years on the trail were the happiest i ever lived.
there were many hardships and dangers but when all went well there was no other life so pleasant.
most of the time we were solitary adventurers in a great land.
and we were free and full of the zest of darers.

north wind picture archives alamy the conquest of the far west 443 market for livestock.
but the established cattle ranches with fenced in grazing land and stocks of hay for winter feed survived grew and prospered eventually producing more beef than ever.
although the cattle industry was overwhelmingly male in its early years there were always a few women involved in ranching and driving.
as ranching became more sedentary the presence of women greatly increased.
by 1890 more than 250 000 women owned ranches or farms in the western states many of them as proxies for their husbands or fathers but some in their own right.
indeed the region provided women with many opportunities that were closed to them in the east including the opportunity to participate in politics.
wyoming was the first state in the union to guarantee woman suffrage and throughout the west women established themselves as an important political presence and occasionally as significant officeholders.
women won the vote earlier in the west than they did in the rest of the nation although for different reasons in different places.
in utah the mormons granted women suffrage in an effort to stave off criticism of their practice of polygamy.
in some places women won suffrage before political k gains for statehood to swell the electorate to the women number required by congress.
in others women won the vote by persuading men that they would help bring a moral voice into the politics of the region and strengthen the sense of community in the west.
most men and many women believed that women were more generous and virtuous than men.
they might bring these special qualities to the raw societies of the region.
many of the same arguments were ultimately used to justify suffrage in the east as well.
the romance of the west the supposedly unsettled west had always occupied a special place in the anglo american imagination beginning in the seventeenth century when the first white settlers along the atlantic coast began to look to the interior.
they were searching for new opportunities or for refuge from the civilized world.
the vast regions of this last frontier had a particularly strong romantic appeal to many people.
the western landscape the allure of the west was obvious.
the great plains the rocky mountains the basin and plateau region beyond the rockies the sierra nevada and the cascade range all constituted a landscape of brilliant diversity and spectacular grandeur different from anything white americans had encountered before.
it was little wonder that newcomers looked on the west with reverence and wonder.
painters of the rocky mountain school of whom the best rocky known were albert bierstadt and thomas moran celebrated the new west in grandi ose canvases some of which were taken on tours around eastern and midwestern states and attracted enormous crowds eager for a vision of the great west.
such paintings emphasized the ruggedness and dramatic variety of the region and reflected the same awe toward the land that earlier regional painters had displayed toward the hudson river valley and other areas.
the interest in paintings of the west helped inspire a growing wave of tourism.
increasingly in the 1880s and 1890s as railroads extended farther into the region and as the indian wars subsided resort hotels began to spring up near some of the most spectacular landscapes in the region and easterners began to come for visits of several weeks or more combining residence in a comfortable hotel with hikes and excursions into the wilderness the cowboy culture even more appealing than the landscape was the rugged free spirited lifestyle that many americans associated with myth of the r e west a lifestyle that supposedly stood cowboy in sharp contrast to the increasingly stable and ordered world of the east.
many nineteenth century americans came to romanticize especially the figure of the cowboy and transformed him remarkably quickly from the low paid worker he actually was into a powerful and enduring figure of myth.
admiring americans seldom thought about the many dis mal aspects of the cowboy s life the tedium the loneliness the physical discomforts the low pay the few opportunities for advancement.
instead in popular western novels such as owen wisters the virginian 1902 they romanticized his freedom from traditional social constraints his affinity with nature even his supposed propensity for violence.
wisters character was a semi educated man whose natural decency courage and compassion made him a powerful symbol of the supposed virtues of the frontier.
but the virginian was only the most famous example of a type of literature that soon swept throughout the united states novels and stories about the west and about the lives of cowboys in particular that appeared in boys magazines pulp novels theater and even serious literature.
the enormous popularity of traveling wild west shows spread the cult of the cowboy still further.
see patterns of popular culture p.
the cowboy had become perhaps the most widely admired popular hero in america and a powerful and enduring symbol of the important american ideal of the natural man that symbol has survived into the twenty first century in popular literature in song in film and on television.
the idea of the frontier yet it was not simply the character of the new west that made it so important to the nations imagination.
it was also that many americans considered it the last frontier.
since the earliest moments of european settlement in america the image of uncharted territory to the west had always comforted patterns of popular culture the wild west show for many americans the old west has always been a place of myth a source of romantic and exciting stories.
one reason the romantic depiction of the old west persisted was the astonishing popularity of the wild west show in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

he was so familiar a figure that many of his posters contained only his picture with the words he is coming.
this more conventional poster announces a visit of the show to brooklyn.
archive photos getty images this colorful entertainment may have had little connection with the reality of western life but it gave its audiences an image of the west as a place of adventure and romance that has lasted for generations.
the wild west show emerged out of a number of earlier entertainment traditions.
the great showman p t barnum had begun popularizing the wild west as early as the 1840s when he staged a grand buffalo hunt for spectators in new york and such shows continued into the 1870s.
at about the same time western cowboys began staging versions of the modern rodeo when their cattle drives passed near substantial towns.
but the first real wild west show opened in omaha nebraska in 1883 its organizer was william f cody better known as buffalo bill cody had ridden for the pony express fought in the civil war and been a supplier of buffalo meat to workers on the transcontinental railroad hence his celebrated nickname.
but his real fame was a result of his work as a scout for the u s cavalry during the indian wars of the 1870s and as a guide for hunting parties of notable easterners.
cody s wild west shows included mock indian attacks by real indians on stagecoaches and wagon trains portrayals of the pony express and shooting riding and roping exhibitions.
the grand finale a grand hunt on the plains featured buffalo elk deer mountain sheep longhorn cattle and wild horses.
cody s romantic and inspired those who dreamed of starting image of the hfe anew.
now with the last of that unset tied land being slowly absorbed into the nations civilization that image exercised a stronger pull than ever.
mark twain one of the great american writers of the nineteenth century gave voice to this romantic vision of the frontier in a series of brilliant novels and memoirs.
in some of his writings notably roughing it 1872 he wrote of the far west and of his own experience as a newspaper reporter in nevada during the mining boom.
his greatest works however were novels that dealt with life on an earlier frontier the mississippi valley of twains boyhood.
in the adventures of tom sawyer 1876 and the adventures of huckleberry finn 1885 he produced characters who repudiated the constraints of organized society and attempted to escape into a natural world.
for huck finn the vehicle of escape was a small raft on the mississippi but the yearning for freedom reflected a larger vision of the west as the last refuge from the constraints of civilization.
the painter and sculptor frederic remington also captured the romance of the west and its image as an alternative to the frederic settled civilization of the east.
he por remington trayed the cowboy as a natural aristocrat much like wisters virginian living in a natural world in which all the normal supporting structures of civilization were missing.
the romantic quality of his work made remington one of the most beloved and successful art ists of the nineteenth century.
theodore roosevelt who was like both wister and remington a man born and raised in the east traveled to the dakota badlands in the mid 1880s to help himself recover from the sudden death of his young wife.
he had long romanticized the west as a place of physical regeneration a phce where a man could gain strength through rugged activity just as roosevelt a sickly asthmatic boy had hardened himself through adherence to the idea of a strenuous life.
his long sojourn into the badlands in the 1880s cemented his love of the region which continued to the end of his life.
and like annie oakley annie oakley had been a vaudeville and circus entertainer for years before joining buffalo bill s wild west show in 1885.
she was under five feet tall and weighed less than a hundred pounds but her exploits with pistols rifles and horses earned her a reputation as a woman of unusual strength and skill.
bettmann corbis shows inspired dozens of imitators.
always at the center of every show whether cody s or one of his imitators was the effort to evoke the mythic romance of the old west.
buffalo bill was always the star performer in his own productions.
but the show had other celebrities too.
annie oakley became wildly popular for her shooting acts during which she would throw into the air small cards with her picture on them shoot a hole through their middle and toss them into the audience as souvenirs.
native americans were important parts of the wild west shows and hundreds of them participated showing off their martial skills and exotic costumes and customs.
the great sioux leader sitting bull toured with the show for four months in 1885 during which he discussed indian affairs with president cleveland who was a member of one of sitting bull s audiences.
the famous chiricahua apache warrior geronimo who had fought against the united states until 1886 spenta season touring with one of buffalo bill s competitors having previously been paraded around the country as a prisoner by the u s army at their own imagined past and their eagerness to remember a wild west that had never really been what they liked to believe.

the wild west shows died out not long after world war i but many of their features survived in circuses and rodeos and later in films radio and television shows and theme parks.
their popularity was evidence of the nostalgia with which late nineteenth century americans looked wister and remington he made his own fascination with the west a part of the nations popular culture.
in the 1890s he published a four volume history the winning of the west with a romanticized account of the spread of white civilization into the frontier.
these and other books on the west enhanced his own reputation.
they also contributed to the publics fascination with the frontier frederick jackson turner perhaps the clearest and most influential statements of the romantic vision of the frontier came from the historian frederick jackson turner of the university of wisconsin.
in turners 1893 the thirtwthree year old turner de frontier livered a memorable paper to a meeting of thesis the american historical association in chicago titled the significance of the frontier in american history in which he argued that the end of the frontier also marked the end of one of the most important democratizing forces in american life.
see debating the past pp.
in fact turners assessments were both inaccurate and premature.
the west had never been a frontier in the sense he meant the term an empty uncivilized land awaiting settlement.
white migrants who moved into the region had joined or displaced already established societies and cultures.
at the same time considerable unoccupied land remained in the west for many years to come.
but turner did express a growing and generally accurate sense that much of the best farming and grazing land was now taken that in the future it would be more difficult for individuals to acquire valuable land for little or nothing.

robert harding world imagery alamy through most of the nineteenth century the history of the west reflected the romantic and optimistic view of the region as a place of adventure and opportunity where brave and enterprising people endured great hardships to begin building a new civilization the emergence of western history as an important field of scholarship can be traced to frederick jackson turner s the significance of the frontier in american history a paper he delivered at a meeting of the american historical association in 1893 turner stated his thesis simply.
the settlement of the west by white people the existence of an area of free land its continuous recession and the advance of american settlement westward was the central story of american history.
the process of westward expansion transformed a desolate and savage land into a modern civilization.
it also continually renewed american ideas of democracy and individualism.
it shaped not just the west but the nation as a whole the turner thesis shaped american history for a generation and it shaped western american history for even longer.
in the first half of the twentieth century virtually everyone who wrote about the west echoed at least part of turner s argument.

in the great plains 1931 and the great frontier 1952 walter prescott webb similarly emphasized the bravery and ingenuity of white settlers in the southwest.
serious efforts to displace turners thesis as the explanation of western american history did not begin in earnest until after world war ii.
in virgin land 1950 henry nash smith examined many of the same heroic images of the west that turner and his disciples.
he treated those images less as descriptions of reality than as myths.
earl pomeroy challenged turner s notion of the west as a place of individualism innovation and democratic renewal claiming that conservatism inheritance and continuity bulked at least as large.
the western historians of the late 1970s launched an even more emphatic attack on the turner thesis and the idea of the frontier.
new western historians such as richard white patricia nelson limerick william cronon donald worster peggy pascoe and many others challenged the turnerians on a number of points.
turner saw the nineteenth century west as free land awaiting the expansion of anglo american settlement and american democracy.
pioneers settled the region by conquering the obstacles that stood in the way of civilization.
the new western historians rejected the concept of a frontier and emphasized instead the elaborate and highly developed civilizations that already existed in the region.
white english speaking americans they argued did not so much settle the west as conquer it though their conquest was never complete anglo americans in the west continued to share the region not only with the indians and hispanics who preceded them there but also with african americans asians latino americans and others who flowed into the west at the same time they did.
the turnerian west was a place of heroism triumph and above all progress dominated by the feats of brave white men.
more recent historians describe the west as a less triumphant and less masculine place in which bravery and success coexist with oppression greed and failure in which decaying ghost towns bleak indian reservations impoverished barrios and ecologically devastated landscapes are as characteristic of western development as great ranches rich farms and prosperous cities and in which women are as important as men in shaping the societies that emerged.
this aspect of the new western history has attracted particular criticism from those attached to traditional accounts.
the novelist larry mcmurtry for example has denounced the newer scholarship as failure studies.
he has insisted that in rejecting the romantic image westerners had of themselves the revisionists omit an important part of the western experience.
to turner and his disciples the nineteenth century west was a place where rugged individualism flourished and replenished american democracy.
the newer western scholars contend that western individualism is a self serving myth.
western pioneers they argue were never self sufficient but depended on government subsidized railroads for access to markets federal troops for protection from indians and later government funded dams and canals for irrigating their fields and sustaining their towns.
while turner defined the west as a process a process of settlement that came to an end with the closing of the frontier in the late nineteenth century more recent historians see the west as a region whose distinctive history did not end in 1890 but continues into our own time.

what are the main tenets of turner s frontier thesis.
how did the portrayal of the west by the newer western historians differ from the west that turner described.
why did the newer western historians challenge turner s view and why has their depiction of the west in turn provoked such controversy.
psychological consider the west an empty open land it loss was possible to believe that there were constantly revitalizing opportunities in american life.
now there was a vague and ominous sense of opportunities foreclosed of individuals losing their ability to control their own destinies.
the psychological loss was all the greater because of what historian henry nash smith would later call in virgin land 1950 the myth of the garden the once widely shared belief that the west had the potential to be a virtual garden of eden where a person could begin life anew and where the ideals of democracy could be restored.
the dispersal of the tribes having imagined the west as a virgin land awaiting civilization by white people many americans tried to force the region to match their image of it.
that meant above all ensuring that the indian tribes would not remain obstacles to the spread of white society.
white tribal policies the traditional policy of the federal government was to regard the tribes simultaneously as independent nations and as wards of the president and to negotiate treaties with them that were solemnly ratified by the senate.
this limited concept of indian sovereignty had been responsible for the governments attempt before 1860 to erect a permanent frontier between whites and indians to reserve the region west of the bend of the missouri river as permanent indian country.
however treaties or agreements with the tribes seldom survived the pressure of white settlers eager for access to indian lands.
the history of relations between the united states and the native americans was therefore one of nearly endless broken promises.
by the early 1850s the idea of establishing one great enclave in which many tribes could live gave way in the face of 447 448 chapter 16 concentration policy white demands for access to lands in indian territory to a new reservations policy known as concentration in 1851 each tribe was assigned its own defined reservation confirmed by separate treaties treaties often illegitimately negotiated with unauthorized representatives chosen by whites people known sarcastically as treaty chiefs the new arrangement had many benefits for whites and few for the indians.
it divided the tribes from one another and made them easier to control.
it allowed the government to force tribes into scattered locations and to take over the most desirable lands for white settlement.
but it did not survive as the basis of indian policy for long.
in 1867 in the aftermath of a series of bloody conflicts congress established an indian peace commission composed of soldiers and civilians to recommend a new and presumably permanent indian policy.
the commission recommended replacing the concentration policy with a plan to move all the plains indians into two large reservations one in indian chief garfield edward curtis one of the most accomplished photographers of tribal life in the early twentieth century made this portrait of a jicarilla apache chief in 1904.
by then the jicarilla were living in a reservation in northern new mexico and white officials had assigned all members of the tribe spanish or english names.
the man depicted here the head chief had chosen the name garfield himself.
stapleton collection corbis poorly administered reservations territory oklahoma the other in the dakotas.
at a series of meetings with the tribes government agents cajoled bribed and tricked representatives of the arapaho cheyenne sioux and other tribes into agreeing to treaties establishing the new reservations.
this solution worked little better than previous ones.
white management of indian matters was entrusted to the bureau of indian affairs a branch of the department of the interior responsible for distributing land making payments and supervising the shipment of supplies.
its record was appalling.
the bureaus agents in the west products of political patronage were often men of extraordinary incompetence and dishonesty.
but even the most honest and diligent agents were generally ill prepared for their jobs had no understanding of tribal ways and had little chance of success.
worsening the fate of the tribes was the white anglos relentless slaughtering of the buffalo herds that supported the tribes way of life.
even in the 1850s whites had been killing buffalo at a rapid rate to provide food and supplies for the large bands of migrants traveling to the gold rush in california.
after the civil war the white demand for buffalo hides became a national phenomenon partly for economic reasons and partly as a fad.
everyone east of the missouri seemed to want a buffalo robe from the romantic west and there was a strong demand for buffalo leather which was used to make machine belts in eastern factories.
gangs of professional hunters swarmed over the plains to shoot the huge animals.
railroad companies hired riflemen such as buffalo bill cody and arranged shooting expeditions to kill large numbers of buffalo hoping to thin the herds which were obstructions to railroad traffic.
some indian tribes notably the blackfeet also began killing large numbers of buffalo to sell in the booming new market.
it was not just the hunting that threatened the buffalo.
the ecological changes accompanying white settlement the reduction and in some areas virtual decimation of disappearance of the open piains the buffalo also decimated the buffalo population.
the southern herd was virtually exterminated by 1875 and within a few years the smaller northern herd had met the same fate.
in 1865 there had been at least 15 million buffalo a decade later fewer than a thousand of the great beasts survived.
the army and the agents of the bureau of indian affairs condoned and even encouraged the killing.
by destroying the buffalo herds whites were destroying the indians source of food and supplies and their ability to resist the white advance.
they were also contributing to a climate in which indian warriors felt the need to fight to pre serve their way of life.
the conquest of the far west 449 the indian wars there was almost incessant fighting between whites and indians from the 1850s to the 1880s as indians struggled against the growing threats to their civilizations.
indian warriors usually traveling in raiding parties of thirty to forty men indian attacked wagon trains stagecoaches and resistance isolated ranches often in retaliation for earlier attacks.
as the u s army became more deeply involved in the fighting the tribes began to focus more of their attacks on white soldiers.
at times this small scale fighting escalated into something close to a war.
during the civil war the eastern sioux in minnesota cramped on an inadequate reservation and exploited by corrupt white agents suddenly rebelled against the restrictions imposed on them by the government s policies.
led by little crow they killed more than 700 whites before being subdued by a force of regulars and militiamen.
thirty eight of the indians were hanged and the tribe was exiled to the dakotas.
at the same time fighting flared up in eastern colorado where the arapaho and cheyenne were coming into conflict with white miners settling in the region.
bands of indians attacked stagecoach lines and settlements in an effort to regain lost territory.
in response whites called up a large territorial sand creek militia.
the governor urged all friendly massacre indians to congregate at army posts for protection before the army began its campaign.
one arapaho and cheyenne band under chief black kettle apparently in response to the invitation camped near fort lyon on sand creek in november 1864.
some members of the party were warriors but black kettle believed he was under official protection and exhibited no hostile intention.
nevertheless colonel j m chivington apparently encouraged by the army commander of the district led a volunteer militia force largely consisting of unemployed miners many of whom were apparently drunk to the unsuspecting camp and massacred 133 people 105 of them women and children.
black kettle escaped the sand creek massacre.
four years later in 1868 he and his cheyennes some of whom were now at war with the whites were caught on the washita river near the texas border by colonel george a custer.
white troops killed the chief and slaughtered his people.
at the end of the civil war white troops stepped up their wars against the western indians on several fronts.
the most serious and sustained conflict was in montana where the army was attempting to build a road to connect fort laramie wyoming to the new mining centers.
the western sioux resented this intrusion into the heart of their buffalo range.
led by one of their great chiefs red cloud they so harried the soldiers and the construction party among other things burning the forts that were supposed to guard the route that the road could not be used.
it was not only the u s army that threatened the tribes.
it was also unofficial violence by white vigilantes who engaged in what became known as indian hunting in california indian part cu ar tracking down and killing hunting indians became for some whites a kind of sport.
some who did not engage in killing offered rewards or bounties to those who did these bounty hunters brought back scalps and skulls as proof of their deeds.
sometimes the killing was in response to indian raids on white communities.
but often it was in service to a more basic and terrible purpose.
considerable numbers of whites were committed to the goal of literal elimination of the tribes a goal that rested on the belief in the inhumanity of indians and the impossibility of white societys coexisting with them.
in oregon in 1853 for example whites who had hanged a seven year old held up by buffalo once among the most numerous creatures in north america the buffalo almost became extinct as a result of indiscriminate slaughter by white settlers and travelers who often fired at herds from moving trains simply for the sport of it.

the treaties negotiated in 1867 brought a temporary lull to many of the conflicts.
but new forces soon shattered the peace again.
in the early 1870s more waves of white settlers mostly miners began to penetrate some of the lands in dakota territory supposedly guaranteed to the tribes in 1867.

three army columns set out to round them up and force them back onto the reservation.

at the battle of the little bighorn in southern montana in 1876 the most famous conflict between whites and indians the tribal warriors surprised custer and 264 members of his regiment surrounded them and killed every man.
custer was accused of rashness but he encountered something that no white man would likely have predicted.
the chiefs had gathered as many as 2 500 warriors one of the largest indian armies ever assembled at one time in the united states.
but the indians did not have the political organization or the supplies to keep their troops united.
soon the warriors drifted off in bands to elude pursuit or search for food and the army eventually forced them back to the dakota reservations.
the power of the sioux was soon broken.
the proud leaders crazy horse and sitting bull accepted defeat and the monotony of life on reservations.
both were later killed by reservation police after being tricked or taunted into a last pathetic show of resistance.
chief joseph one of the most dramatic episodes in indian history occurred in idaho in 1877.
the nez perce were a small and relatively peaceful tribe some of whose members had managed to live unmolested in oregon into the 1870s without ever signing a treaty with the united states.
but under pressure from white settlers the government forced them to move into a reservation that another branch of the tribe had accepted by treaty in the 1850s.
with no realistic prospect of resisting the indians began the journey to the reservation but on the way several younger indians drunk and angry killed four white settlers.
the leader of the nez perce chief joseph urged his followers to flee from the american troops.
they scattered in several directions and became part of a remarkable chase.
joseph moved with 200 men and 350 women children and elders in an effort to reach canada and take refuge with the sioux there.
pursued by four columns of american soldiers the indians covered 1 321 miles in seventy five days repelling or evading the army time and again.
they were finally caught just short of the canadian boundary.
some escaped and slipped across the border but joseph and most of his followers weary and discouraged finally gave up.

chapter 16 from one place to another for several years in the process many of them died of disease and malnutrition although joseph himself lived until 1908.
the last indians to maintain organized resistance against the whites were the chiricahua apaches who fought intermittently from the 1860s to the late 1880s.
the two ablest chiefs of this fierce tribe were mangas colorados and cochise.
mangas was murdered during the civil war by white soldiers who tricked him into surrendering and in 1872 cochise agreed to peace in exchange for a reservation that included some of the tribes traditional land.
but cochise died in 1874 and his successor geronimo unwilling to bow to white pressures to assimilate fought on for more than a decade establishing bases in the mountains of arizona and mexico and leading warriors in intermittent raids against white outposts.
with each raid however the number of warring apaches dwindled as some warriors died and others drifted away to the reservation.
by 1886 geronimos plight was hopeless.
his band consisted of only about thirty people including women and children while his white pursuers numbered perhaps ten thousand.
geronimo recognized the odds and surrendered an event that marked the end of formal warfare between indians and whites.
the apache wars were the most violent of all the indian conflicts perhaps because the tribes were now the most desperate.
but it was the whites who committed the most flagrant and vicious atrocities.
in 1871 for example a mob of white miners invaded an apache camp slaughtered more than a hundred indians and captured children whom they sold as slaves to rival tribes.
on other occasions white troops murdered indians who responded to invitations to peace conferences once killing them with poisoned food.
nor did the atrocities end with the conclusion of the apache wars.
another tragic encounter occurred in 1890 as a result of a religious revival among the sioux a revival that itself symbolized the catastrophic effects of the white assaults on indian civilization.
the sioux were by now aware that their culture and their glories were irrevocably fading some were also near starvation because corrupt government agents had reduced their food rations.
as other tribes had done in trying times in the past many of these indians turned to a prophet who led them into a religious revival.
this time the prophet was wovoka a paiute who inspired a spiritual awakening that began in nevada and spread quickly ghost to plains new revival emphasized dance the coming of a messiah but its most con spicuous feature was a mass emotional ghost dance which inspired ecstatic visions.
among these visions were images of a retreat of white people from the plains and a restoration of the great buffalo herds.
white agents on the sioux reservation watched the dances in bewilderment and fear some believed they might be the preliminary to hostilities.
on december 29 1890 the seventh cavalry which had once been custers regiment tried to round up a group of about 350 cold and starving sioux at wounded wounded r knee knee south dakota.
fighting broke out in which about 40 white soldiers and more than 300 of the indians including women and children died.
what precipitated the conflict is a matter of dispute.
but the battle soon turned into a one sided massacre as the white soldiers turned their revolving cannons on the indians and mowed them down in the snow.

he was one of many victims of an 1890 massacre of more than 300 members of the tribe killed by u s army soldiers after the indians had surrendered their weapons.
whether the massacre was planned and deliberate or whether it was a result of confusion and fear remains in dispute.
nsf alamy the conquest of the far west 453 in which the tribes would be isolated from white society congress abolished the practice by which tribes owned reservation lands communally.
some supporters of the new policy believed they were acting for the good of the indians whom they considered a vanishing race in need of rescue by white society.
but whatever the motives the policy was designed to force indians to become landowners and farmers to abandon their collective society and culture and become part of white civilization.
the dawes severalty act of 1887 usually known simply as the dawes act provided for the gradual elimination of tribal assimilation wnership of nd and the allotment of tracts to individual owners 160 acres to the head of a family 80 acres to a single adult or orphan 40 acres to each dependent child.
adult owners were given united states citizenship but unlike other citizens they could not gain full title to their property for twenty five years supposedly to prevent them from selling the land to speculators.
the act applied to most of the western tribes.
the pueblo who continued to occupy lands long ago guaranteed them were excluded from its provisions.
in applying the dawes act the bureau of indian affairs relentlessly promoted the idea of assimilation that lay behind it.
not only did they try to move indian families onto their own plots of land they also took some indian children away from their families and sent them to boarding schools run by whites where they believed the young people could be educated to abandon tribal ways.
the bureau also moved to stop indian religious rituals and encouraged the spread of christianity and the creation of christian churches on the reservations.
few indians were prepared for this wrenching change from their traditional collective society to capitalist individualism.
in any case white administration of the program was so corrupt and inept that ultimately the government simply abandoned it.
much of the reservation land therefore was never distributed to individual owners.
congress attempted to speed the transition with the burke act of 1906 but indians continued to resist forced assimilation.
neither then nor later did legislation provide a satisfactory solution to the plight of the indians largely because there was no entirely happy solution to be had.
the interests of the indians were not compatible with those of the expanding white civilization.
whites successfully settled the american west only at the expense of the regions indigenous peoples.
the rise and decline of the western farmer the arrival of the miners the empire building of the cattle ranchers the dispersal of the indian tribes all served as a prelude to the decisive phase of white settlement of the far west.
even before the civil war farmers had begun moving into the plains region challenging the dominance of the ranchers and the indians and occasionally coming into conflict with both.
by the 1870s what was once a trickle had become a deluge.
farmers poured into the plains and beyond enclosed land that had once been hunting territory for indians and grazing territory for cattle and established a new agricultural region.
for a time in the late 1870s and early 1880s the new western farmers flourished enjoying the fruits of an agricultural economic boom comparable in many ways to the booms that eastern industry periodically enjoyed.
beginning in the mid 1880s however the boom turned to bust.
american agriculture not only in the new west but in the older midwest and the south as well was producing more than it ever had too much for the market to absorb.
for that and other reasons prices for agricultural goods declined.
both economically and psychologically the agricultural economy began a long steady decline.
farming on the plains many factors combined to produce this surge of western settlement but the most important was the railroads.
before the civil war the great plains had been accessible only through a difficult journey by wagon.
but beginning in the 1860s a great new network of railroad lines developed spearheaded by the transcontinental routes congress had authorized and subsidized in 1862.
they made huge new areas of settlement accessible.
the completion of the transcontinental line was a dramatic and monumental achievement.
the two lines joined at promontory point in northern utah in the spring of 1869.
but while this first transcontinental line captured the public imagination the construction of subsidiary lines in the following years proved of greater importance to the west.
state governments encouraged railroad development by offering financial aid favorable loans and more than 50 million acres of land on top of the 130 million acres the federal government had already provided.
although operated by private corporations the railroads were essentially public projects.
it was not only by making access to the great plains easier that the railroads helped spur agricultural settlement there.
the railroad companies themselves actively promoted settlement both to provide themselves with customers for their services and to increase the value of their vast landholdings.
in addition the companies set rates so low for settlers that almost anyone could afford the trip west.
and they sold much of their land at very low prices and provided liberal credit to prospec tive settlers.
contributing further to the great surge of white agricultural expansion was a temporary change in the climate of the great plains.
for several years in succession beginning in the 1870s rainfall in the plains states was well above average.
white americans now rejected the old idea that the region was the great american desert.
some even claimed that cultivation of the plains itself actually encouraged rainfall.
even under the most favorable conditions farming on the plains presented special problems.
first was the challenge of fencing.
farmers had to enclose their land if for no other reason than to protect it from the herds of the open range cattlemen.
but traditional wood or stone fences were too expensive and were 454 chapter 16 carlisle indian school government authorities and private philanthropists tried in many ways to encourage indians to assimilate into mainstream white american society after the end of the indian wars of the late nineteenth century.
the carlisle indian industrial school founded by captain richard henry pratt in 1879 was the first federally funded native american off reservation boarding school.
educators there believed that native americans were the equals of people from european backgrounds.
the curriculum was designed to help native americans gain the skills necessary to advance in mainstream american society.
the library of congress lc usz62 55422 barbed wire ineffective as barriers to cattle.
in 1873 however two illinois farmers joseph h glidden and i l ellwood solved this problem by developing and marketing barbed wire which became standard equipment on the plains and revolutionized fencing practices all over the country.
the second problem was water.
much of the land west of the mississippi was considerably more arid than the lands to the east.
some of it was literally desert.
as a result the growth of the west depended heavily on irrigation providing water from sources other than rainfall.
water was diverted from rivers and streams and into farmlands throughout the west in california and in the southwest more than anywhere else.
in other areas farmers drilled wells or found other methods of channeling water onto their lands.
the search for water and the resulting battles over control of water between different landowners and even between different states became a central and enduring characteristic of western life.
in the plains states the problems of water created an epic disaster.
after 1887 a series of dry seasons began and lands that had been fertile now returned to semidesert.
some farmers dealt with the problem by using deep wells pumped by steel windmills by turn ing to what was called dryland farming a system of tillage drought hard times for farmers designed to conserve moisture in the soil by covering it with a dust blanket or by planting drought resistant crops.
in many areas of the plains however only large scale irrigation could save the endangered farms.
but irrigation projects of the necessary magnitude required government assistance and neither the state nor federal governments were prepared to fund the projects.
most of the people who moved into the region had previously been farmers in the midwest the east or europe.
in the booming years of the early 1880s with land values rising the new farmers had no problem obtaining extensive and easy credit and had every reason to believe they would soon be able to retire their debts.
but the arid years of the late 1880s during which crop prices were falling while production was becoming more expensive changed that prospect.
tens of thousands of farmers could not pay their debts and were forced to abandon their farms.
there was in effect a reverse migration white settlers moved back east sometimes turning once flourishing communities into desolate ghost towns.
those who remained continued to suffer from falling prices for example wheat which had sold for 1 60 a bushel at the end of the civil war dropped to 49 cents in the 1890s and persistent indebtedness.
4 the conquest of the far west 455 commercial agriculture american farming by the late nineteenth century no longer bore much relation to the comforting image many americans continued to cherish.
the sturdy independent farmer of popular myth was being replaced by the commercial farmer attempting to do in the agricultural economy what industrialists were doing in the manufacturing economy.
commercial farmers were not self sufficient and made no effort to become so.
they specialized in cash crops which they sold in national or world markets.
they did not make their own household supplies or grow their own food but bought them instead at town or village stores.
this kind of farming when it was successful raised the farmers living standards.
but it also made them dependent on bankers and interest rates railroads and freight rates national and european markets world supply and demand.
and unlike the capitalists of the industrial order they could not regulate their production or influence the prices of what they sold.
between 1865 and 1900 agriculture became an international business.
farm output increased dramatically not only in the united states but also in brazil argentina canada australia new zealand russia and elsewhere.
at the same time modern forms of communication and transportation the telephone telegraph steam navigation railroads were creating new markets around the world for agricultural goods.
american commercial farmers constantly opening new lands produced much more than the domestic market could absorb they relied on the world market to absorb their surplus but in that market they faced major competition.
cotton farmers depended on export sales for 70 percent of their annual income wheat farmers for 30 to 40 percent but the volatility of the international market put them at great risk.
beginning in the 1880s worldwide overproduction led to a drop in prices for most agricultural goods and hence to great economic distress for many of the more than 6 million american farm families.
by the 1890s 27 percent of the farms in the country were mortgaged by 1910 33 188tt 25 p f all farms had been operated by tenants by 1910 the proportion had grown to 37 percent.
commercial farming made some people fabulously wealthy.
but the farm economy as a whole was suffering a significant decline relative to the rest of the nation.
the farmers grievances american farmers were painfully aware that something was wrong.
but few yet understood the implications of national and world overproduction.
instead they concentrated their attention and anger on immediate comprehensible and no less real problems inequitable freight rates high interest charges and an inadequate currency.
the farmers first and most burning grievance was against the railroads.
in many cases the railroads charged higher freight rates for farm goods than for other goods and higher rates in the south and west than in the northeast.
railroads also controlled elevator and warehouse facilities in buying centers and charged arbitrary storage rates.
farmers also resented the institutions controlling credit banks loan companies insurance corporations.
since sources of credit in the west and south were few farmers had to take loans on whatever terms they could get often at interest rates ranging from 10 to 25 percent.
many farmers had to pay these loans back in years when prices were dropping and currency was becoming scarce.
increasing the volume of currency eventually became an important agrarian demand.
a third grievance concerned prices both the prices farmers received for their products and the prices they paid for goods.
farmers sold their products in a competitive world market over which they had no control and of which they had no advanced knowledge.
a farmer could plant a large crop at a moment when prices were high and find that by harvesttime the price had declined.
farmers fortunes rose and fell in response to unpredictable forces.
but many farmers became convinced often with valid reason that middlemen speculators bankers regional and local agents were combining to fix prices so as to benefit themselves at the growers expense.
many farmers also came to believe again not entirely without reason that manufacturers in the east were conspiring to keep the prices of farm goods low and the prices of industrial goods high.
although farmers sold their crops in a competitive world market they bought manufactured goods in a domestic market protected by tariffs and dominated by trusts and corporations.
the agrarian malaise these economic difficulties produced a series of social and cultural resentments.
farm families in some parts of the coun try particularly in the prairie and plains regions isolation.
c where large farms were scattered over vast areas were virtually cut off from the outside world and human companionship.
during the winter months and spells of bad weather the loneliness and boredom could become nearly unbearable.
many farmers lacked access to adequate education for their children to proper medical facilities to recreational or cultural activities to virtually anything that might give them a sense of being members of a community.
older farmers felt the sting of watching their children leave the farm for the city.
they felt the humiliation of being ridiculed as hayseeds by the new urban culture that was coming to dominate american life.
the result of this sense of isolation and obsolescence was a growing malaise among many farmers a discontent that would help create a great national political movement in the 1890s.
it found reflection too in the literature that emerged from rural america.
late nineteenth century writers often romanticized the rugged life of the cowboy and the western miner.
for the farmer however the image was often different.
hamlin garland for example reflected the growing disillusionment in a series of novels and short stories.
in the past garland wrote in the introduction to his novel 456 chapter 16 fason edwards 1891 the agrarian frontier had seemed to be the golden west the land of wealth and freedom and happiness.
all of the associations called up by the spoken word the west were fabulous mythic hopeful now however the bright promise had faded.
the trials of rural life were crushing the human spirit.
so this is the reality of the looking back to many americans in the late nineteenth century the west seemed a place utterly unlike the rest of the united states an untamed frontier in which hardy pioneers were creating a new society in which sturdy individuals still had a chance to be heroes.
this image was a stark and deliberate contrast to the reality of the urbanizing industrializing east in which the role of the individual was being transformed by the rise of industrial life and its institutions.
the reality of the west in these years however was very different from the image.
white americans were moving into the vast regions west of the mississippi at a remarkable rate in the years after the civil war and many of them it is true were settling in lands far from any civilization they had ever known.
but the west was not an empty place in these years.
it contained a large population of indians with whom the white settlers sometimes lived uneasily and sometimes battled but almost always in the end pushed aside and with help from the federal government relocated onto lands whites did not want.

my god once sturdy yeoman farmers had viewed themselves as the backbone of american life.
now they were becoming painfully aware that their position was declining in relation to the rising urban industrial society to the east.
moving in from the south in search of land and freedom.
the west was not a barren frontier but a place of many cultures.
the west was also closely and increasingly tied to the emerging capitalist industrial economy of the east.
the miners who flooded into california colorado nevada the dakotas and elsewhere were responding to the demand in the east for gold and silver but even more for such utilitarian minerals as iron ore copper lead zinc and quartz which had industrial uses.
cattle and sheep ranchers produced meat wool and leather for eastern consumers and manufacturers.
farmers grew crops for sale in national and international commodities markets.
the west certainly looked different from the east and its people lived their lives in surroundings very different from those of eastern cities.
but the growth of the west was very much a part of the growth of the rest of the nation.
and the culture of the west despite the romantic images of pioneering individuals embraced by easterners and westerners alike was at its heart as much a culture of economic growth and capitalist ambition as was the culture of the rest of the nation.

what england had accomplished in a hundred years the united states had achieved in half the time so wrote the historians charles and mary beard in the 1920s expressing the amazement many americans felt when they considered the remarkable expansion of the nation s industrial economy in the late nineteenth century.
americas rise to industrial supremacy was not as sudden as such observers suggested.
the nation had been transformation building a manufacturing economy since early in the nineteenth century and industry of national was we established before the civil war.
but the developments of the last three decades of the nineteenth century overshadowed everything that had come earlier.
those years witnessed nothing less than the transformation of the national economy.
many factors contributed to this transformation new technologies new forms of corporate organization and great waves of immigration that provided a large cheap labor force for the ever larger factory complexes the nation was creating.
industrialization changed the physical landscape of the nation contributing to the rapid growth of cities and helping stimulate the spread of railroads across the united states industrialization also changed america s relationship to the rest of the world drawing the united states more and more into global trade and finance and into a search for overseas markets and foreign suppliers of needed materials.
and industrialization altered the nation s social landscape as well.
the remarkable growth of the economy did much to increase the wealth and improve the lives of many americans.
but the benefits were far from universal.
industrial titans and a growing middle class were enjoying a prosperity without precedent in the nation s history.
but workers farmers and others were experiencing a disorienting and often painful transition that slowly edged the united states toward a great economic and political crisis.
sources of industrial growth many factors contributed to the growth of american industry abundant raw materials a large and growing labor supply a surge in technological innovation the emergence of a talented ambitious and often ruthless group of entrepreneurs a federal government eager to assist the growth of business and a great and expanding domestic market for the products of manufacturing.
industrial technologies perhaps the most important technological development in a nation whose economy rested so heavily on railroads and urban construction was the revolutionizing of iron and steel production in the late nineteenth century.
iron production had developed slowly in the united states through most of the nineteenth century steel production had developed hardly at all by the end of the civil war.
in the 1870s and 1880s however iron production soared as railroads added 40 000 new miles of track and steel production made great strides toward what would soon be its dominance in the metals industry.
the story of the rise of steel is like so many other stories of economic development a story of technological discovery.
an englishman henry bessemer and an american william kelly had developed almost simultaneously a process for converting iron into the much more durable and n s versatile steel.
the process which took bessemers name consisted of blowing produchon air through molten iron to burn out the impurities.
the bessemer process also techniques relied on the discovery by the british metallurgist robert mushet that ingredi ents could be added to the iron during conversion to transform it into steel.
in 1868 the new jersey ironmaster abram s hewitt introduced from europe another method of making steel the open hearth process which ultimately largely supplanted the bessemer process.
chapter 17 these techniques made possible the production of steel in great quantities and large dimensions for use in the manufacture of locomotives steel rails and girders for the construction of tall buildings.
the steel industry emerged first in western pennsylvania and eastern ohio.
that was partly because iron ore could be found there in abundance and because there was already a flourishing iron industry in the region.
it was also because the new forms of steel production created a demand for new kinds of fuel particularly a demand for the anthracite or hard coal that was plentiful in pennsylvania.
later new techniques made it possible to use bituminous soft coal easily mined in western pennsylvania which could then be converted to pittsburgh coke t0 stee furnaces.
as a result pittsburgh quickly became the center of the steel world.
but the industry was growing so fast that new sources of ore were soon necessary.
the upper peninsula of michigan the mesabi range in minnesota and the area around birmingham alabama became important ore producing centers by the end of the century and new centers of steel production grew up near them in cleveland detroit chicago and birmingham among others.
until the civil war iron and steel furnaces were mostly made of stone and usually built against the side of a hill to reduce construction demands.
in the 1870s and after however furnaces were redesigned as cylindrical iron shells lined with brick.
these massive new furnaces were 75 feet tall and higher and could produce more than 500 tons of steel a week.
as the steel industry spread new transportation systems emerged to serve it.
the steel production in the great lakes region was possible only because of the availability of steam freighters that could carry ore on the lakes which contributed to development of new and more powerful steam engines.
shippers also used new steam engines to speed the unloading of ore a task that previously had been performed slowly and laboriously by men and horses.
a close relationship grew up between the emerging steel companies and the railroads.
steel manufacturers provided rails and parts for railroad cars.
the pennsylvania railroad for example literally created the pennsylvania steel company provided it with substantial initial capital and ensured it a market for its products with an immediate contract for steel rails.
the steel industry s need for lubrication for its machines helped create another important new industry in the late rise of the nineteenth century oil.

it was the result of an extraction process developed in the late nineteenth century in the united states by which lubricating oil and fuel oil were separated from crude oil.
in the 1870s designers in france germany and austria inspired by the success of railroad engines had begun to develop an internal combustion engine which used the expanding power of burning gas to drive pistons.
a german nicolaus august otto created a gas powered engine in the mid 1860s a precursor to automobile engines.
but he did not develop a way to untether it from gas lines to be used portably in machines.
one of ottos former employees gottfried daimler later perfected an engine that could be used in automobiles including the famous early car that took daimlers name.
the american automobile industry developed rapidly in the aftermath of these breakthroughs.
charles and frank henry ford duryea built the first gasoline driven motor vehicle in america in 1893.
three years later henry ford produced the first of the famous cars that would eventually bear his name.
by 1910 the industry had become a major force in the economy and the automobile was beginning to reshape american social and cultural life as well as the nations landscape.
in 1895 there were only four automobiles on the american highways.
by 1917 there were nearly 5 million.
the search for a means of human flight was as old as civilization and had been almost entirely futile until the late nineteenth century when engineers scientists and tinkerers in both the united states and europe began to experiment with a wide range of aeronautic devices.
balloonists began to i im r s ffc the flight of the wright brothers orville and wilbur wright became great celebrities after their famous flight at kitty hawk north carolina in de few or 9 nal contributions to the development of aviation technology but their flight with wilbur piloting helped publicize the flying machine that would soon revolutionize travel.
462 chapter 17 consider ways to turn dirigibles into useful vehicles of transportation.
others experimented with kites and gliders to see if they could somehow be used to propel humans through the air.
among those testing gliders were two brothers in ohio wilbur and orville wright who owned a bicycle shop in which they began to construct a glider that could be propelled through the air by an internal combustion engine the same kind of engine that was propelling automobiles.
in 1903 four years after they began their experiments orville made a celebrated test flight near kitty hawk north carolina in which an airplane took off by itself and traveled 120 feet in 12 seconds under its own power before settling back to earth.
by the fall of 1904 the wright brothers had improved the plane to the point where they were able to fly over 23 miles and in the following year they began to take a few passengers with them on their flights.
although the first working airplane was built in the united states aviation technology was slow to gain a foothold in america.
most of the early progress in airplane design occurred in france where there was substantial government funding for research and development.
the u s government created the national advisory committee on aeronautics in 1915 twelve years after the wright brothers flight and american airplanes became a significant presence in europe during world war i.
but the prospects for commercial flight seemed dim until the 1920s when charles lindberghs famous solo flight from new york to paris electrified the nation and the world and helped make aviation a national obsession.
research and development the rapid development of new industrial technologies encouraged business leaders to sponsor their own research to allow them to keep up with the rapid changes in industry.
general electric fearful of technological competition created one of the first corporate laboratories in 1900.
by 1913 bell telephone du pont general electric eastman kodak and corporate about other companies were budget research and itig hundreds of thousands of dollars each development year for research by their own engineers and scientists.
the emergence of corporate research and development laboratories coincided with a decline in government support for research.
that helped corporations to attract skilled researchers who had once worked for government agencies.
it also decentralized the sources of research funding and ensured that inquiry would move in many different directions not just along paths determined by the government.
a rift began to emerge between scientists and engineers.
engineers both inside and out of universities became increasingly tied up with the research and development agendas of corporations and worked hard to be of practical use to the new economy.
many scientists scorned this commercialization of knowledge and preferred to stick to basic research that no immediate practical applications.
even so american transformation scientists were more closely connected of higher to practical challenges than were their education european counterparts and some joined engineers in corporate research and development laboratories which over time began to sponsor not just practical but also basic research.
american universities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries developed a growing connection between university based research and the needs of the industrial economy.
university faculty and laboratories began to receive funding from corporations for research and a partnership began to develop between the academic world and the commercial world that continued into the twenty first century.
no comparable partnership emerged in european universities in these years and some scholars have argued that americas more rapid development in the twentieth century is in part a product of the markets success in harnessing knowledge from the academic world and elsewhere more effectively than the nations competitors abroad.
the science of production by the beginning of the twentieth century many industrialists were turning to new principles of scientific management.
those principles were often known as taylorism after their leading theoretician frederick winslow taylor.
taylors ideas were controversial during his lifetime and have remained controversial since.
taylor urged employers to reorganize the production process by subdividing tasks.
this would speed up production it would also make workers more interchangeable and thus di tayiorism minish a managers dependence on any particular employee.
and it would reduce the n s notebook this page from one of thomas edison s notebooks shows so and notes on some of his early experiments on an incandescent lamp what we i l 1 6 6ctr c s tbulb.
edison was not only the most celebrated inventor of his day but y t early twentieth century one of the greatest popular heroes in american life in a on a k ar d technbgical progress was considered the defining feature of the age archive photos getty images industrial supremacy 463 industrial production this postcard conveys the assembly line at the caterpillar manufacturing company.

the company has been well known for building tractors engines and road machinery.
rykoff coliection corbis need for highly trained skilled workers.
if properly managed by trained experts taylor claimed workers using modern machines could perform simple tasks at much greater speed significantly increasing productive efficiency.
taylor and his many admirers argued that scientific management was a way to make human labor compatible with the demands of the machine age.
scientific management was also a way to increase the employers control of the workplace and to make working people less independent.
the most important change in production technology in the industrial era was the emergence of mass production and above all the moving assembly line which henry ford intro moving duced in his automobile plants in 1914.
assembly line this revolutionary technique cut the time for assembling a chassis from 12v2 hours to h 2 hours.
it enabled ford to raise the wages and reduce the hours of his workers while cutting the base price of his model t from 950 in 1914 to 290 in 1929.
fords assembly line became a model for many other industries.
railroad expansion despite important advances in many other forms of technology and communication the principal agent of industrial progress in the late nineteenth century remained the railroad.
railroads were the nations principal form of transportation.
they helped determine the path by which agricultural and industrial economies developed.
when railroad lines ran through sparsely populated regions new farms and other economic activity quickly sprang up along the routes.
when they reached forests lumberers came quickly in their wake and began cutting down timber to send back to towns and cities for sale.
when railroads moved through the great plains of the west they brought buffalo hunters who nearly exterminated the great herds of bison and later helped transport cattle into the region and carry meat back into the cities.
because chicago was the principal railroad hub of the central united states it also became the place where railroads brought livestock making the city the slaughterhouse of the nation.
railroads even altered concepts of time.
until the 1880s there was no standard method of keeping time from one community to another.
in most places the position of the sun determined the time which meant that clocks were set differently even between nearby towns.
this created great difficulties for railroads which were trying to set schedules for the entire nation.
on november 18 1883 the railroad companies working together agreed to create four time zones across the continent each an hour apart from its closest neighbor.
although not until 1918 did the federal government make these time zones standard for all purposes the action by the railroads very quickly solidified the idea of standard time through most of the united states.
every decade in the late nineteenth century total railroad trackage increased dramatically from 30 000 miles in 1860 to 52 000 miles in 1870 to 93 000 in 1880 to 163 000 in 1890 and to 193 000 by 1900.
subsidies from federal state and local governments as well as investments from abroad were vital to these vast undertakings which required far more capital than private entrepreneurs in america could raise by themselves.
equally important was the emergence of great railroad combinations that brought most of the nations rails under the control of a very few men.
many railroad combinations continued to be dominated by individuals.
the achievements and excesses of these tycoons cornelius vanderbilt james j hill collis p huntington and others became symbols to much of the nation of great economic power concentrated in individual hands.
but railroad development was less significant for the individual barons it rapid expansion of the railroad 464 chapter 17 railroads 1870 1890 this map illustrates the rapid expansion of railroads in the late nineteenth century.
in 1870 there was already a dense network of rail lines in the northeast and midwest illustrated here by the green lines.
the red lines show the further expansion of rail coverage between 1870 and 1890 much of it in the south and the areas west of the mississippi river.
why were railroads so essential to the nations economic growth in these years.
created than for its contribution to the growth of a new institution the modern corporation.
the corporation there had been various forms of corporations in america since colonial times but the modern corporation emerged as a major force only after the civil war when railroad magnates and other industrialists realized that no single person or group of limited partners no matter how wealthy could finance their great ventures.
under the laws of incorporation passed in many states in the 1830s and 1840s business organizations could raise money by limited selling stock to members of the public after liability the civil war one industry after another began doing so.
at the same time affluent americans began to consider the purchase of stock a good investment even if they were not involved in the business whose stock they were purchasing.
what made the practice appealing was that investors had only limited liability that is they risked only the amount of their investments they were not liable for any debts the corporation might accumulate beyond that.
the ability to sell stock to a broad public made it possible for entrepreneurs to gather vast sums of capital and undertake great projects.
the pennsylvania railroad and others were among the first to adopt the new corporate form of organization.
but andrew quickly spread beyond the railroad in carnegie dustry.
in steel the central figure was andrew carnegie a scottish immigrant who had worked his way up from modest beginnings and in 1873 opened his own steelworks in pittsburgh.
soon he dominated the industry.
his methods were much like those of other industrial titans.
he cut costs and prices by striking deals with the railroads and then bought out rivals who could not compete with him.
with his associate henry clay frick he bought up coal mines and leased part of the mesabi iron ore range in minnesota operated a fleet of ore ships on the great lakes and acquired railroads.
ultimately carnegie controlled the processing of his steel from mine to market.
he financed his undertakings not only out of his own profits but out of the sale of stock as well.
then in 1901 he sold out for 450 million to the banker j pierpont morgan who merged the carnegie interests with others to create the giant united states steel corporation a 1 4 billion enterprise that controlled almost two thirds of the nations steel production.
there were similar developments in other industries.
gustavus swift developed a relatively small chicago meatpacking industrial supremacy 465 andrew carnegie carnegie was one of a relatively small number of great industrialists of the late nineteenth century who genuinely rose from rags to riches born in scotland he came to the united states in 1848 at the age of thirteen and soon found work as a messenger in a pittsburgh telegraph office.
his skill in learning to transcribe telegraphic messages he became one of the first telegraphers in the country able to take messages by sound brought him to the attention of a pennsylvania railroad official and before he was twenty he had begun his ascent to the highest ranks of industry.
after the civil war he shifted his attention to the growing iron industry in 1873 he invested all his assets in the development of the first american steel mills.
two decades later carnegie was one of the wealthiest men in the world.
in 1901 he abruptly resigned from his businesses and spent the remaining years of his life as a philanthropist.
by the time of his death in 1919 he had given away more than 350 million which by some measures would be worth well over a hundred billion dollars in 2014.

isaac singer patented a sewing machine in 1851 and created i m singer and company one of the first modern manufacturing corporations.
many of the corporate organizations developed a new approach to management.
large national business enterprises deeded more systematic administrative structures than the limited local ventures of the past.
as a result corporate leaders introduced a set of managerial techniques the genesis of modern business administration that relied on the division of responsibilities a carefully designed hierarchy of control modern cost accounting procedures and above all a new breed of new business executive the middle manager managerial who formed a layer of command between techniques workers and owners.
beginning in the railroad corporations these new management techniques moved quickly into virtually every area of large scale industry.
efficient administrative capabilities helped make possible another major feature of the modern corpora tion consolidation.
consolidating corporate america businessmen created large consolidated organizations primarily through two methods.
one was horizontal integration the iohn d rockefeller rockefeller s standard oil company became perhaps the argest and most powerful monopoly in america in the late nineteenth century and rockefeller lecame one of the nations wealthiest and most controversial men.
some historians consider rockefeller to have been the richest person in history with a personal fortune at the time of lis death of up to over a half trillion dollars adjusted for the late 2000s.
hulton archive setty images horizontal and vertical integration 466 chapter 17 combining of a number of firms engaged in the same enterprise into a single corporation.
the consolidation of many different railroad lines into one company was an example.
another method which became popular in the 1890s was vertical integration the taking over of all the different businesses on which a company relied for its primary function as in the case of carnegie steel.
the most celebrated corporate empire of the late nineteenth century was john d rockefellers standard oil a great rockefellers combination created through both hori standard oil zontal and vertical integration.
shortly after the civil war rockefeller launched a refining company in cleveland and immediately began trying to eliminate his competition.
allying himself with other wealthy capitalists he proceeded methodically to buy out competing refineries.
in 1870 he formed the standard oil company of ohio within a few years it had acquired twenty of the twenty five refineries in cleveland as well as plants in pittsburgh philadelphia new york city and baltimore.
so far rockefeller had expanded only horizontally.
but soon he began expanding vertically as well.
he built his own barrel factories terminal warehouses and pipelines.
standard oil owned its own freight cars and developed its own marketing organization.
by the 1880s rockefeller had established such dominance within the petroleum industry that to much of the nation he served as the leading symbol of monopoly.
he controlled access to 90 percent of the refined oil in the united states.
rockefeller and other industrialists saw consolidation as a way to cope with what they believed was the greatest curse of the modern economy cutthroat competition most businessmen claimed to believe in free enterprise and a competitive marketplace but in fact they feared the existence of too many competing firms convinced that substantial competition could spell instability and ruin for all.
a successful enterprise many capitalists believed but did not say publicly was one that could eliminate or absorb its competitors.
as the movement toward combination accelerated new vehicles emerged to facilitate it.
the railroads began making so called pool arrangements informal agreements among various companies to stabilize rates and divide markets arrangements known as cartels that would later become illegal.
but the pools did not work very well.
if even a few firms in an industry were unwilling to cooperate as was almost always the case the pool arrangements collapsed.
the trust and the holding company the failure of the pools led to new techniques of consolidation resting less on cooperation than on centralized control.
at first the most successful such technique was the creation of the trust pioneered by standard oil in the early 1880s and perfected by the banker j p morgan.
over time trust the trust agreement became a term for any great economic combination.
but the trust was in fact a particular kind of organization.
under a trust agreement stockholders in individual corporations transferred their stocks to a small group of trustees in exchange for shares in the trust itself.
owners of trust certificates often had no direct control over the decisions of the trustees they simply received a share of the profits of the combination.
the trustees themselves on the other hand might literally own only a few companies but could exercise effective control over many.
in 1889 the state of new jersey helped produce a third form of consolidation by changing its laws of incorporation to permit companies to buy up other companies.
other states soon followed.
that made the trust unnecessary and permitted actual corporate mergers.
rockefeller for example quickly relocated standard oil to new jersey and created there what became known as a holding company a central corporate body that would buy up the stock of various members of the standard oil trust and establish direct formal ownership of the corporations in the trust.
ont morgan this arresting portrait captures something of the intimidating pz7 i p erpnt mr9an the most pwerful fancier in america for decades until his death in 1913.
the granger collection new york industrial supremacy 467 by the end of the nineteenth century as a result of corporate rapid consolidation 1 percent of the corporations corporate america were able to control more than consolidation 33 percent of the manufacturing.
a system of economic organization was emerging that lodged enormous power in the hands of a very few men the great bankers of new york such as.
p morgan industrial titans such as rockefeller who gained control of a major bank and others.
whether or not this relentless concentration of economic power was the only way or the best way to promote industrial expansion became a major source of debate in america.
but it is clear that whatever else they may have done the industrial giants of the era were responsible for substantial economic growth.
they were integrating operations cutting costs creating a great industrial infrastructure stimulating new markets creating jobs for a vast new pool of unskilled workers and opening the way to large scale mass production.
they were also creating the basis for some of the greatest public controversies of their era.
capitalism and its critics the rise of big business produced many critics.
farmers and workers saw in the growth of the new corporate power centers a threat to notions of a republican society in which wealth and authority were widely distributed.
middle class critics pointed to the corruption that the new industrial titans seemed to produce in their own enterprises and in local state and national politics.
the growing criticisms challenged the captains of industry to defend the new corporate economy to convince the public and themselves that it was compatible with the ideology of individualism and equal opportunity that had long been central to the american self image.
the self made man the most common rationale for modern capitalism rested squarely on the older ideology of individualism.
the new industrial economy its defenders argued was not reducing opportunities for individual advancement but expanding them.
it was providing every individual with a chance to succeed and attain great wealth.
there was an element of truth in such claims but only a small one.
before the civil war there had been myth of the few millionaires in america by 1892 self made there were more than 4 000.
some man were in fact what almost all million aires claimed to be self made men andrew carnegie had worked as a bobbin boy in a pittsburgh cotton mill john d rockefeller had begun as a clerk in a cleveland commission house e h harriman a great railroad tycoon had begun as a broker s office boy.
but most of the new business tycoons had begun their careers from positions of wealth and privilege.
nor was their rise to power and prominence always a result simply of hard work and ingenuity as they liked to claim.
it was also a result of ruthlessness arrogance and at times rampant corruption.
the railroad magnate cornelius vanderbilt expressed the attitude of many corporate tycoons with his belligerent question what do i care about the law.
haint i got the power so did his son william with his oft quoted statement the public be damned industrialists made large financial contributions to politicians political parties and government officials in exchange for assistance and support.
and more often than not politicians responded as they hoped.
cynics said that colossus of rail roads cornelius vanderbilt known as the commodore accumulated one of america s great fortunes by consolidating several large railroad companies under his control in the 1860s.
his name became a synonym not only for enormous wealth but also in the eyes of many americans for excessive corporate power as suggested in this cartoon showing him standing astride his empire and manipulating its parts.

steel magnate andrew carnegie accumulated a huge fortune in industry but devoted the last two decades of his life to philanthropy establishing more than 2 500 libraries in the united states endowing universities and building carnegie hall in new york city and the peace palace in the hague.
in 1911 he established the carnegie corporation of new york to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding carnegie articulated his philosophy of the obligation of the wealthy to use their fortunes to improve the world in the essay wealth published in north american review in 1889 and excerpted in the first source document below.
investor and philanthropist warren buffett is the chairman and chief executive officer of berkshire hathaway a conglomerate holding company whose assets include geico the pampered chef fruit of the loom see s candies and benjamin moore co among many others.
known as the sage of omaha buffett was born in omaha nebraska in 1930 and still resides in the house he bought there in 1957 for 31 500.
he made his first stock purchase at age 11 when he bought shares of cities service preferred.
today buffett is one of the world s richest men with an estimated net worth of 45 billion in 2010.
in 2006 buffett announced that he intended to give away most of his fortune during his lifetime rather than having the funds distributed after his death.
the majority of buffett s wealth will go to the bill and melinda gates foundation the charitable foundation established by his close friend bridge partner and fellow philanthropist bill gates.
andrew carnegie 1889 wealth andrew carnegie this then is held to be the duty of the man of wealth first to set an example of modest unostentatious living shunning display or extravagance to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds which he is called upon to administer and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which in his judgment is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community the man of wealth thus becoming the mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren bringing to their service his superior wisdom experience and ability to administer doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves.
in bestowing charity the main consideration should be to help those who will help themselves to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so to give those who desire to rise the aids by which they may rise to assist but rarely or never to do all.
neither the individual nor the race is improved by almsgiving those worthy of assistance except in rare cases seldom require assistance.
the really valuable men of the race never do except in cases of accident or sudden change.
everyone has of course cases of individuals brought to his own knowledge where temporary assistance can do genuine good and these he will not overlook.
but the amount which can be wisely given by the 468 individual for individuals is necessarily limited by his lack of knowledge of the circumstances connected with each.
he is the only true reformer who is as careful and as anxious not to aid the unworthy as he is to aid the worthy and perhaps even more so for in almsgiving more injury is probably done by rewarding vice than by relieving virtue.
thus is the problem of rich and poor to be solved.
the laws of accumulation will be left free the laws of distribution free.
individualism will continue but the millionaire will be but a trustee for the poor entrusted for a season with a great part of the increased wealth of the community but administering it for the community far better than it could or would have done for itself.
the best minds will thus have reached a stage in the development of the race in which it is clearly seen that there is no mode of disposing of surplus wealth creditable to thoughtful and earnest men into whose hands it flows save by using it year by year for the general good.
this day already dawns.
but a little while and although without incurring the pity of their fellows men may die sharers in great business enterprises from which their capital cannot be or has not been withdrawn and is left chiefly at death for public uses yet the man who dies leaving behind him millions of available wealth which was his to administer during life will pass away unwept unhonored and unsung no matter to what uses he leaves the dross which he cannot take with him.
of such as these the public verdict will then be the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced such in my opinion is the true gospel concerning wealth obedience to which is destined some day to solve the problem of the rich and the poor and to bring peace on earth among men goodwill source north american review june 1889.

how does carnegie differentiate between almsgiving and philanthropy.
warren buffett 2010 my philanthropic pledge warren buffett in 2006 1 made a commitment to gradually give all of my berkshire hathaway stock to philanthropic foundations.
i couldnt be happier with that decision.
now bill and melinda gates and 1 are asking hundreds of rich americans to pledge at least 50 of their wealth to charity.
so i think it is fitting that i reiterate my intentions and explain the thinking that lies behind them.
first my pledge more than 99 of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.
measured by dollars this commitment is large.
in a comparative sense though many individuals give more to others every day.
millions of people who regularly contribute to churches schools and other organizations thereby relinquish the use of funds that would otherwise benefit their own families.
the dollars these people drop into a collection plate or give to united way mean forgone movies dinners out or other personal pleasures.
in contrast my family and i will give up noth ing we need or want by fulfilling this 99 pledge.
moreover this pledge does not leave me contributing the most precious asset which is time.
many people including im proud to say my three children give extensively of their own time and talents to help others.
gifts of this kind often prove far more valuable than money.
a struggling child befriended and nurtured by a caring mentor receives a gi t whose value far exceeds what can be bestowed by a check.
my sister doris extends significant person to person help daily.
ive done little of this.
what i can do however is to take a pile of berkshire hathaway stock certificates wclaim checks that when converted to cash can command far ranging resources and commit them to benefit others who through the luck of the draw have received the short straws in life.
to date about 20 of my shares have been distributed including shares given me by my late wife susan buffett.
i will continue to annually distribute about 4 of the shares i retain.
at the latest the proceeds from all of my berkshire shares will be expended for philanthropic purposes by 10 years after my estate is settled.
nothing will go to endowments i want the money spent on current needs.
this pledge will leave my lifestyle untouched and that of my children as well.
they have already received significant sums for their personal use and will receive more in the future.
they live comfortable and productive lives.
and i will continue to live in a manner that gives me everything i could possibly want in life.
some material things make my life more enjoyable many however would not.
i like having an expensive private plane but owning a half dozen homes would be a burden.
too often a vast collection of possessions ends up possessing its owner.
the asset i most value aside from health is interesting diverse and long standing friends.
my wealth has come from a combination of living in america some lucky genes and compound interest.
both my children and i won what i call the ovarian lottery.
for starters the odds against my 1930 birth taking place in the u s were at least 30 to 1.
my being male and white also removed huge obstacles that a majority of americans then faced.
my luck was accentuated by my living in a market system that sometimes produces distorted results though overall it serves our country well.
ive worked in an economy that rewards someone who saves the lives of others on a battlefield with a medal rewards a great teacher with thank you notes from parents but rewards those who can detect the mispricing of securities with sums reaching into the billions.
in short fates distribution of long straws is wildly capricious.
the reaction of my family and me to our extraordinary good fortune is not guilt but rather gratitude.
were we to use more than 1 of my claim checks on ourselves neither our happiness nor our well being would be enhanced.
in contrast the remaining 99 can have a huge effect on the health and welfare of others.
that reality sets an obvious course for me and my family keep all we can conceivably need and distribute the rest to society for its needs.
my pledge starts us down that course.

70 industrial supremacy 471 standard oil did everything to the ohio legislature except refine it a member of the pennsylvania legislature once reportedly said mr speaker i move we adjourn unless the pennsylvania railroad has more business for us to transact the average industrialist of the late nineteenth century was not however a rockefeller or a vanderbilt.
for every successful millionaire there were dozens of aspiring businessmen whose efforts failed.
some industries fell under the monopolistic control of a single firm or a small group of large firms.
but most industries remained fragmented with many small companies struggling to carve out a stable position for themselves in an uncertain highly competitive environment.
the annals of business did indeed include real stories of individuals rising from rags to riches.
they also included stories of people moving from riches back to rags.
survival of the fittest most tycoons liked to claim that they had attained their wealth and power through hard work acquisitiveness and thrift the traditional virtues of protestant america.
those who succeeded they argued deserved their success.
god gave me my money explained john d rockefeller expressing the assumption that riches were a reward for worthiness.
those who failed they said had earned their failure through their own laziness stupidity or carelessness.
let us remember said a prominent protestant minister that there is not a poor person in the united states who was not made poor by his own shortcomings such assumptions helped strengthen a popular social theory of the late nineteenth century social darwinism the appli social cation of charles darwin s laws of evolution darwinism and natural selection among species to human society.
just as only the fittest survived in the process of evolution social darwinists claimed so in human society only the fittest individuals survived and flourished in the marketplace.
the english philosopher herbert spencer was the first and most important proponent of this theory.
society he argued benefited from the elimination of the unfit and the survival of the strong and talented.
spencers books were popular in america in the 1870s and 1880s.
and his teachings found prominent supporters among american intellectuals most notably william graham sumner of yale university who promoted similar ideas in lectures articles and a famous 1906 book folkways.
sumner did not agree with everything spencer wrote but he did share spencers belief that individuals must have absolute freedom to struggle to compete to succeed or to fail.
many industrialists seized on the theories of spencer and sumner to justify their own power.
the growth of a large business is merely the survival of the fittest rockefeller proclaimed.
this is not an evil tendency in business.
it is merely the working out of the law of nature and a law of god social darwinism appealed to businessmen because it seemed to legitimize their success and confirm their virtues.
it also appealed to them because it placed their activities within the context of traditional american ideas of freedom and indi justifying the vidualism.
above all it appealed to them status quo because it justified their tactics.
social darwinists insisted that all attempts by labor to raise wages by forming unions and all endeavors by government to regulate economic activities would fail because economic life was controlled by a natural law the law of competition.
and social darwinism coincided with another law that seemed to justify business practices and business dominance the law of supply and demand as defined by adam smith and the classical economists.
the economic system they argued was like a great and delicate machine functioning by the invisible hand of market forces.
but social darwinism and the ideas of classical economics did not have much to do with the realities of the corporate economy.
at the same time that businessmen were celebrating the virtues of competition and the free market they were actively seeking to protect themselves from competition and to replace the natural workings of the marketplace with control by great combinations.
rockefellers great standard oil monopoly was the clearest example of the effort to free an enterprise from competition.
many other businessmen made similar attempts on a smaller scale.
vicious competitive battle something spencer and sumner celebrated and called a source of healthy progress was in fact the very thing that american businessmen most feared and tried to eliminate.
the gospel of wealth some businessmen attempted to temper the harsh philosophy of social darwinism with a more gentle if in some ways equally self serving idea the gospel of wealth people of great wealth advocates of this idea argued had not only great power but great responsibilities as well.
it was their duty to use their riches to advance social progress.
andrew carnegie elaborated on the creed in his 1901 book the gospel of wealth in which he wrote that the wealthy should consider all revenues in excess of their own needs as trust funds to be used for the good of the community the person of wealth he said was the mere trustee and agent for his poorer brethren carnegie was only one of many great industrialists who devoted large parts of their fortunes to philanthropic works much of it to libraries and schools institutions he believed would help the poor to help themselves.
the notion of private wealth as a public blessing existed alongside another popular concept the notion of great wealth russell as something available to all.
russell h conwell conwell a baptist minister became the most prominent spokesman for the idea by delivering one lecture acres of diamonds reportedly more than 6 000 times between 1880 and 1900.
conwell told a series of stories which he claimed were true of individuals who had found opportunities for extraordinary wealth in their own backyards.
one such story involved a modest farmer who discovered a vast diamond mine in his own fields in the course of patterns of popular culture ujfwuhinhmhnifjniijuiifiiiihinijimihiniiihiuhithiihuiiii the novels of horatio alger young boy perhaps an orphan makes his perilous way through life on the rough streets of the city by selling newspapers or peddling matches.

that in a nutshell is the story that horatio alger presented to his readers in novel after novel more than 100 of them in all for over forty years.
during algers lifetime americans bought many million copies of his novels.
after his death in 1899 his books and others written in his name continued to sell at an astonishing rate.
alger was born in 1832 into a middle class new england family attended harvard and spent a short time as a unitarian minister.
he never experienced the hardships he later chronicled.
in the mid 1850s he turned to writing stories and books.
his most famous novel ragged dick was published in 1868 but there were many others almost identical to it tom the bootblack sink or swim jed the poorhouse boy phil the fiddler andy grant s pluck.
most of his books were aimed at young people and almost all of them were fables of a young man s rise from rags to riches.
the purpose of his writing he claimed was twofold.
he wanted to exert a salutary influence upon the class of whom i was writing by setting before them inspiring examples of what energy ambition and an honest purpose may achieve.
he also wanted to show his largely middle class readers the life and experiences of the friendless and vagrant children to be found in all our cities most americans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were attracted to alger because his stories helped reinforce one of the most cherished of their national myths that with willpower and hard work anyone could become a self made man.
that belief was all the more important in the late nineteenth century when the rise of large scale corporate industrialization was making it increasingly difficult for individuals to control their own fates.
alger placed great emphasis on the moral qualities of his heroes their success was a reward for their virtue.
but many of his readers ignored the moral message and clung simply to the image of sudden and dramatic success.
after the author s death his publishers responded to that yearning by abridging many of alger s works to eliminate the parts of his stories where the heroes do good deeds.
instead they focused solely on the success of alger s heroes in rising in the world.
alger had very mixed feelings about the new industrial order he described.
his books were meant to reveal not just the opportunities for advancement it sometimes created but also its cruelty.
to alger the modern age working his land.
1 say to you he told his rapt audiences that you have acres of diamonds beneath you right here.
that the men and women sitting here have within their reach opportunities to get largely wealthy.
i say that you ought to get rich and that it is your duty to get rich most of the millionaires in the country conwell claimed inaccurately had begun on the lowest rung of the economic ladder and had worked their way to success.
every industrious individual had the chance to do likewise.
horatio alger was the most famous promoter of the success horatio story.

alger was originally a minister in a small town in massachusetts but was driven from his pulpit as a result of a sexual scandal.
he moved to new york where he wrote his celebrated novels about poor boys who rise from rags to riches more than 100 in all which together sold more than 20 million copies.
he became something of a folk hero in american culture.
few of his many fans were aware of his homosexuality.
like most other gay men of his era he kept his private life carefully hidden fearful that publicity would destroy his reputation and his career.
alternative visions alongside the celebrations of competition the justifications for great wealth and the legitimization of the existing order stood a group of alternative philosophies challenging the corporate ethos and at times capitalism itself.
one such philosophy emerged in the work of the sociologist lester frank ward.
ward was a darwinist but he rejected lester frank application of darwinian laws to hu ward man society.
in dynamic sociology 1883 and other books he argued that civilization was governed not by natural selection but by human intelligence which was capable of shaping society as it wished.
unlike sumner who believed that state intervention to remodel the environment was futile ward thought that an active government engaged in positive planning was societys best hope.
the people through their government could inter vene in the economy and adjust it to serve their needs.
other americans skeptical of the laissez faire ideas of the social darwinists adopted drastic approaches to reform.
some dissenters joined the socialist labor party founded in the 1870s and led for many years by daniel de leon an immigrant from the west indies.
de leon attracted a modest following in the industrial cities but the party failed to become a major political force.
it never polled more than 82 000 votes.
a dissident faction of his party eager to forge ties with organized labor broke away and in 1901 formed the more enduring american socialist party.
other radicals gained a wider following.
one of the most influential was henry george of california.
his angrily eloquent 472 risen from the ranks alger s novels were even more popular after his death in 1899 than they had been in his lifetime this is a reprint of the cover of one of his many rags to riches books.
risen from the ranks is about the rise of a young boy harry walton who rises from newsboy to newspaper editor.
the granger collection new york did not guarantee success through hard work alone there had to be some providential assistance as well.
that was one reason that in almost all his books his heroes triumphed not just because of their own virtues or efforts but because of some amazing stroke of luck as well.
over time alger s admirers came to ignore his own misgivings about industrialism and to portray his books purely as celebrations of and justifications for laissez faire capitalism and the accumulation of wealth.
today though his books are largely forgotten the name horatio alger lives on representing the idea of individual advancement through in a phrase alger coined pluck and luck.
an example of the transformation of alger into a symbol of individual achievement is the horatio alger award established in 1947 by the american schools and colleges association to honor living individuals who by their own efforts had pulled themselves up by their bootstraps in the american tradition.
among its recipients have been presidents dwight d eisenhower and ronald reagan evangelist billy graham and u s supreme court justice clarence thomas.

progress and poverty published in 1879 became one of the best selling nonfiction works in american publishing history.
henry george geor e tried t0 explain why poverty existed amid the wealth created by modern industry.
this association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times he wrote.
nso long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but to build up great fortunes to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast between the house of have and the house of want progress is not real and cannot be permanent george blamed social problems on the ability of a few monopolists to grow wealthy as a result of rising land values.
an increase in the value of land he claimed was a result not of any effort by the owner but of the growth of society around the land.
it was an unearned increment and it was rightfully the property of the community.
and so george proposed a single tax to replace all other taxes which would return the increment to the people.
the tax he argued would destroy monopolies distribute wealth more equally and eliminate poverty.
single tax societies sprang up in many cities.
george moved east to new york and in 1886 with the support of labor and the socialists he narrowly missed being elected mayor.
rivaling george in popularity was edward bellamy whose utopian novel looking backward published in 1888 sold more than 1 million copies.
it described the experiences of a young bostonian who went into a hypnotic sleep in 1887 and awoke looking in t ie year 2000 t0 nd a new social order backward where want politics and vice were unknown.
the new society had emerged from a peaceful evolutionary process.
the large trusts of the late nineteenth century had continued to grow and combine until they formed a single great trust controlled by the government which absorbed all the businesses of all the citizens and distributed the abundance of the industrial economy equally among all the people.
society had become a great machine so logical in its principles and direct and simple in its workings that it almost ran itself.
fraternal cooperation had replaced competition.
class divisions had disappeared.
bellamy labeled the philosophy behind this vision nationalism and his work inspired the formation of more than 160 nationalist clubs to propagate his ideas.
the problems of monopoly relatively few americans shared the views of those who questioned capitalism itself.
but by the end of the century a growing number of people were becoming deeply concerned about a particular glaring aspect of capitalism the growth of monopoly control of the market by large corporate combinations.
laborers farmers consumers small manufacturers conservative bankers and financiers advocates of radical change all began to assail monopoly and economic concentration.
473 the novels of louisa may alcott horatio alger s rags to riches tales captured the aspirations of many men of the late nineteenth century louisa may alcott s enormously popular novels helped give voice to the often unstated ambitions of many young women.
alcott was born in 1832 the daughter of a prominent if generally impoverished reformer and educator bronson alcott a new england transcendentalist committed to abolishing slavery and advancing women s rights.
louisa may alcott grew up wanting to write one of the few serious vocations available to women.
as a young adult she wrote a series of popular adventure novels under the pen name a m barnard populated by conventional male heroes.
while serving as a nurse in the civil war she contracted typhoid and recovered but developed mercury poisoning through her treatment and suffered from it until her death in 1888.
after the war she chose a different path writing realistic fiction and basing it on the lives and experiences of women.
the publication of little women 1868 1869 established alcott as a major literary figure and as an enduring if sometimes puzzling inspiration for girls and indeed women of all ages.
little women and its successors little men 1871 and jo s boys 1886 were unlike the formulaic horatio alger stories in which young men inevitably rose from humble circumstances to great success.
and yet they both echoed and altered the message of those books.
the fictional march family in the novels was in fact modeled on alcotts own impoverished if intellectually lively childhood and much of little women is a chronicle of poverty suffering and even death.
but it is also the story of a young girl jo march modeled to some degree on alcott herself who struggles to build a life for herself that is not defined by conventional women s roles and ambitions.
jo march like louisa may alcott becomes a writer.
she spurns a conventional marriage to her attractive and wealthy neighbor laurie.
unlike alcott who never married jo does find a husband an older man a german professor who does not support jo s literary ambitions many readers have found this marriage troubling and false to the message of the rest of the book it seems to contradict alcott s belief that women can have intellectual independence and achievement.

i wont marry jo to laurie to please any one.
jos marriage to professor bhaer is in many ways a concession.
jo should have remained a literary spinster like alcott herself she once wrote but so many enthusiastic ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry laurie or somebody that i didn t dare to refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her it is tempting to see louisa may alcott s life as an independent woman a writer and an active suffragist as a better model to her readers than the characters in her fiction.
jo march is willful rebellious stubborn ambitious and often selfish not the poised romantic submissive woman of most sentimental novels of her time.
she hates housekeeping and drudgery.
she yearns at times to be a boy.
she resists society s expec tations through her literary aspirations her sharp temper and ultimately her unconventional marriage.
through those qualities she captured the imaginations of late nineteenth century female readers and continues to capture the imaginations of readers today.
little women has survived far longer than the horatio alger stories did precisely because it presents a story of growing up that unlike alger s is not predictable but complicated conflicted and surprising.

in what ways are alcott s novels similar to alger s.
how do they differ.
little women has continued to be popular as a novel and it has been made several times into movies and at least once into a broadway musical.
what accounts for its enduring popularity.
they blamed monopoly for creating artificially high prices and for producing a highly unstable economy.
in the absence of competition they argued monopolistic industries could charge whatever prices they wished railroads in particular charged very high rates along some routes because in the absence of competition they knew their customers had no choice but to pay them.
artificially high prices moreover contributed to the economys instability as production consistently outpaced demand.
beginning in 1873 the economy fluctuated erratically with severe recessions creating havoc every five or six years each recession worse than the previous one until finally in 1893 the system seemed on the verge of total collapse.
hostility to monopoly was based on more than a concern about prices.
many americans considered monopoly dangerous because the rise of large combinations seemed to threaten the ability of individuals to advance in the world.
if a single person or a small group could control all economic activity in an industry what opportunities would be left for others.
to men in particular monopoly threatened the ideal of the wage earning husband capable of supporting a family and prospering because combinations seemed to reduce opportunities to succeed to make less likely the idea of the self made man memorialized in the novels of horatio alger.
monopoly therefore threatened not just competition but certain notions of manhood as well.
adding to the resentment of monopoly was the emer gence of a new class of enormously and conspicuously wealthy people whose lifestyles became an affront to those juggling to stay afloat.
according to one estimate early in the century 1 percent of the families in america controlled nearly 88 percent of the nations assets.
some of the wealthy andrew carnegie for example lived unostentatiously and donated large sums to charities.
others however lived in almost grotesque luxury.
like a clan of feudal barons the vanderbilts maintained in addition to many country estates seven opulent mansions on seven blocks of new york citys fifth avenue.

the standard of living was rising for everyone but the gap between rich and poor was increasing.
to those in difficult economic circumstances the sense of relative deprivation could be almost as frustrating and embittering as poverty itself.
industrial workers in the new economy the american working class was both a beneficiary and a victim of the growth of industrial capitalism.
many workers in the late nineteenth century experienced a real rise in their standard of living.
but they did so at the cost of arduous and 475 476 chapter 17 often dangerous working conditions diminishing control over their own work and a growing sense of powerlessness.
the immigrant workforce the industrial workforce expanded dramatically in the late nineteenth century as demand for factory labor grew.
there was a continuing flow of rural americans into factory towns and cities people disillusioned with or bankrupted by life on the farm and eager for new economic and social opportunities.
and there was a great wave of immigration from mexico asia canada and above all europe in the decades following the civil war an influx greater than that of any previous era.
the 25 million immigrants who arrived in the united states between 1865 and 1915 were more than four times the number who had arrived in the fifty years before.
in the 1870s and 1880s most of the immigrants to eastern industrial cities came from the nation s traditional sources new sources of en8land ireland and northern europe.
immigration by the end of the century however the major sources of immigration had shifted with large numbers of southern and eastern europeans italians poles russians greeks slavs and others moving to america among other nations and into the industrial workforce.

no reliable figures are available for either group but an estimated 1 million mexicans entered the united states in the first three decades of the twentieth century many of them swelling the industrial workforce of western cities.
the new immigrants were coming to america in part to escape poverty and oppression in their homelands.
but they were also lured to the united states by expectations of new opportunities.
sometimes such expectations were realistic but often they were the result of false promises.
railroads tried to lure immigrants into their western landholdings by distributing misleading advertisements overseas.
industrial employers actively recruited immigrant workers under the contract labor law which until its repeal in 1885 permitted them to pay for the passage of workers in advance and deduct the amount later from their wages.
even after the repeal of the law employers continued to encourage the immigration of unskilled laborers often with the assistance of foreign born labor brokers such as the greek and italian padrones who recruited work gangs of their fellow nationals.
the arrival of these new groups introduced heightened eth heightened nic tensions into the dynamic of the ethnic tensions working class.
low paid poles greeks and french canadians began to displace higher paid british and irish workers in the textile factories of new england.
italians slavs and poles emerged as a major source of labor for the mining industry in the east traditionally dominated by native workers or northern european immigrants.
chinese and mexicans competed with anglo americans and african americans in mining farmwork and factory labor in california colorado and texas.
wages and working conditions the average standard of living for workers rose in the years after the civil war but for many laborers the return for their labor remained very small.
at the turn of the century the average income of the american worker was 400 to 500 a year below the 600 figure widely considered the minimum for a reasonable level of comfort.
nor did workers have much job security.
all workers were vulnerable to the boom and bust cycle of the industrial economy and some lost their jobs because of technological advances or because of the cyclical or seasonal nature of their work.
even those who kept their jobs could find their wages suddenly and substantially cut in hard times.
few workers in other words were ever far from poverty.
american laborers faced other hardships as well.
for first generation workers accustomed to the patterns of agrarian life there was a difficult industrial supremacy 477 women on the assembly line this image from 1902 shows women at work on the lock and drill department assembly line at the national cash register company in dayton ohio.

everett collection historical alamy adjustment to the nature of modern industrial labor the performance of routine repetitive tasks often requiring little skill on a strict and monotonous schedule.
to skilled artisans whose once valued tasks were now performed by machines the new system was impersonal and demeaning.
factory laborers worked ten to twelve hour days six days a week in the steel industry they worked twelve hours a day.
many worked in appallingly unsafe or unhealthy factories.
industrial accidents were frequent and severe.
compensation to the victims from either their employers or the government was often limited until many states began passing workmen s compensation laws in the early twentieth century.
for many workers the most disturbing aspect of factory labor in the new industrial system was their loss of control loss of control over conc itions f rheir labr even semiskilled workers and common laborers had managed to maintain some control over their labor in the relatively informal working conditions of the early and mid nineteenth century.
as the corporate form of organization spread employers set out to make the factory more efficient often in response to the principles of scientific management.
that meant they believed centralizing control of the workplace in the hands of managers ensuring that workers had no authority or control that might disrupt the flow of production.
this loss of control as much as the low wages and long hours lay behind the substantial working class militancy in the late nineteenth century.
women and children at work the decreasing need for skilled work in factories induced many employers to increase the use of unskilled women and children whom they could hire for lower wages than adult males.
by 1900 women made up 17 percent of the industrial workforce a fourfold increase since 1870 and 20 percent of all women well over 5 million were wage earners.
some of these working women were single and took jobs to support themselves or their parents or siblings.
many others were married and had to work to supplement the inadequate earnings of their husbands for many working class families two incomes were required to support even a minimal standard of living.
many reformers including many females saw women as particularly vulnerable to exploitation and injury in the rough environment of the factory.
they considered it inappropriate for women to work independently.
the problem of women in the workforce became a significant public issue.
in some communities the aversion to seeing married women work was so strong among both men and women that families struggled on inadequate wages rather than see a wife and mother take a job.
women industrial workers were overwhelmingly white and mostly young 75 percent of them under twenty five.
the vast poorly paid majority were immigrants or the daughters women of immigrants.
there were some women in all areas of industry even in some of the most arduous jobs.
most women however worked in a few industries where unskilled and semiskilled machine labor as opposed to heavy manual labor prevailed.
the textile industry remained the largest single industrial employer of women.
domestic service remained the most common female occupation overall.
women worked for wages as low as 6 to 8 a week well below the minimum necessary for survival and well below the wages paid to men working the same jobs.

even highly skilled women workers made about half what men doing the same job earned.
advocates of a minimum wage law for women created a sensation when several women testified at a hearing in chicago that low wages and desperate poverty had driven them to prostitution.
the testimony was not however sensational enough for the illinois legislature which promptly defeated the bill.
at least 1 7 million children under sixteen years of age were employed in factories and fields in 1900 more than twice the number of thirty years before.
ten percent of all girls aged ten to fifteen and 20 percent of all boys held jobs.
this was partly because some families so desperately needed additional wages that parents and children alike were pressed into service.
it was also because in some families the reluctance to permit wives to work led parents to send their children into the workforce to avoid forcing mothers to go.
this did not however prevent reformers from seeing children working in factories as a significant social problem.
under the pressure of outraged public opinion thirty eight state legislatures passed child labor laws in the late nineteenth century but these laws were of limited impact.
sixty percent of child workers were employed in agriculture which was typically exempt from the laws such children often worked twelve hour days picking or hoeing in the fields.
and even for children employed in factories the laws merely set a minimum age of twelve years and a maximum workday of ten hours standards that employers often ignored.
in the cotton mills of the south children working at the looms all night were kept awake by having cold water thrown in their faces.
in canneries little girls cut fruits and vegetables sixteen ineffective child labor laws hours a day.
exhausted children were particularly susceptible to injury while working at dangerous machines and they were maimed and even killed in industrial accidents at an alarming rate.
as much as the appalling conditions of women and child workers troubled the national conscience conditions for many men were at least equally dangerous.
in mills and mines and on the railroads the american accident rate was higher than that of any industrial nation in the world.
as late as 1907 an average of twelve railroad men a week died on the job.
in factories thousands of workers faced such occupational diseases as lead or phosphorus poisoning against which few employers took precautions.
the struggle to unionize labor leaders attempted to fight back against the poor conditions in the workplace by adopting some of the same tactics their employers had used so effectively creating large combinations or unions.
but by the end of the century their efforts had met with little success.
there had been craft unions in america representing small groups of skilled workers since well before the civil war.
alone however individual unions could not hope to exert national significant power in the new corporate labor union economy and in the 1860s some labor leaders began to search for ways to combine the energies of the various labor organizations.
the first attempt to federate separate unions into a single national organization came in 1866 when william h sylvis founded the national labor union a polyglot association claiming 640 000 members that included a variety of reform groups having lirie j industrial supremacy 479 i kehoe hanged.

but many argued that as long as conditions made it impossible for men to support their families women should have full and equal opportunities in the workplace.

particularly alarming to middle class americans was the emergence of the molly maguires a militant labor organization in the anthracite coal region of pennsylvania.
the mollies operated within the ancient order of hibernians an irish fraternal society.
they attempted to intimidate the coal operators through violence and occasionally murder and they added to the growing perception that labor activism was motivated by dangerous radicals.
much of the violence attributed to the molly maguires however was instigated or performed by informers and agents employed by the mine owners who wanted a pretext for ruthless measures to suppress unionization.

after the panic of 1873 the national labor union disintegrated and disappeared.

in philadelphia state militia opened fire on thousands of workers and their families who were attempting to block the railroad crossings and killed twenty people.
in all more than 100 people died before the strike finally collapsed several weeks after it had begun.
the great railroad strike was americas first major national labor conflict and it illustrated how disputes between workers and employers could no longer be localized in the increasingly national economy.
it illustrated as well the depth of resentment among many american workers toward their employers and toward the governments allied with them and the lengths to which they were prepared to go to express that resentment.
and finally it was an indication of the frailty of the labor movement.
the failure of the strike seriously weakened the railroad unions and damaged the reputation of labor organizations in other industries as well.
480 chapter 17 the knights of labor the first genuinely national labor organization was the noble order of the knights of labor founded in 1869 under the leadership of uriah s stephens.
membership was open to all who toiled a definition that included all workers and most business and professional people.
the only excluded groups were lawyers bankers liquor dealers and professional gamblers.
unlike most labor organizations of the time the knights welcomed women members not just female factory workers but domestic servants and women who worked in their own homes.
leonora barry an irish immigrant who had worked in a new york hosiery factory ran the womans bureau of the knights.
under her effective leadership the knights enlisted 50 000 women members both black and white and created over a hundred all female locals.
the knights were loosely organized without much central direction.
members met in local assemblies which took many different forms.
they were loosely affiliated with a national general assembly their program was similarly vague.
although they championed an eight hour day and the abolition of child labor the leaders were more interested in long range reform of the economy.
leaders of the knights hoped to replace the wage system with a new cooperative system in which workers would themselves control a large part of the economy.
for several years the knights remained a secret fraternal organization.
but in the late 1870s under the leadership of terence v powderly the order moved into the open and entered a spectacular period of expansion.
by 1886 it claimed a total membership of over 700 000 including some militant elements that the moderate dissolution of the knights of labor leadership could not always control.
local unions or assemblies associated with the knights launched a series of strikes in the 1880s in defiance of powderlys wishes.
in 1885 striking railway workers forced the missouri pacific a link in the gould system to restore wage cuts and recognize their union.
but the victory was temporary.
in the following year a strike on another gould railroad the texas and pacific was crushed and the power of the unions in the gould system was broken.
their failure helped discredit the organization.
by 1890 the membership of the knights had shrunk to 100 000.
a few years later the organization disappeared.
the afl even before the knights began to decline a rival organization based on a very different organizational concept appeared.
in 1881 representatives of a number of existing craft unions formed the federation of organized trade and labor unions of the united states and canada.
five years later it changed its name to the american federation of labor afl and it soon became the most important and enduring labor group in the country.
rejecting the knights idea of one big union for everybody the federation was an association of autonomous craft unions and represented mainly skilled workers.
it was generally hostile to organizing unskilled workers who did not fit comfortably within the craft based structure of existing organizations.
toward women the afl adopted an apparently contradictory policy.
on the one hand the male leaders of the afl were hostile to the idea of women entering the opposition paid workforce.
because women were weak to female tjie believed employers could easily take advantage of them by paying them less than knights of labor delegates 1886 the knights of labor was the first and for many years the only labor organization to welcome women unreservedly as this portrait of delegates to the knights 1886 convention indicates.

it is the so called competition of the unorganized defenseless woman worker the girl and the wife that often tends to reduce the wages of the father and husband samuel gompers the powerful leader of the afl once said.
he talked often about the importance of women remaining in the home and argued incorrectly that there is no necessity of the wife contributing to the support of the family by working.
more than that female labor was the afl newspaper wrote the knife of the assassin aimed at the family circle.
gompers himself believed strongly that a test of a mans worth was his ability to support a family and that women in the workforce would undermine mens positions as heads of their families.
although hostile to the idea of women workers the afl nevertheless sought equal pay for those women who did work and even hired some female organizers to encourage unionization in industries dominated by women.
these positions were in fact less contradictory than they seem.
by raising the pay of women the afl could make them less attractive to employers and in effect drive them out of the workforce.
gompers accepted the basic premises of capitalism his goal was simply to secure for workers a greater share of capitalisms material rewards.
gompers opposed the creation of a workers party he was generally hostile to any government efforts to the afls protect labor or improve working condi agenda tions convinced that what government could give it could also take away.
the afl concentrated instead on the relationship between labor and management.
it supported the immediate objectives of most workers better wages and working conditions.
and while the afl hoped to attain its goals by collective bargaining it was ready to use strikes if necessary.
as one of its first objectives the afl demanded a national eight hour day and called for a general strike if workers did not achieve the goal by may 1 1886.
on that day strikes and demonstrations calling for a shorter workday took place all over the country most of them staged by afl unions but a few by radical groups.
in chicago a center of labor and radical strength a strike was haymarket already in progress at the mccormick square harvester company when the general strike began.
city police had been harassing the strikers and labor and radical leaders called a protest meeting at haymarket square.
when the police ordered the crowd to disperse someone threw a bomb that killed seven officers and injured sixty seven other people.
the police who had killed four strikers the day before fired into the crowd and killed four more people.
conservative property conscious americans frightened and outraged demanded retribution even though no one knew who had thrown the bomb.
chicago officials finally rounded up eight anarchists and charged them with murder on the grounds that their statements had incited whoever had hurled the bomb.
all eight scapegoats were found guilty after a remarkably injudicious trial.
seven were sentenced to death.
one of the condemned committed suicide four were executed md two had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.
to most middle class americans the haymarket bombing was an alarming symbol of social chaos and radicalism.
anarchism now became a code word in the public mind for terrorism and violence even though most anarchists were relatively peaceful visionaries dreaming of a new social order.
for the next thirty years the specter of anarchism remained one of the most frightening concepts in the american middle class imagination.
it also became a constant obstacle to the goals of the afl and other labor organizations and it was particularly devastating to the knights of labor which as the most radical of the major labor organizations never recovered from the post haymarket hysteria.
however much they tried to distance themselves from radicals unions were always vulnerable to accusations of anarchism as the violent strikes of the 1890s occasionally illustrated.
the homestead strike the amalgamated association of iron and steel workers which was affiliated with the american federation of labor was the most powerful trade union in the country.
its members were skilled workers in great demand by employers and thus able to exercise significant power in the workplace.
employers sometimes called such workers little shopfloor autocrats and they resented the substantial control over working conditions these skilled laborers often had.
the union had a rulebook with fifty six pages of what workers called legislation limiting the power of employers.
in the emerging corporate world of the late nineteenth century such challenges to management control were beginning to seem intolerable to many employers.
by the mid 1880s the steel industry had introduced new production methods and new patterns of organization that were streamlining the steelmaking process and at the same time reducing the companies dependence on skilled labor.
in the carnegie system the union had a foothold in only one of the corporations three major factories the homestead plant henry clay near pittsburgh.
by 1890 carnegie and his frick chief lieutenant henry clay frick had de cided that the amalgamated had to go even at homestead.
over the next two years they repeatedly cut wages at homestead.
at first the union acquiesced aware that it was not strong enough to wage a successful strike.
in 1892 the company stopped even discussing its decisions with the amalgamated in effect denying the unions right to negotiate.
finally when frick announced another wage cut at homestead and gave the union two days to accept it the amalgamated called for a strike.
frick abruptly shut down the plant and called in 300 guards from the pinkerton detective agency to enable the company to hire nonunion workers.
the hated pinkertons were well known strikebreakers and their mere presence was often enough to incite workers to violence.
the pinkertons approached the plant by river on barges on july 6 1892.
the strikers prepared for them by pouring oil on the water and setting it on fire and they met the guards at the docks with guns and dynamite.
after several hours of pitched 482 chapter 17 battle during which three guards and ten strikers were killed and many others injured the pinkertons surrendered and were escorted roughly out of town.
but the workers victory was temporary.
the governor of pennsylvania at the companys request sent the states entire the union national guard contingent some 8 000 defeated troops to homestead.
production resumed with strikebreakers now protected by troops.
public opinion turned against the strikers when a radical made an attempt to assassinate frick.
slowly workers drifted back to their jobs and finally four months after the strike began the amalgamated surrendered.
by 1900 every major steel plant in the northeast had broken with the amalgamated which now had no power to resist.
its membership shrank from a high of 24 000 in 1891 two thirds of all eligible steelworkers to fewer than 7 000 a decade later.
its decline was symbolic of the general erosion of union strength in the late nineteenth century as factory labor became increasingly unskilled and workers thus became easier to replace.
the afl unions were often powerless in the face of these changes.
the pullman strike a dispute of greater magnitude and equal bitterness if less violence was the pullman strike in 1894.
the pullman palace car company manufactured sleeping and parlor cars for railroads which it built and repaired at a plant near chicago.
the company built a 600 acre town named pullman and rented its trim orderly houses to the employees.
george m pullman owner of the company considered the town a model solution to the industrial problem he referred to the workers as his children but many residents chafed at the regimentation and the high rents.
in the winter of 1893 1894 the pullman company slashed wages by about 25 percent citing the declining revenues the depression that began in 1983 was causing.
at the same time pullman refused to reduce rents in its model town which were 20 to 25 percent higher than rents for comparable accommodations in surrounding areas.
workers went on strike eugene debs and persuaded the militant american railway union led by eugene v debs to support them by refusing to handle pullman cars and equipment.
opposing the strikers was the general managers association a consortium of twenty four chicago railroads.
it persuaded its member companies to discharge switchmen who refused to handle pullman cars.
every time this happened debss union instructed its members who worked for the offending companies to walk off their jobs.
within a few days thousands of railroad workers in twenty seven states and territories were on strike and transportation from chicago to the pacific coast was paralyzed.
most state governors responded readily to appeals from strike threatened businesses but the governor of illinois john peter altgeld was a man with demonstrated sympathies for workers and their grievances.
altgeld had criticized the trials of the haymarket anarchists and had pardoned the convicted the pullman strike these two images portray two aspects of the great pullman strike of 1894.
the photograph above shows u s troops ordered to chicago to quell the strike camping on the lakefront.
the drawing below shows freight cars and an engine destroyed by striking workers.
these images were published together in harper s weekly to illustrate the ferocity of the pullman battle.
the library of congress lc usz62 96506 men who were still in prison when he took office.
he refused to call out the militia to protect employers now.
bypassing altgeld railroad operators asked the federal government to send regular army troops to illinois on the pretext that the strike was preventing the movement of mail on the trains.
president grover cleveland and attorney general richard olney a former railroad lawyer and a bitter foe of unions complied.
in july 1894 over altgelds objections the president ordered 2 000 troops to the chicago area.
a federal court issued an injunction forbidding the union to continue the strike.
industrial supremacy 483 when debs and his associates defied it they were arrested and imprisoned.
with federal troops protecting the hiring of new workers and with the union leaders in a federal jail the strike quickly collapsed.
sources of labor weakness the last decades of the nineteenth century were years in which labor despite its organizing efforts made few real gains and suffered many important losses.
in a rapidly expanding industrial economy wages for workers rose hardly at all and not nearly enough to keep up with the rising cost of living.
labor leaders won a few legislative victories the abolition by congress in 1885 of the contract labor law the establishment by congress in 1868 of an eight hour day on public works projects and in 1892 of an eight hour day for government employees state laws governing hours of labor and safety standards and gradually some guaranteed compensation for workers injured on the job.
but many of these laws were not enforced and neither strikes nor protests seemed to have much effect.
the end of the century found most workers with less political power and considerably less control of the workplace than they had had forty years before.
workers failed to make greater gains for many reasons.
the principal labor organizations represented only a small percentage of the industrial workforce.
four percent of all workers fewer than 1 million belonged to unions in 1900.
the afl the most important excluded unskilled workers who were emerging as the core of the industrial workforce and along with them most women blacks and recent immigrants.
women responded to this exclusion in 1903 by forming their own organization the womens trade union league wtul.
but after several frustrating years of attempting to unionize women the wtul turned the bulk of its attention to securing protective legislation for women workers not general organization and mobilization of labor.
other divisions within the workforce contributed further to union weakness.
tensions between different ethnic and racial groups kept laborers divided.
another source of labor weakness was the shifting nature of the workforce.
many immigrant workers came to america intending to remain only briefly to earn some money and return home.
the assumption that they had no long range fu shifting ture in the country even though it was nature of the often a mistaken one eroded their willing workforce ness to organize.
other workers natives and immigrants alike were in constant motion moving from one job to another one town to another seldom in one place long enough to establish institutional ties or exert real power.
a study of newburyport massachusetts over a thirty year period shows that 90 percent of the workers there vanished from the town records in those years many of them because they moved elsewhere.
even workers who stayed put often did not remain in the same job for long.
some real social mobility did exist.
workers might move from unskilled to semiskilled or skilled jobs during their lifetimes their children might become foremen or managers.
the gains were small but they were enough to inspire considerable and often unrealistic hopes and to persuade some workers that they were not part of a permanent working class.
above all workers made few gains in the late nineteenth century because of the strength of the forces arrayed against corporate them.
they faced corporate organizations strength f vast wealth and power which were generally determined to crush any efforts by workers to challenge their prerogatives not just through brute force but also through infiltration of unions espionage within working class communities and sabotage of organizational efforts.
and as the homestead and pullman strikes suggest the corporations usually had the support of local state and federal authorities who were willing to send in troops to preserve order and crush labor uprisings on demand.
despite the creation of new labor unions despite a wave of strikes and protests that in the 1880s and 1890s reached startling proportions workers in the late nineteenth century failed to create successful organizations or to protect their interests in the way the large corporations managed to do.
in the battle for power within the emerging industrial economy almost all the advantages seemed to lie with capital.
looking back in the four decades following the end of the civil war the united states propelled itself into the forefront of the industrializing nations of the world.
large areas of the nation remained overwhelmingly rural to be sure and the majority of the population was still engaged in activities closely tied to farming.
even so americas economy and along with it the nations society and culture were being profoundly transformed.
new technologies new forms of corporate management and new supplies of labor helped make possible the rapid growth of the nations industries and the construction of its railroads.
the factory system contributed to the growth of the nations cities and at times created entirely new ones.
immigration provided a steady supply of new workers for the growing industrial economy.
the result was a steady and substantial increase in national wealth rising living standards for much of the population and the creation of great new fortunes.
but industrialization did not spread its fruits evenly.
large areas of the country most notably the south profited relatively little from economic growth as did large groups in the population most notably minorities women and recent immigrants.
industrial workers experienced arduous labor conditions and wages that rose much more slowly than the profits key terms people places events recall and reflect of the corporations for which they worked.
small merchants and manufacturers found themselves overmatched by great new combinations.
industrialists strove to create a rationale for their power and to persuade the public that everyone had something to gain from it.
but many americans remained skeptical of modern capitalism and some workers struggling to form unions american federation of labor 480 andrew carnegie 464 edward bellamy 473 eugene v debs 482 frederick winslow taylor 462 gospel of wealth 471 haymarket bombing 481 henry clay frick 481 henry ford 461 henry george 472 homestead strike 481 horatio alger 472 horizontal integration 466 john d rockefeller 466 john peter altgeld 482 j p morgan 464 knights of labor 480 molly maguires 479 1 who were some of the business and industrial titans of the late nineteenth century and what did they contribute to americas industrial growth.

what were some of the problems that resulted from rapid urbanization and how did urban governments respond to these problems.
how did the sources of immigration to america shift in the late nineteenth century and what was the native response to the change.
how did the rise of mass consumption affect leisure and entertainment.
setting the stage the industrialization and commercialization of america changed the face of society in countless ways.
nowhere were those changes more profound than in the growth of cities and the creation of an urban society and culture.
having begun its life as a primarily agrarian republic the united states in the late nineteenth century was becoming an urban nation.
the change did not come easily.
cities grew so rapidly that their facilities and institutions could not keep pace.
housing transportation sewers social services governments al lagged far behind the enormous demands the new urban population was placing on them.
the enormous diversity of many urban populations required cities to assimilate different and sometimes clashing population groups a challenge that has continued to face the nation into the present.
but despite their many problems cities continued to grow in both size and influence.
people flocked to them to take advantage of the economic and educational opportunities they offered to escape what many considered the boredom of rural life and to experience the new forms of entertainment that cities were helping to advance.
as centers of wealth cities also became the sites of great civic projects that have defined the identity of many urban centers ever since.
cities across the united states and around much of the world set out in these years to build public parks museums theaters opera houses monumental railroad stations imposing libraries and great boulevards.
the city of a century ago like the city of today symbolized many of the greatest achievements and desires of modern society and also many of its greatest fears.
the urbanization of america the great migration from the countryside to the city was not unique to the united states.
it was occurring simultaneously throughout much of the western world in response to industrialization and the factory system.
america a society with little experience of great cities found urbanization both jarring and alluring.
rapid urban growth the lure of the city we cannot all live in cities the journalist horace greeley wrote shortly after the civil war yet nearly all seem determined to do so the urban population of america increased sevenfold in the half century after the civil war.
and in 1920 the census revealed that for the first time a majority of the american people lived in urban areas communities of 2 500 people or more.
new york city and its environs grew from 1 million in 1860 to over 3 million in 1900.
chicago had 100 000 residents in 1860 and more than a million in 1900.
cities were experiencing similar growth in all areas of the country.
natural increase accounted for only a small part of the urban growth.
in fact urban families experienced a high rate of infant mortality a declining fertility rate and a high death rate from disease.
without immigration cities would have grown slowly if at all.
the city attracted people from the countryside because it offered conveniences entertainments and cultural experiences unavailable in rural communities.
cities gave women the opportunity to act in ways that in smaller communities would have been seen to violate propriety they gave gay men and lesbian women space in which to build a culture even if still a mostly hidden one and experiment sex ually at least partly insulated from the hostile gaze of others.
but most of all cities attracted people because they offered more and better paying jobs than were available in rural america or in the foreign economies many immigrants were fleeing.
people moved to cities too because new forms of transportation made it easier for them to get there.
railroads made simple quick and inexpensive what once was a daunting journey from parts 487 488.
chapter 15 a monument to the lost cause this monument in the town square of monroe georgia was typical of many such memorials erected all across the south after the civil war.
they served both to commemorate the confederate dead and to remind white southerners of what was by the 1870s already widely known and romanticized as the lost cause lee snider photo images corbis could advance successfully in american society.
but whatever their particular demands virtually all former slaves were united in their desire for independence from white control.
freed from slavery blacks throughout the south began almost immediately to create autonomous african american communities.
they pulled out of white controlled churches and established their own.
they created fraternal benevolent and mutual aid societies.
when they could they began their own schools.
for most white southerners freedom meant something very different.
it meant the ability to control their own destinies without interference from the north or the federal government.
and in the immediate aftermath of the war they attempted to exercise this version of freedom by trying to restore their society to its antebellum form.
slavery had been abolished in the former confederacy by the emancipation proclamation and everywhere else as of december 1865 by a freedmens bureau school african american students and teachers stand outside a school for former slaves one of many run by the freedmens bureau throughout the defeated confederacy in the first years after the war.
corbis the thirteenth amendment.
but many white planters continued a kind of slavery in an altered form by keeping black workers legally tied to the plantations.
when many white southerners fought for what they considered freedom they were fighting above all to preserve local and regional autonomy and white supremacy.
the federal government kept troops in the south after the war to preserve order and protect the freedmen.
in march 1865 congress established the freedmens bureau an agency of the army directed by general oliver o howard.
the freedmens bureau distributed food to millions of former slaves.
it established schools staffed by missionaries and teachers who had been sent to the south by freedmens aid societies and other private and church groups in the north.
it made modest efforts to settle blacks on lands of their own.
the bureau also offered considerable assistance to poor whites many of whom were similarly destitute and homeless after the war.
but the freedmens bureau was not a permanent solution.
it had authority to operate for only one year and in any case it was far too small to deal effectively with the enormous problems facing southern society.
by the time the war ended other proposals for reconstructing the defeated south were emerging.
the freedmens bureau issues of reconstruction reconstruction was determined not just by social realities or ideals.
it was also determined by partisan politics.
the terms by which the southern states rejoined the union had important implications for both major political parties.
the republican victories in 1860 and 1864 had been a result in large part of the division of the democratic party and later the removal of the south from the electorate.
readmitting the south leaders of both parties believed would reunite the democrats and weaken the republicans.
in addition the republican party had taken advantage of the souths absence from congress to pass a program of nationalistic economic legislation railroad subsidies protective tariffs banking and currency reforms and other measures to benefit northern business leaders and industrialists.
should the democratic reconstruction and the new south 403 party regain power with heavy southern support these programs would be in jeopardy.
complicating these practical questions were emotional concerns.
many northerners believed the south should be punished in some way for the suffering and sacrifice its rebellion had caused.
many northerners believed too that the south should be transformed made over in the norths urbanized image its supposedly backward feudal undemocratic society civilized and modernized.
even among the republicans in congress there was considerable disagreement about the proper approach to reconstruction disagreement that reflected the same fac conservative tional divisions that had created disputes and radical over emancipation during the war.
republicans conservatives insisted that the south accept the abolition of slavery but proposed few other conditions for the readmission of the seceded states.
the radicals led by representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania and senator charles sumner of massachusetts urged that the civil and military leaders of the confederacy be punished that large numbers of southern whites be disenfranchised that the legal rights of former slaves be protected and that the property of wealthy white southerners who had aided the confederacy be confiscated and distributed among the freedmen.
some radicals favored granting suffrage to the former slaves.
others hesitated since few northern states permitted blacks to vote.
between the radicals and the conservatives stood a faction of uncommitted republicans the moderates who rejected the punitive goals of the radicals but supported extracting at least some concessions from the south on african american rights.
plans for reconstruction president lincolns sympathies lay with the moderates and conservatives of his party.
he believed that a lenient reconstruction policy would encourage southern unionists and other former whigs to join the republican party and would thus prevent the readmission of the south from strengthening the democrats.
more immediately the southern unionists could become the nucleus of new loyal state governments in the south.
lincoln was not uninterested in the fate of the freedmen but he was willing to defer questions about their future for the sake of rapid reunification.
lincolns reconstruction plan which he announced in december 1863 offered a general amnesty to white southerners other than high officials of the confederacy who would pledge loyalty to the gov lincolns 10 ernment and accept the elimination of ptan slavery.
whenever 10 percent of the number of voters in i860 took the ath in any state those loyal voters could set up a state government.
lincoln also hoped to extend su rage to african americans who were educated owned prope y wade davis bill and had served in the union army.
three southern states louisiana arkansas and tennessee all under union occupation reestablished loyal governments under the lincoln formula in 1864.
the radical republicans were astonished at the mildness of lincolns program.
they persuaded congress to deny seats to representatives from the three reconstructed states and refused to count the electoral vote of those states in the election of 1864.
but for the moment the radicals were uncertain about what form their own reconstruction plan should take.
their first effort to resolve that question was the wade davis bill passed by congress in july 1864.
it authorized the president to appoint a provisional governor for each conquered state.
when a majority not lincolns 10 percent of the white males of the state pledged their allegiance to the union the governor could summon a state constitutional convention whose delegates were to be elected by those who would swear through the so called ironclad oath that they had never borne arms against the united states another departure from lincolns plan.
the new state constitutions would have to abolish slavery disenfranchise confederate civil and military leaders and repudiate debts accumulated by the state governments during the war.
after a state had met these conditions congress would readmit it to the union.
like the presidents proposal the wade davis bill left up to the states the question of political rights for blacks.
congress passed the bill a few days before it adjourned in 1864 and lincoln disposed of it with a pocket veto.
his action enraged the radical leaders and the pragmatic lincoln became convinced he would have to accept at least some of the radical demands.
he began to move toward a new approach to reconstruction.
the death of lincoln what plan lincoln might have produced no one can say.
on the night of april 14 1865 the president and his wife attended a play at fords theater in washington.
as they sat in the presidential box john wilkes booth a member of a distinguished family of actors and a zealous advocate of the southern cause entered the box from the rear and shot lincoln in the head.
the president was carried unconscious to a house across the street where early the next morning surrounded by family friends and political associates among them a tearful charles sumner he died.
the circumstances of lincolns death earned him immediate martyrdom.
it also produced something close to hysteria throughout the north.
there were accusations that booth had acted as part of a great conspiracy accusations that contained some truth.
booth did indeed have associates one of whom stabbed and wounded secretary of state seward the night of the assassination another of whom abandoned at the last moment a plan to murder vice president johnson.
booth himself escaped on horseback into the virginia countryside where on april 26 he was cornered by union troops and shot to abraham lincoln this haunting photograph of abraham lincoln showing clearly the weariness and aging that four years as a war president had created was taken in washington only four days before his assassination in 1865.
the library of congress death in a blazing bam.
a military tribunal convicted eight other people of participating in the conspiracy at least two of them on the basis of virtually no evidence.
four were hanged.
to many northerners however the murder of the president seemed evidence of an even greater conspiracy one masterminded and directed by the unrepentant leaders of the defeated south.
militant republicans exploited such suspicions relentlessly for months ensuring that lincolns death would help doom his plans for a relatively easy peace.
johnson and restoration leadership of the moderates and conservatives fell to lincolns successor andrew johnson who was not well suited by either circumstance or personality for the task.
a democrat until he had joined the union ticket with lincoln in 1864 he became andrew a repu ican president at a moment when johnsons partisan passions were growing.
johnson personality himself was an intemperate and tactless man filled with resentments and insecurities.
he was also openly hostile to the freed slaves and unwilling to support any plans that guaranteed them civil equality or enfranchisement.
he once declared white men alone must manage the south johnson revealed his plan for reconstruction or restoration as he preferred to call it soon after he took office and he implemented it during the summer of 1865 when congress was in recess.
like lincoln he offered amnesty to those southerners who would take an oath of allegiance.
high ranking confederate officials and any white southerner with land worth 20 000 or more would have to apply to the president for individual pardons.
johnson a self made man apparently liked the thought of the great planter aristocrats humbling themselves before him.
in most other respects however his plan resembled that of the wade davis bill.
for each state the president appointed a provisional governor who was to invite qualified voters to elect delegates to a constitutional convention.
johnson did not specify how many qualified voters were necessary but he implied that he would require a majority as had the wade davis bill.
in order to win readmission to congress a state had to revoke its ordinance of secession abolish slavery ratify the thirteenth amendment and repudiate the confederate and state war debts.
the final procedure before restoration was for a state to elect a state government and send representatives to congress.
whereas johnson helped white southerners to return to their land he did little in support of the former slaves.
although freedmen had been given their liberty holding on to it proved difficult.
many freedmen who returned to work for white planters found themselves almost like slaves again.
johnson offered no help.
are not our rights as a free people and good citizens of the united states to be considered asked a petition against the president.
it was a long time before freedmen truly found liberty.
by the end of 1865 all the seceded states had formed new governments some under lincolns plan some under johnsons and were prepared to rejoin the union as soon as northern congress recognized them.
but radical attitudes republicans vowed not to recognize the harden johnson governments just as they had previously refused to recognize the lincoln regimes for by now northern opinion had hardened and become more hostile toward the south than it had been a year earlier when congress passed the wade davis bill.
many northerners were disturbed by the apparent reluctance of some delegates to the southern conventions to abolish slavery and by the refusal of all the conventions to grant suffrage to any blacks.
they were astounded that states claiming to be loyal should elect prominent leaders of the recent confederacy as state officials and representatives to congress.
particularly hard to accept was georgias choice of alexander h stephens former confederate vice president as a united states senator.
radical reconstruction reconstruction under johnsons plan often known as presf dential reconstruction continued only until congress reconvened in december 1865.
at that point congress refused to seat the representatives of the restored states and created a reconstruction and the new south 405 new joint committee on reconstruction to frame a reconstruction policy of its own.
the period of congressional or radical reconstruction had begun.
the black codes meanwhile events in the south were driving northern opinion in more radical directions.
throughout the south in 1865 and early 1866 state legislatures were enacting sets of laws known as the black codes designed to give whites substantial control over former slaves.
the codes authorized local officials to apprehend unemployed african americans fine them for vagrancy and hire them out to private employers to satisfy the fine.
some of the codes forbade blacks to own or lease farms or to take any jobs other than as plantation workers or domestic servants.
congress first responded to the black codes by passing an act extending the life of the freedmens bureau and widening its powers so that it could nullify work agreements forced on freedmen under the black codes.
then in johnson s.
l q vetoes april 1866 congress passed the first civil rights act which declared african americans to be citizens of the united states and gave the federal government power to intervene in state affairs to protect the rights of citizens.
johnson vetoed both bills but congress overrode him on each of them.
the fourteenth amendment in april 1866 the joint committee on reconstruction proposed a new amendment to the constitution which congress approved in early summer and sent to the states for ratification.
eventually it became one of the most important provisions in the constitution.
the fourteenth amendment offered the first constitutional definition of american citizenship everyone born in the united states and everyone naturalized was automatically a citizen and entitled to all the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the constitution including equal protection of the laws by c both the state and national governments.
forbwcis there c0uld be n ther recluirements fr example being white for citizenship.
the amendment also imposed penalties reduction of representation in congress and in the electoral college on states that denied suffrage to any adult male inhabitants.
the wording reflected the prevailing view in congress and elsewhere that the fran chise was properly restricted to men.
finally it prohibited for mer members of congress or other former federal officials who had aided the confederacy from holding any state or federal o fice unless two thirds of congress voted to pardon them.
congressional radicals offered to readmit to the union any state whose legislature ratified the fourteenth amendment.
only tennessee did so.
all the other former confederate states along with delaware and kentucky refused leaving t e amendment temporarily without the necessary approva three fourths of the states.
fourteenth amendment among its provisions the fourteenth amendment provided the first constitutional definition of u s citizenship.
everyone born in the united states and everyone naturalized was automatically a citizen and entitled to all the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the constitution including equal protection of the laws by both the state and national governments.
this amendment also imposed penalties on states that did not extend the right to vote to all male citizens including african american men.
african american women like all women had to wait until 1920 and the ratification of the nineteenth amendment before legally entitled to vote.
north wind picture archives alamy but by now the radicals were growing more confident and determined.
bloody race riots in new orleans and other southern cities riots in which african americans were the principal victims were among the events that strengthened their hand.
in the 1866 congressional elections johnson actively campaigned for conservative candidates but he did his own cause more harm than good with his intemperate speeches.
the voters returned an overwhelming majority of republicans most of them radicals to congress.
in the senate there were now 42 republicans to 11 democrats in the house 143 republicans to 49 democrats.
the south remained largely unrepresented in both chambers.
congressional republicans were now strong enough to enact a plan of their own even over the presidents objections.
the congressional plan the radicals passed three reconstruction bills early in 1867 and overrode johnsons vetoes of all of them.
these bills 406 chapter 15 i ii three reconstruction bills i i finally established nearly two years after the end of the war a coherent plan for reconstruction.
under the congressional plan tennessee which had ratified the fourteenth amendment was promptly readmitted.
but congress rejected the lincoln johnson governments of the other ten confederate states and instead combined those states into five military districts.
a military commander governed each district and had orders to register qualified voters defined as all adult black males and those white males who had not participated in the rebellion.
once registered voters would elect conventions to prepare new state constitutions which had to include provisions for black suffrage.
once voters ratified the new constitutions they could elect state governments.
congress had to approve a state s constitution and the state legislature had to ratify the fourteenth amendment.
once that happened and once enough states ratified the amendment to make it part of the constitution then the former confederate states could be restored to the union.
by 1868 seven of the ten former confederate states arkansas north carolina south carolina louisiana alabama georgia and florida had fulfilled these conditions including ratification of the fourteenth amendment which now became part of the constitution.
they were readmitted to the union.
conservative whites held up the return of virginia and texas until 1869 and mississippi until 1870.
by then congress had added one more fifteenth requirement for readmission ratification of amendment another constitutional amendment the fifteenth which forbade the states and the federal government to deny suffrage to any citizen on account of race color or previous condition of servitude to stop the president from interfering with their plans the congressional radicals passed two remarkable laws of dubious constitutionality in 1867.
one the tenure of office act forbade the president to remove civil officials including members of his own cabinet without the consent of the senate.
the principal purpose of the law was to protect the job of secretary of war edwin m stanton who was cooperating with the radicals.
the other law the command of the army act prohibited the president from issuing military orders except through the commanding general of the army general grant who could not be relieved or assigned elsewhere without the consent of the senate.

reconstruction and the new south 407 the congressional radicals also took action to stop the supreme court from interfering with their plans.
in 1866 the court had declared in the case of ex parte milligan that military tribunals were unconstitutional in places where civil courts were functioning a decision that seemed to threaten the system of military government the radicals were planning for the south.
radicals in congress immediately proposed several bills that would require two thirds of the justices to support any decision overruling a law of congress would deny the court jurisdiction in reconstruction cases would reduce its membership to three and would even abolish it.
the justices apparently took notice.
over the next two years the court refused to accept jurisdiction in any cases involving reconstruction and the congressional bills concerning the court never passed.
the impeachment of the president president johnson had long since ceased to be a serious obstacle to the passage of radical legislation but he was still the official charged with administering the reconstruction programs.
as such the radicals believed he remained a serious impediment to their plans.
early in 1867 they began looking for a way to impeach him and remove him from office.
republicans found grounds for impeachment they believed when johnson dismissed secretary of war stanton despite congresss refusal to agree thus deliberately violating t the tenure of office act in hopes of test office act big aw before the courts.
elated radicals in the house quickly impeached the president and sent the case to the senate for trial.
by that time the radicals were determined to impeach president johnson.
who does not know said benjamin butler an opponent of johnson that from the hour johnson began these his usurpations of power he everywhere denounced congress the legality and constitutionality of its action and defied its legitimate power the trial before the senate lasted throughout april and may 1868.
the radicals put heavy pressure on all the republican senators but the moderates who were losing kith in the radical program vacillated.
on the first johnson three charges to come to a vote seven acquitted republicans joined the democrats and independents to support acquittal.
the vote was 35 to 19 one short of the constitutionally required two thirds majority.
after that the radicals dropped the impeachment effort.
the south in reconstruction when white southerners spoke bitterly in later years of the effects of reconstruction they referred most frequently to the governments congress helped impose on them governments they claimed were both incompetent and corrupt that saddled the region with enormous debts and that trampled on the rights of citizens.
when black southerners and their defenders condemned reconstruction in contrast they spoke of the failure of the national and state governments to go far enough to guarantee freedmen even the most elemental rights of citizenship a failure that resulted in a harsh new system of economic subordination.
see debating the past pp.
the reconstruction governments in the ten states of the south that were reorganized under the congressional plan approximately one fourth of the white males were at first excluded from voting or holding office.
that produced black majorities among voters in south carolina mississippi and louisiana states where blacks were also a majority of the population and in alabama and florida where they were not.
but the government soon lifted most suffrage restrictions so that nearly all white males could vote.
after that republicans maintained control only with the support of many southern whites.
critics called these southern white republicans scalawags many were former whigs who had never felt comfortable the burdened south this reconstruction era cartoon expresses the south s sense of its oppression at the hands of northern republicans.
president grant whose hat bears abraham lincoln s initials rides in comfort in a giant carpetbag guarded by bayonet wielding soldiers as the south staggers under the burden in chains.
more evidence of destruction and military occupation is visible in the background.
the granger collection new york 408 chapter 15 in the democratic party some of them wealthy or once wealthy planters or businessmen interested in the economic scalawags development of the region.
others were farmers who lived in remote areas where there had been little or no slavery and who hoped the republican program of internal improvements would help end their economic isolation.
despite their diverse social positions scalawags shared a belief that the republican party would serve their economic interests better than the democrats.
white men from the north also served as republican lead ers in the south.
critics of reconstruction referred to them carpetbaggers pejoratively as carpetbaggers which conveyed an image of penniless adventurers who arrived with all their possessions in a carpetbag a common kind of cheap suitcase covered with carpeting material.
in fact most of the so called carpetbaggers were well educated people of middle class origin many of them doctors lawyers and teachers.
most were veterans of the union army who looked on the south as a new frontier more promising than the west.
they had settled there at wars end as hopeful planters or as business and professional people.
but the most numerous republicans in the south were the black freedmen most of whom had no previous experi freedmen ence in politics and who tried there fore to build institutions through which they could learn to exercise their power.
in several states african american voters held their own conventions to chart their future course.
one such colored convention as southern whites called them assembled in alabama in 1867 and announced we claim exactly the same rights privileges and immunities as are enjoyed by white men we new orleans riot on july 30 1866 a violent conflict took place outside the mechanics institute in new orleans.
whites attacked blacks parading outside the building whe a reconvened louisiana constitutional convention was being held.
the state s radical republicans had called for the convention because they were angered by the legislatures enactment of the black codes that restricted the rights of african americans to travel and wc an estimated thirty eight people were killed and forty six wounded most of them african american.
the granger collection new york ask nothing more and will be content with nothing else the black churches that freedmen created after emancipation also helped give unity and political self confidence to the former slaves.
african americans played a significant role in the politics of the reconstruction south.
they served as delegates to the constitutional conventions.
they held public offices of practically every kind.
between 1869 and 1901 twenty african americans served in the u s house of representatives two in the senate hiram revels of mississippi and blanche k bruce of mississippi.
african americans served too in state legislatures and in various other state offices.
southern whites complained loudly both at the time and for generations to come about negro rule during reconstruction but no such thing ever actually existed in any of the states.
no black man was ever elected governor of a southern state although lieutenant governor p b s pinchback briefly performed gubernatorial duties in louisiana.
african americans never controlled any of the state legislatures although they held a majority in the lower house in south carolina for a short time.
in the south as a whole the percentage of black officeholders was always far lower than the percentage of blacks in the population.
the record of the reconstruction governments is mixed.
critics at the time and since denounced them for corruption and financial extravagance and there is some truth to both charges.
officeholders in many states enriched themselves through graft and other illicit activities.
state budgets expanded to hitherto unknown totals and state debts soared to previously undreamed of heights.
in south carolina for example the public debt increased from 7 million to 29 million in eight years.
but the corruption in the south real as it was was hardly unique to the reconstruction governments.
corruption was at least as rampant in the northern states.
and in both north and south it was a result of the same thing a rapid economic expansion of government services and revenues that put new strains on and new temptations before elected officials everywhere.
the end of reconstruction did not end corruption in southern state governments.
in many states in fact corruption increased.
and the state expenditures of the reconstruction years were huge only in comparison with the meager budgets of the antebellum era.
they represented an effort to provide the south with urgently needed services that antebellum governments had never offered public education public works programs relief for the poor and other costly new commitments.
there were to be sure graft and extravagance in reconstruction governments there were also positive and permanent accomplishments.
education perhaps the most important of those accomplishments was a dramatic improvement in the education of african americans and white southerners with scant learning.
in the first years of reconstruction much of the impetus for educational reform in j reconstruction and the new south 409 the south came from outside groupsfrom the freedmens bureau from northern private philanthropic organizations from many northern women black and white who traveled to the south to teach in freedmens schools and from black southerners themselves.
over the opposition of many southern whites who feared that education would give african americans false notions of equality these reformers established a large network of schools for former slaves 4 000 schools by 1870 staffed by 9 000 teachers half of them black teaching 200 000 students about 12 percent of the total school age population of the freedmen.
in the 1870s reconstruction governments also began to build a comprehensive public school system in the south.
by 1876 more than half of all white children and about 40 percent of all black children were attending schools in the south.
several black academies offering more advanced education also began operating.
gradually these academies grew into an important network of black colleges and universities which included such distinguished schools as fisk and atlanta universities and morehouse college.
already however southern education was becoming divided into two separate systems one black and one white.
segregated early efforts to integrate the schools of the schools region were a dismal failure.
the freedmens bureau schools for example were open to students of all races but almost no whites attended them.
new orleans set up an integrated school system under the reconstruction government again whites almost universally stayed away.
the one federal effort to mandate school integration the civil rights act of 1875 had its provisions for educational desegregation removed before it was passed.
as soon as the republican governments of reconstruction were replaced the new southern democratic regimes quickly aban doned all efforts to promote integration.
landownership and tenancy the most ambitious goal of the freedmens bureau and of some radical republicans in congress was to make reconstruction the vehicle for a fundamental reform of the southern pl antation before and after emancipation this map shows the distribution of lands and dwellings on the barrow plantation in oglethorpe county xl of the civil war.
the map on the lef shows the plantation in 861 as the war z het barrow plantation was highly centralized before the war with all slaves living together in a complex of dwellings near the masters ouse.
weri y ye p 9 independently.
escape was very differently divided.
housing was now widely dispersed as former slaves became tenants or sharecroppers and began working their own small pieces and g p churches had sprung up away from the landowners house as well.
why did former slaves move so quickly to relocate their homes and churches away from their former masters.
410 chapter 15 landownership in the south.
the effort failed.
in the last years of the war and the first years of reconstruction the freedmen s bureau did oversee the redistribution of substantial amounts of land to freedmen in a few areas notably the sea islands of south carolina and georgia and areas of mississippi that had failure of land once belonsed t0 the famlly f redistribution jefferson davis.
by june 1865 the bureau had settled nearly 10 000 black families on their own land most of it drawn from abandoned plantations arousing dreams among former slaves throughout the south of forty acres and a mule by the end of that year however the experiment was already collapsing.
southern plantation owners were returning and demanding the restoration of their property and president johnson was supporting their demands.
despite the resistance of the freedmens bureau the government eventually returned most of the confiscated land to the original white owners.
very few northern republicans believed that the federal government had the right to confiscate property.
even so distribution of landownership in the south changed considerably in the postwar years.
among whites there was a significant decline in landownership from 80 percent before the war to 67 percent by the end of reconstruction.
some whites lost their land because of unpaid debt or increased taxes some left the marginal lands they had owned to move to more fertile areas where they rented.
during the same period the number of african americans who owned land rose from virtually none to more than 20 percent.
many black landowners acquired their property through hard work or luck or both.
but some relied unwisely on assistance from white dominated financial or philanthropic institutions.
one of them was the freedman s bank established in 1865 by antislavery whites in an effort to promote landownership among african americans.
they persuaded thousands of freedmen to deposit their modest savings in the bank but then invested heavily in unsuccessful enterprises.
it was ill prepared therefore for the national depression of the 1870s and it failed in 1874.
still most blacks and a growing minority of whites did not own their own land during reconstruction and some who acquired land in the 1860s had lost it by the 1890s.
these sharecropping people worked for others in one form or another.
many african american agricultural laborers perhaps 25 percent of the total simply worked for wages.
most however became tenants of white landowners working their own plots of land and paying their landlords either a fixed rent or a share of their crop see p 420.
the new system was a repudiation of former slaves of the gang labor system of the antebellum plantation in which slaves had lived and worked together under the direction of a master.
as tenants and sharecroppers african americans enjoyed at least a physical independence from their landlords and had the sense of working their own land even if in most cases they could never hope to buy it.
but tenantry also benefited landlords in some ways relieving them of any responsibility for the physical well being of their workers.
the crop lien system in some respects the postwar years were a period of remarkable economic progress for african americans.
if the material benefits they had received under slavery are calculated as income then prewar blacks had earned about a 22 percent share of the profits of the plantation system.
by the end of reconstruction they were earning 56 percent.
measured another way the per capita income of southern blacks rose 46 percent between 1857 and 1879 while the per capita income of southern whites declined 35 percent.
this represented one of the most significant redistributions of income in american history.
but these figures are somewhat misleading.
while the black share of profits was increasing the total profits of southern agriculture were declining a result of the dislocations sharecroppers 1879 this painting by winslow homer 1836 1910 depicts ecroppers picking cotton.
in sharecropping a landowner permits tenants to use the land in exchange for a share of the crops produced.
the granger collection new york reconstruction and the new south 411 of the war and a reduction in the world market for cotton.
in addition while african americans were earning a greater return on each hour of labor than they had under slavery they were working fewer hours.
women and children were less likely to labor in the fields than in the past.
adult men tended to work shorter days.
in all the black labor force worked about one third fewer hours during reconstruction than slaves had been compelled to work under slavery a reduction that brought the working schedule of blacks roughly into line with that of white farm laborers.
nor did the income redistribution of the postwar years lift many african americans out of poverty.
black per capita income rose from about one quarter of white per capita income to about one half in the first few years after the war.
and after this initial increase it rose hardly at all.
for blacks and poor whites alike whatever gains there might have been as a result of land and income redistribution were often overshadowed by the ravages of the crop lien system.
few of the traditional institutions of credit in the south the factors and banks returned after the war.
in their stead new system emerged a new system of credit centered of credit ir lare part n local country stores some of them owned by planters others by independent merchants.
blacks and whites landowners and tenants all depended on these stores for such necessities as food clothing seed and farm implements.
and since farmers did not have the same steady cash flow as other workers customers usually had to rely on credit from these merchants in order to purchase what they needed.
most local stores had no competition and went to great lengt hs to ensure that things stayed that way.
as a result they were able to set interest rates as high as 50 or 60 percent.
farmers had to give the merchants a lien or claim on their crops as collateral for the loans thus the term crop lien system.
farmers who suffered a few bad years in a row as often happened could become trapped in a cycle of debt from which they could never escape.
wash day on the plantation one of the most common occupations of women recently emancipated from slavery was taking in laundry from white families who no longer had slaves household servants.
this photograph of a group of african american women illustrates how arduous a task laundry was.
the l brary o ongress 412 chapter 15 this burdensome credit system had a number of effects on the region almost all of them unhealthy.
one effect was that some former slaves who had acquired land during the early years of reconstruction gradually lost it as they fell into debt.
so to a lesser extent did white small landowners.
another effect was that southern farmers became almost wholly dependent on cash crops and most of all on cotton because only such marketable commodities seemed to offer any possibility of escape from debt.
thus southern agriculture never sufficiently diversified even in the best of times became more one dimensional than ever.
the relentless planting of cotton moreover was contributing to an exhaustion of the soil.
the crop lien system in other words was not only helping to impoverish small farmers it was also contributing to a general decline in the southern agricultural economy.
the african american family in freedom one of the most striking features of the black response to reconstruction was the effort to build or rebuild family structures and to protect them from the interference they had experienced under slavery.
a major reason for the rapid departure of so many emancipated slaves from plantations was the desire to find lost relatives and reunite families.
thousands of african americans wandered through the south often over vast distances looking for husbands wives children or other relatives from whom they had been separated.
in the few black newspapers that circulated in the south there were many advertisements by people searching for information about their relatives.
former slaves rushed to have marriages previously without legal standing sanctified by church and law.
black families resisted living in the former slave quarters and moved instead to small cabins scattered widely across the countryside where they could enjoy at least some privacy.
within the black family the definition of male and female roles quickly came to resemble that within white families.
many women and children ceased working in the fields.
such work they believed was a badge of slavery.
instead many women restricted themselves largely to domestic tasks cooking cleaning gardening sewing raising children attending to the needs of their husbands.
some black husbands refused to allow their wives to work as servants in white homes.
when i married my wife i married her to wait on me one freedman told a former master who was attempting to hire his wife as a servant.
she got all she can do right here for me and the children still middle class notions of domesticity were often difficult to sustain in the impoverished circumstances of most changing former slaves.
economic necessity required gender roles many black women to engage in income producing activities including activities that they and their husbands resisted working as domestic servants taking in laundry or helping in the field.
by the end of reconstruction half of all black women over the age of sixteen were working for wages.
and unlike white working women most black female income earners were married.
the grant administration exhausted by the political turmoil of the johnson administration american voters in 1868 yearned for a strong stable figure to they turned trustingly to general ulysses s grant the hero of the war and by 1868 a revered national idol.
the soldier president grant could have had the nomination of either party in 1868.
but believing that republican reconstruction policies were u s grant more ppular in the north he accepted the republican nomination.
the democrats nominated former governor horatio seymour of new york.
the campaign was a bitter one and grants triumph was surprisingly narrow.
without the 500 000 new black republican voters in the south he would have had a minority of the pop ular vote.
grant entered the white house with no political experience and his performance was clumsy and ineffectual from the start.
except for hamilton fish whom grant appointed secretary of state and who served for eight years with great distinction most members of the cabinet were ill equipped for their tasks.
grant relied chiefly and increasingly on established party leaders the group most ardently devoted to patronage.
his administration used the spoils system even more blatantly than most of its predecessors embittering reform minded members of his party.
grant also alienated the many northerners who were growing disillusioned with radical reconstruction policies which the president continued to support.
some republicans suspected correctly that there was also corruption in the grant administration itself.
by the end of grants first term therefore members of a substantial faction of the party who referred to themselves as liberal liberal republicans had come to oppose republicans what they called grantism in 1872 hoping to prevent grants reelection they bolted the party and nominated their own presidential candidate horace greeley veteran editor and publisher of the new york tribune.
the democrats somewhat reluctantly named greeley their candidate as well hoping that the alliance with the liberals would enable them to defeat grant.
but the effort was in vain.
grant won a substantial victory polling 286 electoral votes to greeleys 66 and nearly 56 percent of the pop ular total.
the grant scandals during the 1872 campaign the first of a series of political scandals came to light that would plague grant and the credit republicans for years.
it involved the mobilier credit mobilier construction company which had helped build the union pacific railroad.
the heads of credit mobilier had used their positions reconstruction and the new south 413 credit mobilier this political cartoon by thomas nast called the cherubs of credit mobilier depicts the censure by the house of representatives of congressmen james brooks of new york and oakes ames of massachusetts for their involvement in the credit mobilier scandal one of several scandals to stain the grant administration.
the granger collection new york as union pacific stockholders to steer large fraudulent contracts to their construction company thus bilking the union pacific and the federal government which provided large subsidies to the railroad of millions.
to prevent investigations the directors had given credit mobilier stock to key members of congress.
in 1872 congress launched an investigation which revealed that some highly placed republicans including schuyler colfax now grants vice president had accepted some of the stock.
one dreary episode followed another in grants second term.
benjamin h bristow grants third treasury secretary discovered that some of his officials and a group of distillers operating as a whiskey ring were cheating the government out of taxes by filing false reports.
then a house investigation revealed that william w belknap secretary of war had accepted bribes to retain an indian post trader in office the so called indian ring.
other lesser scandals added to the growing impression that grantism had brought rampant corruption to government.
the greenback question compounding grants and the nations problems was a financial crisis known as the panic of 1873.
it began with the panic of 1873 failure of a leading investment banking firm jay cooke and company which had invested too heavily in postwar railroad building.
there had been panics before in 1819 1837 and 1857 but this was worse than any earlier economic crisis.
the depression it pro duced lasted four years.
debtors now pressured the government to redeem federal war bonds with greenbacks paper currency of the sort printed during the civil war which would increase the amount of money in circulation.
but grant and most republicans wanted a sound currency based solidly on gold reserves which would favor the interests of banks and other creditors.
approximately 356 million in paper currency issued during the civil war was still in circulation.
in 1873 the treasury issued more in response to the panic.
but in 1875 republican leaders in congress in an effort to crush the greenback movement for good passed the specie resumption act.
it provided that after january 1 1879 the greenback dollars whose value constantly fluctuated would be redeemed by the government and replaced with new certificates firmly pegged to the price of gold.
the law satisfied creditors who had worried that debts would be repaid in paper currency of uncertain value.
but resumption made things more difficult for debtors because the gold based money supply could not easily expand.
in 1875 the greenbackers as the inflationists were called formed their own political organization the national greenback party.
it was active in the next three presidential elections but it failed to gain widespread support.
it did however keep the money issue alive.
the question of the proper composition of the currency was to remain one of the most controversial and enduring issues in late nine teenth century american politics.
national greenback party republican diplomacy the johnson and grant administrations achieved their greatest successes in foreign affairs.
the accomplishments were the work not of the presidents themselves who displayed little aptitude for diplomacy but of two outstanding secretaries of state william h seward who had served lincoln and who remained in office until 1869 and hamilton fish who served throughout the two terms of the grant administration.
an ardent expansionist seward acted with as much daring as the demands of reconstruction politics and the republican sewards hatred of president johnson would permit.
folly seward accepted a russian offer to sell alaska to the united states for 7 2 million despite criticism from many americans who considered alaska a frozen wasteland and derided it as sewards folly in 1867 seward also engineered the american annexation of the tiny midway islands west of hawaii.
hamilton fishs first major challenge was resolving the long standing controversy with england over the american claims that the british government had violated neutrality laws during the civil war by permitting english shipyards to alabama build ships among them the alabama for claims the confederacy.
american demands that england pay for the damage these vessels had caused became known as the alabama claims in 1871 after a number of failed efforts fish forged an agreement the treaty of washington which provided for international arbitration and in which britain expressed regret for the escape of the alabama from england.
the abandonment of reconstruction as the north grew increasingly preoccupied with its own political and economic problems interest in reconstruction began to wane.
the grant administration continued to protect republican governments in the south but less because of any interest in ensuring the position of freedmen than because of a desire to prevent the reemergence of a strong democratic party in the region.
but even the presence of federal troops was not enough to prevent white southerners from overturning the reconstruction regimes.
by the time grant left office democrats had taken back or as white southerners called it redeemed the governments of seven of the eleven former confederate states.
for three other states south carolina louisiana and florida the end of reconstruction had to wait for the withdrawal of the last federal troops in 1876 a withdrawal that was the result of a long process of political bargaining and compromise at the national level.
one former confederate state tennessee had never been part of the reconstruction process because it had ratified the fourteenth amendment and rejoined the union in 1866.
the southern states redeemed in the states where whites constituted a majority the states of the upper south overthrowing republican control was relatively simple.
by 1872 all but a handful of southern whites had regained suffrage.
now a clear majority of the electorate they needed only to organize and vote for their candidates.
in other states where african americans were a majority or the black and white populations were almost equal whites used intimidation and violence to undermine the reconstruction regimes.
secret societies the ku klux kian the knights of the white camellia and others used terrorism to frighten or physically bar blacks from voting or otherwise exercising citizenship.
paramilitary organizations the red shirts and white leagues armed themselves to police elections and worked to force all white males to join the democratic party and to exclude all african americans from meaningful political activity.
the ku klux kian was the largest and most effective of these organizations.
formed in 1866 and led by former ku klux klan confederate general nathan bedford forrest it gradually absorbed many of the smaller terrorist organizations in the south.
its leaders devised rituals costumes secret languages and other airs of mystery to create a bond among its members and make the organization seem even more terrifying to those it was attempting to intimidate.
the kians midnight rides bands of men clad in white sheets and masks their horses covered with white robes and with hooves muffled created terror in black communities throughout the south.
many white southerners considered the kian and the other secret societies and paramilitary groups proud patriotic societies.
together such groups served in effect as a military force even if a decentralized and poorly organized one continuing the battle against northern rule.
they worked in particular to advance the interests of those with the most to gain from a restoration of white supremacy above all the planter class and the southern democratic party.
even stronger than the kian in discouraging black political power however was the simple weapon of economic pressure some planters refused to rent land to republican blacks storekeepers refused to extend them credit employers refused to give them work.
the ku klux klan acts the republican congress tried for a time to turn back this new wave of white repression.
in 1870 and 1871 it passed two enforcement acts also known as the acts ku k1ux klan acts whlch were in many ways the most radical measures of the era.
the enforcement acts prohibited the states from discriminating against voters on the basis of race and gave the federal government power to supersede the state courts and prosecute violations of the law.
it was the first time the federal government had ever claimed the power to prosecute crimes by individuals under federal law.
federal district attorneys were now empowered to take action against conspiracies to deny african americans such rights as voting holding office and serving on juries.
the new laws also authorized the president to use the military to protect civil rights and to suspend the right of habeas corpus when violations of the rights seemed particularly egregious.
in october 1871 president grant used this provision of the law when he declared a state of lawlessness in nine counties in south carolina and sent in federal troops to occupy the area.
hundreds of suspected klan members were arrested some were held for long periods without trial some were eventually convicted under the law and sent to jail.
the enforcement acts were seldom used as severely as they decline of were in south carolina but they were ef the klan fective in the effort by blacks and northern whites to weaken the klan.
by 1872 klan violence against blacks was in decline throughout the region.
waning northern commitment the ku klux klan acts marked the peak of republican commitment to enforce the new rights reconstruction was extending to black citizens.
but that commitment did not last for long.
southern blacks were gradually losing the support of many of their former backers in the north.
as early as 1870 after the adoption of the fifteenth amendment some northern reformers convinced themselves that their long campaign on behalf of black people was now over that with the vote african americans ought to be able to take care of themselves.
over the next several years former radical leaders such as charles sumner and horace greeley now began calling themselves liberals cooperating with democrats and at times 4 reconstruction and the new south 415 outdoing even the democrats in denouncing what they viewed as black and carpetbag misgovernment.
within the south itself many white republicans joined the liberals and eventually moved into the democratic party.
the panic of 1873 further undermined support for reconstruction.
the economic crisis spurred northern industrialists and their allies to find an explanation for the poverty and instability around them.
they found it in a new idea known as social darwinism see p 471 a harsh theory that argued that individuals who failed did so because of their.
own weakness and unfitness those influ impact of social encea by social darwinism came to view darwinism the large number of unemployed vagrants in the north and poor african americans in the south as irredeemable misfits.
social darwinism also encouraged a broad critique of government intervention in social and economic life which further weakened commitment to the reconstruction program.
support for land redistribution never great and willingness to spend money from the depleted federal treasury to aid the freedmen waned quickly after 1873.
state and local governments also found themselves short of funds and rushed to cut back on social services which in the south meant the end of almost all services to the former slaves.
in the congressional elections of 1874 the democrats won control of the house of representatives for the first time since 1861.
grant took note of the changing temper of the north and made use of military force to prop up the republican regimes that were still standing in the south.
by the end of 1876 only three southern states were left in the hands of the republicans south carolina louisiana and florida.
in state elections that year democrats after using terrorist tactics claimed victory in all three.
but the republicans challenged the results and claimed victory as well and they were able to remain in office because of the presence of federal troops.
without federal troops it was now clear the last of the republican regimes would quickly fall.
the compromise of 1877 grant had hoped to run for another term in 1876.
but most republican leaders were shaken by recent democrat success afraid of the scandals with which grant was associated and hayes versus concerned about the presidents declining tilden health.
instead they sought a candidate not associated with the problems of the grant years one who might entice liberals and unite the party again.
they settled on rutherford b hayes of ohio a former union army officer governor and congressman champion of civil service reform.
the democrats united behind samuel j tilden the reform governor of new york who had been instrumental in challenging the corrupt tweed ring of new york gitys tammany hall.
although the campaign was a bitter one there were few differences of principle between the candidates both of whom were conservatives committed to moderate reform.
the november election produced an apparent democratic victory.
tilden carried the south and several large northern states and his popular margin over hayes was nearly 300 000 votes.
but disputed returns from louisiana south carolina florida and oregon whose total electoral vote was 20 threw the election in doubt.
tilden had undisputed claim to 184 electoral votes only one short of a majority.
but hayes could still win if he managed to receive all 20 disputed votes.
the constitution had established no method to determine the validity of disputed returns.
it was clear that the decision lay with congress but it was not clear with which house or through what method.
the senate was republican the house democratic.
members of each party naturally supported a solution that would yield them the victory.
finally late in january 1877 congress tried to break the deadlock by creating a special electoral commission to judge the disputed votes.
the commission would be composed of five senators five representatives and five justices of the supreme court.
the congressional delega tion would consist of five republicans and five democrats.
the court delegation would include two republicans two democrats and an independent.
but the independent seat ultimately went to a justice whose real sympathies were with the republicans.
the commission voted along straight special electoral commission candidate party electoral vote popular vote rutherford b hayes 185 4 036 298 republican 48 samuel j tilden 184 4 300 590 democratic 51 nonvoting territories 81 8 of electorate voting the election of 1876 the election of 1876 was one of the most controversial in american history.
as in the elections of 1824 1888 and 2000 the winner of the popular vote samuel j tilden was not the winner of the electoral college which he lost by one vote.
the final decision as to who would be president was not made untd the day before the official inauguration in march.
how did the republicans turn this apparent defeat into a victory.
debating the past reconstruction t1 t.
ver the nature of reconstruction has created so much controversy over u d jtl i jli the decades that one scholar writing in 1959 described the issue as a dark and bloody ground.
for many years a relatively uniform and highly critical view of reconstruction prevailed among historians.
william a dunning offered the principal scholarly expression of this view in reconstruction political and economic 1907 the first major historical interpretation of reconstruction.
dunning portrayed reconstruction as a corrupt outrage perpetrated on the prostrate south by a vicious and vindictive group of northern republican radicals.
unscrupulous carpetbaggers flooded the south to profit from the misery of the defeated region ignorant illiterate blacks were thrust into positions of power for which they were entirely unfit.
the reconstruction experiment survived only because of the determination of the republican party to keep itself in power.
some later writers notably howard k beale added an economic motive to protect northern business interests.
dunning s interpretation shaped the views of several generations of historians and helped shape popular depictions of reconstruction such as those expressed in the 1915 film the birth of a nation and then the 1936 book and 1939 movie gone with the wind.
the great african american scholar w e b.
du bois was among the first to challenge the dunning view.
in black reconstruction 1935 du bois argued that reconstruction politics in the southern states had been an effort on the part of the masses black and white to create a more democratic society.
the misdeeds of the reconstruction governments he claimed had been greatly exaggerated and their achievements overlooked.
in the 1940s the historians c vann woodward david herbert donald thomas b alexander and others began to reexamine the reconstruction governments in the south and to suggest that their records were not nearly as inaccurate and incomplete as most historians had previously assumed.
by the early 1960s a new view of reconstruction was emerging the revisionist approach was summarized by john hope franklin in reconstruction after the civil war 1961 and kenneth stampp in the era of reconstruction 1965 who claimed that the postwar republicans had been engaged in a genuine if flawed effort to solve the problem of race in the south by providing much needed protection to the freedmen.
the reconstruction governments for all their faults had been bold experiments in interracial politics.
the congressional radicals were not saints but they had displayed a genuine concern for the rights of slaves.
andrew johnson was not a martyred defender of the constitution but an inept racist politician who resisted reasonable compromise and brought the government to a crisis.
african americans had played only a small part in reconstruction governments and had generally acquitted themselves well.
the reconstruction regimes had in fact brought important progress to the south establishing the region s first public school system and other important social changes.
corruption in the south had been no worse than corruption in the north at that time what was tragic about reconstruction the revisionist view claimed was not what it did to southern whites but rather what it did not do for southern blacks by stopping short of the reforms necessary to ensure blacks genuine equality reconstruction had consigned them to more than a century of injustice and discrimination.
in later years scholars began to question the revisionist view in an attempt to draw attention to the achievements of reconstruction.
eric foner in nothing but freedom 1983 and reconstruction america s party lines 8 to 7 awarding every disputed vote to hayes.
congress accepted their verdict on march 2.
two days later hayes was inaugurated.
behind the resolution of the deadlock however lay a series of elaborate compromises among leaders of both parties.
when a democratic filibuster threatened to derail the commissions report republican senate leaders met secretly with southern democratic leaders to work out terms by which the democrats would allow the election of hayes.
according to traditional accounts republicans and southern democrats met at washingtons wormley hotel.
in return for a republican pledge that hayes would withdraw the last federal troops from the south thus permitting the overthrow of the last republican governments there the southerners agreed to abandon the filibuster.
actually the story behind the compromise of 1877 is more complex.
hayes was already on record favoring withdrawal of the troops so republicans needed to offer more than that if they hoped for democratic support.
the real compromise agreement the one that won over the southern democrats was reached well before the wormley meeting.
as the price of their cooperation the southern democrats among them some former whigs exacted several pledges from the republicans in addition to withdrawal of the troops the appointment of at least one southerner to the hayes cabinet control of federal patronage in their areas generous internal improvements and federal aid for the texas and pacific railroad.
many powerful southern democrats supported industrializing their region.
they believed republican programs of federal support for business would aid the south more than the states rights pol icies of the democrats.
in his inaugural address hayes announced that the souths most pressing need was the restoration of wise honest and peaceful local self government a signal that he planned to withdraw federal troops and let white democrats take over the state governments.
that statement and hayess subsequent actions supported the widespread charges that he was 416.
the freedmen s bureau for four years after the civil war the freedmens bureau served newly freed slaves helping them to get housing food education and other services.
this image shows african american men and women waiting for rations most of them old and sick.
the granger collection new york have both argued that the freed slaves displayed considerable independence in constructing their households on their own terms and asserting their control over family life reproduction and work.
according to jones in labor of love labor of sorrow 1985 women in particular sought the opportunity to labor on behalf of their own families and kin within the protected spheres of household and community.
some historians have begun to argue that reconstruction was not restricted to the south alone.
heather richardson in west from appomattox 2007 and the death of reconstruction 2001 shows how the entire nation changed during the civil war and reconstruction with the south perhaps changing least of all.
the age of reconstruction was also the age of western expansion and industrialization.
understand analyze and evaluate unfinished revolution 1988 emphasized how far the former slaves moved toward freedom and independence in a short time and how large a role african americans played in shaping reconstruction.
during reconstruction blacks won a certain amount of legal and political power in the south even though they held that power only temporarily they used it to strengthen their economic and social positions and to win a position of limited but genuine independence.
though they failed to achieve equality they won a measure of individual and community autonomy that they used as building blocks of the freedom that emancipation alone had not guaranteed.
leon litwack argued similarly in been in the storm so long 1979 that former slaves used the relative latitude they enjoyed under reconstruction to build a certain independence for themselves within southern society.
they strengthened their churches they reunited their families by refusing to work in the gang labor system of the plantations they forced the creation of a new labor system in which they had more control over their own lives.
writing from the perspective of women s history amy dru stanley and jacqueline jones 1.
according to the essay the birth of a nation and gone with the wind are popular depictions of reconstruction that reflect dunning s interpretation of the era.
can you find other popular depictions that reflect other interpretations of reconstruction.
a new view of reconstruction began to emerge in the 1960s the era of the civil rights movement.
why do you think the civil rights movement might have encouraged historians and others to reexamine reconstruction.
which view of reconstruction do you find more persuasive the view of reconstruction as a tragic era of exploitation of the south by the north or the view that sees reconstruction as an era of achievement and progress.
paying off the south for acquiescing in his election and strengthened those who referred to him as his fraudulency hayes tried to counter such charges by projecting an image of stern public and private rectitude.
but the election had already created such bitterness that even hayes s promise to serve only one term could not mollify his critics.
the president and his party had hoped to build up a new republican organization in the south drawn from whiggish conservative white groups and committed to some modest republican acceptance of african american rights.
but failurecin a11 such efforts failed although many the south white southern leaders sympathized with republican economic policies popular resentment of reconstruction and its attack on white supremacy was so deep that supporting the party was politically impossible.
at the same time the withdrawal of federal troops signaled that the national government was giving up its attempts to control southern politics and to improve the lot of african americans in southern society.
the legacies of reconstruction reconstruction made some important contributions to the efforts of former slaves to achieve dignity and equality in american life.
and it was not as disastrous an experience for southern whites as most of them believed at the time.
but reconstruction was in the end largely a failure for in those years the united states abandoned its first serious effort to resolve the nations oldest and deepest social problem the problem of race.
moreover the experience so disappointed disillusioned and embittered white americans that it would be nearly a century before they would try again in any serious way.
why did this great assault on racial injustice not achieve more.
in part it was because of the weaknesses and errors of the people who directed it.
but in greater ideological h h limits part ir was because attempts to produce solutions ran up against conservative obstacles so deeply embedded in the nation s life that they could not be dislodged.
veneration of the constitution 4 418 chapter 15 this a republican form of government the new york artist and cartoonist thomas nast marked the end of reconstruction in 1876 with this biting cartoon in harper s weekly expressing his dismay at what he considered the nation s betrayal of the former slaves who still had not received adequate guarantees of their rights.
the caption of the cartoon continued is this protecting life liberty or property.
is this equal protection of the laws.
the library of congress lc usz62 116353 sharply limited the willingness of national leaders to infringe on the rights of states and individuals.
a profound respect for private property and free enterprise prevented any real assault on economic privilege in the south.
above all perhaps a pervasive belief among many of even the most liberal whites that african americans were inherently inferior served as an obstacle to equality.
given the context within which americans of the 1860s and 1870s were working what is surprising is not that reconstruction did so little but that it did as much as it did.
considering the odds confronting them therefore african americans had reason for pride in the gains they made during reconstruction.
and future generations had reason for gratitude for two great charters of freedom the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution which although largely ignored at the time would one day serve as the basis for a second reconstruction that would renew the drive to bring freedom and equality to all americans.
the new south the agreement between southern democrats and northern republicans that helped settle the disputed election of 1876 was supposed to be the first step toward developing a stable permanent republican party in the south.
in that respect at least it failed.
in the years following the end of reconstruction white southerners established the democratic party as the only viable political organization for the regions whites.
even so the south did change in the years after reconstruction in some of the ways the framers of the compromise of 1877 had hoped.
the redeemers by the end of 1877 after the last withdrawal of federal troops every southern state government had been redeemed by white democrats.
many white southerners rejoiced at the res bourbon rule toration of what they liked t0 cal1 home rule but in reality political power in the region was soon more restricted than at any time since the civil war.
once again the south fell under the control of a powerful conservative oligarchy whose members were known variously as the redeemers to themselves and their supporters or the bourbons a term for aristocrats used by some of their critics.
in a few places this post reconstruction ruling class was much the same as the ruling class of the antebellum period.
in alabama for example the old planter elite despite challenges from new merchant and industrial forces retained much of its former power and continued largely to dominate the state for decades.
in most areas however the redeemers constituted a genuinely new ruling class.
they were merchants industrialists railroad developers and financiers.
some of them were former planters some of them northern immigrants who had become absorbed into the regions life some of them ambitious upwardly mobile white southerners from the regions lower social tiers.
they combined a commitment to home rule and social conservatism with a commitment to economic development.
the various bourbon governments of the new south behaved similarly to one another.
conservatives had complained that the reconstruction governments fostered widespread corruption but the redeemer regimes were even more awash in waste and fraud.
in this they were little different from governments in every region of the country.
at the same time virtually all the new democratic regimes lowered taxes reduced spending and drastically diminished state services including many of the most important accomplishments of reconstruction.
in one state after another for example state support for public school systems was reduced or eliminated.
schools are not a necessity an economy conscious governor of virginia commented.
by the late 1870s significant dissenting groups were challenging the bourbons protesting the cuts in services and denouncing the commitment of the redeemer governments to the paying off the prewar and reconstruction readjuster debts in full at the original usually high challenge rates of interest.
in virginia for example 3 vigorous readjuster movement emerged demanding that the state revise its debt payment procedures so as to make more money available for state services.
in 1879 the reconstruction and the new south 419 readjusters won control of the legislature and in the next few years they captured the governorship and a u s senate seat.
other states produced similar movements some of them adding demands as well for greenbacks debt relief and other economic reforms.
a few such independent movements included significant numbers of african americans in their ranks but all consisted primarily of lower income whites.
by the mid 1880s however conservative southerners largely by exploiting racial prejudice had destroyed most of the dissenting movements.
industrialization and the new south some white southern leaders in the post reconstruction era hoped to see their region become the home of a vigorous industrial economy.
the south had lost the war such leaders henry grady argued because its economy had been unable to compete with the modernized manufacturing capacity of the north.
now the region must out yankee the yankees and build a new south henry grady editor of the atlanta constitution and other prominent spokesmen for a new south seldom challenged white supremacy but they did advocate other important changes in southern values.
above all they promoted the virtues of thrift industry and progress qualities that prewar southerners had often denounced in northern society.
we have sown towns and cities in the place of theories grady boasted to a new england audience in the 1880s and put business above politics.
we have fallen in love with work but even the most fervent advocates of the new south creed were generally unwilling to break entirely with the southern past.
that was evident in among other things the popular literature of the region.
at the same time that white southern writers were extolling the virtues of industrialization in newspaper editorials and speeches they were painting nostalgic portraits of the old south in their literature.
few southerners advocated a literal return to the old ways but most whites eagerly embraced romantic talk of the lost cause and they responded warmly to the local color fiction of such writers as joel chandler harris whose folktales the most famous being uncle remus 1880 portrayed the slave society of the antebellum years as a harmonious world marked by engaging dialect and close emotional bonds between the races.
the writer thomas nelson page similarly extolled the old virginia aristocracy.
the growing popularity of minstrel shows also reflected the romanticization of the old south see patterns of popular culture pp.
the white leaders of the new south in short faced their future with one foot still in the past.
even so southern industry expanded dramatically in the years after reconstruction and became a more important part of the regions economy than ever before.
most visible was the growth in textile manufacturing which increased ninefold in the last twenty years of the century.
in the past southern planters had usually shipped their cotton out of the region to manufacturers in the north or in europe.
now textile factories appeared in the south itself many of them drawn to the south from new england by the abundance of water power the ready supply of cheap labor the low taxes and the accommodating conservative governments.
the tobacco processing industry similarly established an important foothold in the region largely through the work of james b duke of north carolina whose american tobacco company established for a time a virtual monopoly over the processing of raw tobacco into marketable materials.
in the lower south particularly in birmingham alabama the iron and later steel industry grew rapidly.
by 1890 the southern iron and steel industry represented nearly a fifth of the nations total capacity.
railroad development increased substantially in the post reconstruction years at a rate far greater than that of the nation at large.
between 1880 and 1890 trackage in the south railroad mre than doubled.
and the south took a development major step toward integrating its transportation system with that of the rest of the country when in 1886 it changed the gauge distance between the two rails of its trackage to correspond with the standards of the north.
yet southern industry developed within strict limits and its effects on the region were never even remotely comparable to the effects of industrialization on the north.
the southern share of national manufacturing doubled in the last twenty years of the century to 10 percent of the total.
but that percentage was the same the south had claimed in 1860 the region in other words had done no more than regain what it had lost during the war and its aftermath.
the regions per capita income increased 21 percent in the same period.
but at the end of the century average income in the south was only 40 percent of that in the north in 1860 it had been more than 60 percent.
and even in those areas where development had been most rapid textiles iron railroads much of the capital had come from the north.
in effect the south was developing a colonial economy.
the growth of industry in the south required the region to recruit a substantial industrial workforce for the first time.
from the beginning a high percentage of the factory workers and an especially high percentage of textile workers were women.
heavy male casualties in the civil war had helped create a large population of unmarried women who were in dire need of employment.
factories also hired entire families many of whom were moving into towns from failed farms.
workdays were long often twelve hours a day and wages were far below the northern equivalent indeed one of the greatest attractions of the south to industrialists was that employers were able to pay workers there as little as one half what northern workers received.
life in most mill towns was rigidly controlled by the owners and managers of the factories who rigorously suppressed attempts at protest or union organization.
company stores sold goods to workers at inflated prices and issued credit at exorbitant rates much like country stores in agrarian areas and mill owners ensured that no competitors were able to establish themselves in the community.
at the same time however the conditions of the mill town helped create a strong sense of community and solidarity among workers even if they seldom translated such feelings into militancy.
the minstrel show fe minstrel show was one of the most popular forms of entertainment in america in the.
7 7 second half of the nineteenth century.
it was also a testament to the high awareness of race and the high level of racism in american society both before and after the civil war.
minstrel performers were mostly white usually disguised as black.
but african american performers also formed minstrelsy at high tide the primrose west minstrel troupe a lavish and expensive entertainment that drew large crowds in the 1800s was one of many companies to offer this brand of entertainment to eager audiences all over the country.
although minstrelsy began with white musicians performing in blackface the popularity of real african american minstrels encouraged the impresarios of the troupe to include groups of white and black performers alike.
the library of congress lc usz62 2659 their own minstrel shows end trensformed them into vehicles for training black entertainers and developing new forms of music and dance.
before and during the civil war when minstrel shows consisted almost entirely of white performers performers blackened their faces with cork and presented grotesque stereotypes of the slave culture of the american south among the most popular of the stumbling ridiculously ignorant characters invented for these shows were such figures as zip coon and jim crow whose name later resurfaced as a label for late nineteenth century segregation laws.
a typical minstrel show presented a group of seventeen or more men seated in a semicircle facing the audience.
the man in the center ran the show played the straight man for the jokes of others and led the music lively dances and sentimental ballads played on banjos castanets and other instruments and sung by soloists or the entire group.
after the civil war white minstrels began to expand their repertoire.
drawing from the famous and successful freak shows of p t barnum and other entertainment entrepreneurs some began to include siamese twins bearded ladies and even a supposedly 8 foot 2 inch chinese giant in their shows.
they also incorporated sex both by including women in some shows and even more popularly by recruiting female impersonators one of the most successful minstrel performers of the 1870s was francis leon who delighted crowds with his female portrayal of a flamboyant prima donna.
one reason white minstrels began to move in these new directions was that they were now facing competition from black performers who could provide more authentic versions of black music dance and humor.
some industries textiles for example offered virtually no opportunities to african american workers.
others including tobacco iron and lumber did provide some employment for blacks usually the most menial and lowest paid positions.
some mill towns therefore were places where black and white culture came into close contact.
that proximity contributed less to the growth of racial harmony than to the determination of white leaders to take additional measures to protect white supremacy.
at times industrialization proceeded on the basis of no wage paying employment.
through the convict lease system southern states leased gangs of convicted criminals to private convict interests as a cheap labor supply.
the sys lease system tem exposed the convicts to brutal and at times fatal mistreatment.
it paid them nothing the leasing fees went to the states not the workers.
and it denied employment in railroad construction and other projects to the free labor force.
tenants and sharecroppers despite significant growth in southern industry the region remained primarily agrarian.
the most important economic reality in the post reconstruction south therefore was the impoverished state of agriculture.
the 1870s and 1880s saw an acceleration of the trends that had begun in the immediate postwar years the imposition of systems of tenantry and debt peonage on much of the region the reliance on a few cash crops rather than on a diversified agricultural system and in creasing absentee ownership of valuable farmlands many of them purchased by merchants and industrialists who paid little 10 ag field minstrels this famous minstrel group stands in front of a huge promotional poster sometime in the late 1890s.
archive photos getty images but interest in the minstrel show did not die altogether.
in 1927 hollywood released the jazz singer the first feature film with sound.
it was about the career of a white minstrel performer and its star was one of the most popular singers of the twentieth century al jolson whose career had begun on the blackface minstrel circuit years before.
understand analyze and evaluate they usually brought more talent to the task than white performers.
the georgia minstrels organized in 1865 was one of the first all black minstrel troupes and it had great success in attracting white audiences in the northeast for several years.
by the 1870s touring african american minstrel groups were numerous.
the black minstrels used many of the conventions of the white shows.
there were dances music comic routines and sentimental recitations.
some black performers even chalked their faces to make themselves look as dark as the white blackface performers with whom they were competing.
black minstrels sometimes denounced slavery at least indirectly and did not often speak demeaningly of the capacities of their race.
but they could not entirely escape caricaturing african american life as they struggled to meet the expectations of their white audiences.
the black minstrel shows had few openly political aims.
they did help develop some important forms of african american entertainment and transform them into a part of the national culture.
black minstrels introduced new forms of dance derived from the informal traditions of slavery and black community life.
they showed the buck and wing the stop time and the virginia essence which established the foundations for the tap and jazz dancing of the early twentieth century.
they also improvised musically and began experimenting with forms that over time contributed to the growth of ragtime jazz and rhythm and blues.
eventually black minstrelsy like its white counterpart evolved into other forms of theater including the beginnings of serious black drama.
at ambrose park in brooklyn in the 1890s for example the celebrated black comedian sam lucas a veteran of the minstrel circuit starred in the play darkest america which one black newspaper later described as a delineation of negro life carrying the race through all their historical phases from the plantation into reconstruction days and finally painting our people as they are today cultured and accomplished in the social graces holding the mirror faithfully up to nature.
how did minstrel shows performed by white minstrels reinforce prevailing attitudes toward african americans.
minstrel shows performed by black minstrels often conformed to existing stereotypes of african americans.
can you think of any popular entertainments today that carry remnants of the minstrel shows of the nineteenth century.
attention to whether the land was being properly used.
during reconstruction perhaps a third or more of the farmers in the south were tenants by 1900 the figure had increased to 70 percent.
that was in large part the result of the crop lien system the system by which farmers borrowed money against their future crops and often fell deeper and deeper into debt.
tenantry took several forms.
farmers who owned tools equipment and farm animalsor who had the money to buy them usually paid an annual cash rent for their land.
but many farmers including most black ones had no money or equipment.
landlords would supply them with land a crude house a few tools seed and sometimes a mule.
in return farmers would promise the landlord a large share of the annual crop hence the term sharecropping after paying their landlords and their local merchants who were often the same people sharecroppers seldom had anything left to sell on their own.
african americans and the new south the new south creed was not the property of whites alone.
many african americans were attracted to the vision of progress and self improvement as well.
some blacks succeeded in elevating themselves into a distinct middle class most of them economically inferior to the white middle class but nevertheless significant.
these were former slaves and as the decades passed their offspring who managed to blacclassddle ac tuire property build sma11 businesses or enter professions.
a few african americans accumulated substantial fortunes by establishing banks and 421 422 chapter 15 family portrait this photograph of an african american family of four generations was taken in the late nineteenth century.
every member of this family was born on the plantation of j j smith of beaufort south carolina.
the youngest members while certainly touched by slavery were not born into that institution.
corbis insurance companies to serve the black community.
one of those was maggie lena a black woman who became the first female bank president in the united states when she founded the st luke penny savings bank in richmond in 1903.
most middle class blacks experienced more modest gains by becoming doctors lawyers nurses or teachers serving african american communities.
a cardinal tenet of this rising group of african americans was that education was vital to the future of their race.
with the support of northern missionary societies and to a far lesser extent a few southern state governments they expanded the network of black colleges and institutes that had taken root during reconstruction into an important educational system.
the chief spokesman for this commitment to education and booker t for a time tlae maior spokesman for african washington americans in the south and beyond was booker t washington founder and president of the tuskegee institute in alabama.
born into slavery washington had worked his way out of poverty after acquiring an education at virginias famous hampton institute.
he urged other blacks to follow the same road to self improvement.
washingtons message was both cautious and hopeful.
african americans should attend school learn skills and establish a solid footing in agriculture and the trades.
industrial not classical education should be their goal.
they should moreover refine their speech improve their dress and adopt habits of thrift and personal cleanliness they should in short adopt the standards of the white middle class.
only thus he claimed could they win the respect of the white population the prerequisite for any larger social gains.
african americans should forgo agitating for political rights he said and concentrate on self improvement and preparation for equality.
in a famous speech the atlanta in geor ia in 1895 washington outlined a compromise philosophy of race relations that became widely known as the atlanta compromise.
the wisest among my race understand he said that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly rather blacks should engage in severe and constant struggle for economic gains for as he explained no race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized if african americans were ever to win the rights and privileges of citizenship they must first show that they were prepared for the exercise of these privileges washington offered a powerful challenge to those whites who wanted to discourage african americans from acquiring an education or winning any economic gains.
he helped awaken the interest of a new generation to the possibilities for selfadvancement through self improvement.
but his message was also an implicit promise that african americans would not overtly challenge the system of segregation that whites were then in the process of erecting.
the birth of jim crow few white southerners had ever accepted the idea of racial equality.
that the former slaves acquired any legal and political rights at all after emancipation was in large part the result of federal support.
that support all but vanished after 1877.
federal troops withdrew.
congress lost interest.
and the supreme court effectively stripped the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of much of their significance.
in the so called civil rights cases of 1883 the court ruled that the fourteenth amendment prohibited state governments from discriminating against people because of race but did not restrict private organizations or individuals from doing so.
thus railroads hotels theaters and workplaces could legally practice segregation.
eventually the court also validated state legislation that institutionalized the separation of the races.
in plessy v ferguson 1896 a case involving a louisiana law that required separate plessy v seating arrangements for the races on rail ferguson roads the court held that separate accom modations did not deprive blacks of equal rights if the accommodations were equal a decision that survived for years as part of the legal basis for segregated schools.
in cumming v county board of education 1899 the court ruled that laws establishing separate schools for whites were valid even if there were no comparable schools for african americans.
before these decisions white southerners were working to strengthen white supremacy and to separate the races to the greatest extent possible.
one illustration of this movement reconstruction and the new south 423 the crop lien system in 1880 in the years after the civil war more and more southern farmers white and black became tenants or sharecroppers on land owned by others.
this map shows the percentage of farms that were within the so called crop lien system the system by which people worked their lands for someone else who had a claim or lien on a part of the farmers crops.
note the high density of sharecropping and tenant farming in the most fertile areas of the deep south the same areas where slaveholding had been most dominant before the civil war.
how did the crop lien system contribute to the shift in southern agriculture toward one crop farming.
from subordination to segregation was black voting rights.
in some states disenfranchisement had begun almost as soon as reconstruction ended.
but in other areas black voting continued for some time after reconstruction largely because conservative whites believed they could control the black electorate and use it to beat back the attempts of poor white farmers to take control of the democratic party.
in the 1890s however franchise restrictions became much more rigid.
during those years some small white farmers began to demand complete black disenfranchisement both because of ra eial prejudice and because they objected to the black vote being used against them by the conservative planters known as bourbons see p 418.
at the same time many members of the conservative elite began to fear that poor whites might unite politically with poor african americans to challenge them.
they too began to support further franchise restrictions.
in devising laws to disenfranchise black males the southern states had to find ways to evade the fifteenth amendment which prohibited states from denying anyone the right to vote because of race.
two devices emerged before 1900 to accomplish this goal.
one was the poll tax or some form of property restricting qualification few african americans were the franchise prosperous enough to meet such requirements.
another was the literacy or understanding test which required voters to demonstrate an ability to read and interpret the constitution.
even those african americans who could read had trouble passing the difficult test white officials gave them.
such restrictions were often applied unequally.
literacy tests for whites for example were sometimes much easier than those for blacks.
even so the laws affected poor white voters as well as african americans.
by the late 1890s the black vote had decreased by 62 percent the white vote by 26 percent.
one result was that some states passed so called grandfather laws permitting men who could not meet the literacy and property qualifications to be enfranchised if their ancestors had voted before reconstruction began thus barring the descendants of slaves from the polls while allowing poor whites access to them.
in many areas however ruling elites were quite content to see poor whites a potential source of opposition to their power barred from voting.
the supreme court proved as compliant in ruling on the disenfranchising laws as it was in dealing with the civil rights 424.

corbis cases.
the court eventually voided the grandfather laws but it validated the literacy test in the 1898 case of williams v mississippi and displayed a general willingness to let the southern states define their own suffrage standards as long as evasions of the fifteenth amendment were not too glaring.
laws restricting the franchise and segregating schools were only part of a network of state statutes known as the jim crow laws that by the first years of the twentieth century had institutionalized an elaborate system of segregation reaching into almost every area of southern life.
blacks and whites could not ride in the same railroad cars sit in the same waiting rooms use the same washrooms eat in the same restaurants or white sit in same t ieaters blacks had no ac control cess t0 many public parks beaches and perpetuated picnic areas they could not be patients in many hospitals.
much of the new legal structure did no more than confirm what had already been widespread social practice in the south since well before the end of reconstruction.
but the jim crow laws also stripped african americans of many of the modest social economic and political gains they had made in the more fluid atmosphere of the late nineteenth century.
the laws served too as a means for whites to retain control of social relations between the races in the newly growing cities and towns of the south where traditional patterns of deference and subjugation were more difficult to preserve than in the countryside.
what had been maintained by custom in the rural south was to be maintained by law in the urbanizing south.
more than legal efforts were involved in this process.
the 1890s witnessed a dramatic increase in white violence against blacks which along with the jim crow laws served to inhibit black agitation for equal rights.
the worst such violence lynching of blacks by white mobs either because the victims were accused of crimes or because they had seemed somehow to violate their expected station reached appalling levels.
in the nation as a whole in the 1890s there was an average of 187 lynchings each year more than 80 percent of them in the south.
the vast lynchings majority of victims were black.
one african american woman lucy mcmillan said john hunter s wife came to my house on saturday morning and reconstruction and the new south 425 a lynch mob 1893 a large almost festive crowd gathers to watch the lynching of a black man accused of the murder of a three year o d white girl.
lynch ngs remained frequent n the south un il as late as the 1930s but they reached their peak in the 1890s and the firs years of the twentieth century.
lynchings such as this one pubhshed well n advance and attracting whole families who traveled great distances to see them were infrequent.
most lynchings were the work of smaller groups operating with less visibility.
the library of congress told they were going to whip me.
i was afraid of them.
there was so much talk of ku klux drowning people and killing them.
the most celebrated lynchings occurred in cities and towns where large well organized mobs occasionally with the tacit cooperation of local authorities seized black prisoners from the jails and hanged them in great public rituals.
such public lynch tags were often planned well in advance and elaborately orga nized.
they attracted large audiences from surrounding regions.
entire families traveled many miles to witness the spectacles.
but such great public lynchings were relatively rare.
muc more frequent and more dangerous to african americans because less visible or predictable were lynchings performe by small vigilante mobs often composed of friends or relative of the victim or supposed victim of a crime.
those invo ve lynchings often saw their actions as a legitimate enforcement and indeed some victims of lynchings a in ac committed crimes.
but lynchings were also a means y w ic whites controlled the black population through terror an intimidation.
thus some lynch mobs killed african arne whose only crime had been presumptuousness chose as victims outsiders in the community w ose p threatened to disturb the normal pattern of race relations.
black men who had made any sexual advances toward white women or who white men thought had done so were particularly vulnerable to lynchings the fear of black sexuality and the unspoken fear among many men that white women might be attracted to that sexuality was always an important part of the belief system that supported segregation.
whatever the reasons or circumstances the victims of lynch mobs were denied the protection of the laws and the opportunity to prove their innocence.
the rise of lynchings shocked the conscience of many white americans in a way that other forms of racial injustice did not.
almost from the start there was a substantial anti lynching movement.
in 1892 ida b.
wells a committed black journalist launched what became an international anti lynching movement with a series of impassioned articles after the lynching of three of her friends in memphis tennessee her home.
the movement gradually gathered strength in the first years of the twentieth century attracting substantial support from whites particularly white women in both the north and the south.
its goal was a federal anti lynching law which would allow the national government to do what how we remember the past can tell us a great deal about remembering black history our vajues and priorities as a nation.
when these memories take official form as in a public monument erected in a culturally significant setting they offer a view into how americans understood history in a particular time.
what is revealed however is rarely a popular consensus about what individuals or events were worthy of being celebrated.
rather the final construction and placement of any public monument typically reflects a series of tough debates between people with different views of the meaning of the past.
the two monuments pictured on the following page are among the most famous in american history in general and african american history in particular.
the first is a bronze relief by augustus saint gaudens commemorating the fifty fourth massachusetts volunteer infantry regiment the first military unit composed of black soldiers raised in the north during the civil war.
at full fighting strength with over 1000 african american men led by an all white officer corps the 54th became a national symbol of african american freedom.
leading the assault on july 18 1863 against the confederate stronghold fort wagner on morris island south carolina it sustained heavy losses including that of its commanding officer colonel robert shaw.
despite failing to take the fort the black troops fought passionately and with discipline thereby silencing critics who doubted the very ability of african americans to stand strong in battle.
saint gaudens unveiled his memorial in may 1897.
eleven feet high and 14 feet long it depicts the 54th marching through boston in the first leg of its journey to the battle front.
leading the unit is colonel shaw on horseback.
it still sits in its original locale at the edge of the boston common in the shadow of the massachusetts state house.
the second monument is a white granite statue by lie yixin a sculptor from the people s republic of china honoring the life of civil rights pioneer martin luther king jr king a baptist minister born in atlanta georgia who led the fight to end segregation in the south in the 1950s and 1960s.
he spearheaded the drive to pass the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965.
he was assassinated in 1968.
the king statue is actually part of a larger four acre park dedicated to his life that sits in the southwest corner of the national mall in washington d c.
the 30 foot high statue has a clear view of the lincoln memorial and the jefferson memorial and is accompanied by a 450 foot long inscription wall that bears quotes from kings most famous speeches.
the king memorial is the first dedicated to a black american on the national mall.

427 428 chapter 15 state and local governments in the south were generally unwilling to do punish those responsible for lynchings.
but the substantial white opposition to lynchings stood as an exception to the general white support for suppression of african americans.
indeed just as in the antebellum period the shared commitment to white supremacy helped dilute class looking back reconstruction long remembered by many white americans as a vindictive outrage or a tragic failure was in fact a profoundly important moment in american history.
despite the bitter political battles in washington d c and throughout the south culminating in the unsuccessful effort to impeach president andrew johnson the most important result of the effort to reunite the nation after its long and bloody war was a reshaping of the lives of ordinary people in all regions of the nation.
in the north reconstruction solidified the power of the republican party and ensured that public policy would support the continued growth of an advanced industrial economy.
the rapid growth of the northern economy continued and accelerated drawing more and more of its residents into an expanding commercial world.
in the south reconstruction did more than simply bring slavery to an end.
it fundamentally rearranged the relationship between the region s white and black citizens.
only for a while did reconstruction permit african americans to participate actively and effectively in southern politics.
after a few years of widespread black voting and significant black officeholding the forces of white supremacy forced most african americans to the margins of the southern political world where they would mostly remain until the 1960s.
but in other ways the lives of southern blacks changed dramatically.
overwhelmingly they left the plantations.
some sought work in towns and cities.
some left the region altogether.

economic issues tended to play a secondary role to race in southern politics distracting people from the glaring social inequalities that afflicted blacks and whites alike.
the commitment to white supremacy in short was a burden for poor whites as well as for blacks.
but the great majority began farming on small farms of their own not as landowners except in rare cases but as tenants and sharecroppers on land owned mostly by whites.
the result was a form of economic bondage driven by debt only scarcely less oppressive than the legal bondage of slavery.
but within this system african americans managed to carve out a much larger sphere of social and cultural autonomy than they had ever been able to create under slavery.
black churches organized in great numbers.
african american schools emerged in some communities and black colleges began to appear in the region.
some former slaves owned businesses and flourished.
in southern cities and towns a fledgling black middle class began to emerge.
the system of tenantry which emerged in the course of reconstruction continued after its end to dominate the southern economy.
strenuous efforts by new south advocates to advance industry and commerce in the region produced significant results in a few areas.
but the south on the whole remained what it had always been an overwhelmingly rural society with a sharply defined class structure.
it was also a region with a deep commitment among its white citizens to the subordination of african americans a commitment solidified in the 1890s and the early twentieth century when white southerners erected an elaborate legal system of segregation the jim crow laws.
the promise of the great reconstruction amendments to the constitution the fourteenth and fifteenth remained largely unfulfilled in the south as the century drew to its close.

what various ethnic and racial groups populated the american west and how were the cultural characteristics of these groups reflected in the west.
how did the arrival and settlement of substantial numbers of anglo americans transform the society and economy of the west.
what role did the federal government play in shaping the development of the west.
american progress 1872 the brooklyn artist john gast painted this tribute to westward expansion an image of hardy pioneers marching toward the frontier protected by the goddess of progress.
it was designed for travel guides to encourage tourists and migrants to travel to the west.
the library of congress lctjszc4 668 setting the stage by the mid 1840s migrants from the eastern regions of the united states had settled in the west in substantial numbers.
farmers ranchers and miners all found opportunity in the western lands.
by the end of the civil war the west had already become legendary in the eastern states.
it no longer seemed to be the great american desert an image popularized by early travelers in the west it was now the frontier an empty land awaiting settlement and civilization a place of wealth adventure opportunity and untrammeled individualism.
in fact the real west of the mid nineteenth century bore little resemblance to either of these images.
it was a diverse land with many different regions and different climates and an extensively populated land with a number myth and we eve pe societies and cultures.
indians mexicans french and british canadians reality asians and others had been living in the west for generations.
the anglo american settlers helped create new civilizations in this vast and complicated land but they seldom did so by themselves.
although they tried with considerable success to conquer and disperse many of the peoples already living in the region they were never able to make the west theirs alone.
they interacted in countless ways with the existing population.
almost everything the anglo americans did and built reflected the influence of these other cultures.
most of all however english speaking americans transformed the west by making it part of the growing capitalist economy of the east.
and despite their self image as rugged individualists they relied heavily on assistance from the federal government land grants subsidies and military protection as they developed the region.
the societies of the far west the far west or what many nineteenth century americans called the great west the region beyond the mississippi river into which millions of anglo americans moved in the years after the civil war was in fact many lands.
it contained some of the most arid territory in the united states and some of the wettest and lushest.
it contained the flattest plains and the highest mountains.
it contained vast treeless prairies and deserts and great forests.
and it contained many peoples.
the western tribes the largest and most important western population group before the great anglo american migration was the indian tribes.
some were members of eastern tribes cherokee creek and others who had been forcibly resettled west of the mississippi to indian territory later oklahoma and elsewhere before the civil war.
but most were members of tribes that had always lived in the west.
the western tribes had developed several forms of civilization.
more than 300 000 indians among them the serrano chumash porno maidu yurok and chinook had lived on the pacific coast before the arrival of spanish settlers.
disease and dislocation decimated the tribes but in the mid nineteenth century 150 000 remained some living within the hispanic society the spanish and mexican settlers had created many still living within their own tribal communities.
the pueblos of the southwest had long lived largely as farmers and had established permanent settle ments there even before the spanish arrived in the seventeenth century.
the pueblos grew corn they built towns and cities of adobe houses they practiced elaborate forms of irrigation and they participated in trade and commerce.
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries their intimate relationship with the spanish later mexicans produced in effect an alliance against the apaches navajos and comanches of the region.
the complex interaction between the pueblos and the spanish produced an elaborate caste system in the southwest.
at the top were the spanish or mexicans who owned the largest estates and controlled the trading centers at santa fe and elsewhere.
the pueblos subordinate but still 431.
366 chapter 14 we now stand without a shield with bare bosoms presented to our enemies at first they did not have sufficient military power to seize two fortified offshore military installations fort sumter on an island in the harbor of charleston south carolina garrisoned by a small force under major robert anderson and fort pickens in the harbor of pensacola florida.
south carolina sent commissioners to washington to ask for the surrender of sumter but buchanan timid though he was refused to yield it.
indeed in january 1861 he ordered an unarmed merchant ship to proceed to fort sumter with additional troops and supplies.
confederate guns on shore fired at the vessel the first shots between north and south and turned it back.
still neither section was yet ready to concede that war had begun.
and in washington efforts began once more to forge a compromise.
the failure of compromise gradually compromise forces gathered behind a proposal first submitted by senator john j crittenden of kentucky and known crittenden as crittenden compromise.
it called for compromise several constitutional amendments which would guarantee the permanent existence of slavery in the slave states and would satisfy southern demands on such issues as fugitive slaves and slavery in the district of columbia.
but the heart of crittendens plan was a proposal to reestablish the missouri compromise line in all present and future territory of the united states slavery would be prohibited north of the line and permitted south of it.
the remaining southerners in the senate seemed willing to accept the plan but the republicans were not.
the compromise would have required the republicans to abandon their most fundamental position that slavery not be allowed to expand.
and so nothing had been resolved when abraham lincoln arrived in washington for his inauguration sneaking into the city in disguise on a night train to avoid assassination as he passed through the slave state of maryland.
in his inaugural address which dealt directly with the secession crisis lincoln laid down several basic principles.
since the union was older than the constitution no state could leave it.
acts of force or violence to support secession were insurrectionary.
and the government would hold occupy and possess federal property in the seceded states a clear reference to fort sumter.
fort sumter conditions at fort sumter were deteriorating quickly.
union forces were running short of supplies unless they received fresh provisions the fort would have to be evacuated.
lincoln believed that if he surrendered sumter his commitment to maintaining the union would no longer be credible.
so he sent a relief expedition to the fort carefully informing the south carolina authorities that there would be no attempt to send troops or munitions unless the supply ships met with resistance.
the war begins the new confederate government now faced a dilemma.
permitting the expedition to land would seem to be a tame submission to federal authority.
firing on the ships or the fort would seem to the north at least to be aggression.
but confederate leaders finally decided that to appear cowardly would be worse than to appear belligerent and they ordered general p g t beauregard commander of confederate forces at charleston to take the island by force if necessary.
when anderson refused to surrender the fort the confederates bombarded it for two days april 12 13 1861.
on april 14 anderson surrendered.
the civil war had begun.
as the southern states began to secede abraham lincoln spoke of american liberty it was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country but 1 hope to the world for all future time.
it was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men.
this is a sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence.
now my friends can this country be saved upon that basis.
if it can i will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if i can help to save it.
if it cannot be saved upon that principle it will be truly awful almost immediately lincoln began mobilizing the north for war.
and equally promptly four more slave states seceded from the union and joined the confederacy virginia april 17 1861 arkansas may 6 north carolina may 20 and tennessee june 8.
the four remaining slave states maryland delaware kentucky and missouri cast their lot with the union under heavy political and even military pressure from washington.
was there anything that lincoln or those before him could have done to settle the sectional conflict peaceably.
that question has preoccupied historians for more than a century without resolution.
see debating the past pp.
there were of course actions that might have prevented a war if for example northern leaders had decided to let the south withdraw in peace.
the real question however is not what hypothetical situations might have reversed the trend toward war but whether the preponderance of forces in the nation were acting to hold the nation together or to drive it apart.
and by 1861 it seems clear that in both the north and the south sectional antagonisms whether justified or nothad risen to such a point that the existing terms of union had become untenable.
people in both regions had come to believe that two distinct and incompatible civilizations had developed in the united states and that those civilizations were incapable of living together in peace.
ralph waldo emerson speaking fr much of the north said at the time i do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state.
and a slaveowner expressing the sentiments of much of the south said shortly after the election of lincoln these northern people hate us annoy us and would have us j the civil war 367 fort sumter during the bombardment this graphic drawing shows the interior of fort sumter during its bombardment by confederate forces in april 1861.

why then continue together that the north and the south had come to believe these things helped lead to secession and war.
whether these things were actually true whether the north and the south were really as different and incompatible as they thought is another question one that the preparations for and conduct of the war help to answer.
the opposing sides as the war began only one thing was clear all the important material advantages lay with the north.
its population was more union than twice as lar8e as t iat of t ie south and advantages nearly four times as large as the nonslave population of the south so the union had a much greater manpower reserve for both its armies and its workforce.
the north had an advanced industrial system and was able by 1862 to manufacture almost all its own war materials.
the south had almost no industry at all and despite impressive efforts to increase its manufacturing capacity had to rely on imports from europe throughout the war.
in addition the north had a much better transportation system than did the south and in particular more and better railroads twice as much trackage as the confederacy and a much better integrated system of lines.
during the war moreover the already inferior confederate railroad system steadily deteriorated and by the beginning of 1864 had almost collapsed.
but in the beginning the north s material advantages were not as decisive as they appear in retrospect.
the south was for the most part fighting a defensive war on its own land south population north railroad mileage union and confederate resources virtually all the material advantages population manufacturing railroads wealth even agriculture lay with the north during the civil war as this chart shows.
what advantages did the south have in the conflict.
and thus had the advantage of local support and familiarity with the territory.
the northern armies on the other hand were fighting mostly within the south with long lines of communications amid hostile local populations and with access only to the south s own inadequate transportation system.
the commitment of the white population of the southern south to the war was with limited excep advantages tions clear and firm.
in the north opinion about the war was divided and support for it remained shaky until near the end.
a major southern victory at any one of several crucial moments might have proved decisive by breaking the north s will to continue the struggle.
finally many southerners believed that the dependence of the english and french textile industries on american cotton would require those nations to intervene on the side of the confederacy.
the mobilization of the north in the north the war produced considerable discord frustration and suffering.
but it also produced prosperity and economic growth by giving a major stimulus to both industry and agriculture.
republican economic policy economic measures with southern forces now gone from congress the republican party could exercise virtually unchallenged authority.
during the war it enacted an aggressively nationalistic program to promote economic development particularly in the west.
the homestead act of 1862 permitted any citizen or prospective citizen to claim 160 acres of public land and to purchase it for a small fee after living on it for five years.
the morrill land grant act of the same year transferred substantial public acreage to the state governments which were to sell the land and use the proceeds to finance public education.
this act led to the creation of many new state colleges and universities the so called land grant institutions.
congress also passed a series of tariff bills that by the end of the war had raised duties to the highest level in the nations history a great boon to domestic industries eager for protection from foreign competition.
congress also moved to complete the dream of a transcontinental railroad.
it created two new federally chartered corporations the union pacific railroad company which was to build westward from omaha and the central pacific which was to build eastward from california settling the prewar conflict over the location of the line.
the two projects were to meet in the middle and complete the link.
the government provided free public lands and generous loans to the companies.
the national bank acts of 1863 1864 created a new national banking system.
existing or newly formed banks could join the system if they had enough capital and were willing to the civil war 369 war by railroad union soldiers pose beside a mortar mounted on a railroad car in july 1864 during the siege of petersburg virginia.
railroads played a critical role in the civil war and the superiority of the north s rail system was an important factor in its victory.
it was appropriate perhaps that the battle for petersburg the last great struggle of the war was over control of critical railroad lines.
national archives and records administration national bank acts invest one third of it in government securities.
in return they could issue u s treasury notes as currency.
the new system eliminated much of the chaos and uncertainty in the nation s cur rency and created a uniform system of national bank notes.
more difficult than promoting economic growth was financing the war.
the government tried to do so in three ways by levying taxes issuing paper currency and borrowing.
congress levied new taxes on almost all goods and services and in 1861 the government levied an income tax for the first financing thf time with rates that eventua11 rose t0 10 war percent on incomes above 5 000.
but tax ation raised only a small proportion of the funds necessary for financing the war and strong popular resistance prevented the government from raising the rates.
at least equally controversial was the printing of paper currency or greenbacks the new currency was backed not by gold or silver but simply by the good faith and credit of the government much like today s currency.
the value of the greenbacks fluctuated according to the fortunes of the northern armies.
early in 1864 with the war effort bogged down a greenback dollar was worth only 39 percent of a gold dollar.
even at the close of the war it was worth only 67 percent of a gold dollar.
because of the difficulty of making purchases with this uncertain currency the government used greenbacks sparingly.
the treasury issued only 450 million worth of paper currency a small proportion of the cost of the war but enough to produce significant inflation.
370 chapter 14 by far the largest source of financing for the war was loans from the american people.
in previous wars the government had sold bonds only to banks and to a few wealthy investors.
now however the treasury persuaded ordinary citizens to buy over 400 million worth of bonds the first example of mass financing of a war in american history.
still bond purchases by individuals constituted only a small part of the governments borrowing which in the end totaled 2 6 billion.
most of the loans to finance the war came from banks and large financial interests.
raising the union armies over 2 million men served in the union armed forces during the course of the civil war.
but at the beginning of 1861 the regular army of the united states consisted of only 16 000 troops many of them stationed in the west to protect white settlers from indians.
so the union like the confederacy had to raise its army mostly from scratch.
lincoln called for an increase of 23 000 in the regular army but the bulk of the fighting he knew would have to be done by volunteers in state militias.
when congress convened in july 1861 it authorized enlisting 500 000 volunteers for three year terms as opposed to the customary three month terms.
this voluntary system of recruitment produced adequate forces only briefly.
after the first flush of enthusiasm for the war enlistments declined.
by march 1863 congress was forced to pass a national draft law.
virtually all young adult males were eligible to be drafted but a man could escape service by hiring someone to go in his place or by paying the government a fee of 300.
only about 46 000 men were ever actually conscripted but the draft greatly increased voluntary enlistments.
to a people accustomed to a remote and inactive national government conscription was strange and threatening.
opposition to the law was widespread particularly among la draft riots borers immigrants and democrats opposed to the war known as peace democrats or copperheads by their opponents.
occasionally opposition to the draft erupted into violence.
demonstrators against the draft rioted in new york city for four days in july 1863 after the first names were selected for conscription.
it was among the most violent urban uprisings in american history.
more than 100 people died.
irish workers were at the center of the violence.
they were angry because black strikebreakers had been used against them in a recent longshoremens strike and they blamed african americans generally for the war which they thought was being fought for the benefit of slaves who would soon be competing with white workers for jobs.
the rioters lynched a number of african americans burned down homes and businesses mostly those of free blacks and even destroyed an orphanage for african american children.
only the arrival of federal troops subdued the rioters.
wartime politics when abraham lincoln arrived in washington early in 1861 many politicians noting his lack of national experience and his folksy unpretentious manner considered him a minor politician from the prairies a man whom the real leaders of his party would easily control.
but the new president moved quickly to establish his own authority.
he assembled a cabinet representing every faction of the republican party and every segment of northern opinion men of exceptional prestige and influence and in some cases arrogance several of whom believed that they not lincoln should be president.

he increased the size of the regular army without receiving legislative authority to do so.
he unilaterally proclaimed a naval blockade of the south.
lincolns greatest political problem was the widespread popular opposition to the war mobilized by factions in the democratic party.
the peace democrats feared that the agricultural northwest was losing influence to the industrial east wartime and that republican nationalism was erod repression ing states rights.
lincoln used extraordi nary methods to suppress them.
he ordered military arrests of civilian dissenters and suspended the right of habeas corpus the right of a person to be released by a judge or court from unlawful detention as in the case of insufficient evidence.

the new york city draft riot 1863 opposition to the civil war draft was widespread in the north and in july 1863 produced a violent four day uprising in new york city in which as many as 100 people died.

the most prominent copperhead in the country ohio congressman clement l vallandigham was seized by military authorities and exiled to the confederacy after he made a speech claiming that the purpose of the war was to free the blacks and enslave the whites.
lincoln defied all efforts to curb his authority to suppress opposition even those of the supreme court.
when chief justice taney issued a writ ex parte merrymari requiring him to release an imprisoned maryland secessionist leader lincoln simply ignored it.
after the war in 1866 the supreme court ruled in ex parte milligan that military trials in areas where the civil courts existed were unconstitutional.
repression was not the only tool the north used to strengthen support for the war.
in addition to arresting disloyal northerners lincolns administration used new tools of persuasion to build popular opinion in favor of the war.
in addition to pro war pamphlets posters speeches and songs the war mobilized a significant corps of photographers organized by the renowned mathew brady one of the first important photographers in american history to take pictures of the war.
the photographs that resulted from this effort new to warfare were among the grimmest ever made to that point many of them displaying the vast numbers of dead on the civil war battlefields.
for some americans the images of death contributed to a revulsion from the war.
but for most northerners they gave evidence of the level of sacrifice that had been made for the preservation of the union and thus spurred the nation on to victory.
southerners used similar propaganda in the confederacy although less effectively.
the presidential election of 1864 occurred therefore in the midst of considerable political dissension.
the republicans had suffered heavy losses in the congressional elections of 1862 and in response leaders of the party tried to create a broad coalition of all the groups that supported the war.
they called the new organization the union party but in reality it was little more than the republican party and a small faction of war democrats.
the union party nominated lincoln for another term as president and andrew johnson of tennessee a war democrat who had opposed his states decision to secede for the vice presidency.
the democrats nominated george b mcclellan a celebrated former union general who had been relieved of his command by lincoln.
the party adopted a platform denouncing the war and calling for a truce.
mcclellan repudiated that demand but the democrats were clearly the peace party in the campaign trying to profit from growing war weariness and from the unions discouraging military position in the summer of 1864.
at this crucial moment however several northern military victories particularly the capture of atlanta georgia early in 1864 election september rejuvenated northern morale and boosted republican prospects.
lincoln won debating the past the causes of the civil war t wt secor d inaugural address in march 1865 abraham lincoln looked back at the beginning i ini of the civil war four years earlier.
all knew he said that slavery was somehow the cause of the war.
few historians doubt the basic truth of lincoln s statement but they have disagreed on to liberty this painting by theodore kaufmann shows a group of fugitive slaves escaping from the south in the late years of the civil war.
thousands of former slaves crossed the union lines where they were given their freedom.
many of them joined the union army.
the granger collection new york sharply about whether slavery was the only or even the principal cause of the war.
this debate began even before the war itself.
in 1858 senator william h seward of new york took note of two competing explanations of the sectional tensions that were then inflaming the nation.
on one side he claimed stood those who believed the sectional hostility to be accidental unnecessary the work of interested or fanatical agitators opposing them stood those like seward himself who believed there to be an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces.
the irrepressible conflict argument dominated historical discussion of the war from the 1860s to the 1920s.
because the north and the south had reached positions on the issue of slavery that were both irreconcilable and seemingly unalterable some historians claimed the conflict had become inevitable james rhodes in his seven volume history of the united states from the compromise of 1850 1893 1900 placed greatest emphasis on the moral conflict over slavery but he suggested as well that the struggle also reflected fundamental differences between the northern and southern economic systems.
charles and mary beard in the rise of american civilization 2 vols 1927 also viewed the war as an irrepressible economic rather than moral conflict.
ultimately however reelection comfortably with 212 electoral votes to mcclellan s 21 the president carried every state except kentucky new jersey and delaware.
but lincolns lead in the popular vote was a modest 10 percent.
had union victories not occurred when they did and had lincoln not made special arrangements to allow union troops to vote mcclellan might have won.
the politics of emancipation despite their surface unity in 1864 and their general agreement on most economic matters the republicans disagreed sharply on the issue of slavery.
radicals led in congress by such men as representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania and senators charles sumner of massachusetts and benjamin wade of ohio wanted to use the war to abolish slavery immediately and completely.
conservatives favored a slower more gradual and they believed less disruptive process for ending slavery.
in the beginning at least they had the support of the president.
372 despite lincolns cautious view of emancipation momentum began to gather behind it early in the war.
in 1861 congress passed the confiscation act which declared that all confiscation slaves used for insurrectionary purposes acts that is in support of the confederate mili tary effort would be considered freed.
subsequent laws in the spring of 1862 abolished slavery in washington d c and in the western territories and compensated owners.
in july 1862 the radicals pushed through congress the second confiscation act which again declared free the slaves of persons aiding and supporting the insurrection whether or not the slaves themselves were doing so and which also authorized the president to employ african americans including freed slaves as soldiers.
as the war progressed much of the north seemed slowly to accept emancipation as a central war aim nothing less would justify the enormous sacrifices of the struggle many northerners believed.
as a result the radicals increased their influence within the republican party a development that did not g of hose who believed he c v l war to have been irrepressible returned to an emphasis on social and cultural factors.
allan nevins in the ordeal of the union 8 vols 1947 1971 arqued that the problem of slavery lay at the root of the cultural differences between the north and the south but that the fundamental assumptions tastes and cultural aims of the two regions were diverging in other ways as well.
more recent proponents of the irrepressible conflict argument have taken different views of the northern and southern positions on the conflict but have been equally insistent on the role of culture and ideology in creating them.
eric foner in free soil free labor free men 1970 and other writings emphasized the importance of the free labor ideology to northern opponents of slavery.
most northerners including abraham lincoln foner claimed opposed slavery largely because they feared it might spread to the north and threaten the position of free white laborers.
eugene genovese writing of southern slaveholders in the political economy of slavery 1965 argued that just as northerners were becoming convinced of a southern threat to their economic system so southerners believed that the north had aggressive and hostile designs on the southern way of life.
like foner therefore genovese saw cultural differences as the source of an all but inevitable conflict.
other historians have argued that the civil war might have been avoided that the differences between north and south were not so fundamental as to have necessitated war.
the idea of the war as avoidable gained wide recognition among historians in the 1920s and 1930s when a group known as the revisionists began to offer new accounts of the origins of the conflict.
one of the leading revisionists was james g randall who saw in the social and economic systems of the north and the south no differences so fundamental as to require a war.
avery craven another leading revisionist argued similarly in the coming of the civil war 1942 that slave laborers were not much worse off than northern industrial workers that the institution was already on the road to ultimate extinction and that war could therefore have been averted had skillful and responsible leaders worked to produce compromise.
more recent students of the civil war have emphasized the role of political agitation and ethnocultural conflicts in the coming of the war.
michael holt in the political crisis of the 1850s 1978 emphasized the role of political parties and especially the collapse of the second party system rather than the irreconcilable differences between sections in explaining the conflict although he avoided placing blame on any one group.
along with paul kleppner joel silbey and william gienapp holt was one of the creators of an ethnocultural interpretation of the war.
these scholars argue that the civil war began in large part because the party system the most effective instrument for containing and mediating sectional differences collapsed in the 1850s and produced a new republican party that aggravated rather than calmed the divisions in the nation william gienapp in the origins of the republican party 1852 1856 1987 argued that the disintegration of the party system in the early 1850s was less a result of the debate over slavery in the territories than of such ethnocultural issues as temperance and nativism.
gienapp and the other ethnoculturalists would not entirely dispute lincolns claim that slavery was somehow the cause of the war.
but they do challenge the arguments of eric foner and others that the free labor ideal of the north and the challenge slavery and its possible expansion into the territories posed to that ideal was the principal reason for the conflict.
slavery became important they suggest less because of irreconcilable differences of attitude than because of the collapse of parties and other structures that might have contained the conflict.

the immediate effect of the proclamation was limited since it applied only to slaves still under confederate control.
but the document was of great importance nevertheless because it clearly and irrevocably established that the war was being fought not only to preserve the union but also to eliminate slavery.
eventually as federal armies occupied much of the south the proclamation became a practical reality and led directly to the freeing of thousands of slaves.

the causes of wars are rather different from their meanings.
presidents often wartime oratory use wartime speeches to shape public understanding of those meanings to articulate their visions of what wars are really about.
they tend to emphasize broad principles and cherished ideals rather than more narrow economic concerns or even national security arguments.
more than four months after the pivotal battle at gettysburg president abraham lincoln traveled there to dedicate a military cemetery.
a crowd of 15 000 listened first to the famed orator edward everetts two hour account of the battle.
then came lincoln.
his speech was much shorter just over two minutes.
the president touched briefly on american history before turning to the civil war and what it meant.
the gettysburg address is reproduced here in its entirety the 1863 document.
almost a hundred and fifty years later president george w bush also appealed to the past in explaining the conflict of his time the war on terrorism of the early twenty first century.
the occasion was bushs second inaugural address delivered in january 2005 after his victory over the democratic nominee john kerry.
his speech came in the middle of the ongoing wars in iraq and afghanistan that had been prompted by the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001.
though the context couldnt have been more different bush devoted part of his address to themes similar to lincolns so many years before.
that excerpt is included here as the 2005 document.
lincoln 1863 the gettysburg address november 19 1863 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
we are met on a great battle field of that war.
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
but in a larger sense we can not dedicate we can not consecratewe can not hallow this ground.
the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here.
it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.

the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.
americas vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.
from the day of our founding we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth.
across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave.
advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation.

so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.
this is not primarily the task of arms though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary.
freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities.

376 chapter 14 war helped african americans to liberate themselves and they did so in increasing numbers as the war progressed.
many slaves were taken from their plantations and put to work building defenses and other chores.
once transported to the front many of them found ways to escape across northern lines where they were treated as contraband goods seized from people who had no right to them.
they could not be returned to their masters.
by 1862 the union army often penetrated deep into the confederacy.
almost everywhere they went escaped slaves often whole families flocked to join them by the thousands.
some of them joined the union army others simply stayed with the troops until they could find their way to free states.
when the union captured new orleans and much of southern louisiana slaves refused to work for their former masters even though the union occupiers had not made any provisions for liberating african americans.
by the end of the war slavery had been abolished in two union slave states maryland and missouri and in three confederate states occupied by union forces tennessee arkansas and louisiana.
the final step came in 1865 when congress approved and the necessary states ratified the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery as an institution in all parts of the united states.
after more than two centuries legalized slavery finally ceased to exist in the united states.
african americans and the union cause about 186 000 emancipated african americans served as soldiers sailors and laborers for the union forces joining a significant number of free blacks from the north.
the services of black enlistment mistreatment of black soldiers african americans to the union military were significant in many ways not least because of the substantial obstacles many black men had to surmount in order to enlist.
in the first months of the war african americans were largely excluded from the military.
a few black regiments eventually took shape in some of the union occupied areas of the confederacy mainly because they were a ready source of manpower in these defeated regions.
but once lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation black enlistment increased rapidly and the union military began actively to recruit african american soldiers and sailors in both the north and where possible the south.
some of these men were organized into fighting units.
the best known was probably the fifty fourth massachusetts infantry which like most black regiments had a white commander robert gould shaw a member of an aristocratic boston family.
shaw and more than half his regiment died during a battle near charleston south carolina in the summer of 1863.
most black soldiers however were assigned menial tasks behind the lines such as digging trenches and transporting water.
even though fewer african americans than whites died in combat the black mortality rate was higher than the rate for white soldiers because so many died of disease from working long arduous hours in unsanitary conditions.
conditions for blacks and whites were unequal in other ways as well.
african american soldiers were paid a third less than were white soldiers until congress changed the law in mid 1864.
but however dangerous onerous or african american troops although most of the black soldiers who enlisted in the union army durinq the civil war nerf a i ho black combat regunents members of one of which are pictured here who fought with great success and valor in criticalbltfe s the civil war 377 menial the tasks black soldiers were given most of them felt enormous pride in their service pride they retained throughout their lives and often through the lives of their descendants.
many moved from the army into politics and other forms of leadership in both the north and after the war the reconstruction south.
black fighting men captured by the confederates were unlike white prisoners not returned to the north in exchange for southern soldiers being returned to the south.
they were sent back to their masters if they were escaped slaves or often executed.
in 1864 confederate soldiers killed more than 260 african americans after capturing them in tennessee.
the war and economic development the civil war did not as some historians used to claim transform the north from an agrarian to an industrial society.
industrialization was already far advanced when the war began and in some areas the war retarded growth by cutting manufacturers off from their southern markets and sources of raw material and by diverting labor and resources to military purposes.
on the whole however the war sped the economic development of the north.
that was in part a result of the political dominance of the republican party and its promotion of nationalistic economic legislation.
but it was also because the war itself required the expansion of certain sectors of the economy.
coal production increased by nearly 20 percent during the war.
railroad facilities improved mainly through the adoption of a standard gauge track width on new lines.
the loss of farm labor to the military forced many farmers to increase the mechanization of agriculture.
the war was a difficult experience for many american workers.
for industrial workers there was a substantial loss of purchasing power as prices in the north rose by more than 70 percent during the war while wages rose only about 40 percent.
that was partly because liberalized immigration laws permitted a flood of new workers into the labor market and helped keep wages hard times 1w was a so ecause increasing mech for workers anization of production eliminated the jobs of many skilled workers.
one result of these changes was a substantial increase in union membership in many industries and the creation of several national unions for coal miners railroad engineers and others organizations bitterly opposed and rigorously suppressed by employers.
women nursing and the war responding not only to the needs of employers for additional labor but to their own often desperate need for money women found themselves by either choice or necessity thrust into new and often unfamiliar roles during the war.
they took over positions vacated by men and worked as teachers retail salesclerks office workers and mill and factory hands.
above all women entered nursing a field previously dominated by men.
the u s sanitary commission an organization u s sanitary civi ian volunteers led by social reformer commission dorothea dix mobilized large numbers of female nurses to serve in field hospitals.
by the end of the war women were the dominant force in nursing by 1900 nursing had become an almost entirely female profession.
female nurses not only cared for patients but also performed other tasks considered appropriate for women cooking cleaning and laundering.
female nurses encountered considerable resistance from male doctors many of whom considered women too weak for medical work and who in any case gender roles thought it inappropriate that women reinforced were taking care of men who were strangers to them.
the sanitary commission tried to counter such arguments by attributing to nursing the u s sanitary commission mathew brady took this photograph of female nurses and union soldiers standing before an infirmary at brandy station virginia near petersburg in 1864.
the infirmary was run by the u s sanitary commission the government supported nursing corps that became important to the medical care of wounded soldiers during the civil war.
national archives and records administration 378 chapter 14 many of the domestic ideals that american society attributed to womens work in the home women as nurses would play the same maternal nurturing instructive role they played as wives and mothers.
the right of woman to her sphere which includes housekeeping cooking and nursing has never been disputed one sanitary commission official insisted.
but not all women who worked for the commission were content with a purely maternal role some challenged the dominance of men in the organization and even stood up against doctors whom they considered incompetent increasing the resentment felt toward them by many men.
in the end though the work of female nurses was so indispensable to the military that the complaints of male doctors were irrelevant.
nurses and many other women found the war a liberating experience in which as one sanitary commission nurse later wrote the american woman had developed potencies and possibilities of which she had been unaware and which surprised her as it did those who witnessed her marvelous achievement some women especially those who had been committed to feminist causes earlier came to see the war as an opportunity to win support for their own goals.
elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony who together founded the national womans loyal league in 1863 worked simultaneously for the abolition of slavery and the awarding of suffrage to women.
clara barton who was active during the war in collecting and distributing medical supplies and who later became an important figure in the nursing profession and a founder of the american red cross said in 1888 at the wars end woman was at least fifty years in advance of the normal position which continued peace would have assigned her that may have been an exaggeration but it captured the degree to which many women looked back on the war as a crucial moment in the redefinition of female roles and in the awakening of a sense of independence and new possibilities.
whatever nursing may have done for the status of women it had an enormous impact on the medical profession and on nursing and r e treatment of wounded soldiers during medicine the war.
the u s sanitary commission not only organized women to serve at the front it also funneled medicine and supplies to badly overtaxed field hospitals.
the commission also as its name suggests helped spread ideas about the importance of sanitary conditions in hospitals and clinics and probably contributed to the relative decline of death by disease in the civil war.
nevertheless twice as many soldiers died of diseases malaria dysentery typhoid gangrene and others as died in combat during the war.
even minor injuries could lead to fatal infections.
the mobilization of the south many southerners boasted loudly of the differences betweer their new nation and the nation they had left.
the difference were real.
but there were also important similarities betweer the union and the confederacy which became clear as the two sides mobilized for war similarities in their political systems in the methods they used for financing the war and conscripting troops and in the way they fought.
the confederate government the confederate constitution was largely identical to the constitution of the united states but with several significant exceptions it explicitly acknowledged the sovereignty of the individual states although not the right of secession and it specifically sanctioned slavery and made its abolition even by one of the states practically impossible.
the constitutional convention at montgomery named a provisional president and vice president jefferson davis of mississippi and alexander h stephens of georgia who were later chosen by the general electorate without opposition for six year terms.
davis had been a moderate secessionist before the war stephens had argued against secession.
the confederate government like the union government was dominated throughout the war by moderate leaders.
also like the unions it was dominated less by the old aristocracy of the east than by the newer aristocrats of the west of whom davis was the most prominent example.
davis was in the end an unsuccessful president.
he was a reasonably able administrator and the dominating figure in his government encountering little interference from the daviss generally tame members of his unstable leadership cabinet and serving as his own secretary of war.
but he rarely provided genuinely national leadership.
one shrewd confederate official wrote all the revolutionary vigor is with the enemy.
with us timidity hair splitting there were no formal political parties in the confederacy but its congressional and popular politics were rife with dissension nevertheless.
some white southerners and of course most african americans who were aware of the course of events opposed secession and war.
many white people in poorer backcountry and upcountry regions where slavery was limited refused to recognize the new confederate government or to serve in the southern army some worked or even fought for the union.
most white southerners supported the war but as in the north many were openly critical of the government and the military particularly as the tide of battle turned against the south and the confederate economy decayed.
southern divisions money and manpower financing the confederate war effort was a monumental and ultimately impossible task.
it involved creating a national revenue system in a society unaccustomed to significant tax burdens.
it depended on a small and unstable banking system that had little capital to lend.
because most wealth in the south was invested in slaves and land liquid assets were scarce and the civil war 379 the confederacys only gold seized from u s mints located in the south was worth only about 1 million.
the confederate congress tried at first not to tax the people directly but to requisition funds from the individual states.
most of the states however were also unwilling to tax their funding citizens and paid their shares when they problems paid them at all with bonds or notes of dubious worth.
in 1863 the congress enacted an income tax which planters could pay in kind as a percentage of their produce.
but taxation never provided the confederacy with much revenue it produced only about 1 percent of the governments total income.
borrowing was not much more successful.
the confederate government issued bonds in such vast amounts that the public lost faith in them and stopped buying them.
efforts to borrow money in europe using cotton as collateral fared no better.
as a result the confederacy had to pay for the war through the least stable most destructive form of financing paper currency which it began issuing in 1861.
by 1864 the confederacy had issued the staggering total of 1 5 billion in paper money more than twice what the union had produced.
and unlike volunteers young southern soldiers posed for t is p o ogr first battle of bull run.
the civil war was the first major military con ic in g iy and it launched the careers of many of america s early photograp ers.
richmond history center raising the confederate army the union the confederacy did not establish a uniform currency system the national government states cities and private banks all issued their own notes producing widespread chaos and confusion.
the result was a disastrous inflation far worse than anything the north experienced.
prices in the north rose 80 percent in the course of the war in the south they rose 9 000 percent with devastating effects on the souths morale.
like the united states the confederacy first raised a military by calling for volunteers.
and as in the north by the end of 1861 voluntary enlistments were declining.
in april 1862 therefore the congress enacted a conscription act which subjected all white males between the ages of eighteen and thirty five to military service for three years.
as in the north a draftee could avoid service if he furnished a substitute.
but since the price of substitutes was high the provision aroused such opposition from poorer whites that it was repealed in 1863.
even more controversial was the exemption from the draft of one white man on each plantation with twenty or more slaves a provision that caused smaller farmers to make the same complaint some northerners made its a rich mans war but a poor mans fight many more white southerners were exempted from military service than were northerners.
even so conscription worked for a time.
at the end of 1862 about 500 000 men were in the confederate military.
a total of approximately 900 000 served in the course of the entire war.
that number did not include the many slave men and slave women recruited by the military to perform such services as cooking laundry and manual labor hence freeing additional white manpower for fighting.
after 1862 however conscription began producing fewer men in part because the union had by then begun to seize large areas of the confederacy and thus had cut off much of the population from conscription or recruitment.
early in 1864 the government faced a critical manpower shortage.
in a desperate move the confederate congress began trying to draft men as young as seventeen and as old as fifty.
but in a nation suffering from intense war weariness where many had con cluded that defeat was inevitable nothing could attract or retain an adequate army any longer.
in 1864 1865 there were 100 000 desertions.
in a frantic final attempt to raise men the confederate congress authorized the conscription of 300 000 slaves but the war ended before the government could attempt this incongruous experiment.
states rights versus centralization the greatest sources of division in the south however were differences of opinion over the doctrine of states manpower shortage 380 chapter 14 rights.
states rights had become such a cult among many white southerners that they resisted all efforts to exert national authority even those necessary to win the war.
they restricted daviss ability to impose martial law and suspend habeas corpus.
they obstructed conscription.
recalcitrant governors such as joseph brown of georgia and zebulon m vance of north carolina tried at times to keep their own troops apart from the confederate forces and insisted on hoarding surplus supplies for their own states militias.
even so the confederate government did make substantial strides in centralizing power in the south.
by the centralization end of the warthe confederate bureau cracy was larger than its counterpart in washington.
the central government experimented successfully for a time with a food draft which permitted soldiers to feed themselves by seizing crops from farms in their path.
the government impressed slaves often over the objections of their owners to work as laborers on military projects.
the confederacy seized control of the railroads and shipping it imposed regulations on industry it limited corporate profits.
states rights sentiment was a significant handicap but the south nevertheless took important steps in the direction of centralization becoming in the process increasingly like the region whose institutions it was fighting to escape.
economic and social effects of the war the war had a devastating effect on the economy of the south.
it cut off southern planters and producers from the markets in the north on which they had depended it made the sale of cotton overseas much more difficult it robbed farms and industries that did not have large slave populations of a male workforce leaving some of them unable to function effectively.
while in the north production of all goods agricultural and industrial increased somewhat during the war in the south production declined by more than a third.
most of all perhaps the fighting itself wreaked havoc on the southern economy.
almost all the major battles of the war occurred within the confederacy both armies spent most of their time on southern soil.
as a result of the savage fighting the souths already inadequate railroad system was nearly destroyed much of its most valuable farmland and many of its most successful plantations were ruined by union troops especially in the last year of the war.
once the northern naval blockade became effective in 1862 the south experienced massive shortages of almost everything.
the region was overwhelmingly agricultural but since it had concentrated so single mindedly on producing cotton and other export crops it did not grow enough food economic t0 meet its own needs and despite the woes efforts of women and slaves to keep farms functioning the departure of white male workers seriously diminished the regions ability to keep up what food production there had been.
large numbers of doctors were conscripted to serve the needs of the military leaving many communities without any medical care.
blacksmiths carpenters and other craftsmen were similarly in short supply.
as the war continued the shortages the inflation and the suffering created increasing instability in southern society.
there were major food riots some led by women in georgia north carolina and alabama in 1863 as well as a large demonstration in richmond that quickly turned violent.
resistance to conscription food impressment and taxation increased throughout the confederacy as did hoarding and black market commerce.
despite the economic woes of the south the war transformed confederate society in many of the same ways that it was changing the society of the union.
the changes were par ticularly significant for southern women.
for women because so many men left the farms and plantations to fight the task of keeping families together and maintaining agricultural production fell increasingly to women.
slaveowners wives often became responsible for managing large slave workforces the wives of modest farmers learned to plow fields and harvest crops.
substantial numbers of females worked as schoolteachers or in government agencies in richmond.
even larger numbers chose nursing both in hospitals and in temporary facilities set up to care for wounded soldiers.
the long range results of the war for southern women are more difficult to measure but equally profound.
the experience of the 1860s forced many women to question the prevailing southern assumption that females were unsuited for certain activities that they were not fit to participate actively in the public sphere.
a more concrete legacy was the decimation of the male population and the creation of a major gender imbalance in the region.
after the war there were many thousands more women in the south than there were men.
in georgia for example women outnumbered men by 36 000 in 1870 in north carolina by 25 000.
the result of course was a large number of unmarried or widowed women who both during and after the war had to find employment thus by necessity rather than choice expanding the number of acceptable roles for women in southern society.
even before emancipation the war had far reaching effects on the lives of slaves.
confederate leaders who were more terrified of slave revolts during the war than they had been in peacetime enforced slave codes and other regulations with particular severity.
even so many slaves especially those near the front found ways to escape their masters and cross behind union lines in search of freedom those who had no realistic avenue for escape seemed to their owners at least to be particularly resistant to authority during the war.
that was in part because on many planta tions the masters and overseers for whom they were accus tomed to working were away at war they found it easier to resist the authority of the women and boys left behind to manage the farms.
the civil war 381 atlanta after the burning general sherman captured atlanta on september 2 1864 evacuated most of the population and set fire to the city.
this photograph shows the extent of the devastation.
the destruction of atlanta was the beginning of sherman s famous march to the sea it also signaled the beginning of a new kind of warfare waged not just against opposing armies but also against the economies and even the populations of the enemy.
corbis strategy and diplomacy militarily the initiative in the civil war lay mainly with the north since it needed to destroy the confederacy while the south needed only to avoid defeat.
diplomatically however the initiative lay with the south.
it needed to enlist the recognition and support of foreign governments the union wanted to preserve the status quo prior to the war.
the commanders the most important union military commander was abraham lincoln whose previous military experience consisted only lincolns f brief service in his state militia during leadership the black hawk war.
lincoln was a successful commander in chief because he realized that numbers and resources were on his side and because he took advantage of the norths material advantages.
he realized too that the proper objective of his armies was the destruction of the confederate armies not the occupation of southern territory.
it was important that lincoln bad a good grasp of strategy because many of his generals did flot.
the problem of finding adequate commanders for the troops in the field plagued him throughout the first three years of the war.
from 1861 to 1864 lincoln tried time and again to find a chief of staff capable of orchestrating the union war effort.
he turned first to general winfield scott the aging hero of the mexican war.
but scott was unprepared for the magnitude of the new conflict and retired on november 1 1861.
lincoln replaced him with the young george b mcclellan commander of the union armies in the east the army of the potomac but the proud arrogant mcclellan had a wholly inadequate grasp of strategy and returned to the field in march 1862.
for most of the rest of the year lincoln had no chief of staff.
and when he finally appointed general henry w halleck to the post he found him an ineffectual strategist who left all substantive decision making to the president.
not until march 1864 did lincoln finally find a general he trusted to command the war effort ulysses s grant who shared lincolns belief in making enemy armies and resources not enemy territory the target of military efforts.
lincoln gave grant a relatively free hand but the general always submitted at least the broad outlines of his plans to the president for advance approval.
lincolns and later grants handling of the war effort faced constant scrutiny from the committee on the conduct of the war a joint investigative committee of the two houses of congress and the most powerful voice the legislative branch has ever had in formulating war policies.
established in december 1861 and chaired by senator benjamin f wade of ohio it complained constantly of the insufficient ruthlessness of northern generals which radicals on the committee attributed largely inaccurately to a secret sympathy among the officers for slavery.
the committees efforts often seriously interfered with the conduct of the war.
southern command arrangements centered on president davis who unlike lincoln was a trained professional soldier.
nevertheless he failed to create an effective command system.
382 chapter 14 ulysses s grant one observer said of grant seen here posing for a photograph during the wilderness campaign of 1864 he habitually wears an expression as if he had determined to drive his head through a brick wall and was about to do it.
it was an apt metaphor for grant s military philosophy which relied on constant unrelenting assault.
one result was that grant was willing to fight when other northern generals held back.
another was that grant presided over some of the worst carnage of the civil war.
the library of congress early in 1862 davis named general robert e lee as his principal military adviser.
but in fact davis had no intention of sharing robert e lee contrl f strategy with anyone.
after a few months lee left richmond to command forces in the field and for the next two years davis planned strategy alone.
in february 1864 he named general braxton bragg as a military adviser but bragg never provided much more than technical advice.
not until february 1865 did the confederate congress create the formal position of general in chief.
davis named lee to the post but made clear that he expected to continue to make all basic decisions.
in any case the war ended before this last command structure had time to take shape.
at lower levels of command men of markedly similar backgrounds controlled the war in both the north and the south.
many of the professional officers on both sides were graduates of the u s military academy at west point and the u s.
naval academy at annapolis and thus had been trained in similar ways.
many were closely acquainted even friendly with their counterparts on the other side.
and all were imbued with the classic eighteenth century models of warfare that the service robert e lee lee who was a moderate by the standards of southern politics in the 1850s opposed secession and was ambivalent about slavery.
but he could not bring himself to break with his region and he left the u s army to lead confederate forces beginning in 1861.
he was and remains the most revered of all the white southern leaders of the civil war.
for decades after his surrender at appomattox lee was a symbol to white southerners of the lost cause.
corbis academies still taught.
the most successful officers were those who like grant and william tecumseh sherman were able to see beyond their academic training and envision a new kind of warfare in which destruction of resources was as important as battlefield tactics.
amateur officers played an important role in both armies as commanders of volunteer regiments.
in both north and south such men were usually economic or social leaders in their communities who appointed themselves officers and rounded up troops to lead.
this system was responsible for recruiting considerable numbers of men into the armies of the two nations.
only occasionally however did it produce officers of real ability.
the role of sea power the union had an overwhelming advantage in naval power and it gave its navy two important roles in the war.
one was enforcing a blockade of the southern coast which the president ordered on april 19 1861.
the other was assisting the union armies in field operations.
the civil war 383 the blockade of the south was never fully effective but it had a major impact on the confederacy nevertheless.
the u s the union navy could generaby keep oceangoing blockade ships out confederate ports.
for a time small blockade runners continued to slip through.
but gradually federal forces tightened the blockade by seizing the ports themselves.
the last important port in confederate hands wilmington north carolina fell to the union early in 1865.
the confederates made bold attempts to break the blockade with new weapons.
foremost among them was an ironclad warship constructed by plating with iron a former u s frigate the merrimac which the yankees had scuttled in ironclads norfolk harbor when virginia seceded.
on march 8 1862 the refitted merrimac renamed the virginia left norfolk to attack a blockading squadron of wooden ships at nearby hampton roads.
it destroyed two of the ships and scattered the rest.
but the union government had already built ironclads of its own.
and one of them the monitor arrived off the coast of virginia only a few hours after the virginias dramatic foray.
the next day it met the virginia in the first battle between ironclad ships.
neither vessel was able to sink the other but the monitor put an end to the virginias raids and preserved the blockade.
the confederacy experimented as well with other naval innovations such as small torpedo boats and hand powered submarines.
but despite occasional small successes with these new weapons the south never managed to overcome the unions naval advantages.
as a supporter of land operations the union navy was particularly important in the western theater of war the vast region between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river where the major rivers were navigable by large vessels.
the navy transported supplies and troops and joined in attacking confederate strong points.
with no significant navy of its own the south could defend only with fixed land fortifications which proved no match for the mobile land and water forces of the union.
europe and the disunited states judah p benjamin the confederate secretary of state for most of the war was a clever and intelligent man but he confined most of his energy to routine administrative tasks.
william seward his counterpart in washington gradually became one of the great american secretaries of state.
he had invaluable assistance from charles francis adams the american minister to london who had inherited the considerable diplomatic talents of his father john quincy adams and his grandfather john adams.
at the beginning of the war the ruling classes of englan d france the two nations whose support was most crucia to both sides were generally sympathetic to the confederacy for several reasons.
the two nations imported much southern ctton for their textile industries they were eager to we the united states an increasingly powerful commercia and some british and french citizens admired the supposedly aristocratic social order of the south which they believed resembled the hierarchical structures of their own societies.
but france was unwilling to take sides in the conflict unless england did so first.
and in england the government was reluctant to act because there was powerful popular support for the union.
important english liberals such as john bright and richard cobden considered the war a struggle between free and slave labor and urged their followers to support the union cause.
the politically conscious but largely unenfranchised workers in britain expressed their sympathy for the north frequently and unmistakably in mass meetings in resolutions and through their champions in parliament.
after lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation these groups worked particularly avidly for the union.
southern leaders hoped to counter the strength of the british antislavery forces by arguing that access to southern king cotton ctton was vital to the english and french diplomacy textile industries.
but this king cotton diplomacy on which the confederacy had staked so many of its hopes failed.
english manufacturers had a surplus of both raw cotton and finished goods on hand in 1861 and could withstand a temporary loss of access to american cotton.
later as the supply of american cotton began to diminish both england and france managed to keep some of their mills open by importing cotton from egypt india and other sources.
equally important english workers the people most seriously threatened by the cotton shortage did not clamor to have the blockade broken.
even most of the 500 000 english textile workers thrown out of jobs as a result of mill closings continued to support the north.
in the end therefore no european nation offered diplomatic recognition to the confederacy or intervened in the war.
no nation wanted to antagonize the united states unless the confederacy seemed likely to win and the south never came close enough to vic tory to convince its potential allies to support it.
even so there was considerable tension and on occasion near hostilities between the united states and britain beginning in the first days of the war.
great britain declared itself neutral as soon as the fighting began followed by france and other nations.
the union government was furious neutrality implied that the two sides to the conflict had equal stature.
leaders in washington were insisting that the conflict was simply a domestic insurrection not a war between two legitimate governments.
a more serious crisis the so called trent affair began in late 1861.
two confederate diplomats james m mason and john slidell had slipped through the then ineffective union blockade to havana cuba where they boarded an english steamer the trent for england.
waiting in cuban waters was the american frigate san jacinto commanded by the impetuous charles wilkes.
acting without authorization wilkes stopped the british vessel arrested the diplomats and carried them in triumph to boston.
the british government demanded the release of the prisoners reparations and an apology.
lincoln and seward aware that wilkes had violated trent affair baseball and the civil war i b t before the great urban stadiums long before the lights and the cameras and the cj tj multimillion dollar salaries long before the little leagues and the high school and college teams baseball was the most popular game in america.
and during the civil war it was a treasured pastime for soldiers and for thousands of men and some women behind the lines in both north and south.
the legend that baseball was invented by abner doubleday who probably never even saw the game came from albert g spalding a patriotic sporting goods manufacturer eager to prove that the game had purely american origins and to dispel the notion that it came from england.
in fact baseball was derived from a variety of earlier games especially the english pastimes of cricket and rounders.
american baseball took its own distinctive form beginning in the 1840s when alexander cartwright a shipping clerk formed the new york knickerbockers laid out a diamond shaped field with four bases and declared that batters with three strikes were out and that teams with three outs were retired.
cartwright moved west in search of gold in 1849 ultimately grew rich and settled finally in hawaii where he brought the game to americans in the pacific.
but the game did not languish in his absence.
henry chadwick an english born journalist spent much of the 1850s popularizing the game and regularizing its rules.
by 1860 baseball was being played by college students and irish workers by urban elites and provincial farmers by people of all classes and ethnic groups from new england to louisiana.
it was also attracting the attention of women.
students at vassar college formed ladies teams in the 1860s and in philadelphia free black men formed the first of what would become a great network of african american baseball teams the pythians.
from the beginning they were barred from playing against most white teams.
when young men marched off to war in 1861 some took their bats and balls with them.
almost from the start of the fighting soldiers in both armies took advantage of idle moments to lay out baseball diamonds and organize games.
there were games in prison camps games on the white house lawn where union soldiers were sometimes billeted.
and games on battlefields that were sometimes interrupted by gunfire and cannonfire.
it is astonishing how indifferent a person can become to danger a soldier wrote home to ohio in 1862.
the report of musketry is heard but a very little distance from us.
yet over there on the other side of the road is most of our company playing bat ball.
after a skirmish in texas another union soldier lamented that in addition to casualties his company had lost the only baseball in alexandria texas.
far from discouraging baseball military commanders and the u s sanitary commission the union armys medical arm actively encouraged the game during the war.
it would they believed help keep up the soldiers morale.
away from the battlefield baseball continued to flourish.
in new york city games between local teams drew crowds of ten or twenty thousand.
the national association of baseball players founded in 1859 had recruited ninety one clubs in ten northern states by maritime law and unwilling to risk war with england stalled the negotiations until american public opinion had cooled off then released the diplomats with an indirect apology.
a second diplomatic crisis lasted for years.
unable to construct large vessels itself the confederacy bought six ships known as commerce destroyers from british shipyards.
the best known of them were the alabama the florida and the shenandoah.
the united states protested that this sale of military equipment to a belligerent violated the laws of neutrality and the protests became the basis after the war of damage claims by the united states against great britain.
the american west and the war except for texas which joined the confederacy all the western states and territories remained officially loyal to the union but not without controversy and conflict.
southerners and southern sympathizers were active throughout the west.
and in some places there was actual combat between unionists and secessionists.
there was particularly vicious fighting in kansas and missouri the scene of so much bitterness before the war.
the same pro slavery and free state forces who had fought one another in the 1850s continued to do so with even more deadly results.
william c quantrill an ohio native who had spent 384 guerrilla war in the west band were an much of his youth in the west became a captain in the confederate army after he organized a band of guerrilla fighters mostly teenage boys with which he terrorized areas around the kansas missouri border.
quantrill and his exceptionally murderous group notorious for killing almost everyone in their path.
their most infamous act was a siege of lawrence kansas during which they slaughtered 150 civilians adults and children alike.
union troops killed quantrill shortly after the end of the war.
union sympathizers in kansas organized in bands known as the jayhawkers were only marginally less savage as they moved across western missouri exacting reprisals for the actions of quantrill and other confederate guerrillas.
one jayhawk unit was jointly commanded by the son of john brown and the brother of susan b anthony men who brought the fervor of abolitionists to their work.
even without a major battle the border areas of kansas and missouri were among the bloodiest and most terrorized places in the united states during the civil war.
not long after the war began confederate agents tried to negotiate alliances with the five civilized tribes living in indian territory later oklahoma in hopes of recruiting their support against union forces in the west.
the indians themselves were divided.
some wanted to support the south both because they resented the way the u s government had treated them and r 1865 a north western association of baseball players organized in chicago in 1865 indicated that the game was becoming well established in the west as well.
in brooklyn william cammeyer drained a skating pond on his property built a board fence around it and created the first enclosed baseball field in america the union grounds.
he charged 10 cents admission.
the professionalization of the game was under way.
despite the commercialization and spectacle that became associated with baseball in the years after the civil war the game remained for many americans what it was to millions of young men fighting in the most savage war in the nations history an american passion that at times even if briefly erased the barriers dividing groups from one another.
officers and men forget for a time the differences in rank a massachusetts private wrote in 1863 and indulge in the invigorating sport with a schoolboy s ardor.

how could a competitive game of baseball erase the barriers dividing groups from one another.
the united states today is engaged in wars in iraq and afghanistan.
are the cultural pastimes or recreations available to the men and women fighting these wars to help relieve the stress of war and bridge the differences between the opposing sides as successful in these aims as was baseball during the civil war.
why or why not.
baseball during the civil war crossed the lines of cultural differences between the north and the south.
does baseball today professional or amateur continue to cross lines of cultural differences.
because some tribal leaders were themselves slaveholders.
but other indians supported the north out of a general hostility to slavery in both the south and their own nation.
one result of these divisions was a civil war within indian territory.
another was that indian regiments fought for both the union and the confederacy during the war.
but the tribes themselves never formally allied themselves with either side.
the course of battle in the absence of direct intervention by the european powers the two contestants in america were left to resolve the con j igh flict between themselves.
they did so in four casualties long years of bloody combat that produced more carnage than any war in american history before or since.
more than 618 000 americans died in the civil war far more than the 115 000 who perished in world war i or the 318 000 who died in world war il more indeed than died in all other american wars combined prior to vietnam.
there were nearly 2 000 deaths for every 100 000 of population during the civil war.
in world war i the comparable figure was 109 deaths in world war ii 241 deaths.
massive death and along with it massive grief shadowed both north and south during and after the war.
despite the gruesome cost the civil war has become the most romanticized and the most intently studied of all american wars.
in part that is because the conflict produced in addition to terrible fatalities a series of military campaigns of classic strategic interest and a series of military leaders who displayed unusual brilliance and daring.
the technology of battle much of what happened on the battlefield in the civil war was a result of new technologies that transformed the nature of combat.
the civil war has often been called the first modern war and the first total war.
the great conflict between the north and the south was unlike any war fought before it and it suggested what warfare would be like in the future.
the most obvious change in the character of warfare in the 1860s was the nature of the armaments that both sides used in battle.
among the most important was the introduction of repeating weapons.
samuel colt had patented a repeating pistol the revolver in 1835 but more important for military purposes was the repeating rifle introduced in 1860 by oliver winchester.
also important were greatly improved cannons and artillery a result of advances in iron and steel technology of the previous decades.
repeating weapons 31 t america in the world the consolidation of nations m tt d american civil war was an event largely rooted in conditions particular to the united 1 h u states.
but it was also a part of a worldwide movement in the nineteenth century to create large consolidated nations.
a commitment to preserving the union to consolidating rather than dismantling the nation was one of the principal motives for the north s commitment to fighting a war against the seceding states.
similar efforts at expansion consolidation and unification were occurring in many other nations around the same time.
the consolidation of nation states was of course not new to the nineteenth century.
the revolutions in america and france in the late eighteenth century and the subsequent strengthening of the french concept of nationhood under napoleon in the early nineteenth century inspired new nationalist enthusiasms in other parts of europe.
nationalist sentiment also grew among peoples who the unification of italy this engraving shows the battle of volturno which was really a series of skirmishes that took place in september and october 1860.
the main battle between garibaldi s volunteers and the troops of the kingdom of the two sicilies occurred on october 1.
although the immediate aftermath of the battle left garibaldi s forces exhausted they did go on to successfully unify italy under king victor emmanuel ii.
italy tarker archive the image works shared language culture ethnicity and tradition and who came to believe that a consolidated nation was the best vehicle for strengthening their common bonds.
in 1848 a wave of nationalist revolutions erupted in italy france and austria challenging the imperial powers that many europeans believed were subjugating national cultures.
those revolutions failed but they helped lay the groundwork for the two most important national consolidations of nineteenth century europe.
one of these consolidations occurred in germany which was divided into numerous small independent states in the early nineteenth century but where popular sentiment for german unification had been growing for decades.
it was spurred in part by new histories of the german volk people and by newly constructed images of german traditions visible in such literature as the grimms fairy tales an effort to record and popularize german folk traditions and make them the basis of a shared sense of a common past.
in 1862 king wilhelm i of prussia the leader of one of the most powerful of the scattered german states appointed an aristocratic landowner otto von bismarck as his prime minister bismarck exploited the growing nationalism throughout the various german states and helped develop a strong popular base for unification.
he did so in part by launching prussian wars against denmark austria and france wars prussia easily won inspiring pride in german power that extended well beyond prussia the franco prussian war of 1870 was particularly important because prussia fought it to take possession of the french provinces of alsace and lorraine provinces the prussians claimed were part of the german national community because its people although legally french citizens were ethnically and linguistically german.
in 1871 capitalizing on the widespread nationalist sentiment the war had created throughout the german speaking states bismarck persuaded the german king to proclaim himself emperor or kaiser of a new empire that united all german peoples except those in austria and switzerland.
these devastating advances in the effectiveness of arms an artillery changed the way soldiers in the field fought.
it wa now impossibly deadly to fight battles as they had been fough for centuries with lines of infantry soldiers standing erect ii the field firing volleys at their opponents until one side with drew.
fighting in that way now produced almost inconceiv able slaughter and soldiers quickly learned that the prope position for combat was staying low to the ground and behin cover.
for the first time in the history of organized warfare infantry did not fight in formation and the battlefield became a more chaotic place.
gradually the deadliness of the new weapons encouraged armies on both sides to spend a great deal of time building elaborate fortifications and trenches to protect themselves from enemy fire.
the sieges of vicksburg and petersburg the defense of richmond and many other sieges led to the construction of vast fortifications around the civil war 387 the second great european movement for national unification occurred in italy which had long been divided into small kingdoms city states and regions controlled by the vatican.
beginning in the early nineteenth century italian nationalists formed what became known as the young italy movement under the leadership of giuseppe mazzini.
the movement demanded an end to foreign control in italy and the unification of the italian people into a single nation.
peoples with common language culture and tradition mazzini believed should be free to unite and govern themselves.
more important than this growing popular nationalism as a cause of italian unification were the efforts of powerful and ambitious leaders.
the most powerful italian state in the mid nineteenth century was the kingdom of the piedmont and sardinia in the northwestern part of the peninsula.
its king victor emmanuel ii appointed his own version of bismarck camillo di cavour as prime minister in 1852.
cavour joined forces with nationalists in other areas of italy to drive the spanish and the austrians out of italian territory.
having first won independence for northern italy cavour joined forces with the southern nationalist leader giuseppe garibaldi who helped win independence in the south and then agreed to a unification of the entire italian nation under victor emmanuel ii in 1860.
other nations in these years were also trying to create preserve and strengthen nation states.
some failed to do so russia for example despite the reform efforts of several tsars never managed to create a stable nation state from among its broad and diverse peoples.
but others succeeded meiji japan for example instituted a series of reforms in the 1880s and 1890s that created a powerful new japanese nation state.
in fighting and winning the civil war the nationalists of the northern parts of the united states not only preserved the unity of their nation.
they also became part of a movement toward the consolidation of national cultures and national territories that extended through many areas of the globe.

cities and attacking armies.
they were the predecessors to t e great network of trenches that became so central a part o world war i.
other weapons technologies were less central to the tng of the war but important nevertheless.
there was spora use of the relatively new technology of hot air balloons em ployed intermittently to provide a view of enemy formations in the field.
during one battle a union balloonist took a teie graph line aloft with him in his balloon and tapped out messages about troop movements to the commanders below.
ironclad ships such as the merrimac or virginia and the monitor torpedoes and submarine technology all suggested the dramatic changes that would soon overtake naval warfare although none played a major role in the civil war.
critical to the conduct of the war however were two other relatively new technologies the railroad and the telegraph.
the railroad was particularly important in a war in importance of which millions of soldiers were being mo the railroad bilized and transferred to the front and in which a single field army could number as many as 250 000 men.
transporting such enormous numbers of soldiers and the supplies necessary to sustain them would have been almost impossible without railroads.
but they also limited mobility.
railroad lines and stations are of course in fixed positions.
commanders therefore were forced to organize their campaigns around the location of the railroads whether the location was optimal or not.
the impact of the telegraph on the war was limited both by the scarcity of qualified telegraph operators and by the difficulty of bringing telegraph wires into the fields where battles were being fought.
the situation improved somewhat after the new u s military telegraph corps headed by thomas scott and andrew carnegie trained and employed over 1 200 operators.
gradually too both the union and confederate armies learned to string telegraph wires along the routes of their troops so that field commanders were able to stay in close touch with one another during battles.
both the north and the south sent spies behind enemy lines who tried to tap the telegraph lines of their opponents and send important information back about troop movements and formations.
the telegraph the opening clashes 1861 the union and the confederacy fought their first major battle of the war in northern virginia.
a union army of over 30 000 men under the command of general irvin mcdowell was stationed just outside washington.
about thirty miles away at the town of manassas was a slightly smaller confederate army under general p g t beauregard.
if the northern army could destroy the southern one union leaders believed the war might end at once.
in mid july mcdowell marched his inexperienced troops toward manassas.
beauregard moved his troops behind bull run a small stream north of manassas and called for reinforcements which reached him the day before the battle.
the two armies were now approximately the same size.
on july 21 in the first battle of bull run or first battle of manassas mcdowell almost succeeded in dispersing the confederate forces.
but the southerners stopped a last strong union assault and then began a savage counterattack.
the union troops exhausted after hours of hot hard fighting suddenly panicked.
they first battle of bull run broke ranks and retreated chaotically.
388 chapter 14 wilsons creek mcdowell was unable to reorganize them and he had to order a retreat to washington a disorderly withdrawal complicated by the presence along the route of many civilians who had ridden down from the capital picnic baskets in hand to watch the battle from nearby hills.
the confederates as disorganized by victory as the union forces were by defeat and short of supplies and transportation did not pursue.
the battle was a severe blow to union morale and to president lincolns confidence in his officers.
it also dispelled the illusion that the war would be a brief one.
elsewhere in 1861 union forces were achieving some small but significant victories.
in missouri rebel forces gathered behind governor claiborne jackson and other state officials who wanted to secede from the union.
nathaniel lyon who com manded a small regular army force in st louis moved his troops into southern missouri to face the secessionists.
on august 10 at the battle of wilsons creek lyon was defeated and killed but not before he had seriously weakened the striking power of the confederates.
union forces were subsequently able to hold most of the state.
meanwhile a union force under george b mcclellan moved east from ohio into western virginia.
by the end of 1861 it had liberated the anti secession mountain people of the region.
they created their own state government loyal to the union and were admitted to the union as west virginia in 1863.
the occupation of western virginia was of limited military value since the mountains cut the area off from the rest of virginia.
it was however an important symbolic victory for the north.
the western theater after the first battle of bull run military operations in the east settled into a long and frustrating stalemate.
the first decisive operations in 1862 occurred in the west.
union forces were trying to seize control of the southern mississippi river which would divide the confederacy and give the north easy transportation into the heart of the south.
northern soldiers advanced on the river from both the north and south moving downriver from kentucky and upriver from the gulf of mexico toward new orleans.
in april a union squadron of ironclads and wooden vessels commanded by david g farragut gathered in the gulf of mexico then smashed past weak confederate forts near the kt mouth of the mississippi and from there captured sailed up to new orleans which was defenseless because the confederate high command had expected the attack to come from the north.
the city surrendered on april 25 the first major union victory and an important turning point in the war.
from then on the mouth of the mississippi was closed to confederate trade and the souths largest city and most important banking center was in union hands.
farther north in the western theater confederate troops under the command of albert sidney johnston were stretched out in a long defensive line centered at two forts in tennessee fort henry and fort donelson on the tennessee and cumberland rivers respectively.
but the forts were well behind the main southern flanks a fatal weakness that union commanders recognized and exploited.
early in 1862 ulysses s grant attacked fort henry whose defenders awed by the ironclad riverboats accompanying the union army surrendered with almost no resistance on february 6.
grant then moved both his naval and ground forces to fort donelson where the confederates put up a stronger fight but finally on february 16 had to surrender.
by cracking the confederate center grant had gained control of river communications and forced confederate forces out of kentucky and half of tennessee.
with about 40 000 men grant now advanced south along the tennessee river to seize control of railroad lines vital to the confederacy.
from pittsburg landing he marched to shiloh nearby shiloh tennessee where a force almost equal to his own commanded by albert sidney johnston and p g t beauregard caught him by surprise.
the result was the battle of shiloh april 6 7.
in the first days fighting during which johnston was killed the southerners drove grant back to the river.
but the next day reinforced by 25 000 fresh troops grant recovered the lost ground and forced beauregard to withdraw.
after the narrow union victory at shiloh northern forces occupied corinth mississippi the hub of several important railroads and established control of the mississippi river as far south as memphis.
braxton bragg who succeeded johnston as commander of the confederate army in the west gathered his forces at chattanooga in eastern tennessee which the confederacy still controlled.
he hoped to win back the rest of the state and then move north into kentucky.
but first he had to face a union army commanded by don carlos buell and later william s rosecrans whose assignment was to capture chattanooga.
the two armies maneuvered for advantage inconclusively in northern tennessee and southern kentucky for several months until they finally met december 31 january 2 in the battle of murfreesboro or stones river.
bragg was forced to withdraw to the south his campaign a failure.
by the end of 1862 union forces had made considerable progress in the west.
but the major conflict remained in the east where they were having much less success.
the virginia front 1862 union operations were being directed in 1862 by george b mcclellan commander of the army of the potomac and the most controversial general of the war.
mcclellan was a superb trainer of men but he often appeared reluctant to commit his troops to battle.
opportunities for important engagements came and went and mcclellan seemed never to george ta e advantage of themclaiming always mcclellan r at his preparations were not yet complete or that the moment was not right.

the winter of 1861 1862 mcclellan concentrated on his army of 150 000 men near washington.
finally gned a spring campaign whose purpose was to cap e confederate capital at richmond.
but instead of 1 overland directly toward richmond mcclellan a complicated roundabout route that he thought circumvent the confederate defenses.
the navy carry his troops down the potomac to a peninsula east htond between the york and james rivers.
the army approach the city from there.
it became known as the alar campaign.
mcclellan began the campaign with only part of his army.
approximately 100 000 men accompanied him down the potomac.
another 30 000 under general irvin mcdowell remained behind to protect washington.
mcclellan insisted that washington was safe as long as he was threatening richmond and finally persuaded lincoln to promise to send him the additional men.
but before the president could do so a confederate army under thomas j.
stonewall jackson changed his plans.
jackson staged a rapid march north through the shenandoah valley as if he were planning to cross the potomac and attack washington.

in the brilliant valley campaign of may 4 june 9 1862 jackson defeated two separate union forces and slipped away before mcdowell could catch him.
meanwhile confederate troops under joseph e johnston seven pines were attacking mcclellans advancing army outside richmond.
but in the two day battle of fair oaks or seven pines may 31 june 1 they could not repel the union forces.
johnston badly wounded was replaced by robert e lee who then recalled stonewall jackson from the shenandoah valley.
with a combined force of 85 000 to face mcclellans 100 000 lee launched a new offensive known as the battle of the seven days june 25 july 1.
lee wanted to cut mcclellan off from his base on the york river and then destroy the isolated union army.
but mcclellan fought his way across the peninsula and set up a new base on the james.
there with naval support the army of the potomac was safe.
mcclellan was now only twenty five miles from richmond with a secure line of water communications and thus in a good position to renew the campaign.
time and again however he found reasons for delay.
instead of replacing mcclellan with a more aggressive commander lincoln finally ordered the army to move to northern virginia and join a smaller force under john pope.
the president hoped to begin a new offensive against richmond on the direct overland route that he himself had always preferred.
as the army of the potomac left the peninsula by water lee moved north with the army of northern virginia to strike pope before mcclellan could join him.
pope was as rash as mcclellan was cautious and he attacked the approaching confederates without waiting for the arrival of all of mcclellans troops.
in the ensuing second battle of bull run or second battle of manassas august 29 30 lee threw back the assault and routed popes army which fled to washington.
with hopes for an overland campaign against richmond now in disarray lincoln removed pope from command and put mcclellan in charge of all the union forces in the region.
lee soon went on the offensive again heading north through western maryland and mcclellan moved out to meet him.
mcclellan had the good luck to get a copy of antietam lees orders which revealed that a part of the confederate army under stonewall jackson had separated from the rest to attack harpers ferry.
but instead of attacking quickly before the confederates could recombine mcclellan delayed and gave lee time to pull most of his forces together behind antietam creek near the town of sharpsburg.
there on september 17 in the bloodiest single day engagement of the war mcclellans 87 000 man army repeatedly attacked lees force of 50 000 with enormous casualties on both sides.
six thousand soldiers died and 17 000 sustained injuries.
late in the day just as the confederate line seemed ready to break the last of jacksons troops arrived from harpers ferry to reinforce it.
mcclellan might have broken through with one more assault.
instead he allowed lee to retreat into virginia.
technically antietam was a union victory but in reality it was an opportunity squandered.
in november lincoln finally removed mcclellan from command for good.
mcclellans replacement ambrose e burnside was a shortlived mediocrity.
he tried to move toward richmond by crossing the rappahannock at fredericksburg the strongest defensive point on the river.
there on december 13 he launched a series of attacks against lee all of them bloody all of them hopeless.
after losing a large part of his army burnside withdrew to the north bank of the rappahannock.
he was relieved at his own request.
the progress of the war why did the union with its much larger population and its much better transportation and technology than the confederacy make so little progress in the first two years of the war.
had there been a decisive and dramatic victory by either side early in the war for example a major victory by the union at the first battle of bull run the conflict might have ended quickly by destroying the confederacys morale.
but no such decisive victory occurred in the first two years of the war.
many northerners blamed the military stalemate on timid or incompetent union generals and there was some truth to that view.
but the more important reason for the drawn out conflict was that it was not a traditional war of tactics and military strategy.
it was even if the leaders of both sides were not yet fully aware of it a war of attrition.
winning or losing battles here and there would not determine the outcome of the war.
what would bring the war to a conclusion was the steady destruction of the resources that were necessary for victory.
more than two bloody years of fighting was still to the first connecticut artillery mathew brady s photograph shows the first connecticut artillery at fort richardson virginia.
the library of congress lc b8184 10601 392 chapter 14 come.
but those last years were a testimony to the slow steady deterioration of the confederacy s ability to maintain the war and to the consistent growth of the resources that allowed the union armies to grow steadily stronger.
with the federal blockade growing tighter and tighter the confederacy found it difficult to secure food.
on april 2 1863 a confederate soldier received a letter from richmond from a friend.
something very sad has just happened in richmond she said something that makes me ashamed of all my hats bonnets gowns stationery books magazines dainty food she saw hundreds of young women and men looking for food.
the crowd now rapidly increased and numbered i am sure more than a thousand women and children.
it grew and grew until it reached the dignity of a mob a bread riot.
while i write women and children are still standing in the streets demanding food 1883 year of decision at the beginning of 1863 general joseph hooker was in command of the still formidable army of the potomac whose 120 000 troops remained north of the rappahannock opposite fredericksburg.
but despite his reputation as a fighter his popular nickname was fighting joe hooker showed little resolve as he launched his own campaign in the spring.
taking part of his army hooker crossed the river above fredericksburg and moved toward the town and lees army.
but at the last minute he apparently lost his nerve and drew back to a defensive position in a desolate area of brush and scrub trees known as the wilderness lee had only half as many men as battle of hooker did but he boldly divided his chancellorsville forces for a dual assault on the union army.
in the battle of chancellorsville may 1 5 stonewall jackson attacked the union right and lee himself charged the front.
hooker barely managed to escape with his army.
lee had defeated the union objectives but he had not destroyed the union army.
and his ablest officer jackson was wounded during the battle and subsequently died of pneumonia.
while the union forces were suffering repeated frustrations in the east they were continuing to achieve important vicksburg victories in the west.
in the spring of 1863 ulysses s grant was driving at vicksburg mississippi one of the confederacys two remaining strongholds on the southern mississippi river.
vicksburg was well protected surrounded by rough country on the north and low marshy ground on the west and with good artillery coverage of the river itself.
but in may grant boldly moved men and supplies overland and by water to an area south of the city where the terrain was better.
he then attacked vicksburg from the rear.
six weeks later on july 4 vicksburg whose residents were by then literally starving as a result of a prolonged siege surrendered.
at almost the same time the other confederate strong point on the river port hudson louisiana also surrendered to a union force that had moved north from new orleans.
the union had achieved one nunj t union forces union victory proposed union drive confederate defenses confederate victory louisiana the siege of vicksburg may july 1863 in the spring of 1863 grant began a campaign to win control of the final piece of the mississippi river still controlled by the confederacy.
to do that required capturing the southern stronghold at vicksburg a well defended city sitting above the river.
vicksburg s main defenses were in the north so grant boldly moved men and supplies around the city and attacked it from the south.
eventually he cut off the city s access to the outside world and after a six week siege its residents finally surrendered.
what impact did the combined victories at vicksburg and gettysburg have on northern commitment to the war.
of its basic military aims control of the whole length of the mississippi.
the confederacy was split in two with louisiana arkansas and texas cut off from the other seceded states.
the victories on the mississippi were among the great turning points of the war.
during the siege of vicksburg lee proposed an invasion of pennsylvania which would he argued divert union troops north and remove the pressure on the lower mississippi the civil war 393 july 2 3 1863 confederate forces union federal forces confederate forces union forces roads july 1 1863 confederates under lee s command on july 1 drive federals to south of town gettysburg july 1 3 1863 gettysburg was the most important single battle of the civil war.
the map on the left shows the distribution of union and confederate forces at the beginning of the battle july 1 after lee had driven the northern forces south of town.
the map on the right reveals the pattern of the attacks on july 2 and 3.
note in particular pickett s bold and costly charge whose failure on july 3 was the turning point in the battle and some chroniclers have argued the war.
why did robert e lee believe that an invasion of pennsylvania would advance the confederate cause.
i i surther he argued if he could win a major victory on northern soil england and france might come to the confederacys aid.
the war weary north might even quit the var before vicksburg fell.
in june 1863 lee moved up the shenandoah valley into maryland and then entered pennsylvania.
the union army of ho potomac commanded first by hooker and then by george meade also moved north parallel with the confederates movement staying between lee and washington.
the two irmies finally encountered each other at the small town of j0ttysburg pennsylvania.
there on july 1 3 1863 they ought the most celebrated battle of the war.
meades army established a strong well protected position n the hills south of the town.
the confident and combative gettysburg lee attacked even though his army was outnumbered 75 000 to 90 000.
his first issault on the union forces on cemetery ridge failed.
a day ater he ordered a second larger effort.
in what is remembered ls picketts charge a force of 15 000 confederate soldiers dvanced for almost a mile across open country while being swept by union fire.
only about 5 000 made it up the ridge and this remnant finally had to surrender or retreat.
by now lee had lost nearly a third of his army.
on july 4 the same day as the surrender of vicksburg he withdrew from gettysburg another major turning point in the war.
never again were the weakened confederate forces able to threaten northern territory seriously.
before the end of 1863 there was a third important turning point this one in tennessee.
after occupying chattanooga on september 9 union forces under william rosecrans began an unwise pursuit of braggs retreating confederate forces.
bragg was waiting for them just across the georgia line with reinforcements from lees army.
the two armies engaged in the battle of chickamauga september 19 20 one of the few battles in which the confederates enjoyed a numerical superiority 70 000 to 56 000.
union forces could not break the confederate lines and retreated back to chattanooga.
bragg now began a siege of chattanooga itself seizing the heights nearby and cutting off fresh supplies to the 394 chapter 14 battle of chattanooga union forces.
grant came to the rescue.
in the battle of chattanooga november 23 25 the reinforced union army drove the confederates back into georgia.
northern troops then occupied most of eastern tennessee.
union forces had now achieved a second important objective control of the tennessee river.
four of the eleven confederate states were now effectively cut off from the southern nation.
no longer could the confederacy hope to win independence through a decisive military victory.
they could hope to win only by holding on and exhausting the northern will to fight.
the last stage 1864 1863 by the beginning of 1864 ulysses s grant had become general in chief of all the union armies.
at long last president lincoln had found a commander whom he could rely on to pursue the war doggedly and tenaciously.
grant was not a subtle strategic or tactical general he believed in using the north s overwhelming advantage in troops and material resources to overwhelm the south.
he was not afraid to absorb massive casualties as long as he was inflicting similar casualties on his opponents.
grant planned two great offensives for 1864.
in virginia the army of the potomac technically under meades command but really now under grants would advance toward richmond and force lee into a decisive battle.
in georgia grant s strategy western army under william tecumseh sherman would advance east toward atlanta and destroy the remaining confederate force farther south which was now under the command of joseph e johnston.
the northern campaign began when the army of the potomac 115 000 strong plunged into the rough wooded wilderness area of northwestern virginia in pursuit of lees 75 000 man army.
after avoiding an engagement for several weeks lee turned grant back in the battle of the wilderness may 5 7.
but grant was undeterred.
without stopping to rest or reorganize he resumed his march toward richmond.
he met lee again in the bloody five day battle of spotsylvania court lee surrenders to grant appomattox court house april 9 1865 april 1 1865 railroad union forces confederate forces rt n confederate defense line confederate victory union victory ml 4 0 1 l virginia campaigns 1864 1865 from the confederate defeat and retreat from gettysburg until the end of the war f u s grant was commander of all union forces and had taken over the army of the potomac.

396 chapter 14 i j i i house in which 12 000 union troops and a large but unknown number of confederates died or were wounded.
despite the enormous losses grant kept moving.
but victory continued to elude him.
lee kept his army between grant and the confederate capital and on june 1 3 repulsed the union forces again just northeast of richmond at cold harbor.
the month long wilderness campaign had cost grant 55 000 men killed wounded and captured to lees 31 000.
and richmond still had not fallen.
grant now changed his strategy.
he moved his army east of richmond bypassing the capital altogether and headed south toward the railroad center at petersburg.
if he could seize petersburg he could cut off the capitals communications with the rest of the confederacy.
but petersburg had strong defenses and once lee came to the citys relief the assault became a prolonged siege which lasted nine months.
in georgia meanwhile sherman was facing less ferocious resistance.
with 90 000 men he confronted confederate forces of 60 000 under johnston who was unwilling to risk a direct engagement.
as sherman advanced johnston tried to delay him by maneuvering.
the two armies fought only one real battle at kennesaw mountain northwest of atlanta on june 27 where johnston scored an impressive victory.
even so he was unable to stop the union advance toward atlanta.
capture of president davis replaced johnston with atlanta the combative john b.
hood who twice daringly attacked shermans army but accomplished nothing except seriously weakening his own forces.
sherman took atlanta on september 2.
news of the victory electrified the north and helped unite the previously divided republican party behind president lincoln.
a young union drummer boy william bircher left an account of the burning of atlanta.
at night we destroyed the city by fire he wrote.
a grand and awful spectacle it presented to the beholder.
the heaven was one expanse of lurid fire the air was filled with flying burning cinders.
buildings covering two hundred acres were in ruins or in flames every instant there was the sharp detonation of the smothered booming sound of exploding shells and powder concealed in the buildings and then the sparks and flames would shoot up into the black and red roof.
i heard the real fine band of the thirty third massachusetts playing john browns soul goes marching on hood now tried unsuccessfully to draw sherman out of atlanta by moving back up through tennessee and threatening an invasion of the north.
sherman did not take the bait.
but he did send union troops to reinforce nashville.
in the battle of nashville on december 15 16 1864 northern forces practically destroyed what was left of hoods army.
meanwhile sherman had left atlanta to begin his soon to be famous march to the sea.

he sought not only to deprive the confederate army of war materials and railroad communications but also to break the will of the southern people by burning towns and plantations along his route.
by december 20 he had reached savannah which surrendered two days later.
sherman offered it to president lincoln as a christmas gift.
early in 1865 having left savannah largely undamaged sherman continued his destructive march northward through south carolina.
he was virtually unopposed until he was well inside north carolina where a small force under johnston could do no more than cause a brief delay.
in april 1865 grants army of the potomac still engaged in the prolonged siege at petersburg finally captured the civil war 397 appomattox a vital railroad junction southwest of the courthouse town.
without rail access to the south cut off from other confederate forces lee could no longer hope to defend richmond.
with the remnant of his army now about 25 000 men lee began moving west in the forlorn hope of finding a way around the union forces so that he could head south and link up with johnston in north carolina.
but the union army pursued him and blocked his escape route.
finally recognizing that further bloodshed was futile lee arranged to meet grant at a private home in the small town of appomattox court house virginia.
there on april 9 he surrendered what was left of his forces.
nine days later near durham north carolina johnston surrendered to sherman.
in military terms at least the long war was now effectively over even though jefferson davis refused to accept defeat.
he fled south from richmond and was finally captured in georgia.
a few southern diehards continued to fight but even their resistance collapsed before long.
well before the last shot was fired the difficult process of reuniting the shattered nation had begun.
the war ensured the permanence of the union but many other issues remained far from settled.
what would happen to the freedmen the term used for slaves who were now liberated.
could the south and the north reconcile.
would the massive industrial growth in the north during the civil war spread to the south or would the south remain an agrarian region with much less wealth than in the north.
the end of the war was the beginning of more than a generation of struggle to determine the legacy of the civil war.
looking back the american civil war began with high hopes and high ideals on both sides.
in both the north and the south thousands of men enthusiastically enlisted in local regiments marched down the streets of their towns and cities dressed in uniforms of blue or gray to the cheers of family friends and neighbors and went off to war.
four years later more than 600 000 of them were dead and many more maimed and traumatized for life.
a fight for principles and ideals a fight few people had thought would last more than a few months had become one of the longest wars and by far the bloodiest war in american history before or since.
during the first two years of fighting the confederate forces seemed to have all the advantages.
they were fighting on their own soil.
their troops seemed more committed to the cause than those of the north.
their commanders were exceptionally talented while union forces were for a time erratically led.
gradually however the unions advantages began to assert themselves.
the union had a stabler political system led by one of the greatest leaders in the nations history as op posed to the confederacys untested government led by a relatively weak president.
it had a much larger population a far more developed industrial economy superior financial institu tions and a better railroad system.
by the middle of 1863 the tide of war had changed and over the next two years union forces gradually wore down the confederate armies before finally triumphing in 1865.
the norths victory was not just a military one.
the war strengthened the norths economy giving a spur to industry and railroad development.
it greatly weakened the souths by de impact of stroying millions of dollars of property and the norths depleting the regions young male popula victory tion.
southerners had gone to war in pan because of their fears of growing northern dominance.
the war itself ironically confirmed and strengthened that dominance.
there was no doubt by 1865 that the future of the united states lay in the growth of industry and commerce which would occur for many years primarily outside the south.
but most of all the civil war was a victory for the millions of african american slaves over whose plight the conflict had largely begun in the first place.
the war produced abraham lincolns epochal emancipation proclamation and later the thirteenth amendment to the constitution which abolished slavery.
it also encouraged hundreds of thousands of slaves to free themselves to desert their masters and seek refuge behind union lines at times to fight in the union armies.
the future of the freed slaves was not to be without challenges and hardships but 3 5 million people who had once lived in bondage emerged from the war as free men and women.

the genius of freedom this 1874 lithograph portrays a series of important moments in the history of african americans in the south during reconstruction among them the participation of black soldiers in the civil war a speech by a black representative in the north carolina legislature and the movement of african american workers from slavery into a system of free labor.
it also portrays some of the white leaders among them lincoln and charles sumner who had promoted the cause of the freedmen.
the library of congress lc usz62 2247 setting the stage few periods in the history of the united states have produced as much bitterness or created such enduring controversy as the era of reconstruction the years following the civil war when americans attempted to reunite their shattered nation.
to many white southerners reconstruction was a destructive experience a time when vindictive northerners inflicted humiliation and revenge on the prostrate south and unnecessarily delayed a genuine reunion of the sections.
northern defenders of reconstruction in contrast argued that their policies and forceful federal intervention were the only way to keep unrepentant confederates from restoring southern society as it had been before the war.
to most african americans at the time and to many people of all races since reconstruction was notable for other reasons.
neither a vicious tyranny as white southerners charged nor a thoroughgoing reform as many northerners claimed it was rather a small but important first step in the effort by former slaves to secure civil rights and economic power.
reconstruction did not provide african americans with either the legal protections or the material resources to assure them real equality.
when it came to an end finally in the late 1870s the freed slaves found themselves abandoned by the federal government to face a system of economic peonage and legal subordination.
yet for all its shortcomings reconstruction did help african americans create institutions and legal precedents that in the twentieth century would become the basis for their efforts to win freedom and equality.
the problems of peacemaking in 1865 as it became clear that the war was almost over no one in washington had yet formed a plan for what would happen to the defeated south.
lincoln could not negotiate a treaty with the confederate government he continued to insist that the confederate government had no legal right to exist.
yet neither could he simply readmit the southern states into the union as if nothing had happened.
devastated south the aftermath of war and emancipation the civil war was a catastrophe for the south with no parallel in americas experience as a nation.
towns had been gutted plantations burned fields neglected bridges and railroads destroyed.
the many white southerners stripped of their slaves through emancipation and stripped of the capital they had invested in now worthless confederate bonds and currency had almost no personal property.
many families had to rebuild their fortunes without the help of adult males massive numbers of whom had died in the war.
some white southerners faced starvation and homelessness.
the more than 258 000 confederate soldiers who had died in the war constituted over 20 percent of the adult white male population of the region thousands more returned home wounded or sick.
almost all surviving white southerners had lost people close to them in the fighting.
a cult myth of the f ritualized mourning developed throughout the region in the late 1860s lost cause particularly among white women many of whom wore mourning clothes and jewelry for two years or longer.
at the same time white southerners began to romanticize the lost cause and its leaders and to look back nostalgically at the south as it had existed before the terrible disruptions of war.
such confederate heroes as robert e lee stonewall jackson and later jefferson davis were treated with extraordinary reverence almost as religious figures.
communities throughout the south built elaborate monuments in town squares to commemorate their war dead.
the tremendous sense of loss that pervaded the white south reinforced the determination of many whites to protect what remained of their now vanished world.
if conditions were bad for many southern whites they were worse for most southern blacks the 4 million men and women emerging from bondage.
some of them had also seen service during he war as servants to confederate officers or as teamsters and laborers for the southern armies.
reconstruction and the new south 401 iichmond 1865 by the time union forces captured richmond in early 1865 the confederate capital had been under siege for months and much of the city lay in ruins as this photograph eveals.
on april 4 president lincoln accompanied by his son tad visited richmond.
as he walked through the streets of the shattered city hundreds of former slaves emerged from the rubble to ratch him pass.
no triumphal march of a conqueror could have equalled in moral sublimity the humble manner in which he entered richmond a black soldier serving with the union army wrote.
it tas a great deliverer among the delivered.
no wonder tears came to his eyes.

others had worked as spies or scouts for union forces in the outh.
many more had flocked to the union lines to escape hvery.
even before emancipation thousands of slaves in nany parts of the south had taken advantage of wartime dis uptions to leave their owners and move off in search of freedom.
as soon as the war ended hundreds of thousands more ormer slaves young and old healthy and sick left their plan ations.
some went in search of family members who had been old by their former masters.
but many others had nowhere to o.
some trudged to the nearest town or city roamed the countryside camping at night on the bare ground or gathered around union occupation forces hoping for assistance.
virtually none owned any land or property.
most had no possessions except the clothes they wore.
in 1865 in short southern society was in vast disarray.
blacks and whites men and women faced a future of great uncertainty.
yet all southerners faced this future with some very clear aspirations.
for both blacks and whites reconstruction became a struggle to define the meaning of freedom.
but the former slaves and the defeated whites had very different conceptions of what freedom meant.
competing notions of freedom for african americans freedom meant above all an end to slavery and to all the injustices and humiliation they associated with it.
but it also meant the acquisition of rights and protections that would allow them to live as free men and women in the same way white people did.
if i cannot do like a white man one african american man told his former master wi am not free african americans differed with one another on how to achieve that freedom.
some demanded a redistribution of economic resources especially land because as a convention of alabama freedmen put it in a formal resolution the freedom for property which they hold was nearly all the ex slaves earned by the sweat of our brows others asked simply for legal equality confident that given the same opportunities as white citizens they.
516 chapter 19 and black republican loyalties were equally intense.
to them the party of lincoln remained a bulwark against slavery and treason.
religious and ethnic differences also shaped party loyalties.
the democratic party attracted most of the catholic voters recent immigrants and poorer workers groups that often overlapped.
the republican party appealed to northern protestants citizens of old stock and much of the middle class groups that also had considerable overlap.
among the few substantive issues on which the parties took clearly different stands were matters connected with immigrants.
republicans tended to support measures restricting immigration and to favor temperance legislation which many of them believed would help discipline immigrant communities.
catholics and immigrants viewed such proposals as assaults on them and their cultures and opposed them the democratic party followed their lead.
party identification then was usually more a reflection of cultural inclinations than a calculation of economic interest.
individuals might affiliate with a party because their parents had done so or because it was the party of their region their church or their ethnic group.
cultural basis of party identification in most other respects however the united states in the late nineteenth century was a society without a modern national government.
the most powerful institutions were the two political parties and the bosses and machines that dominated them and the federal courts.
presidents and patronage the power of party bosses had an important effect on the power of the presidency.
the office had great symbolic importance but its occupants were unable to do very much except distribute government appointments.
a new president and his tiny staff had to make almost 100 000 appointments most of them in the post office the only really large government agency and even in that function presidents had limited latitude since they had to avoid offending the various factions within their own parties.
sometimes that proved impossible as the presidency of rutherford b hayes 1877 1881 demonstrated.
by the end of his term two groups the stalwarts led by roscoe conkling of new york and the half breeds captained stalwarts and r half breeds by james g blaine of maine were competing for control of the republican party.
the national government one reason the two parties managed to avoid substantive issues was that the federal government and to some degree state and local governments as well did relatively little.
the government in washington was responsible for delivering the mail maintaining a military conducting foreign policy and collecting tariffs and taxes.
it had few other responsibilities and few institutions with which it could have undertaken additional responsibilities even if it had chosen to do so.
there were significant exceptions.
the federal government had been supporting the economic development of the nation for decades.
in the late nineteenth century that mostly meant giving tremendous subsidies to railroads usually in the form of grants of federal land to encourage them to extend their lines deeper into the nation.
and as president clevelands intervention in the pullman strike suggests the government was also not averse to using its military and police power to protect capitalists from challenges from their workers.
in addition the federal government administered a system of annual pensions for union civil war veterans who had retired from work and for their widows.
at its peak this pension system was making payments to a majority of the male citizens black and white of the north and to many women as well.
some reformers hoped to make the system permanent and universal.
but their efforts failed in part because the civil war pension system was awash in party patronage and corruption.
other reformers believers in good government saw elimination of the pension system as a way to fight graft corruption and party rule.
when the civil war generation died out the pension system died with it.
civil war pension system resident chester a arthur although originally a stalwart and a follower of sce conkling upon becoming president on the assassination of james a garfield chester arthur attempted to reform the spoils system.
the pendleton act passed by congress in quired that some civil service jobs be filled by competitive examinations rather than patronage.
the library of congress lc dig ppmsca 28490 from crisis to empire 517 rhetorically the stalwarts favored traditional professional machine politics while the half breeds favored reform.
in fact both groups were mainly interested in a larger share of the patronage pie.
hayes tried to satisfy both and ended up satisfying neither.
the battle over patronage overshadowed all else during hayess unhappy presidency.
his one important substantive initiative an effort to create a civil service system attracted no support from either party.
and his early announcement that he would not seek reelection only weakened him further.
his popularity in washington was not enhanced by the decision of his wife a temperance advocate widely known as lemonade lucy to ban alcoholic beverages from the white house.
hayess presidency was a study in frustration.
the republicans managed to retain the presidency in 1880 in part because they agreed on a ticket that included a stalwart and a half breed.
they nominated james a garfield a veteran congressman from ohio and a half breed for president and chester a arthur of new york a stalwart for vice president.
the democrats nominated general winfield scott hancock a minor civil war commander with no national following.
benefiting from the end of the recession of 1879 garfield won a decisive electoral victory although his popular vote margin was very thin.
the republicans also captured both houses of congress.
garfield began his presidency by trying to defy the stalwarts in his appointments and by showing support for civil service garfield reform.
he soon found himself embroiled assassinated in an ugly public quarrel with conkling and the stalwarts.
it was never resolved.
on july 2 1881 only four months after his inauguration garfield was shot twice while standing in the washington railroad station by an apparently deranged gunman and unsuccessful office seeker who shouted i am a stalwart and arthur is president now garfield lingered for nearly three months but finally died a victim as much of inept medical treatment as of the wounds themselves.
chester a arthur who succeeded garfield had spent a political lifetime as a devoted skilled and open spoilsman and a close ally of roscoe conkling.
but on becoming president he tried pendleton like hayes and garfield before him to follow act an independent course and even to promote reform aware that the garfield assassination had discredited the traditional spoils system.
to the dismay of the stalwarts arthur kept most of garfields appointees in office and supported civil service reform.
in 1883 congress passed the first national civil service measure the pendleton act which required that some federal jobs be filled by competitive written examinations rather than by patronage.
relatively few offices fell under civil service at first but its reach extended steadily.
cleveland harrison and the tariff in the unsavory election of 1884 the republican candidate for president was senator james g blaine of maine known to his ad orers as the plumed knight but to many others as a symbol of seamy party politics.
a group of disgruntled liberal republicans known by their critics as the mugwumps announced they would bolt the party and support an honest democrat.
rising to the bait the democrats nominated grover cleveland the reform governor of new york.
he differed from blaine on no substantive issues but had acquired a reputation as an enemy of corruption.
in a campaign filled with personal invective what may have decided the election was the last minute introduction of a religious controversy.
shortly before the election a delegation election f protestant ministers called on blaine in of 1884 new york city their spokesman dr samuel burchard referred to the democrats as the party of rum romanism and rebellion blaine was slow to repudiate burchards indiscretion and democrats quickly spread the news that blaine had tolerated a slander on the catholic church.
clevelands narrow victory was probably a result of an unusually heavy catholic vote for the democrats in new york.
cleveland won 219 electoral votes to blaines 182 his popular margin was only 23 000.
grover cleveland was respected if not often liked for his stern and righteous opposition to politicians grafters pressure groups and tammany hall.
he had become famous as the veto governor as an official who was not afraid to say no.
he was the embodiment of an era in which few americans believed the federal government could or should do very much.
cleveland had always doubted the wisdom of protective tariffs.
the existing high rates he believed were responsible for the annual surplus in federal revenues which was tempting congress to pass reckless and extravagant legislation which he frequently vetoed.
in december 1887 therefore he asked congress to reduce the tariff rates.
democrats in the house approved a tariff reduction but senate republicans defiantly passed a bill of their own actually raising the rates.
the resulting deadlock made the tariff an issue in the election of 1888.
the democrats renominated cleveland and supported tariff reductions.
the republicans settled on former senator benjamin harrison of indiana who was obscure but respectable the grandson of president william henry harrison he endorsed high tariffs.
the campaign was the first since the civil war to involve a clear question of economic difference between the parties.
it was also one of the most corrupt and closest elections in american history.
harrison won an electoral majority of 233 to 168 but clevelands popular vote exceeded harrisons by 100 000.
new public issues benjamin harrisons record as president was little more substantial than that of his grandfather who had died a month after taking office.
harrison had few visible convictions and he made no effort to influence congress.
and yet during harrisons passive administration public opinion was beginning to force the government to confront some of the pressing social and economic issues of the day.
most notably sentiment was rising in favor of legislation to curb the power of trusts.
by the mid 1880s fifteen western and southern states had adopted laws prohibiting combinations that restrained competition.
but corporations found it easy to escape limitations by incorporating in states such as new jersey and delaware that 518 chapter 19 labor and monopoly this 1883 cartoon appeared in puck a magazine popular for its satirical treatment of american politics.
it expresses a common sentiment of the populists and many others that ordinary men and women portrayed here by the pathetic figure of labor and by the grim members of the audience were almost hopelessly overmatched by the power of corporate monopolies.
the knights shield labeled corruption of the legislature and his spear labeled subsidized press make clear that in the view of the cartoonist at least corporations had many allies in their effort to oppress workers.
the library of congress lc dsg ppmsca 2412 sherman offered them special privileges.
if antitrust antitrust act legislation was to be effective its supporters believed it would have to come from the national government.
responding to growing popular demands both houses of congress passed the sherman antitrust act in july 1890 almost without dissent.
most members of congress saw the act as a symbolic measure one that would help deflect public criticism but was not likely to have any real effect on corporate power.
for over a decade after its passage the sherman act indifferently enforced and steadily weakened by the courts had almost no impact.
as of 1901 the justice department had instituted many antitrust suits against labor unions but only fourteen against business combi nations there had been few convictions.
the republicans were more interested however in the issue they believed had won them the 1888 election the tariff.
representative william mckinley of ohio and senator nelson mckinley w a rich of rhode island drafted the tariff highest protective measure ever proposed to congress.
known as the mckinley tariff it became law in october 1890.
but republican leaders appar ently misinterpreted public sentiment.
the party suffered a stunning reversal in the 1890 congressional election.
the republicans substantial senate majority was slashed to 8 in the house the party retained only 88 of the 323 seats.
mckinley himself was among those who went down in defeat.
nor were the republicans able to recover in the course of the next two years.
in the presidential election of 1892 benjamin harrison once again supported protection grover cleveland renominated by the democrats once again opposed it.
a new third party the peoples party with james b weaver as its candidate advocated substantial economic reform.
cleveland won 277 electoral votes to harrisons 145 and had a popular margin of 380 000.
weaver ran far behind.
for the first time since 1878 the democrats won a majority of both houses of congress.
the policies of clevelands second term were much like those of his first devoted to minimal government and hostile to active efforts to deal with social or economic problems.
again he supported a tariff reduction which the house approved but the senate weakened.
cleveland denounced the result but allowed it to become law as the wilson gorman tariff.
it included only very modest reductions.
but public pressure was growing in the 1880s for other reforms among them regulation of the railroads.
farm organizations in the midwest most notably the grangers had persuaded several state legislatures to pass regulatory legislation in the early from crisis to empire 519 shackled by the tariff this 1894 cartoon by the political satirist louis dalrymple portrays an unhappy uncle sam bound hand and foot by the mckinley tariff and by what tariff opponents considered a closely related evil monopoly.
members of the senate are portrayed as tools of the various industries and special interests protected by the tariff the caption a senate for revenue only is a parody of the antitariff rallying cry a tariff for revenue only meaning that duties should be designed only to raise money for the government not to stop imports of particular goods to protect domestic industries.
a particularly provocative element of the cartoon is the image of two african american legislators promoting another controversial issue free silver see pp.
the granger collection new york 1870s.
but in 1886 the supreme court in wabash st louis and pacific railway co v illinois known as the wabash case ruled one of the granger laws in illinois unconstitutional.
according to the court the law was an attempt to control interstate commerce and thus infringed on the exclusive power of congress.
later the federal courts limited the powers of the states to regulate commerce even within their own boundaries.
effective railroad regulation it was now clear could come only from the federal government.
congress responded to public pressure in 1887 with the interstate commerce act which banned discrimination in rates between long and short hauls required that railroads publish their rate schedules and file them with the government and declared that all interstate rail rates must be reasonable and just although the act did not define what that meant.
a five person agency the interstate commerce commission icc was to administer the act.
but it had to rely on the courts to enforce its rulings.

the agrarian revolt no group watched the performance of the federal government in the 1880s with more dismay than american farmers.
suffering from a long economic decline afflicted with a painful sense of obsolescence rural americans were keenly aware of the problems of the modem economy and particularly eager for government assistance in dealing with them.
the result of their frustrations was the emergence of one of the most powerful movements of political protest in american history what became known as populism.
the grangers according to popular myth american farmers were the most individualistic of citizens.
in reality however farmers had been making efforts to organize for many decades.
the first major farm organization appeared in the 1860s the grange.
the grange had its origins shortly after the civil war in a tour through the south by a minor agriculture department origins official oliver h kelley.
kelley was appalled by what he considered the isolation and drabness of rural life.
in 1867 he left the government and grange awakening the sleepers this 1873 cartoon illustrates the way the grange embraced many of the same concerns that the farmers alliances and their people s party later expressed.

but like most political movements f farmers in sparsely settled regions in particular it provided an antidote to isolation and loneliness.
this gathering of populist farmers 1 important as a cultural experience.
for the movement were tightly bound up with its social purposes.
kansas state historical society rmers in ic inson county kansas shows how the political purposes of from crisis to empire 521 with other department employees founded the national grange of the patrons of husbandry to which he devoted years of labor as secretary and from which emerged a network of local organizations.
at first the grangers defined their purposes modestly.
they attempted to bring farmers together to learn new scientific agricultural techniques to keep farming in step with the music of the age the grangers also hoped to create a feeling of community to relieve the loneliness of rural life.
the grangers grew slowly for a time.
but when the depression of 1873 caused a major decline in farm prices membership rapidly increased.
by 1875 the grange claimed more than 800 000 members and 20 000 local lodges it had chapters in almost every state but was strongest in the great staple producing regions of the south and the midwest.
as membership grew the lodges in the midwest began to focus less on the social benefits of organization and more on the economic possibilities.
they attempted to organize marketing co economic operatives to allow farmers to circumvent the grievances hated middlemen people who managed the sale of farmers crops taking a large cut of the profits for themselves.
and they urged cooperative political action to curb monopolistic practices by railroads and warehouses.
the grangers set up cooperative stores creameries elevators warehouses insurance companies and factories that produced machines stoves and other items.
more than 400 enterprises were in operation at the height of the movement and some of them forged lucrative relationships with existing businesses.
one corporation emerged specifically to meet the needs of the grangers the first mail order business montgomery ward and company founded in 1872 which helped farmers escape from overpriced local stores.
eventually however most of the grange enterprises failed both because of the inexperience of their operators and because of the opposition of the middlemen they were challenging.
the grangers also worked to elect state legislators pledged to their program.
usually they operated through the existing political parties although occasionally they ran can program didates under such independent party labels as antimonopoly and reform at their peak they managed to gain control of the legislatures in most of the midwestern states.
their purpose was to subject the railroads to government controls.
the granger laws of the early 1870s imposed strict regulations on railroad rates and practices.
but the new regulations were soon destroyed by the courts.
that defeat combined with the political inexperience of many grange leaders and above all the temporary return of agricultural prosperity in the late 1870s produced a dramatic decline m the power of the association.
some of the granger cooperatives survived as effective economic vehicles for many years but the movement as a whole dwindled rapidly.
by 1880 its membership had shrunk to 100 000 had faded.
as early as 1875 farmers in parts of the south most notably in texas were banding together in so called farmers alliances.
by 1880 the southern alliance had more than 4 million members and a comparable northwestern alliance was taking root in the plains states and the midwest and developing ties with its southern counterpart.
like the granges the alliances were principally concerned with local problems.
they formed cooperatives and other marketing mechanisms.
they established stores banks processing plants and other facilities for their members to free them from the hated furnishing merchants who kept so many farmers in debt.
some alliance leaders however also saw the movement as an effort to build a society in which economic competition might give way to cooperation.
they argued for a sense of mutual neighborly responsibility that would enable farmers to resist oppressive outside forces.
alliance lecturers traveled throughout rural areas attacking the concentration of power in great corporations and financial institutions and promoting cooperation as an alternative economic system.
from the beginning women were full voting members in most local alliances.
many held offices and served as lecturers.

she made some 160 speeches in 1890 alone.
her critics called her the kansas pythoness but she was popular among populist farmers with her denunciations of banks railroads and middlemen and her famous advice to raise less corn and more hell.
corbis the farmers alliances the successor to the grange as the leading vehicle of agrarian protest began to emerge even before the granger movement 522 chapter 19 bearing the cross of gold the cartoonist grant hamilton created this image of william jennings bryan shortly after he made his famous cross of gold speech at the democratic national convention which led to his nomination for president.
the cartoon highlights two of the most powerful images in bryans speech a crown of thorns and a cross of gold both biblical references and both designed to represent the oppression that the gold standard imposed on working people.
the granger collection new york for urging farmers to raise less corn and more hell others emphasized issues of particular concern to women especially temperance.
like their urban counterparts agrarian women argued that sobriety was a key to stability in rural society.
alliances and the populist party they eventually created advocated extending the vote to women in many areas of the country.
although the alliances quickly became far more widespread than the granges had ever been they suffered from similar problems.
their cooperatives did not always work well partly because the market forces operating against them were sometimes too strong to be overcome partly because the cooperatives themselves were often mismanaged.
these economic frustrations helped push the movement into a new phase at the end of the 1880s the creation of a national political organization.
in 1889 the southern and northwestern alliances despite continuing differences between them agreed to a loose merger.
the next year the alliances held a national convention at ocala florida and issued the so called ocala demands which were in effect a party platform.
in the 1890 off year elections candidates supported by the alliances won partial or complete control of the legislatures in twelve states.
they also won six governorships three seats in the u s senate and approximately ty in the u s house of representatives.
many of the success u alliance candidates were democrats who had benefited o ten passively from alliance endorsements.
but dissident armers rew enough encouragement from the results to con emp ate urther political action including forming a party of inwestern alliance.

then in july 1892 1 300 exultant delegates poured into omaha nebraska to proclaim the creation of the new party approve an official set of principles and nominate candidates for the presidency and vice presidency.
the new organization s official name was the peoples party but its members were more commonly known as populists.
the election of 1892 which restored grover cleveland to the presidency demonstrated the potential power of the new movement.
the populist presidential candidate was james b weaver of iowa a former greenbacker who received the nomination after the death of leonidas polk the early favorite.
weaver polled more than 1 million votes 8 5 percent of the total and carried six mountain and plains states for 22 electoral votes.
nearly 1 500 populist candidates won election to seats in state legislatures.
the party elected three governors five senators and ten congressmen.
it could also claim the support of many republicans and democrats in congress who had been elected by appealing to populist sentiment.
the populist constituency the populists dreamed of creating a broad political coalition.
but populism always appealed principally to farmers particularly to small farmers with little long range economic security people whose operations were minimally mechanized if at all who relied on one crop and who had access only to limited credit.
in the midwest the populists were usually family farmers struggling to hold on to their land or to get it back.
in the south there were many modest landowners too but in addition there were significant numbers of sharecroppers and tenant farmers.
whatever their differences however most populists had at least one thing in common they were engaged in a type of farming that was becoming less viable in the face of new mechanized diversified and consolidated commercial agriculture.
populists tended to be not only economically but also culturally marginal.
the movement appealed above all to geographically isolated farmers who felt cut off from the mainstream of national life and resented their isolation.
populism gave such people an outlet for their grievances it also provided them with a social experience a sense of belonging to a community that they had previously lacked.
the populists were also notable for the groups they failed co attract.
there were energetic efforts to include labor within the coalition.
representatives of the knights of labor attended early organizational meetings the new party added a labor plank to its platform calling for shorter hours for workers and restrictions on immigration and denouncing the use of private detective agencies as strikebreakers in labor disputes.
on the whole however populism never attracted significant labor support in part because the economic interests of labor and the interests of farmers were often at odds.
one exception was the rocky mountain states where the populists did have some significant success in attracting min ers to their cause.
they did so partly because local populist free silver leaders endorsed a demand for tree silver the idea of permitting silver to become along with gold the basis of the currency so as to expand the money supply.
in colorado idaho nevada and other areas of the far west silver mining was an important activity and the peoples party enjoyed substantial if temporary success there.
in the south white populists struggled with the question of whether to accept african americans into the party.
their numbers and poverty made black farmers possibly valuable allies.
there was an important black component to the colored movement a network ofcolored alliances alliances that by 1890 had more than one and a quarter million members.
but most white populists were willing to accept the assistance of african americans only as long as it was clear that whites would remain indisputably in control.
when southern conservatives began to attack the populists for undermining white supremacy the interracial character of the movement quickly faded.
most of the populist leaders were members of the rural middle class professional people editors and lawyers or longtime politicians and agitators.
many active populists were women.
some populist leaders were somber serious theoreticians others were semihysterical rabble rousers.
in the south in particular populism produced the first generation of what was to become a distinctive and enduring political breed the southern demagogue tom watson in georgia jeff davis in arkansas and others attracted widespread popular support by arousing the resentment of poor southerners against the entrenched planter aristocracy.
populist ideas the reform program of the populists was spelled out first in the ocala demands of 1890 and then even more clearly in the omaha platform of 1892.
it proposed a system ofsubtreasuries which would replace and strengthen the cooperatives of populist grangers and alliances that had been ex platform perimenting for years.
the government would establish a network of warehouses where farmers could deposit their crops.
using those crops as collateral growers could then borrow money from the government at low rates of interest and wait for the price of their goods to go up before selling them.
in addition the populists called for the abolition of national banks the end of absentee ownership of land the direct election of u s senators which would weaken the power of conservative state legislatures and other devices to improve the ability of the people to influence the political process.
they called as well for regulation and after 1892 government ownership of railroads telephones and telegraphs.
and they demanded a system of government operated postal savings banks a graduated income tax and the inflation of the currency.
eventually the party as a whole embraced the demand of its western mem bers for the remonetization of silver.
some populists were openly anti semitic pointing to the jews as leaders of the obscure financial forces attempting to enslave and oratory were part of american life in the nineteenth cen j tury.
starting in 1826 lyceums were among the first public organizations to provide adults with both.
participants met in libraries vacant schools and elsewhere.
organizers estimated that 13 000 people attended public lectures.
an even larger movement to provide instructional lectures and speeches arose during the 1880s and 1890s from the populist movement.
men and women flocked by the hundreds or even thousands to hear speeches and discussions provided by itinerant speakers.
the most famous of these lectures were the chautauquas founded in the summer of 1874 by two enterprising men from the chautauqua lakes area in western new york state.
within a few years the chautauqua assembly had expanded to include lectures on literary scientific theological and practical subjects and was attracting ever larger audiences for one or two week schools.
in 1883 the new york state legislature granted the assemblies a charter and gave them the name the chautauqua university.
so successful and profitable were the chautauqua assemblies that scores of towns and villages began establishing lecture series of their own little chautauquas throughout the midwest.
at the peak of this movement a chicago promoter organized traveling programs to tour rural areas across the united states visiting more than 8 000 different communities within a single year.
from 1904 through the mid 1920s these traveling chautauquas attracted enormous crowds and generated great excitement almost everywhere they went.
on the day of a chautauqua lecture roads chautauqua assembly this chautauqua meeting occurred in clarinda iowa.
it was one of hundreds of such meetings during the 1880s and 1890s that met the need of thousands of people across the country for knowledge and learning.

others were anti intellectual anti eastern and anti urban.
a few of the leading populists gave an impression of personal failure brilliant instability and brooding communion with mystic forces.
ignatius donnelly for example wrote one book locating the lost isle of atlantis another claiming that bacon had written shakespeare s plays and still another caesnr s column 1891 presenting a deranged vision of bloody revolution and the creation of a populist utopia.
tom watson once a champion of interracial harmony ended his career baiting blacks and jews.
yet the occasional bigotry of some populists should not dominate the image of populism as a whole which was a serious effort to find solutions to real problems.
populists emphat ically rejected the laissez faire orthodoxies ideological their tlme mcludmg the idea that the challenge rights of ownership are absolute.
they raised one of the most overt and powerful challenges of the era to the direction in which american in dustrial capitalism was moving.
the crisis of the 1890s the agrarian protest was only one of many indications of the national political crisis emerging in the 1890s.
there was a severe depression widespread labor unrest and violence and the continuing failure of either major party to respond to the growing distress.
the rigid conservatism of grover cleveland who took office for the second time just at the moment the economy collapsed meant that the federal government did little to alleviate the crisis.
out of this growing sense of urgency came some of the most heated political battles in american history culminating in the dramatic campaign of 1896 on which many americans came to believe the future of the nation was hanging.
the panic of 1893 the panic of 1893 precipitated the most severe depression nation had yet experienced.
it began in march 1893 when philadelphia and reading railroad unable to meet paym on loans declared bankruptcy.
two months later the natk cordage company failed as well.

conwell s sermon was characteristic of one kind of popular chautauqua event lectures that stressed self improvement.
other such lectures stressed religion and health.
the chautauqua circuit was one of the best ways for a speaker to reach large numbers of people which is one reason why so many progressive leaders and feminist reformers eagerly joined in.
it was for a time one of the most powerful forms of communication in the nation.
the traveling chautauquas declined during the 1920s and almost vanished in the 1930s victims of radio movies and the automobile the spread of public education to rural areas and the reckless overexpansion of ambitious organizers.

beyond market demand.
the depression reflected the degree to which the american economy was now interconnected the degree to which failures in one area affected all other areas.
and the depression showed how dependent the economy was on the health of the railroads which remained the nation s most powerful corporate and financial institutions.
when the railroads suffered as they did beginning in 1893 everything suffered.
once the panic began its effects spread with startling speed.
within six months more than 8 000 businesses 156 railroads and 400 banks failed.
already low agricultural prices tumbled further.
up to 1 million workers 20 percent of the labor force lost their jobs the highest level of unemployment in american history to that point.
the depression was unprecedented not only in its severity but also in its persistence.
although there was some improvement beginning in 1895 prosperity did not fully return until 1901.
the suffering the depression caused naturally produced social unrest especially among the enormous numbers of unemployed workers.
in 1894 jacob s coxey an ohio businessman and populist began advocating a massive public works program to create jobs for the unemployed and an inflation of the cur rency.
when it became clear that his proposals were making no progress in congress coxey announced that he would send a petition to washington with boots on a march of the unem ployed to the capital to present their demands to the govern ment.
toxeys army as it was known numbered only about coxeys army 500 when it reached washington d c after having marched on foot from masillon ohio.
armed police barred them from the capitol and arrested coxey.
he and his followers were herded into camps because their presence supposedly endangered public health.
congress took no action on their demands.
to many middle class americans the labor turmoil of the time the homestead and pullman strikes for example see pp.
481 483 was a sign of a dangerous instability even perhaps a revolution.
labor radicalism some of it real more of it imagined by the frightened middle class heightened the general sense of crisis among the public.
the silver question the financial panic weakened the governments monetary system.
president cleveland believed that the instability of the currency was the primary cause of the depression.
the money question therefore became the basis for some of the most dramatic political conflicts of the era.
at the heart of the complicated debate was the question of what would form the basis of the dollar.
today the value of the dollar rests on little more than public confidence in the government.
but in the nineteenth century many people believed that currency was worthless if there was not something concrete behind it precious metal specie which holders of paper money could collect if they presented their currency to a bank or to the treasury.
chapter 19 during most of its existence as a nation the united states had recognized two metals gold and silver as a basis for the dollar a situation known as bimetallism in the 1870s however that had changed.
the official ratio of the value of silver to the value of gold for purposes of creating currency the mint ratio was 16 to 1 sixteen ounces of silver equaled one ounce of gold.
but the actual commercial value of silver the market ratio was much higher than that.
owners of silver could get more by selling it for manufacture into jewelry and other objects than they could by taking it to the mint for conversion to coins.
so they stopped taking it to the mint and the mint stopped coining silver.
in 1873 congress passed a law that seemed simply to recognize the existing situation by officially discontinuing silver coinage.
few people objected at the time.
but in the course of the 1870s the market value of silver fell well below the official mint ratio of 16 to 1.
sixteen ounces of silver in other words were now worth less not more than one ounce of gold.
silver became attractive for coinage again.
in discontinuing silver coinage congress had eliminated a potential method of expanding the currency and had eliminated a potential market for silver miners.
before long many americans concluded that a conspiracy of big bankers had been responsible for the demonetization of silver and referred to the law as the crime of73 two groups of americans were especially determined to undo the crime of73 one consisted of the silver mine owners crime of 73 now understandably eager to have the government take their surplus silver and pay them much more than the market price.
the other group consisted of discontented farmers who wanted an increase in the currency question the quantity of money an inflation of the currency as a means of raising the prices of farm products and easing payment of the farmers debts.
the inflationists demanded that the government return at once to free silver that is to the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the old ratio of 16 to 1.
but by the time the depression began in 1893 congress had made no more than a token response to their demands.
at the same time the nations gold reserves were steadily dropping.
president cleveland believed that the chief cause of the weakening gold reserves was the sherman silver purchase act of 1890 a sop to silver miners which had required the government to purchase but not to coin silver and to pay for it in gold.
early in his second administration therefore a special session responded to clevelands request and repealed the sherman act although only after a bitter and divisive battle that helped create a permanent split in the democratic party.
the presidents gold policy had aligned the southern and western democrats in a solid alliance against him and his eastern followers.
by now both sides had invested the currency question symbolic with great symbolic and emotional impor importance of tance.
indeed the issue aroused passions rarely seen in american politics culminating in the tumultuous presidential election i i taking arms against the populists kansas was a populist stronghold in the 1890s but the new party faced populists believed had given them control of the legislature.

supporters of the gold standard considered its survival essential to the honor and stability of the nation.
supporters of free silver considered the gold standard an instrument of tyranny.
free silver became to them a symbol of liberation.
silver would be a peoples money as opposed to rold the money of oppression and exploitation.
it would eliminate the indebtedness of farmers and of whole regions of the country.
a graphic illustration of the popularity of the silver issue was the enormous success of william h harveys coins financial school published in 1894 which became one of the reat best sellers of its age.
the fictional professor coin ran an imaginary school specializing in finance and the book consisted of his lectures and his dialogues with his students.
the professors brilliant discourses left even his most vehement opponents dazzled as he persuaded his listeners with simple logic of the almost miraculous restorative qualities of free silver it means the reopening of closed factories the relighting of fires in darkened furnaces it means hope instead of despair comfort in place of suffering life instead of death cross of gold most populists did not pay much attention to the silver issue at first.
but as the party developed strength the money question became more important to its leaders.
the populists desperately needed funds to finance their campaigns.
silver mine owners were willing to provide assistance but insisted on an elevation of the currency plank.
the populists also needed to form alliances with other political groups.
the money question seemed a way to win the support of many people not engaged in farming but nevertheless starved for currency.
1 the scholarly debates over populism have tended to reflect a larger debate among historians on populist politics.
some historians viewed the populists with suspicion and hostility.
the library of congress lc uszc4 1473j others have viewed populism approvingly.
to them the populists have appeared as essentially admirable democratic activists.
this latter view shaped the first and for many years the only general history of populism john d hicks s the populist revolt 1931.
hicks described populists as people reacting rationally and progressively to economic misfortune.
they were proposing reforms that would limit the power of the new financial titans and restore a measure of control to the farmers.
populism was he wrote the last phase of a long and perhaps a losing struggle the struggle to save agricultural america from the devouring jaws of industrial america 1 a losing struggle perhaps but not a vain one for many of the reforms the populists advocated hicks implied became the basis of later progressive legislation.
an alternative to this generally approving view of populism appeared in the early 1950s when some scholars recalling the european fascism of world war ii and wary about contemporary communism took a more hostile view of mass popular politics.
a leading proponent of this harsh new view was richard hofstadter.
in the age of reform 1955 hofstadter conceded that populism embraced some progressive i the emergence of bryan as the election of 1896 approached republicans watching the failure of the democrats to deal effectively with the depression were confident of success.
party leaders led by the william ohio boss marcus a hanna settled on mckinley governor william mckinley of ohio who had as a member of congress authored the 1890 tariff act as the partys presidential candidate.
the republican platform opposed the free coinage of silver except by agreement with the leading commercial nations which everyone realized was unlikely.
thirty four delegates from the mountain and plains states walked out of the convention in protest and joined the democratic party.
the democratic national convention of 1896 was the scene of unusual drama.
southern and western delegates eager to neutralize the challenge of the peoples party were determined to seize control of the party from conservative easterners and incorporate some populist demands among them free silver into the democratic platform.
they wanted as well to nominate a pro silver presidential candidate.
528 oeienuers or tne gold standard seemed lu uunmiatv debate until the final speech.
then william jennings bryan a handsome thirty six year old congressman from nebraska al cross of ready well known as an effective orator gold speech mounted the podium to address the convention.
his great voice echoed through the hall as he defended free silver in what became one of the most famous political speeches in american history.
the closing passage sent his audience into something close to a frenzy having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world supported by the commercial interests the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold it became known as the cross of gold speech.
in the aftermath of bryans powerful speech the convention voted to adopt a pro silver platform.
and the following ay bryan as he had eagerly and not entirely secretly hoped was nominated for president on the fifth ballot.
he was and mains the youngest person ever nominated for president by ideas and advocated some sensible reforms but he concentrated primarily on exposing both the soft and the dark sides of the movement.
populism was soft hofstadter claimed because it rested on a nostalgic and unrealistic myth because it romanticized the nation s agrarian past and refused to confront the realities of modern life.
it was dark he argued because it was permeated with bigotry and ignorance.
populists he claimed revealed anti semitic tendencies and they displayed animosity toward intellectuals easterners and urbanites as well.
challenges to hofstadters thesis arose almost immediately.
norman pollack argued in a 1962 study the populist response to industrial america that the agrarian revolt had rested not on nostalgic romantic concepts but rather on a sophisticated farsighted and even radical vision of reform one that recognized the realities of an industrial economy but that sought to make that economy more equitable and democratic by challenging many of the premises of capitalism.
walter t k nugent in tolerant populists 1963 argued that the populists in kansas were far from bigoted that they not only tolerated but welcomed jews and other minorities into their party and that they offered a practical sensible program.
lawrence goodwyn in democratic promise 1976 argued similarly that the populists advocated an intelligent and above all a democratic alternative to the inequities of modern capitalism.
historians were debating not only the question of what populism meant.
they were also arguing over who the populists were.
hicks hofstadter and goodwyn disagreed on many things but they shared a general view of the populists as victims of economic distress usually one crop farmers in marginal agricultural regions victimized by drought and debt.
other scholars however suggested that the problem of identifying the populists is more complex.
sheldon hackney in populism to progressivism in alabama 1969 argued that the populists were not only economically troubled but also socially rootless only tenuously connected to society by economic function by personal relationships by stable community membership by political participation or by psychological identification with the south s distinctive myths.
peter argersinger stanley parsons james turner and others have similarly suggested that populists were characterized by a form of social and even geographic isolation.
steven hahn s 1983 study the roots of southern populism identified poor white farmers in the upcountry as the core of populist activity in georgia and hahn argued that populists were reacting not simply to the psychic distress of being left behind but also to a real economic threat to their way of life to the encroachments of a new commercial order of which they bad never been a part.
another debate concerns the legacy of populism.
in roots of reform 1999 elizabeth sanders contends that populism did not die as a movement after the 1896 election.
on the contrary she argues the populists succeeded in dominating much of the democratic party in the following decades and turning it into a vehicle for advancing the interests of farmers and the broader reform causes for which populists had fought.
michael kazin in the populist persuasion 1994 argues that a populist tradition has survived throughout much of american history influencing movements as disparate as those led by huey long in the 1930s the new left and george wallace in the 1960s ross perot in the 1990s and the tea party movement in the aftermath of the 2008 economic collapse.
other historians however maintain that the term populism has been used and misused so widely as to have become virtually meaningless that it really applies only to the agrarian insurgents of the 1890s.

3 major party.
republican and conservative democrats attacked bryan as a dangerous demagogue.
but his many admirers hailed him as the great commoner.
he was a potent symbol of rural protestant middle class america.
the choice of bryan and the nature of the democratic platform created a quandary for the populists.
they had fusion expected both major parties to adopt conservative programs and nominate conservative candidates leaving the populists to represent the growing forces of protest.
but now the democrats had stolen much of their thunder.
the populists faced the choice f naming their own candidate and splitting the protest vte or endorsing bryan and losing their identity as a party.
by now the populists had embraced the free silver cause hnt most populists still believed that other issues were more important.
many argued that fusion with the democrats who had endorsed free silver but ignored most f the other populist demands would destroy their party.
but the majority concluded that there was no viable alterative.
amid considerable acrimony the convention voted t0 support bryan.
the conservative victory the campaign of 1896 produced desperation among conservatives.
the business and financial community frightened beyond reason at the prospect of a bryan victory contributed lavishly to the republican campaign which may have spent as much as 7 million as compared to the democrats 300 000.
from his home at canton ohio mckinley hewed to the tradition by which candidates for president did not actively campaign for the office.
he conducted a dignified tront porch campaign by receiving pilgrimages of the republican faithful organized and paid for by hanna.
bryan showed no such restraint.
he became the first presidential candidate in american history to stump every section the country systematically to appear in villages and hamlets indeed the first to say frankly to the voters that he wanted to be president.
he traveled 18 000 miles and addressed an estimated 5 million people.
but bryan may have done mself more harm than good.
by violating a long standing idition of presidential candidates remaining aloof from their birth of modern campaigning 530 chapter 19 own campaigns the tradition by which they stood for office rather than running for it bryan helped establish the modern form of presidential politics.
but he also antagonized many voters who considered his campaign undignified.
on election day mckinley polled 271 electoral votes to bryans 176 and received 51 1 percent of the popular vote to bryans 47 7.
bryan carried the areas of the south and west where miners or struggling staple farmers predominated.
the democratic program like that of the populists had been too narrow to win a national election.
for the populists and their allies the election results were a disaster.
they had gambled everything on their fusion with the end of the democratic party and lost.
within months peoples party of the election the peoples party began to dissolve.
never again would american farmers unite so militantly to demand economic reform.
bryan whistle stopping by long established tradition candidates for the presidency did not actively campaign after receiving their partys nomination.
nineteenth century americans considered public stumping to be undignified and inappropriate for a future president.
but in 1896 william jennings bryan a young candidate little known outside his own region a man without broad support even among the leaders of his own party decided that he had no choice but to go directly to the public for support.
he traveled widely and incessantly in the months before the election appearing before hundreds of crowds and hundreds of thousands of people.
the library of congress lc uszc2 6259 mckinley ano recovery the administration of william mckinley which began in the aftermath of turmoil saw a return to relative calm.
one reason was the exhaustion of dissent.
by 1897 when mckinley took office the labor unrest that had so frightened many middle class americans and so excited working class people had subsided.
with the simultaneous decline of agrarian protest the greatest destabilizing forces in the nations politics were temporarily at least in retreat.
another reason was the shrewd character of the mckinley administration itself committed as it was to reassuring stability.
most important however was the gradual easing of the economic crisis a development that undercut many of those who were agitating for change.
mckinley and his allies committed themselves fully to only one issue one on which they knew virtually all republicans agreed the need for higher tariff rates.
within weeks of his inauguration the administration won approval of the dingley tariff raising duties to the highest point in american history.
the administration dealt more gingerly with the explosive silver question an issue that mckinley himself had never considered very important in any case.
mckinley sent a commission to europe to explore the possibility of a silver agreement with great britain and france.
as he and everyone else anticipated the effort produced no agreement.
the republicans then enacted the currency currency act or go standard act of 1900 which confirmed the nations commitment to the gold standard by assigning a specific gold value to the dollar and requiring all currency issued by the united states to hew to that value.

economic developments at the time seemed to vindicate the republicans.
prosperity began to return in 1898.
foreign crop failures sent farm prices surging upward and american business entered another cycle of expansion.
prosperity and the gold standard it seemed were closely allied.
but while the free silver movement had failed it had raised an important question for the american economy.
in the quarter century before 1900 the countries of the western world had experienced a spectacular growth in productive facilities and population.
yet the supply of money had not kept pace with economic progress because the supply was tied to gold and the amount of gold had remained practically constant.
had it not been for a dramatic increase in the gold supply in the late 1890s a result of new techniques for extracting gold from low content ores and the discovery of huge new gold deposits in alaska south africa and australia populist predictions of financial disaster might in fact have proved correct.
in 1898 two and a half times as much gold was produced as in 1890 and the currency supply was soon inflated far beyond anything bryan and the free silver forces had anticipated.
by then however bryan like many other americans was becoming engaged with another major issue a growing united states presence in world affairs and the possibility of america becoming an imperialist nation.
stirrings of imperialism for over two decades after the civil war the united states expanded hardly at all.
by the 1890s however some americans were ready indeed eager to resume the course of manifest destiny that had inspired their ancestors to wrest an empire from mexico in the expansionist 1840s.

imperialism at high tide 1900 the united states became a formal imperial power in 1898 when it acquired colonies in the aftermath of the spanish american war.
but the u s was a decided latecomer to imperialism.
during the nineteenth century european nations dramatically expanded the reach of their empires moving in particular into africa and asia.
although the british remained the world s largest imperial power by a significant margin vast areas of the globe came under the control of other european colonizers as this map shows.

1 532 chapter 19 the new manifest destiny several developments helped shift american attention to lands across the seas.
the experience of subjugating the indian tribes had established a precedent for exerting colonial control over dependent peoples.
the concept of the closing of the frontier widely heralded by frederick jackson turner and many others in the 1890s produced fears that natural resources would soon dwindle and that alternative sources must be found abroad.
the depression of the 1890s encouraged some businessmen to look overseas for new markets.
the bitter social protests of the time the populist movement the free silver crusade the bloody labor disputes led some politicians to urge a more aggressive foreign policy as an outlet for frustrations that would otherwise destabilize domestic life.
foreign trade became increasingly important to the american increasing economy in the late nineteenth century.
importance the nations exports had totaled about 392 of trade million in 1870 by 1890 the figure was 857 million and by 1900 1 4 billion.
many americans began to consider the possibility of acquiring colonies that might expand such markets further.
americans were well aware of the imperialist fever that was raging through europe and leading the major powers to partition most of africa among themselves and to turn eager eyes on the far east and the feeble chinese empire.
some americans feared that their nation would soon be left out that no territory would remain to be acquired.
senator henry cabot lodge of massachusetts a leading imperialist warned that the united states must not fall out of the line of march the same distortion of darwinism that industrialists and others had long been applying to domestic economic affairs in the form of social darwinism was now applied to world affairs.
many writers and public figures contended that nations or races like biological species struggled constantly for existence and that only the fittest could survive.
for strong nations to dominate weak ones was therefore in accordance with the laws of nature.

it was their duty therefore to uplift less fortunate peoples even to force superior institutions on them if necessary.

mahans thesis presented in the influence of sea power upon history 1890 and other works was simple countries with sea power were the great nations of history the greatness of the united states bounded by two oceans alfred thayer mahan would rest on its naval strength.
the prerequisites for sea power were a productive domestic economy foreign commerce a strong merchant marine a navy to defend trade routes and colonies which would provide raw materials and markets and could serve as naval bases.
mahan advocated that the united states construct a canal across the isthmus of central america to join the oceans acquire defensive bases on both sides of the canal in the caribbean and the pacific and take possession of hawaii and other pacific islands.
mahan feared the united states did not have a large enough navy to play the great role he envisioned.
but during the 1870s and 1880s the government launched a shipbuilding program that by 1898 had moved the united states to fifth place among the worlds naval powers and by 1900 to third.

but in the mid and late nineteenth century the construction of empires took on a new and different form from those of earlier eras and the word imperialism emerged for the first time to describe it.
european powers now created colonies not by sending large numbers of migrants to settle and populate new lands but instead by creating military political and business structures that allowed them to dominate and profit from the existing populations.
this new imperialism changed the character of the imperial nations themselves enriching them greatly and producing new classes of people whose lives were shaped by the british raj the drum corps of the royal fusiliers in india poses here for a formal portrait taken in 1877.
although the drummers are british an indian associate is included at top left.
this blending of the dominant british with subordinate indians was characteristic of the administration of the british empire in india a government known as the raj from the indian word for rule.
time life pictures getty images the demands of imperial business and administration.
it changed the character of colonized societies even more by drawing them into the vast nexus of global industrial capitalism and by introducing european customs institutions and technologies to the subject peoples.
champions of the new imperialism argued that the acquisition of colonies was essential for the health even the survival of their own industrializing nations.
colonies were sources of raw materials vital to industrial production they were markets for manufactured goods and they could be suppliers of cheap labor.
defenders of the idea of empire argued as well that imperialism was good for the colonized people too.
many saw colonization as an opportunity to export christianity to heathen lands while secular apologists argued that imperialism helped bring colonized people into the modern world.
the british poet rudyard kipling was perhaps the most famous spokesman for empire.
in his celebrated poem the white man s burden he spoke of the duty of the colonizers to lift up primitive peoples to fill full the mouth of famine and bid the sickness cease.
the greatest imperial power of the nineteenth century indeed one of the greatest imperial powers in all of human history was great britain.
by 1800 despite its recent loss of the colonies that became the united states it already possessed vast territory in north america the caribbean and the pacific most notably canada and australia.
but in the second half of the nineteenth century britain greatly expanded its empire its most important acquisition was india.
in 1857 when native indians revolted against british authority british forces brutally crushed the rebellion and established formal colonial control over the land.
british officials backed by substantial military power now governed india through a large civil service staffed mostly by expand american influence into latin america where he believed the united states must look for markets for its surplus goods.
in october 1889 blaine helped organize the first pan american congress which attracted delegates from nineteen nations.
the delegates agreed to create the pan american union a weak international organization located in washington d c that served as a clearinghouse of information to the member nations.
but they rejected blaine s more substantive proposals for an inter american customs union and arbitration procedures for hemispheric disputes.
the cleveland administration took a similarly active interest in latin america.
in 1895 it supported venezuela in a dispute with great britain.
when the british ignored american demands venezuelan r at matter be submitted to arbitration dispute secretary of state richard olney charged that britain was violating the monroe doctrine.
cleveland then created a special commission to settle the dis pute if britain resisted the commissions decision he insisted the united states should be willing to go to war to enforce it.
as war talk raged throughout the country the british government prudently agreed to arbitration.
hawaii and samoa the islands of hawaii in the mid pacific had been an important way station for american ships in the china trade since the 534 from crisis to empire 535 people from england and scotland but with some indians serving in minor or symbolic positions.
the british invested heavily in railroads telegraphs canals harbors and agricultural improvements to enhance the economic opportunities available to them.
they created schools for indian children in an effort to draw them into british culture and make them supporters of the imperial system.
britain also extended its empire into africa and other parts of asia.
cecil rhodes expanded a small existing british colony at cape town into a substantial colony that included what is now south africa.
in 1895 he added new territories to the north which he named rhodesia today zimbabwe and zambia.
other imperialists spread british authority into kenya uganda nigeria and much of egypt.
with the acquisition of singapore hong kong burma and malaya britain extended its empire into east asia.
other european states watching the vast expansion of the british empire quickly jumped into the race for colonies.
france created colonies in indochina vietnam and laos algeria west africa and madagascar.
belgium moved into the congo in west africa.
germany established colonies in the cameroons tanganyika and other parts of africa and in the pacific islands north of australia dutch italian portuguese spanish russian and japanese imperialists created colonies in africa asia and the pacific driven both by their own commercial interests and by the frenzied competition that had developed among rival imperial powers.
in 1898 the united states was drawn into the imperial race as an unanticipated result of the spanish american war but americans also sought colonies although only a few as a result of the efforts of pro imperialists among them theodore roosevelt who believed that in the modern industrial imperial world a nation without colonies would have difficulty remaining or becoming a true great power.

what motivated the european nations drive for empire in the late nineteenth century.

early nineteenth century.
by the 1880s officers of the expanding american navy were looking covetously at pearl harbor on the island of oahu as a possible permanent base for u s ships.
pressure for an increased american presence in hawaii was emerging from another source as well the growing number of americans who had settled on the islands and who had gradually come to dominate their economic and political life.
in doing so the americans had been wresting authority away from the leaders of an ancient civilization.
settled by polynesian people beginning in about 1500 bce hawaii had self developed an agricultural and fishing soci svfficient ety in which different islands and different cieties communities on the same islands each with its own chieftain lived more or less self sufficiently.
when the first americans arrived in hawaii in the 1790s on merchant ships from new england there were perhaps a half million people living there.
battles among rival communities were frequent as ambitious chieftains tried to consolidate power over their neighbors.
in 1810 after a series of such battles king kamehameha i established his dominance welcomed american traders and helped them develop a thriving trade between hawaii and china from which the natives profited along with the merchants.
but americans soon wanted more than trade.
missionaries began settling there in the early nineteenth century and in the 1830s william hooper a boston trader became the first of many americans to buy land and establish a sugar plantation on the islands.
the arrival of these merchants missionaries and planters was devastating to traditional hawaiian society.
the newcomers inadvertently brought infectious diseases to which the hawaiians like the american indians before them were tragically vulnerable.
by the mid nineteenth century more than half the native population had died.
by 1900 disease had more than halved the population again.
but the americans brought other incursions as well.
missionaries worked to undermine native religion.
other white settlers introduced liquor firearms and a commercial economy all of which eroded the traditional character of hawaiian society.
by the 1840s american planters had spread throughout the islands and an american settler g p judd had become prime minister of hawaii under king kamehameha iii who had agreed to establish a constitutional monarchy.
judd governed hawaii for over a decade.
in 1887 the united states negotiated a treaty with hawaii that permitted it to open a naval base at pearl harbor.
by then growing sugar for export to america had become the basis of the hawaiian economy as a result of an 1875 agreement allowing hawaiian sugar to enter the united states duty free.
the american dominated sugar plantation system not only displaced native hawaiians from their lands but also sought to build a workforce with asian immigrants whom the americans considered more reliable and more docile than the natives.
indeed finding adequate labor and keeping it under control were the principal concerns of many planters.
some planters deliberately sought to create a mixed race workforce chinese japanese native hawaiians filipinos portuguese and others as a way to keep the workers divided and unlikely to challenge them.
native hawaiians did not accept their subordination without protest.
in 1891 they elevated a powerful nationalist to queen t rone queen liliuokalani who set liliuokalani out to challenge the growing american control of the islands.
but she remained in power only two years.
by 1890 the united states had eliminated the privileged position of hawaiian sugar in international trade.
the result was devastating to the economy of the islands and american planters concluded that the only way for them to recover was to become part of the united states and hence exempt from its tariffs.
in 1893 they staged a revolution and called on the united states for protection.
after the american minister ordered marines from a warship in yellow journalism pulitzer was a successful newspaper publisher in st louis missouri when he traveled to new york city in 1883 to buy a struggling paper the new york world.

the yellow press and the wreck of the maine no evidence was ever found tying the spanish to the explosion in havana harbor that destroyed the american battleship maine in february 1898.
indeed most evidence indicated that the blast came from inside the ship a fact that suggests an accident rather than sabotage.
nevertheless the newspapers of joseph pulitzer and william randolph hearst ran sensational stories about the incident that were designed to arouse public sentiment in support of a war against the spanish.
this front page from pulitzers new york world is an example of the lurid coverage the event received.
circulation figures at the top right of the page indicate too how successful the coverage was in selling newspapers.
the granger collection new york a journal that is not only cheap but bright not only bright but large not only large but truly democratic that will serve and battle for the people with earnest sincerity within a year the world s daily circulation had soared from 10 000 to over 60 000.
by 1886 it had reached 250 000 and was making enormous profits.
the success of pulitzer s world marked the birth of what came to be known as yellow journalism a phrase that reportedly derived from a character in one of the worlds comic strips the yellow kid.
color printing in newspapers was relatively new and yellow was the most difficult color to print so in the beginning the term yellow journalism was a comment on the new technological possibilities that pulitzer was so eagerly embracing.
eventually however it came to refer to a sensationalist style of reporting and writing that spread quickly through urban america and changed the character of newspapers forever.
sensationalism was not new to journalism in the late nineteenth century of course.
political scandal sheets had been publishing lurid stories since before the american revolution.
but the yellow journalism of the 1880s and 1890s took the search for a mass audience to new levels.
the world created one of the first sunday editions with lavishly colored special sections comics and illustrated features.
it expanded coverage of sports fashion literature and theater.
it pioneered large glaring overheated headlines that captured the eyes of people who were passing newsstands.
it published exposes of political corruption.
it made considerable efforts to bring drama and energy to its coverage of crime.
it tried to involve readers directly in its stories as when a world campaign helped raise 300 000 to build a base for the statue of liberty with much of the money coming in donations of five or ten cents from working class readers.
and it introduced a self consciously populist style of writing that appealed to working class readers.
the american people want something terse forcible picturesque striking pulitzer said.
his reporters wrote short forceful sentences.
they did not shy away from expressing sympathy or outrage.
and they were not always constrained by the truth.

but debate continued until 1898 when the republicans returned to power and approved the agreement.
t ree thousand miles south of hawaii the samoan islands h p sofi ng served as a way station for american ships in t e aciric trade.
as american commerce with asia increased honolulu harbor to go ashore to aid the rebels the queen yielded her authority.
a provisional government dominated by americans who constituted less than 5 percent of the population of the islands immediately sent a delegation to washington to negotiate a 536 pulitzer very quickly produced imitators the most important of them the california publisher william randolph hearst who in 1895 bought the new york journal cut its price to one cent pulitzer quickly followed suit copied many of the world s techniques and within a year raised its circulation to 400 000 hearst soon made the journal the largest circulation paper in the country selling more than a million copies a day.
pulitzer whose own circulation was not far behind accused him of pandering to the worst tastes of the prurient and the horror loving and dealing in bogus news but the world wasted no time before imitating the journal.
the competition between these two great yellow journals soon drove both to new levels of sensationalism.
their success drove newspapers in other cities around the nation to copy their techniques.
the civil war in cuba in the 1890s gave both papers their best opportunities yet for combining sensational reporting with shameless appeals to patriotism and moral outrage.
they avidly published exaggerated reports of spanish atrocities toward the cuban rebels fanning popular anger toward spain when the american battleship maine mysteriously exploded in havana harbor in 1898 both papers without any evidence immediately blamed spanish authorities.
the journal offered a 50 000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the explosion and it crowded all other stories off its front page there is no other news hearst told his editors to make room for such screaming headlines as the whole country thrills with war fever and havana populace insults the memory of the maine victims.
in the three days following the maine explosion the journal sold more than 3 million copies a new world s record for newspaper circulation.
in the aftermath of the maine episode the more conservative press launched a spirited attack on yellow journalism.
that was partly in response to hearsts boast that the conflict in cuba was the journals war.
he sent a cable to one of his reporters in cuba saying you furnish the pictures and i ll furnish the war.
growing numbers of critics tried to discourage yellow journalism which ry yuok a respectable editors both deplored and feared.
some schools libraries and clubs began to banish the papers from their premises.
but the techniques the yellow press pioneered in the 1890s helped map the way for a tradition of colorful popular journalism later embodied in tabloids some elements of which eventually found their way into television news that has endured into the present day.

for the next ten years the three acquisition powers jockeyed for dominance in samoa of samoa occasionally coming dangerously close to business groups in the united states and the american navy began urging the government to annex the samoan harbor at pago pago.

finally the three nations agreed to share power over samoa.

the united states retained the harbor at pago pago.
war with spain imperial ambitions had thus begun to stir within the united states well before the late 1890s.
but a war with spain in 1898 turned those stirrings into overt expansionism.
the war transformed americas relationship to the rest of the world and left the nation with a far flung overseas empire.
controversy over cuba the spanish american war was a result of events in cuba which along with puerto rico now represented all that remained of spains once extensive american empire.
cubans had been resisting spanish rule since at least 1868.
many americans had sympathized with the cubans during that long struggle but the united states had not intervened.
in 1895 the cubans rebelled again.
this revolution produced a ferocity on both sides that horrified many americans.
cuban revolt the cubans deliberately devastated the island to force the spaniards to leave.
the spanish commanded by general valeriano weyler confined civilians in some areas to hastily prepared concentration camps where they died by the thousands victims of disease and malnutrition.
the american press took to calling the general butcher weyler the spanish had used some of these same savage methods during earlier struggles in cuba without shocking american sensibilities.
but the revolt of 1895 was reported more fully and sensationally by the american press which helped create the impression that the spaniards were committing all the atrocities when in fact there was considerable brutality on both sides.
the conflict in cuba came at a particularly opportune moment for the publishers of some american newspapers joseph pulitzer with his new york world and william randolph hearst with his new york journal.
see patterns of popular culture pp.
in the 1890s hearst and pulitzer were engaged in a ruthless circulation war and they both sent batteries of reporters and illustrators to the island with orders to provide accounts of spanish atrocities.

the mounting storm of indignation against spain did not persuade president cleveland to support intervention.
but when mckinley became president in 1897 he formally protested spain s uncivilized and inhuman conduct causing the spanish government fearful of american intervention to recall weyler modify the concentration policy and grant the island a qualified autonomy.
but whatever chances there were for a peaceful settlement vanished as a result of two dramatic incidents in february 1898.
the first occurred when a cuban agent stole a private letter written by dupuy de lome the spanish minister in washington and turned it over to the american press.
the letter described mckinley as a weak man and a bidder for the admiration of the crowd this was no more than many americans including some republicans were saying about their president.
theodore roosevelt described mckinley as having no more backbone than a chocolate eclair but coming from a foreigner it created intense popular anger.
dupuy de lome promptly resigned.
while excitement over the de lome letter was still high the american battleship maine blew up in havana harbor the maine wit a oss more r an peple the ship had been ordered to cuba in january to protect american lives and property.
many americans assumed that the spanish had sunk the ship particularly when a naval court of inquiry hastily and inaccurately reported that an external explosion by a submarine mine had caused the disaster.
later evidence suggested that the disaster was actually the result of an accidental explosion inside one of the engine rooms.
war hysteria swept the country and congress unanimously appropriated 50 million for military preparations.
remember the mainer became a national chant for revenge.
mckinley still hoped to avoid a conflict.
but others in his administration including assistant secretary of the navy theodore roosevelt were clamoring for war.
in march 1898 the president asked spain to agree to an armistice negotiations for a permanent peace and an end to the concentration camps.
spain agreed to stop the fighting and eliminate the concentration camps but refused to negotiate with the rebels and reserved the right to resume hostilities at its discretion.
that satisfied neither public opinion nor the congress and a few days later the united states declared war on spain.
declared in april it was over in august in part because cuban rebels had already greatly weakened the spanish resistance which made the american intervention in many respects little more than a mopping up exercise.
only 460 americans were killed in battle or died of wounds although some 5 200 others perished of disease ma mobilization aria dysentery and typhoid among oth problems ers.
casualties among cuban insurgents who continued to bear the brunt of the fighting were much higher.
and yet the american war effort was not without difficulties.
united states soldiers faced serious supply problems a shortage of modern rifles and ammunition uniforms too heavy for the warm caribbean weather inadequate medical services and skimpy almost indigestible food.
the regular army numbered only 28 000 troops and officers most of whom had experience in quelling indian outbreaks but none in larger scale warfare.
as in the civil war the united states had to rely heavily on national guard units organized by local communities and commanded for the most part by local leaders without military experience.
there were racial conflicts.
a significant proportion of the american invasion force consisted of black soldiers.
some were volunteer troops put together by african american communities although some governors refused to allow the formation of such units.
others were members of the four black regiments in the regular army who had been stationed on the frontier to defend white settlements against indians and were now transferred east to fight in cuba.
as the black soldiers traveled through the south toward the training camps they chafed at the rigid segregation to which they were subjected and occasionally resisted the restrictions openly.
african american soldiers in georgia deliberately made use of a whites only park in florida they beat a soda fountain operator for refusing to serve them in tampa white provocations and black retaliation led to a nightlong riot that left thirty people wounded.
racial tensions continued in cuba where african americans played crucial roles in some of the important battles of the war including the famous charge at san juan hill and won many medals.
nearly half the cuban insurgents fighting with the americans were of african descent and unlike their american counterparts they were fully integrated into the rebel army.
indeed one of the leading insurgent generals antonio maceo was a black man.
the sight of black cuban soldiers fighting alongside whites as equals gave african americans a stronger sense of the injustice of their own position.
seizing the philippines by an accident of history the assistant secretary of the navy during the cuban revolution was theodore roosevelt an ardent anglophile eager to see the united states join the british and other nations as imperial powers.

but unknown to the americans the spanish government had by now decided that santiago was lost and had ordered cervera to evacuate.
on july 3 cervera tried to escape from the harbor.
the waiting american squadron destroyed his entire fleet.
on july 16 the commander of spanish ground forces in santiago surrendered.
at about the same time an american army landed in puerto rico and occupied it against virtually no opposition.
on august 12 an armistice ended the war.
under the terms of the armistice spain recognized the independence of cuba.
it ceded puerto rico now occupied by american troops and the pacific island of guam to the united states.
and it accepted continued american occupation of manila pending the final disposition of the philippines.

the native people of the island the arawaks had mostly disappeared as a result of infectious diseases spanish brutality and poverty.
puerto rican society developed therefore with a spanish ruling class and a large african workforce for the coffee and sugar plantations that came to dominate its economy.
as puerto rican society became increasingly distinctive resistance to spanish rule began to emerge just as it had in cuba.
uprisings occurred intermittently beginning in the 1820s the most important of them the so called lares rebellion was like the others effectively crushed by the spanish in 1868.
but the growing resistance did prompt some reforms the abolition of slavery in 1873 representation in the spanish parliament and other changes.
demands for independence continued to grow and in 1898 in response to political pressure organized by the popular politician luis munoz rivera spain granted the island a degree of independence.
but before the changes had any chance to take effect control of puerto rico shifted to the united states.
american military forces occupied the island during the war.
they remained in control until 1900 when the foraker act ended military rule and established a formal colonial government an american governor and a two chamber legislature the members of the upper chamber appointed by the united states the members of the lower elected by the puerto rican people.
the united states could amend or veto any legislation the puerto ricans passed.
agitation for independence continued and in 1917 under pressure to clarify the relationship between puerto rico and america congress passed the jones act which declared puerto rico to be united states territory and made all puerto ricans american citizens.
the puerto rican sugar industry flourished as it took advantage of the american market that was now open to it sugar without tariffs.
as in hawaii americans economy began establishing large sugar plantations on the island and hired natives to work them many of the planters did not even live in puerto rico.
the growing emphasis on sugar as a cash crop and the transformation of many puerto rican farmers into paid laborers led to a reduction in the growing of food for the island.
puerto ricans became increasingly dependent on imported food and hence increasingly a part of the international commercial economy.
when international sugar prices were high puerto rico did well.
when they dropped the islands economy sagged pushing the many plantation workers already poor into destitution.
unhappy with the instability the poverty among natives and the american threat to hispanic culture many puerto ricans continued to agitate for independence.
others however began to envision closer rela tions with the united states even statehood.
the debate over the philippines although the annexation of puerto rico produced relatively little controversy the annexation of the philippines created a puerto rico and the united states ahe annexation of puerto rico produced relatively little con annexation troversy in the united states.

bettmann corbis the philippines question long and impassioned debate.
controlling a nearby caribbean island fit reasonably comfortably into the united states s sense of itself as the dominant power in the western hemisphere.
controlling a large and densely populated territory thousands of miles away seemed different and to many americans more ominous.
mckinley claimed to be reluctant to support annexation.
but according to his own accounts he came to believe there were no acceptable alternatives.
emerging from what he described as an agonizing night of prayer he claimed divine guidance for his decision to annex the islands.
returning them to spain would be cowardly and dishonorable he claimed.
turning them over to another imperialist power france germany or britain would be bad business and discreditable granting the islands independence would be irresponsible the filipinos were unfit for self government the only solution was to take them all and to educate the filipinos and uplift and christianize them and by gods grace do the very best we could by them the treaty of paris signed in december 1898 brought a formal end to the war.
it confirmed the terms of the armistice concerning cuba puerto rico and guam.
american negotiators startled the spanish by demanding that they cede the philippines to the united states something the original armistice had not included.
the spanish objected briefly but an american offer of 20 million for the islands softened their resistance.
they accepted all the american terms.
anti imperialist league in the u s senate however resistance was fierce.
during debate over ratification of the treaty a powerful anti imperialist movement arose around the country to oppose acquisition of the philippines.
the antiimperialists included some of the nations wealthiest and most powerful figures andrew carnegie mark twain samuel gompers senator john sherman and others.
their motives were various.
some believed simply that imperialism was immoral a repudiation of americas commitment to human freedom.
some feared polluting the american population by introducing inferior asian races into it.
industrial workers feared being undercut by a flood of cheap laborers from the new colonies.
conservatives worried about the large standing army and entangling foreign alliances that they believed imperialism would require and that they feared would threaten american liberties.
sugar growers and others feared unwelcome competition from the new territories.
the anti imperialist league established late in 1898 by upper class bostonians new yorkers and others to fight against annexation attracted a widespread following in the northeast and waged a vigorous campaign against ratification of the paris treaty.
favoring ratification was an equally varied group.
there were the exuberant imperialists such as theodore roosevelt who saw the acquisition of empire as a way to reinvigorate the nation and keep alive what they considered the healthy restorative influence of the war.
some businessmen saw opportunities to dominate the asian trade.
and most republicans saw partisan advantages in acquiring valuable new territories through a war fought and won by a republican administration.
perhaps the strongest argument in favor of annexation however was that the united states already possessed the islands.
when anti imperialists warned of the danger of acquiring territories with large populations who might have to become citizens the imperialists had a ready answer the nations long standing policies toward indians treating them as dependents rather than as citizens had created a precedent for annexing land without absorbing people.
supporters of annexation argued that the uncivilized filipinos would occupy the same status precisely as our indians.
they are in fact indians and the fourteenth amendment does not make citizens of indians the fate of the treaty remained in doubt for weeks until it received the unexpected support of william jennings bryan a fervent anti imperialist.
he backed ratification not because he approved of annexation but because he hoped to move the issue out of the senate and make it the subject of a national referendum in 1900 when he expected to be the from crisis to empire 545 democratic presidential candidate again.
bryan persuaded a number of anti imperialist democrats to support the treaty so as to set up the 1900 debate.
the senate ratified it finally on february 6 1899.
but bryan miscalculated.
if the election of 1900 was in fact a referendum on the philippines as bryan expected it proved beyond doubt that the nation had decided in favor of imperialism.
once again bryan ran against mckinley and once again mckinley won even more decisively than in 1896.
it was not only the issue of the colonies however that ensured mckinleys victory.
the republicans were the beneficiaries of growing prosperity and also of the colorful personality of their vice presidential candidate theodore roosevelt the hero of san juan hill.
election of 1900 the republic as empire the new american empire was small by the standards of the great imperial powers of europe.
but it embroiled the united states in the politics of both europe and the far east in ways the nation had always tried to avoid in the past.
it also drew americans into a brutal war in the philippines.
governing the colonies three of the american dependencies hawaii alaska acquired from russia in 1867 and puerto rico presented relatively few problems.
they received territorial status and their residents american citizenship relatively quickly hawaii in 1900 alaska in 1912 and puerto rico in 1917.
the u s navy took control of the pacific islands of guam and tutuila.
some of the smallest least populated pacific islands now under american control the united states simply left alone.
cuba was a thornier problem.
american military forces commanded by general leonard wood remained there until 1902 to prepare the island for independence.
they built roads schools and hospitals reorganized the legal financial and administrative systems and introduced medical and sanitation reforms.
but the united states also laid the basis for years of american economic domination of the island.
when cuba drew up a constitution that made no reference to the united states congress responded by passing platt the amendment in 1901 and pres amendment sured cuba into incorporating its terms into its constitution.
the platt amendment barred cuba from making treaties with other nations thus in effect giving the united states control of cuban foreign policy it gave the united states the right to intervene in cuba to preserve independence life and property and it required cuba to permit american naval stations on its territory.
the amendment left cuba with only nominal political independence.
american investments which quickly took over the is nds economy made the new nation an american economic uncle sam for a new suit by j s pughe in puck magazine 1900 president william mckinley is favorably depicted here as a tailor measuring his client for a suit large enough to accommodate the new possessions the united states obtained in the aftermath of the spanish american war.

the library of congress lc dig ppmsca 25453 american appendage as well.
americans poured into economic cuba buying up plantations factories rail dominance roads and refineries.
absentee american ownership of many of the islands most important resources was the source of resentment and agitation for decades.
resistance to yankee imperialism produced intermittent revolts against the cuban government revolts that at times prompted u s military intervention.
american troops occupied the island from 1906 to 1909 after one such rebellion they returned again in 1912 to suppress a revolt by black plantation workers.
as in puerto rico and hawaii sugar production spurred by access to the american market increasingly dominated the islands economy and subjected it to the same cycle of booms and busts that so plagued other sugar producing appendages of the united states economy.
the philippine war americans did not like to think of themselves as imperial rulers in the european mold.
yet like other imperial powers the united states soon discovered as it had discovered at home in its relations with the indians that subjugating another people required more than ideals it also required strength and brutality.
that at least was the lesson of the american experience in the philippines where american forces soon became engaged in a long and bloody war with insurgent forces fighting for independence.
the conflict in the philippines is the least remembered of all american wars.
it was also one of the longest lasting from 1898 to 1902 and one of the most vicious.
it involved 200 000 american troops and resulted in 4 300 american deaths nearly ten times the number who had died in combat in the spanish american war.
the number of filipinos killed in the conflict has long been a matter of dispute but it seems likely that at least 50 000 natives and perhaps many more 546 chapter 19 died.
the american occupiers faced brutal guerrilla tactics in the philippines very similar to those the spanish occupiers had faced prior to 1898 in cuba.
and they soon found themselves drawn into the same pattern of brutality that had outraged so many americans when weyler had used them in the caribbean.
the filipinos had been rebelling against spanish rule even before 1898.
and as soon as they realized the americans had come to stay they rebelled against them aguwaldo as we ably led by emilio aguinaldo who claimed to head the legitimate government of the nation filipinos harried the american army of occupation from island to island for more than three years.
at first american commanders believed the rebels had only a small popular following.
but by early 1900 general arthur macarthur an american commander in the islands and father of general douglas macarthur was writing i have been reluctantly compelled to believe that the filipino masses are loyal to aguinaldo and the government which he heads to macarthur and others that realization was not a reason to moderate american tactics or conciliate the rebels.
it was a reason to adopt much more severe measures.
gradually the american military effort became more systematically vicious and brutal.
captured filipino guerrillas were treated not as prisoners of war but as murderers.
many were summarily executed.
on some islands entire communities were evacuated the residents forced into concentration camps while american troops destroyed their villages farms crops and livestock.
a spirit of savagery grew among some american soldiers who came to view the filipinos as almost subhuman and at times seemed to take pleasure in killing arbitrarily.
one american commander ordered his troops to kill and burn the more you kill and burn the better it will please me.
shoot everyone over the age of 10 over fifteen filipinos were killed for every one wounded in the american civil war the bloodiest conflict in u s history to that point one person had died for every five wounded.
by 1902 reports of the brutality and of the american casualties had soured the american public on the war.
but by then growing t le rebebin bad largely exhausted itself economic an rbe occupiers bad established control dependence over most of the islands.
the key to their victory was the march 1901 capture of aguinaldo who later signed a document urging his followers to stop fighting and declaring his own allegiance to the united states.
aguinaldo then retired from public life and lived quietly until 1964.
fighting continued in some places for another filipino prisoners american troops guard captured filipino guerrillas in manila.

the war itself gave america control of the philippines guam and other smaller spanish possessions in the pacific.
when added to the small scattered islands that the united states had acquired as naval bases earlier in the nineteenth century these new possessions gave the nation a far flung pacific empire even if one whose total territory and population remained small by the standards of the other great empires of the age.
ivto was the reaction in the united states to the acquisition of this new empire.
year and the war revived intermittently until as late as 1906 but american possession of the philippines was now secure.
in the summer of 1901 the military transferred authority over the islands to william howard taft who became their first civilian governor.
taft announced that the american mission h the philippines was to prepare the islands for independence nd he gave the filipinos broad local autonomy.
the americans also built roads schools bridges and sewers instituted major administrative and financial reforms and established a public health system.
the philippine economy dominated by fishing agriculture timber and mining also became increasingly hnked to the economy of the united states.
americans did not make many investments in the philippines and few americans mved there.
but trade with the united states grew to the point that the islands were almost completely dependent on american markets.
in the meantime a succession of american governors grad ually increased filipino political autonomy.
on july 4 1946 the islands gained their independence.
the open door the acquisition of the philippines greatly increased the already strong american interest in asia.
americans were particularly concerned about the future of china with which the united states had an important trade and which was now so enfeebled that it provided a tempting target for exploitation by stronger countries.
by 1900 england france germany russia and japan were beginning to carve up china among themselves.
they pressured the chinese government for concessions which gave them effective control over various regions most along the coast of china.
in some cases they simply seized chinese territory and claimed it as their own.
many americans feared that the process would soon cut them out of the china trade altogether.
eager for a way to advance american interests in china without risking war mckinley issued a statement in september 1898 saying the united states wanted access to china but no special advantages there.
asking only the open door for ourselves we are ready to accord the open door to others the 548 chapter 19 next year secretary of state john hay translated those words into policy when he addressed identical messages which ti became known as the open door notes door notes t0 englancf germany russia france japan and italy.
he asked them to approve three principles each nation with a sphere of influence in china was to respect the rights and privileges of other nations in its sphere chinese officials were to continue to collect tariff duties in all spheres the existing tariff favored the united states and nations were not to discriminate against other nations in levying port dues and railroad rates within their own spheres.
together these principles would allow the united states to trade freely with the chinese without fear of interference and without having to become militarily involved in the region.
they would also retain the illusion of chinese sovereignty and thus prevent formal colonial dismemberment of china which might also create obstacles to american trade.
europe and japan received the open door proposals coolly.
russia openly rejected them the other powers claimed to accept them in principle but to be unable to act unless all the other powers agreed.
but hay refused to consider this a rebuff.
he boldly announced that all the powers had accepted the principles of the open door in final and definitive form and that the united states expected them to observe those principles.
no sooner had the diplomatic maneuvering over the open door ended than the boxers a secret chinese martial arts society with highly nationalist convictions and a somewhat mystical vision of their invulnerability to bullets launched a revolt against foreigners in china.
the boxer rebellion spread widely across eastern china attacking westerners wherever they could find them including many christian missionaries.
but the climax of the revolt was a siege of the entire western foreign diplomatic corps which took refuge in the british embassy in beijing.
the imperial powers including the united states sent an international expeditionary force into china to rescue the diplomats.
in august 1900 it fought its way into peking and broke the siege.
the boxer rebellion became an important event for the role of the united states in china.
mckinley and hay had agreed to american participation in quelling the boxer rebellion so as to secure a voice in the settlement of the uprising and to prevent the partition of china by the european powers.
hay now won support for his rebellion pen door approach from england and germany and induced the other participating powers to accept compensation from the chinese for the damages the boxer rebellion had caused.
chinese territorial integrity survived at least in name and the united states re tained access to its lucrative trade.
a modern military system the war with spain had revealed glaring deficiencies in the american military system.
the army had exhibited the great est weaknesses but the entire military organization had demonstrated problems of supply training and coordination.
had the united states been fighting a more powerful foe the boxer rebellion 1900 this photograph shows imprisoned boxers in beijing days earlier they had been involved in the siege of the compound in which western diplomats lived.
an expeditionary force of numerous european powers in china and of the united states had broken the siege and captured the boxers.
bettmann corbis disaster might have resulted.
after the war mckinley appointed elihu root an able corporate lawyer in new york as secretary of war to supervise a major overhaul of the armed forces.
root was one of the first of several generations of attorney statesmen who moved easily between public and private roles and constituted much of what has often been called the american foreign policy establishment between 1900 and 1903 the root reforms enlarged the regular army from 25 000 to a maximum of 100 000.
they established federal army standards for the national guard ensuring that never again would the nation fight a war with volunteer regiments trained and equipped differently than those in the regular army.
they sparked the creation of a system of officer training schools including the army staff college later the roots command and general staff school at fort military leavenworth kansas and the army war reforms college in washington.
and in 1903 a general staff named the joint chiefs of staff was established to act as military advisers to the secretary of war.
it was this last reform that root considered most important.
the creation of a central planning agency modeled on the example of european general staffs.
the joint chiefs were charged with many functions.
they were to supervise and coordinate the entire army establishment and to establish an office that would plan for possible wars.
an army and navy board was to foster interservice cooperation.
as a result of the new reforms the united states entered the twentieth century with something resembling a modern military system.
from crisis to empire 549 looking back for nearly three decades after the end of reconstruction american politics remained locked in a rigid stalemate.
the electorate was almost evenly divided and the two major parties differed on only a few issues.
a series of dull respectable presidents presided over this political system as unwitting symbols of its stability and passivity.
beneath the calm surface of national politics however great social issues were creating deep divisions battles between employers and workers growing resentment among american farmers facing declining prosperity outrage at what many voters considered corruption in government and excessive power in the hands of corporate titans.
when a great depression the worst in the nations history to that point began in 1893 these social tensions exploded.
the most visible sign of the challenge to the political stalemate was the populist movement a great uprising of american farmers demanding far reaching changes in politics and the economy.
in 1892 they created their own political party the peoples party which for a few years showed impressive strength.
but in the climactic election of 1896 in which the populist hero william jennings bryan became the presidential nominee of both the democratic party and the peoples party the republicans won a substantial victory and in the process helped create a great electoral realignment that left the republicans with a clear majority for the next three decades.
the crises of the 1890s coincided with and helped to strengthen a growing american engagement in the world.
in 1898 the united states intervened in a colonial war between spain and cuba won a quick and easy military victory and signed a treaty with spain that ceded significant territory to the americans including puerto rico and the philippines.
a vigorous anti imperialist movement failed to stop the imperial drive.
but taking the colonies proved easier than holding them.
in the philippines american forces became bogged down in a brutal four year war with filipino rebels.
the conflict soured much of the american public and the annexation of colonies in 1898 proved to be both the beginning and the end of american territorial imperialism.

how did government change as a result of their reform efforts.
how did woodrow wilson s progressivism differ from that of theodore roosevelt.
in what ways was it similar to roosevelt s.
setting the stage well before the end of the nineteenth century many americans had become convinced that the rapid changes in their society industrialization urbanization immigration and other jarring events had created intolerable problems.
out of that concern emerged a broad effort to impose order and justice on a society that seemed to be approaching chaos.
by the early years of the twentieth century this outlook had acquired a name progressivism the progressive impulse took many forms so many in fact that even today scholars do not agree on what progressivism means.
but despite or perhaps because of its great diversity progressivism created a remarkable period of political and social innovation.
from the late nineteenth century until at least the end of world war i reformers were the most dynamic and influential force in american politics and culture.
they brought into public debate such issues as the role of women in society the ways to deal with racial difference the question of how to govern cities the fairest way to organize the economy the role of political parties and political machines the impact of immigration and cultural diversity and the degree to which the state should impose moral norms on communities and individuals.
progressivism began as a movement within communities cities and states many different local efforts to improve the working of society.
slowly but steadily these efforts began to become national efforts.
broad movements emerged around passionate issues woman suffrage racial equality the rights of labor.
and the federal government itself beginning in the early twentieth century became a crucible of progressive reform.
reformers attempted to make washington more responsive to their demands.
some worked successfully for the direct popular election of u s senators to replace what they considered the corrupt process by which state legislatures chose members of the senate.
but ultimately it was the presidency not the congress that became the most important vehicle of national reform first under the dynamic leadership of theodore roosevelt and then under the disciplined moralistic leadership of woodrow wilson.
by the time the united states entered world war i in 1917 the federal government which had exercised very limited powers prior to the twentieth century had greatly expanded its role in american life.
the progressive impulse belief in progressivism was first an optimistic vision.
progressives believed as their name progress implies in the idea of progress.
they believed that society was capable of improve ment and that continued growth and advancement were the nations destiny.
but progressives believed too that growth and progress could not continue to occur recklessly as they had in the late nineteenth century.
the natural laws of the marketplace and the doctrines of laissez faire and social darwinism that celebrated those laws were not sufficient direct purposeful human intervention in social and economic affairs was they argued essential to order ing and bettering society.
varieties of progressivism progressives did not always agree on the form their intervention should take and the result w a variety of reform impulses that sometimes seemed to have little in common one powerfi impulse was the spirit of antimonopoly the fear of concentrated power and the urge to lim antimonopoly anb disperse authority and wealth.
this vaguely populist impulse appeale not only to many workers and farmers but to some middle cbss america.
and it encouraged government to regulate or break r rtiilerlldl national level.
bfeak up trusts at botb the state an another progressive impulse was a belief in the importance nf.
individuals are part of a great web of social relationships that each chesion the belief th nips that each persons welfare is dependei 552 the progressives 553 on the welfare of society as a whole.
that assumption produced a concern about the victims of industrialization and other people who had difficult lives.
still another impulse was a deep faith in knowledge in the possibilities of applying to society the principles of natural and social sciences.
many reformers believed that knowledge was faith in more important than anything else as a ve knowledge hide for making society more equitable and humane.
most progressives believed too that a modernized government could and must play an important role in the process of improving and stabilizing society.
modern life was too complex to be left in the hands of party bosses untrained amateurs and antiquated institutions.
the muckrakers among the first people to articulate the new spirit of reform were crusading journalists who began to direct public attention toward social economic and political injustices.
they became known as the muckrakers after theodore roosevelt accused one of them of raking up muck through his writings.
they were committed to exposing scandal corruption and injustice to public view.
at first their major targets were the trusts and particularly the railroads which the muckrakers considered powerful and ida tarbell deeply corrupt.
exposes of the great corpo and lincoln rate organizations began to appear as early as steffens the 1860s when charles francis adams jr and others uncovered corruption among the railroad barons.
one of the most notable muckrakers was the journalist ida tarbells enormous study of the standard oil trust published first in magazines and then as a two volume book in 1904.
by the turn of the century many muckrakers were turning their attention to government particularly to the urban political machines.
the most influential perhaps was lincoln steffens a reporter for mcclures magazine and the author of a famous book based on his articles the shame of the cities 1904.
his portraits of machine government and boss rule his exposure of boodlers in cities as diverse as st louis minneapolis cleveland cincinnati chicago philadelphia and new york his tone of studied moral outrage all helped arouse sentiment for urban political reform.
the alternative to leaving government in the hands of corrupt party leaders the muck takers argued was for the people themselves to take a greater interest in public life.
the muckrakers reached the peak of their influence in the fct decade of the twentieth century.
by presenting social problems to the public with indignation and moral fervor they helped inspire other americans to take action.
the social gospel he growing outrage at social and economic injustice helped produce many reformers committed to the pursuit of what oarne to be known as social justice social justice is a term widely used around the world to describe a kind of justice that goes beyond the individual seeking justice for society as a whole.
advocates of social justice are likely to believe in an egalitarian society and support for poor and oppressed people.
that impulse helped create the rise of what became known as the social gospel by the early twentieth century it had become a powerful movement within american protestantism and to a lesser extent within american catholicism and judaism.
it was chiefly concerned with redeeming the nations cities.
the salvation army which began in england but soon spread to the united states was one example of the fusion of religion with reform.
a christian social welfare organization with a vaguely military structure by 1900 it had recruited 3 000 officers and 20 000 privates and was offering both material aid and spiritual service to the urban poor.
in addition many ministers priests and rabbis left traditional parish work to serve in the troubled cities.
charles sheldons in his steps 1898 the story of a young minister who abandoned a comfortable post to work among the needy sold more than 15 million copies.
it was one of the most successful novels of the era.
walter rauschenbusch a protestant theologian from rochester new york published a series of influential discourses on the possibilities for human salvation through christian reform.
to him the message of darwinism was not father john t ie surviva f the fittest.
he believed ryan rather that all individuals should work to ensure a humanitarian evolution of the social fabric.
some american catholics seized on the 1893 publication of pope leo xiiis encyclical rerum novarum new things as justification for their own crusade for social justice.
catholic liberals such as father john a ryan took to heart the popes warning that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the masses of the poor a yoke little better than slavery itself for decades he worked to expand the scope of catholic social welfare organizations.
the settlement house movement an element of much progressive thought was the belief in the influence of the environment on individual development.
social darwinists such as william graham sumner had argued that peoples fortunes reflected their inherent fitness for survival.
progressive theorists disagreed.
ignorance poverty even criminality they argued were not the result of inherent genetic failings or of the workings of providence they were rather the effects of an unhealthy environment.
to elevate the distressed therefore required an improvement of the conditions in which they lived.
nothing produced more distress many urban reformers believed than crowded immigrant neighborhoods which publicists such as jacob riis were exposing through vivid photographs and lurid descriptions.
one jane addams response to the problems of such commu and hull nities borrowed from england was the ouse settlement house.

the united states in 1900 this map helps illustrate the enormous increase in the nation s urban population in the nineteenth century.
the map of america in 1800 on p 194 in chapter 7 reveals a nation with very few significant cities and with a population clustered largely along the eastern seaboard.
by 1900 a much larger area of the united states had consistent areas of settlement and many more of those areas consisted of towns and cities including three cities chicago new york and philadelphia with populations of over a million and a considerable number of other cities with 100 000 or more people.
also striking however is the amount of land in the west with very light settlement or no settlement.
do climate and geography help explain the variable patterns of settlement.
of the american countryside to nearby cities.
the development of large steam powered ocean liners created a highly competitive shipping industry allowing europeans and asians to cross the oceans to america much more cheaply and quickly than they had in the past.
migrations as a result of urbanization the late nineteenth century became an age of unprecedented geographic mobility as americans left the declining agricultural regions of the east at a dramatic rate.
some who left were moving to the newly developing farmlands of the west.
but many were moving to the cities of the east and the midwest.
geographic mobility among those leaving rural america for industrial cities in the late nineteenth century were young rural women for whom opportunities in the farm economy were limited.
as farms grew larger more commercial and more mechanized they became increasingly male preserves and since much of the workforce on many farms consisted of unskilled and often transient workers there were fewer family units than before.
farm women had once been essential for making clothes and other household goods but those goods were now available in stores or through catalogs.
hundreds of thousands of women moved to the cities therefore in search of work and community.
southern blacks were also beginning what would be a nearly century long exodus from the countryside into the cities.
their withdrawal was a testament to the poverty debt the age of the city.

what were the principal factors behind this substantial population growth.

the opportunities they found in cities were limited.
factory jobs for blacks were rare and professional opportunities almost nonexistent.
urban blacks tended to work as cooks janitors domestic servants and in other low paying service occupations.
because many such jobs were considered womens work black women often outnumbered black men in the cities.
by the end of the nineteenth century there were substantial african american communities 10 000 people or more in over thirty cities many of them in the american south but some new york city chicago communities washington d c baltimore in the north.
or in border states.
much more substantial african american migration would come during world war i and after but the black communities established in the late nineteenth century paved the way for the great population movements of the future.
the most important source of urban population growth in the late nineteenth century however was the arrival of great numbers of new immigrants from abroad 10 million between 1860 and 1890 18 million more in the three decades after that.
some came from canada mexico latin america and particularly on the west coast china and japan.
but by far the greatest number came from europe.
after 1880 the flow of new arrivals began for the first time to include large numbers of people from southern and eastern europe italians greeks slavs slovaks russian jews armenians and others.
by the 1890s more than half of all immigrants came from these new regions as opposed to less than 2 percent in the 1860s.

what factors drew so many immigrants to the united states in these years.
1861 1866 1871 1876 1881 1886 1891 1896 1901 1906 1911 1916 1865 1870 1875 1880 1885 1890 1895 1900 1905 1910 1915 1920 year m tj large waves of immigration that transformed american society in the late nineteenth jl jlt jlji and early twentieth centuries were not unique to the united states.
they were part of a worldwide movement of peoples that affected every continent.
these epic migrations were the product of two related forces population growth and industrialization.
the population of europe grew faster in the second half of the nineteenth century than it had ever grown before almost doubling between 1850 and the beginning of world war i.
the population growth was a result of growing economies able to support more people and productive agriculture that helped end debilitating famines.
but the rapid growth nevertheless strained the resources of many parts of europe and affected in particular rural people who were now too numerous to live off the available land.
many decided to move to other parts of the world where land was more plentiful or jobs were more available.
at the same time industrialization drew millions of people from rural areas into cities sometimes cities in their own countries but often industrial cities in other more economically advanced nations.
from 1800 to the start of world war i 50 million europeans migrated to new lands overseas people from almost all areas of europe but in the later years of the century when migration reached its peak mostly from poor rural areas in southern and eastern europe.
italy russia and poland were among the biggest sources of late nineteenth century migrants.
almost two thirds of these immigrants came to the united states.
but nearly 20 million europeans migrated to other lands to canada australia new zealand south africa argentina and other parts of south america.
many of these migrants moved to vast areas of open land in these countries and established themselves as farmers.
many others settled in the industrial cities that were growing up in all these regions.
it was not only europeans who were transplanting themselves in these years.
vast numbers of migrants usually poor desperate people left asia africa and the pacific islands in search of better lives.
most of them could not afford the journey abroad on their own.
they moved instead as indentured servants agreeing to a term of servitude in their new land in exchange for food shelter and private collection peter newark american pictures bridgeman images.
in earlier stages of immigration most new immigrants from europe with the exception of the irish were at least modestly prosperous and educated.
germans and scandinavians in particular had headed west on their arrival either to farm or to work as businessmen merchants professionals or skilled laborers in midwestern cities such as st louis cincinnati and milwaukee.
most of the new immigrants of the late nineteenth century however lacked the capital to buy farmland and lacked the education to establish themselves in professions.
so like the poor irish immigrants before the civil war they settled overwhelmingly in industrial cities where most of them took unskilled jobs.
the ethnic city by 1890 the population of some major urban areas consisted of a majority of foreign born immigrants and their children 87 percent of the population of chicago 80 percent in new york city 84 percent in milwaukee and detroit.
london the largest industrial city in europe by contrast had a population that was 94 percent native.
jew york had more irish than dublin and more germans the diverse american city than hamburg.
chicago eventually had more poles than warsaw.
equally striking was the diversity of the new immigrant populations.
in other countries experiencing heavy immigration in this period most of the new arrivals were coming from one or two sources argentina for example was experiencing great migrations too but almost everyone was coming from italy and spain.
in the united states however no single national group dominated.
in the last four decades of the nineteenth century substantial groups arrived from italy germany scandinavia austria hungary russia great britain ireland poland greece canada japan china holland mexico and many other nations.
in some towns a dozen different ethnic groups found themselves living in close proximity.
most of the new immigrants were rural people and their adjustment to city life was often painful.
to help ease the transition many national groups formed close knit ethnic communities within the cities italian polish jewish slavic chinese french canadian mexican and other neighborhoods often called immigrant ghettos that attempted to re create in the new world many of the features of the old.
j the age of the city 491 other northwestern transportation.
recruiters of indentured servants fanned out across china japan areas of africa and the pacific islands and above all india.
french and british recruiters brought hundreds of thousands of indian migrants to work in plantations in their own asian and african colonies.
chinese laborers were recruited to work on plantations in cuba and hawaii mines in malaya peru south africa and australia and railroad projects in canada peru and the united states.
african indentured servants moved in large numbers to the caribbean and pacific islanders tended to move to other islands or to australia.
the migration of european peoples to new lands was largely voluntary.
most migrants moved to the united states where indentured servitude was illegal non european migration brought relatively small numbers of people to the united states but together these various forms of migration produced one of the greatest population movements in the history of the world and transformed not just the united states but much of the globe as well.

eastern european sources of immigration from europe 1860 1900 this pie chart shows the sources of european immigration in the late nineteenth century.
the largest number of immigrants continued to come from traditional sources britain ireland germany scandinavia but the beginnings of what in the early twentieth century would become a major influx of immigrants from new sources southern and eastern europe in particular are already visible here.
immigration from other sources mexico south and central america and asia was also significant during this period.
why would these newer sources of european and other kinds of immigration create controversy among older stock americans.
some ethnic neighborhoods consisted of people who had migrated to america from the same province town or village.
even when the population was more diverse however the immigrant neighborhoods offered newcomers much that was familiar.
they could find newspapers and theaters in their native languages stores selling their native n foods churches or synagogues and fra ethnic ternal organizations that provided links communities with their national pasts.
many immi grants also maintained close ties with their native countries.
they stayed in touch with relatives who had remained behind.
some perhaps as many as a third in the early years returned to europe or asia or mexico after a short time others helped bring the rest of their families to america.
the cultural cohesiveness of the ethnic communities clearly eased the pain of separation from the immigrants native lands.
what role it played in helping immigrants become absorbed into the economic life of america is a more difficult question to answer.
it is clear that some ethnic groups jews and germans in particular advanced economically more rapidly than others for example the irish.
one explanation is that by huddling together in ethnic neighborhoods immigrant groups tended to reinforce the cultural values of their previous societies.
when those values were particularly well suited to economic advancement in an industrial society as was for example the high value jews placed on education ethnic identification may have helped members of a group to improve their lots.
when other values predominated maintaining community solidarity sustaining family ties preserving order progress could be less rapid.
assimilation despite the substantial differences among the various immigrant communities virtually all groups of the foreign born had certain things in common.
most immigrants of course shared the experience of living in cities and of adapting from a rural past to an urban present.
most were young the majority of newcomers were between fifteen and forty five years old.
and in virtually all communities of foreign born immigrants the strength of ethnic ties had to compete against another powerful force the desire for assimilation.
many of the new arrivals from abroad had come to america with romantic visions of the new world.
and however disillusioning they might find their first con americanization tact witj the united states they usually 492 chapter 18 i ethnic and class segregation in milwaukee 1850 1890 this map illustrates the complex pattern of settlement in milwaukee a pattern that was in many ways typical of many industrial cities in the late nineteenth century.
two related phenomena industrialization and massive immigration from abroad shaped the landscape of the city in these years.
by 1890 first and second generation immigrants made up 84 percent of the citys population.
note the complicated distribution of ethnic groups in distinctive neighborhoods throughout the city and note too the way in which middle class people especially native born middle class people which included many people of german descent whose families had been in the united states for generations isolated themselves from the areas in which the working class lived.
what were some of the advantages and disadvantages of this ethnic clustering to the immigrants who lived in these communities.
retained the dream of becoming true americans even some first generation immigrants worked hard to rid themselves of all vestiges of their old cultures to become thoroughly americanized.
second generation immigrants were even more likely to attempt to break with the old ways to try to assimilate completely into what they considered the real american culture.
some even looked with contempt on parents and grandparents who continued to preserve traditional ethnic habits and values.
the urge to assimilate put a particular strain on relations between men and women in immigrant communities.
many of the foreign born came from cultures in which women were more subordinate to men and more fully lodged within the family than most women in the united states.
in some immigrant cultures parents expected to arrange their children s marriages and to control almost every changing moment of their daughters lives until gender roles f.
but out of either choice or economic necessity many immigrant women and even more of the american born daughters of immigrants began working outside the home and developing friendships interests and attachments outside the family.
the result was not the collapse of the family centered cultures of immigrant communi 1 ipq rhnqp cultures nroved remarkablv durable.
but there were adjustments to the new and more fluid life of the american city and often considerable tension in the process.
assimilation was not entirely a matter of choice.
native born americans encouraged it both deliberately and inadvertently in countless ways.
public schools taught children in english and employers often insisted that workers speak english on the job.
although there were merchants in immigrant communities who sold ethnically distinctive foods and clothing most stores by necessity sold mainly american products forcing immigrants to adapt their diets wardrobes and lifestyles to american norms.
church leaders were often native born americans or assimilated immigrants who encouraged their parishioners to adopt american ways.
some even reformed their theology and liturgy to make it more compatible with the norms of the new country.
reform judaism imported from germany to the united states in the midnineteenth century was an effort by american jewish leaders as it had been among german leaders to make their faith less foreign to the dominant culture of a largely christian nation.
exclusion the arrival of so many new immigrants and the way many of them clung to old ways and created culturally distinctive communities provoked fear and resentment among some nativism native born americans just as earlier arrivals had done.
some people reacted against the immigrants out of generalized fears and prejudices seeing in their foreignness the source of all the disorder and corruption of the urban world.
these people a chicago newspaper wrote shortly after the haymarket bombing referring to striking immigrant workers are not american but the very scum and offal of europe.
europes human and inhuman rubbish native born americans on the west coast had a similar cul tural aversion to mexican chinese and japanese immigrants.
other native laborers were often incensed by the willingness of the immigrants to accept lower wages and to take over the jobs of strikers.
the rising nativism provoked political responses.
in 1887 henry bowers a self educated lawyer obsessed with a hatred of immigration catholics and foreigners founded the restriction american protective association a group league committed to stopping the immigrant tide.
by 1894 membership in the organization had reportedly reached 500 000 with chapters throughout the northeast and midwest.
that same year a more genteel organization the immigration restriction league was founded in 4 the age of the city 493 pushcart vendor many immigrants to american cities aspired to be merchants.
but many people with such aspirations could not afford to rent or buy a shop.
so they set up business instead in pushcarts which they parked along sidewalks and from which they sold a variety of wares.
this pushcart was photographed with its owner on the lower east side of manhattan around the end of the nineteenth century.
the granger collection new york boston by five harvard alumni.
it was dedicated to the belief that immigrants should be screened through literacy tests and other standards designed to separate the desirable from the undesirable.
the league avoided the crude conspiracy theories and the rabid xenophobia of the american protective association.
its sophisticated nativism made it possible for many educated middle class people to support the restrictionist cause.
even before the rise of these new organizations politicians were struggling to find answers to the immigration question in 1882 congress had responded to strong anti asian sentiment in california and elsewhere and restricted chinese immigration even though the chinese made up only 1 2 percent of the population of the west coast see pp.
in the same year congress denied entry to undesirables convicts paupers the mentally incompetent and placed a tax of 50 cents on each person admitted.
later legislation of the 1890s enlarged the list of those barred from immigrating and increased the tax.
pro immigration this political cartoon from 1880 by joseph keppler expresses the view that people from all over the world should be welcomed into the ever expanding united states.
while opposition to immigration from the restrictionist camp was great immigrants were seen by many employers as a large and cheap labor supply necessary to support a rapidly growing economy.
the granger collection new york 494 chapter 18 these laws kept out only a small number of aliens however and more ambitious restriction proposals advantages of made little prosress congress passed cheap labor a literacy requirement for immigrants in 1897 but president grover cleveland vetoed it.
the restrictions had limited success because many native born americans far from fearing immigration welcomed it and exerted strong political pressure against the restrictionists.
immigration was providing a rapidly growing economy with a cheap and plentiful labor supply many employers argued that americas industrial and indeed agricultural development would be impossible without it.
the urban landscape the city was a place of remarkable contrasts.
it had homes of almost unimaginable size and grandeur and hovels of indescribable squalor.
it had conveniences unknown to earlier generations and problems that seemed beyond societys capacity to solve.
both the attractions and the problems were a result of the stunning pace at which cities were growing.
the expansion of the urban population helped spur important new technological and industrial developments.
but the rapid growth also produced misgovernment poverty congestion filth epidemics and great fires.
planning and building simply could not match the pace of growth.
the creation of public space in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries cities had generally grown up haphazardly with little central planning.
by the mid nineteenth century however reformers planners architects and others began to call for a more ordered vision of the city.
the result was the self conscious creation of public spaces and public services.
among the most important innovations of the mid nineteenth century were great urban parks which reflected the desire of a growing number of urban leaders to provide an antidote to the congestion of the city landscape.
the most successful american promoters of this notion of the park as refuge were the landscape designers frederick law olmsted and calvert vaux who teamed up in the late 1850s to design new york citys central park.
they deliberately created a public space that would look as little like the city as possible.
instead of the ordered formal spaces common in some european cities they created a space that seemed to be entirely natural even though almost all of central park was carefully designed and constructed.
central park was from the start one of the most popular and admired public spaces in the world and as a result olmsted and vaux were recruited to design great parks and public spaces in other cities brooklyn boston philadelphia chicago and washington d c frederick law olmsted and calvert vaux central park band concert by the late nineteenth century new york city s central park was already considered one of the great urban landscapes of the world.
to new yorkers it was an irresistible escape from the crowded noisy life of the rest of the city.
but the park itself sometimes became enormously crowded as well as this well dressed audience at a band concert makes clear.
the granger collection new york at the same time that cities were creating great parks they were also creating great public buildings libraries art galleries natural history museums theaters concert halls and opera houses.
new york citys metropolitan museum of art was only the largest and best known of many great museums taking shape in the late nineteenth century others were created in such cities as boston chicago philadelphia and washington d c.
in one city after another new and lavish public libraries appeared as if to confirm the citys role as a center of learning and knowledge.
wealthy residents of cities were the principal force behind the creation of the great public buildings and at times even parks.
as their own material and social aspirations grew they wanted the public life of the city to provide them with amenities to match their expectations.
becoming an important patron of a major cultural institution was an especially effective route to social distinction.
but this philanthropy whatever the motives behind it also produced valuable assets for the city as a whole.
as the size and aspirations of the great cities increased urban leaders launched monumental projects to remake the way their cities looked.
inspired by massive city rebuilding projects in paris london berlin and other european cities some american cities began to clear away older neighborhoods and streets and city create grand monumental avenues lined beautiful with new more impressive buildings.
a pan 9 yement ticularly important event in inspiring this effort to remake the city was the 1893 columbian exposition in chicago a worlds fair constructed to honor the 400th anniversary of columbuss first voyage to america.
at the center of the wildly popular exposition was a the age of the city 495 cluster of neoclassical buildings the great white city constructed in the fashionable beaux arts style of the time arranged symmetrically around a formal lagoon.
it became the inspiration for what became known as the city beautiful movement led by the architect of the great white city daniel burnham.
the movement aimed to impose a similar order and symmetry on the disordered life of cities around the country.
make no little plans burnham liked to tell city planners.
his influence led to the remaking of cities all across the country from washington d c to chicago and san francisco.
only rarely however were planners able to overcome the obstacles of private landowners and complicated urban politics.
they rarely achieved more than a small portion of their dreams.
there were no reconstructions of american cities to match the elaborate nineteenth century reshaping of paris and london.
the effort to remake the city did not just focus on redesigning the existing landscape.
it occasionally led to the creation of entirely new ones.
in boston in the late 1850s a large area of marshy tidal land was gradually filled in to create the neighborhood known as back bay the landfill project took more the back bay t ian orty years t0 complete and was one of the largest public works projects ever undertaken in america to that point.
but boston was not alone.
chicago reclaimed large areas from lake michigan as it expanded and at one point raised the street level for the entire city to help avoid the problems the marshy land created.
in washington d c another marshy site large areas were filled in and slated for development.
in new york and other cities the response to limited space was not so much creating new land as annexing adjacent territory.
a great wave of annexations expanded the boundaries of many american cities in the 1890s and beyond.
housing the well to do one of the greatest problems of this precipitous growth was finding housing for the thousands of new residents who were pouring into the cities every day.
for the prosperous however housing was seldom a worry.
the availability of cheap labor and the reduced cost of building let anyone with even a moderate income afford a house.
many of the richest urban residents lived in palatial mansions in the heart of the city and created lavish fashionable districts fifth avenue in new york city back bay and beacon hill in boston society hill in philadelphia lake shore drive in chicago nob hill in san francisco and many others.
the moderately well to do and as time went on increasing numbers of wealthy people as well took advantage of the less expensive land on the edges of the city and settled in growth of new suburbs linked to the downtowns by suburbs trains or streetcars or improved roads.
chicago in the 1870s for example boasted nearly 100 residential suburbs connected with the city by railroad and offering the joys of pure air peacefulness qui etude and natural scenery boston too saw the develop ment of some of the earliest streetcar suburbs dorchester brookline and others which catered to both the wealthy and the middle class.
new yorkers of moderate means settled in new suburbs on the northern fringes of manhattan and commuted downtown by trolley or riverboat.
real estate developers worked to create and promote suburban communities that would appeal to nostalgia for the countryside that many city dwellers felt.
affluent suburbs in particular were notable for lawns trees and houses designed to look manorial.
even modest communities strove to emphasize the opportunities suburbs provided for owning land.
housing workers and the poor most urban residents however could not afford either to own a house in the city or to move to the suburbs.
instead they stayed in the city centers and rented.
because demand was so high and space so scarce they had little bargaining power in the process.
landlords tried to squeeze as many rent paying residents as possible into the smallest available space.
in manhattan for example the average population density in 1894 was 143 people per acre a higher rate than that of the most crowded cities of europe paris had 127 per acre berlin 101 and far higher than in any other american city then or since.
in some neighborhoods the lower east side of new york city for example density was more than 700 people per acre among the highest levels in the world.
landlords were reluctant to invest much in immigrant housing confident they could rent dwellings for a profit regardless of their conditions.
in the cities of the south charleston new orleans richmond poor african americans lived in crumbling former slave quarters.
in boston they moved into cheap three story wooden houses triple deckers many of them decaying fire hazards.
in baltimore and philadelphia they crowded into narrow brick row houses.
and in new york as in many other cities more than a million people lived in tenements.
the word tenement had originally referred simply to a multiple family rental building but by the late nineteenth century it was being used to describe slum dwellings only.
the first tenements tenements built in new york city in 1850 had been hailed as a great improvement in housing for the poor.
it is built with the design of supplying the laboring people with cheap lodgings a local newspaper commented and will have many advantages over the cellars and other miserable abodes which too many are forced to inhabit but tenements themselves soon became miserable abodes with many windowless rooms little or no plumbing or central heating and often a row of privies in the basement.
a new york state law of 1870 required a window in every bedroom of tenements built after that date developers complied by adding small sunless air shafts to their buildings.
most of all tenements were incredibly crowded with three four and sometimes many more people crammed into each small room.
jacob riis a danish immigrant and new york newspaper ob riis reporter and photographer shocked many middle class americans with his sensa tional and some claimed sensationalized descriptions and 496 chapter 18 a tenement laundry immigrant families living in tenements in new york and in many other cities earned their livelihoods as they could.
this woman shown here with some of her children was typical of many working class mothers who found income producing activities they could pursue in the home in this case laundry.
this room dominated by large vats and piles of other people s laundry is also the family s home as the crib and religious pictures make clear.
bettmann corbis pictures of tenement life in his 1890 book how the other half lives.
slum dwellings he said were almost universally sunless practically airless and poisoned by summer stenches the hall is dark and you might stumble over the children pitching pennies back there but the solution many reformers including riis favored and that governments sometimes adopted was to raze slum dwellings without building any new or better housing to replace them.
urban transportation urban growth posed monumental transportation challenges.
old downtown streets were often too narrow for the heavy traffic that was beginning to move over them.
most were without a hard paved surface producing either a sea of mud or a cloud of dust.
in the last decades of the nineteenth century more and more streets were paved usually with wooden blocks transportation problems bricks or asphalt but paving could not keep up with the number of new thoroughfares the expanding cities were creating.
by 1890 chicago had paved only about 600 of its more than 2 000 miles of streets.
but it was not simply the conditions of the streets that impeded urban transportation.
it was the numbers of people who needed to move every day from one part of the city to another numbers that mandated the development of mass transportation.
streetcars drawn on tracks by horses had been introduced into some cities even before the civil war.
but the horsecars were not fast enough so many communities developed new forms of mass transit.
in 1870 new york opened its first elevated railway whose noisy filthy steam powered trains moved rapidly above the city streets on massive iron structures.
new york chicago san francisco and other cities also experimented with cable cats mass transit towed by continuously moving underground cables.
richmond virginia introduced the the age of the city 497 streetcar suburbs in nineteenth century new orleans this map of streetcar lines in new orleans reveals a pattern that repeated itself in many cities changing residential patterns emerging in response to new forms of transportation.
the map reveals the movement of population outward from the central city as streetcar lines emerged to make access to the downtown easier.
note the dramatic growth of residential suburbs in the last forty years of the nineteenth century in particular.
what other forms of mass transportation were emerging in american cities in these years.
first electric trolley line in 1888 and by 1895 such systems were operating in 850 towns and cities.
in 1897 boston opened the first american subway when it put some of its trolley lines underground.
at the same time cities were developing new techniques of road and bridge building.
one of the great technological marvels of the 1880s was the completion of the brooklyn bridge in new york city a dramatic steel cable suspension span designed by john a roebling.
the skyscraper cities were growing upward as well as outward.
until the mid nineteenth century almost no buildings more than four or five stories high could be constructed.
construction techniques were such that it was difficult and expensive to build adequate structural supports for tall buildings.
there was also a limit to the number of flights of stairs the users of buildings could be expected to climb.
but by the 1850s there had been successful experiments with machine powered passenger elevators and by the 1870s new methods of construction using cast iron and steel beams made it easier to build tall buildings.
not long after the civil war therefore tall buildings began to appear in the major cities.
the equitable building in new york city completed in 1870 and rising seven and a half floors above the street was one of the first in the nation to be built with an elevator.
a few years later even taller buildings of ten and twelve stories were appearing elsewhere in new york in chicago and in other growing cities around the country.
with each passing decade the size and number of tall buildings increased until by the 1890s the term skyscraper became a popular description of them.
strains of urban life the increasing congestion of the cities and the absence of adequate public services produced many hazards.
crime fire disease indigence and pollution all placed strains on the capacities of metropolitan institutions and both governments and private institutions were for a time poorly equipped to respond to them.
fire and disease one serious problem was fires.
in one major city after another fires destroyed large downtown areas where many buildings were still constructed of wood.
chicago and boston suffered great fires in 1871.
other cities among them baltimore and san francisco where a tremendous earthquake produced a 498.
chapter 18 development of professional fire departments catastrophic fire in 1906 experienced similar disasters.
the great fires were terrible and deadly experiences but they also encouraged the construction of fireproof buildings and the development of professional fire departments.
they also forced cities to rebuild at a time when new technological and architectural innovations were available.
some of the modern high rise downtowns of american cities arose out of the rubble of great fires.
environmental degradation modern notions of environmentalism were unknown to most americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
but the environmental degradation of many american cities was a visible and disturbing fact of life in those years.
the frequency of great fires the dangers of disease and plague the extraordinary crowding of working class neighborhoods were all examples of the environmental costs of industrialization and rapid urbanization.
improper disposal of human and industrial waste was a common feature of almost all large cities in these years.
such practices contributed to the pollution of rivers and lakes and also in many cases to the compromising of the city s drinking water.
this was particularly true in poor neighborhoods with primitive plumbing and sometimes no indoor plumbing outdoor privies that leaked into the groundwater and overcrowded tenements.
the presence of domestic animals horses which were the principal means of transportation until the late nineteenth century but in poor neighborhoods also cows pigs and other animals contributed as well to the environmental problems.
air quality in many cities was poor as well.
few americans had the severe problems that london experienced in these air pollution years with its perpetual fogs created by the debris from the burning of soft coal.
but air pollution from factories and from stoves and furnaces in offices homes and other buildings was constant and at times severe.
the incidence of respiratory infection and related diseases was much higher in cities than it was in non urban areas and it accelerated rapidly in the late nineteenth century.
by the early twentieth century reformers were actively crusading to improve the environmental conditions of cities and were beginning to achieve some notable successes.
by 1910 most large american cities had constructed sewage disposal systems often at great cost to protect the drinking water of their inhabitants and to prevent the great bacterial plagues that impure water had helped create in the past such as the 1873 yellow fever epidemic in memphis that killed more than 5 000 people.
alice hamilton a physician who became an investigator for the u s bureau of labor was a pioneer in the identification of pollution in the workplace.
she documented pu l ways in w ic improper disposal of such potentially dangerous substances as lead the great fire in chicago this haunting photograph shows the intersection of state and madison streets which chicagoans liked to call the world s busiest intersection in the aftermath of the great fire of 1871.
it destroyed much of the city s downtown.
horse drawn streetcars are shown here traveling the ghostly still smoke filled streets.
at left posters advertise the new locations of displaced stores and offices prompting the photographer to attach the optimistic title back in business to this image.
archive photos getty images she was one of the first physicians to identify lead poisoning chemical waste and ceramic dust was creating widespread sickness.
and despite considerable resistance from many factory owners she did bring such problems to public attention and in some states at least inspired legislation to require manufacturers to solve them.
in 1912 the federal government created the public health service which was charged with preventing such occupational diseases as tuberculosis anemia and carbon dioxide poisoning which were common in the garment industry and other trades.
it attempted to create common health standards for all factories but since the agency had few powers of enforcement it had limited impact.
it did however establish the protection of public health as a responsibility of the federal government and also helped bring to public attention the environmental forces that endangered health.
the creation of the occupational health and safety administration in 1970 which gave government the authority to require employers to create safe and healthy workplaces was a legacy of the public health service s early work.
urban poverty above all perhaps the expansion of the cities created widespread and often desperate poverty.
despite the rapid growth of urban economies the sheer number of new residents ensured that many people would be unable to earn enough for a decent subsistence.
public agencies and private philanthropic organizations offered very limited relief.
they were generally dominated by middle class people who tended to believe that too much assistance would breed dependency and that poverty was the fault of the poor themselves a result of laziness or alcoholism the age of the city 499 or other kinds of irresponsibility.
most tried to restrict aid to the deserving poor those who truly could not help themselves at least according to the standards of the organizations themselves which conducted elaborate investigations to separate the deserving from the undeserving.
other charitable societies for example the salvation army which began operating in america in 1879 one year after it salvation was funcled in london concentrated army more on religious revivalism than on the relief of the homeless and hungry.
tensions often arose between native protestant philanthropists and catholic immigrants over religious doctrine and standards of morality.
middle class people grew particularly alarmed over the rising number of poor children in the cities some of them orphans or runaways living alone or in small groups scrounging for food.
these street arabs as they were often called attracted more attention from reformers than any other group although that attention produced no serious solutions to their problems.
crime and violence poverty and crowding naturally bred crime and violence.
much of it was relatively minor the work of pickpockets con high crime artists swindlers and petty thieves.
but rates some was more dangerous.
the american murder rate rose rapidly in the late nineteenth century even as such rates were declining in europe from 25 murders for every million people in 1880 to over 100 by the end of the century a rate slightly higher than the relatively high rates of the 1980s and 1990s.
that reflected in part a very high level of violence in some nonurban areas the american south where rates of lynching and homicide were particularly high and the west where the rootlessness and instability of new communities cow towns mining camps and the like created much violence.
but the cities contributed their share to the increase in crime as well.
native born americans liked to believe that crime was a result of the violent proclivities of immigrant groups and they cited the rise of gangs and criminal organizations in various ethnic communities.
but native born americans were as likely to commit crimes as immigrants.
the rising crime rates encouraged many cities to develop larger and more professional police forces.
in the early nineteenth century police forces had often been private and informal organizations urban governments had resisted professionalized law enforcement.
by the end of the century however professionalized public police departments were a part of the life of virtually every city and town.
they worked closely with district attorneys and other public prosecutors who were also becoming more numerous and more important in city life.
police forces themselves could also spawn corruption and brutality particularly since jobs on them were often filled through political patronage.
and complaints about police dealing differently with white and black suspects or with rich and poor communities were common in the late nineteenth century.
some members of the middle class fearful of urban insurrections felt the need for even more substantial forms of protection.
urban national guard groups many of them created and manned by middle class elites built imposing armories on the outskirts of affluent neighborhoods and stored large supplies of weapons and ammunition in preparation for uprisings that in fact never occurred.
the machine and the boss newly arrived immigrants many of whom could not speak english needed help in adjusting to american urban life its laws its customs usually its language.
some ethnic communities created their own self help organizations.
but for many residents of the inner cities the principal source of assistance was the political machine.
the urban machine was one of americas most distinctive political institutions.
it owed its existence to the power vacuum that the chaotic growth of cities and the boss rule very limited growth of city governments puck magazine puck was the first successful humor magazine published in the united states.
issues were published from 1871 to 1918.
it offered political cartoons caricatures and satire on the issues of the day.
this cover takes on the graft and corruption of tammany hall.
the library of congress lc uszc4 7884 500 chapter 18 had created.
it was also a product of the potential voting power of large immigrant communities.
any politician who could mobilize that power stood to gain enormous influence if not public office.
and so there emerged a group of urban bosses themselves often of foreign birth or parentage.
many were irish because they spoke english and because some had acquired previous political experience from the long irish struggle against the english at home.
almost all were men in most states women could not yet vote.
the principal function of the political boss was simple to win votes for his organization.
that meant winning the loyalty of his constituents.
to do so a boss might provide potential voters with occasional relief baskets of groceries bags of coal.
he might step in to save those arrested for petty crimes from jail.
he rewarded many of his followers with patronage with jobs in city government or in such city agencies as the police which the machines elected officials often controlled with jobs building or operating the new transit systems and with opportunities to rise in the political organization itself.
machines were also vehicles for making money.
politicians enriched themselves and their allies through various forms of graft and corruption.
some of it might be fairly open what graft and george washington plunkitt of new york corruption citys tammany hall called honest graft for example a politician might discover in advance where a new road or streetcar line was to be built buy an interest in the land near it and profit when the city had to buy the land from him or when property values rose as a result of the construction.
but there was also covert graft kickbacks from contractors in exchange for contracts to build streets sewers public buildings and other projects the sale of franchises for the operation of such public utilities as street railways waterworks and electric light and power systems.
the most famously corrupt city boss was william m tweed boss of new york citys tammany hall in the 1860s and 1870s whose excesses finally landed him in jail in 1872.
middle class critics saw the corrupt machines as blights on the cities and obstacles to progress.
in fact political organizations were often responsible not just for corruption but also for modernizing city infrastructures for expanding the role of government and for creating stability in a political and social climate that otherwise would have lacked a center.
the motives of the bosses may have been largely venal but their achievements were sometimes greater than those of the scrupulous reformers who challenged them.
several factors made boss rule possible.
one was the power of immigrant voters who were less concerned with middle class reasons for ic eas p itical morality than with obtain boss rule ing the services that machines provided and reformers did not.
another was the link between the political organizations and wealthy prominent citizens who profited from their dealings with bosses.
still another was the structural weakness of city governments.
the boss by virtue of his control over his machine formed an invis ible government that provided an alternative to what was ften the inadequacy of the regular government.
the urban machine was not without competition.
reform groups frequently mobilized public outrage at the corruption of the bosses and often succeeded in driving machine politicians from office.
tammany for example saw its candidates for mayor and other high city offices lose almost as often as they won in the last decades of the nineteenth century.
but the reform organizations typically lacked the permanence of the machine.
thus many critics of machines began to argue for more basic reforms for structural changes in the nature of city government.
middle class culture the rise of mass consumption for urban middle class americans the last decades of the nineteenth century were a time of dramatic advances.
indeed it was in those years that a distinctive middle class culture began to exert a powerful influence over american life.
much of the rest of american society the majority of the population which was neither urban nor middle class advanced less rapidly or not at all but almost no one was unaffected by the rise of a new urban consumer culture.
patterns of income and consumption american industry could not have grown as it did without the expansion of markets.
the growth of demand occurred at almost all levels of society a result not just of the new techniques of production and mass distribution that were making consumer goods less expensive but also of rising incomes.
incomes in the industrial era were rising for almost everyone although at highly uneven rates.
the most conspicuous result of the new economy was the creation of vast fortunes.
but more important for society as a whole were the growth and increasing rising income prosperity of the middle class.
the salaries of clerks accountants middle managers and other white collar workers rose on average by a third between 1890 and 1910 and in some parts of the middle class salaries rose by much more.
doctors lawyers and other professionals for example experienced a particularly dramatic increase in the prestige and profitability of their professions.
working class incomes rose too in those years although from a much lower base and considerably more slowly.
iron and steelworkers despite the setbacks their unions suffered saw their hourly wages increase by a third between 1890 and 1910 but industries with large female african american or mexican workforces shoes textiles paper laundries many areas of commercial agriculture saw very small increases as did almost all industries in the south.
also important to the new mass market were the develop ment of affordable products and the creation of new merchandising techniques which made many consumer goods available to a broad market for the first time.
a good example the age of the city 501 new of such changes was the emer merchandising gence of ready made clothing techn ques n thg early nineteenth cenm most americans had made their own clothing usually from cloth they bought from merchants at times from fabrics they spun and wove themselves.
affluent people contracted with private tailors to make their clothes.
but the invention of the sewing machine and the spur that the civil war and its demand for uniforms gave to the manufacture of clothing created an enormous industry devoted to producing ready made garments.
by the end of the century almost all americans bought their clothing from stores.
partly as a result much larger numbers of people became concerned with personal style.
interest in women s fashion for example had once been a luxury reserved for the affluent.
now middle class and even working class women could strive to develop a distinctive style of dress.
new homes even modest ones now included clothes closets.
even people in remote rural areas could develop stylish wardrobes by ordering from the new mail order houses.
another example of the rise of the mass market was the way americans bought and prepared food.
the development and mass production of tin cans in the 1880s created a large new industry devoted to packaging and selling canned food and as a result of the techniques gail borden an inventor and politician developed in the 1850s condensed milk.
refrigerated railroad cars made it possible for perishables meats vegetables dairy products and other foodstuffs to travel long distances without spoiling.
the development of artificially frozen ice made it possible for many more households to afford iceboxes.
among other things the changes meant improved diets and better health life expectancy rose six years in the first two decades of the twentieth century.
chain stores and mail order houses changes in marketing also altered the way americans bought chain stores gds.
small local stores faced competition from new chain stores the great atlantic pacific tea company a p began creating a national network of grocery stores as early as the 1850s and expanded it rapidly after the civil war.
f w woolworth opened his first five and ten cent store in utica new york in 1879 and went on to build a national chain of dry goods stores.
chain stores were able to sell manufactured goods at lower prices than the local independent stores because the chains had so much more volume.
from the beginning the chains faced opposition from the established merchants they threatened to displace and from others who feared that they would jeopardize the character of their communities.
similar controversies have continued department stores department stores often created events to help promote sales of their many wares.
here strawbridge and clothier department store creates quite a stir on market street in philadelphia in 1907.
corbis into the twenty first century over the spread of large chains such as wal mart and barnes noble.
but most customers however loyal they might feel to a local merchant found it difficult to resist the greater variety and lower prices the chains provided them.
chain stores were slow to reach remote rural areas which remained dependent on poorly stocked and often very expensive country stores.
but rural people gradually gained access to the new consumer world through the great mail order houses.
in 1872 montgomery ward a chicago based traveling salesman distributed a catalog of consumer goods in association with the farmers organization the grange see p 520.
by the 1880s he was offering thousands of items at low prices to farmers throughout the midwest and beyond.
he soon faced stiff competition from sears roebuck first established by richard sears in chicago in 1887.
together the bulky catalogs from ward and sears changed the lives of many isolated people introducing them to and explaining for them new trends of fashion and home decor as well as making available new tools machinery and technologies for the home.
department stores in larger cities the emergence of great department stores which had appeared earlier in europe helped transform buying habits and turn shopping into an alluring and glamorous activity.
marshall field in chicago created one of the first american department stores and others soon followed macys in new york city abraham and straus in brooklyn jordan marsh and filenes in boston wanamakers in philadelphia.
social consequences of mail order catalogs impact of the department store 502 chapter 18 department stores transformed the concept of shopping in several ways.
first they brought together under one roof an enormous array of products that had previously been sold in separate shops.
second they sought to create an atmosphere of wonder and excitement to make shopping a glamorous activity.
department stores were elaborately decorated to suggest great luxury and elegance.
they included restaurants and tearooms and comfortable lounges to suggest that shopping could be a social event as well as a practical necessity.
they hired well dressed salesclerks mostly women to provide attentive service to their mostly female customers.
third department stores like mail order houses took advantage of economies of scale to sell merchandise at lower prices than many of the individual shops with which they competed.
women as consumers the rise of mass consumption had particularly dramatic effects on american women.
womens clothing styles changed much more rapidly and dramatically than mens which encouraged frequent purchases.
women generally bought and prepared food for their families so the availability of new food products changed not only the way everyone ate but also the way women shopped and cooked.
the consumer economy produced new employment opportunities for women as salesclerks in department stores and as waitresses in the rapidly prolifer national r r consumers ating restaurants.
and it spawned the league creation of a new movement in which women were to play a vital role the consumer protection movement.
the national consumers league formed in the 1890s under the leadership of florence kelley a prominent social reformer attempted to mobilize the power of women as consumers to force retailers and manufacturers to improve wages and working conditions for women workers.
by defining themselves as consumers many middle class women were able to find a stance from which they could become active participants in public life.
indeed the mobilization of women behind consumer causes and eventually many other causes was one of the most important political developments of the late nine teenth century.
leisure in the consumer society closely related to the growth of consumption was an increasing interest in leisure in part because time away from work was expanding rapidly for many people.
members of the urban middle and professional classes had increasingly large blocks of time in which they were not at work evenings weekends even vacations previously almost unknown among salaried workers.
working hours in many factories declined from an average of nearly seventy hours a week in 1860 to under sixty in 1900.
industrial workers might still be on the job six days a week but many of them had more time off in the evenings.
even farmers found that the mechanization of agriculture gave them more free time.
the lives of many americans were becoming compartmentalized with clear distinctions between work and leisure.
redefining leisure the growth of free time produced a redefinition of the idea of leisure in earlier eras relatively few americans had consid t ered leisure a valuable thing.
on the con new conceptions trary many equated it with laziness or of leisure sloth.
rest as in the relative inactivity many americans considered appropriate for the sabbath was valued because it offered time for spiritual reflection and prepared people for work.
but leisure time spent amusing oneself in nonproductive pursuits was not only unavailable to most americans but faintly scorned as well.
but with the rapid expansion of the economy and the in creasing number of hours workers had away from work it became possible to imagine leisure time as a normal part of the lives of many people.
industrial workers in pursuit of shorter hours adopted the slogan eight hours for work eight hours for rest and eight hours for what we will others were equally adamant in claiming that leisure time was both a right and an important contribution to an individuals emotional and even spiritual health.
the economist simon patten was one of the first intellectuals to articulate this new view of leisure which he tied closely to the rising interest in consumption.
patten in the theory of prosperity 1902 the neiv basis of civilization 1910 and simon patten other works challenged the centuries old assumption that the normal condition of civilization was a scarcity of goods.
we are now in the transition stage he wrote from this pain economy the economy of scarcity to a pleasure economy the principal goal of such an economy he claimed should be an abundance of goods and the pursuit of pleasure as americans became more accustomed to leisure as a normal part of their lives they began to look for new experi public ences with which to entertain themselves.
leisure entertainment usually meant going out spending leisure time in public places where there would be not only entertainment but also other people.
thousands of working class new yorkers flocked to the amusement park at coney island for example not just for the rides and shows but for the excitement of the crowds as well.
so did the thousands who spent evenings in dance halls vaudeville houses and concert halls.
affluent new yorkers enjoyed afternoons in central park where a principal attraction was seeing other people and being seen by them.
moviegoers were attracted not just by the movies themselves but also by the energy of the audiences at the lavish movie palaces that began to appear in cities in the early twentieth century j the age of the city 503 just as sports fans were drawn by the crowds as well as by the games.
mass entertainment did not always bridge differences of class race or gender.
saloons and most sporting events tended to be male preserves.
shopping itself becoming a valued leisure time activity and going to tearooms and luncheonettes were more characteristic of female leisure.
theaters pubs and clubs were often specific to particular ethnic communities or particular work groups.
there were in fact relatively few places where people of widely diverse backgrounds gathered together.
when the classes did meet in public spaces as they did for example in city parks there was often conflict over what constituted appropriate public behavior.
elites in new york city for example tried to prohibit anything but quiet genteel activities in central park while working class people wanted to use the public spaces for sports and entertainments.
but even divided by class ethnicity and gender leisure and popular entertainment did help sustain a vigorous public culture.
spectator sports the search for forms of public leisure hastened the rise of organized spectator sports especially baseball which by the end of the century was well on its way to becoming the national pastime see patterns of popular culture pp.
a game much like baseball known as rounders and derived from cricket had enjoyed limited popularity in great britain in the early nineteenth century.
versions of the game began to appear in america in the early 1830s well before abner doubleday supposedly invented baseball.
doubleday in fact had little to do with the creation of baseball and actually cared little for sports.
alexander cartwright a member of a new york city baseball club in the 1840s defined many of the rules and features of the game as we know it today.
by the end of the civil war interest in baseball had grown rapidly.
more than 200 amateur or semiprofessional teams or clubs existed many of which joined a national association and agreed on standard rules.
the first salaried team the major league cincinnati red stockings was formed in baseball 1869.
other cities soon fielded professional teams and in 1876 at the urging of albert spalding they banded together in the national league.
a rival league the american association soon appeared.
it eventually collapsed but in 1901 the american league emerged to replace it.
in 1903 the first modern world series was played in which the american league boston red sox beat the national league pittsburgh pirates.
by then baseball had become an important business and a great national preoccupation at least among men attracting paying crowds in the thousands.
the second most popular game football appealed at first to an elite segment of the male population in part because it originated in colleges and universities.
the first intercollegiate football game in america occurred between princeton and rutgers in 1869 and soon the game became entrenched as part of collegiate life.
early intercollegiate football bore only an indirect relation to the modern game it was more similar to what is now known as rugby.
by the late 1870s however the game was becoming standardized and was taking on the outlines of its modern form.
as college football grew in popularity it spread to other sections of the country notably to the midwestern state growth of universities which were destined soon to college replace the eastern schools as the great powers of the game.
it also began to exhibit football the american national game long before the modern major leagues began local baseball clubs were active throughout much of the united states establishing the game as the national pastime.

national baseball hall of fame and museum inc coney island who lived in the crowded cities of early twentieth century america yearned.
at times for ways to escape the noise smells heat and stress of the urban world.
wealthy families could travel to resorts or country houses but most city dwellers could not afford to venture far and for them ambitious entrepreneurs tried to provide dazzling escapes close to home.
the most celebrated such escape was coney island in brooklyn new york which became for a time the most famous and popular urban resort in america.
with its broad oceanfront beach coney island located in brooklyn had been an attractive destination for visitors since the early nineteenth century.
in the 1870s and 1880s investors built railroad lines from the city to the beach and began to create spectacular amusements to induce new yorkers to visit.
but the real success of coney island began in the 1890s when the amusements and spectacles reached a new level.
sea lion park which opened in 1895 showcased trained sea lions and exotic water rides.
steeplechase park opened two years later attracting visitors with a mechanical steeplechase ride in which visitors could pretend to be jockeys and stunt rooms with moving floors and powerful blasts of compressed air.
by then coney island was a popular site for real horse racing boxing matches and other sports.
it was postcard from luna park visitors to coney island sent postcards to friends and relatives by the millions and those cards were among the most effective promotional devices for the amusement parks.

some schools used ringers tramp athletes who were not even registered as students.
in an effort to eliminate such abuses amos alonzo stagg athletic director and coach at the university of chicago led in forming the western conference or big ten in 1896 which established rules governing eligibility.
football also became known for a high level of violence on the field eighteen college students died of football related injuries and over a hundred were seriously hurt in 1905.
the carnage prompted a white house conference on organized sports convened by president theodore roosevelt.
as a result of its deliberations a new intercollegiate association which in 1910 became known as the national college athletic association the ncaa revised the rules and the required equipment of the game in an effort to make it more honest and safer.
other popular spectator sports were emerging at about the same time.
basketball was invented in 1891 at springfield massachusetts by dr james a naismith a canadian working as athletic director for a local college.
boxing which had long been a disreputable activity concentrated primarily among j steeplechase park steeplechase park opened in 1897 and immediately began attracting crowds eager to ride the mechanical steeplechase shown here.
uig getty images also attracting gambling casinos saloons and brothels.
from the beginning among affluent middle class people at least coney island had a reputation as a rough and unsavory place.
but to the working class immigrants and lower middle class people it was a place of wonder excitement and escape.
the greatest coney island attraction luna park opened in 1903.
it provided not just rides and stunts but lavish reproductions of exotic places and spectacular adventures japanese gardens venetian canals with gondoliers a chinese theater a simulated trip to the moon and reenactments of such disasters as burning buildings earthquakes and even the volcanic eruption that destroyed pompeii.
a year later a competing company opened dreamland which tried to outdo even luna park with a 375 foot tower a three ring circus chariot races and a lilliputian village inspired by gulliver s travels.
a fire destroyed dreamland in 1911.
the popularity of coney island in these years was phenomenal.
thousands of people flocked to the large resort hotels that lined the beaches.
many thousands more made day trips out from the city by train and after 1920 subway.
in 1904 the average daily attendance at luna park alone was 90 000 people.
on weekends the coney island post office handled over 250 000 postcards through which visitors helped spread the reputation of the resort across the nation.
coney island s popularity reflected a number of powerful impulses among urban americans at the turn of the century.
it provided visitors with an escape from the heat and crowding of the vast metropolis around it.
it gave people who had few opportunities for travel a simulated glimpse of exotic places and events that they would never be able to experience in reality.
for immigrants many of whom lived in insular ethnic communities coney island provided a way of experiencing american mass culture on an equal footing with people of backgrounds different from their own.
almost everyone who found coney island appealing did so in part because it provided an escape from the genteel standards of behavior that governed so much of american life at the time.
in the amusement parks of coney island people delighted in finding themselves in situations that in any other setting would have seemed embarrassing or improper women s skirts blown above their heads with hot air people pummeled with water and rubber paddles by clowns hints of sexual freedom as strangers were forced to come into physical contact with one another on rides and amusements and as men and women revealed themselves to each other wearing bathing suits on the beach.
coney island remained popular throughout the first half of the twentieth century and it continues to attract visitors today although in much smaller numbers.
but its heyday was in the years before world war i when the exotic sights and thrilling adventures it offered had almost no counterparts elsewhere in american culture.
when radio movies and eventually television began to offer their own kind of mass escapism coney island gradually ceased to be the dazzling unmatchable marvel it had seemed to earlier generations.

how did coney island reflect the new culture of mass consumption.
what new ideas about leisure help account for the popularity of coney island in the early twentieth century.
what forms of popular culture today continue the coney island tradition of offering escapism adventure and excitement to a mass audience.
the urban working classes had become by the 1880s a more popular and in some places more reputable sport particularly after the adoption of the marquis of queensberry rules by which fighters wore padded gloves and fought in three minute rounds.
the first modern boxing hero john l sullivan became heavyweight champion of the world in 1882.
even so boxing remained illegal in some states until after world war i.
horse racing popular since colonial times became increasingly commercialized with the construction of large tracks and the establishment of large purse races such as the kentucky derby.
gambling and sports even in their infancy spectator sports were closely associated with gambling.
there was elaborate betting some of it organized by underground gambling syndicates on baseball and football almost from the start.
one of the most famous incidents in the history of baseball was the alleged throwing of the 1919 world series by the chicago white sox because of gambling an incident that became known as the black sox scandal.
that event resulted in the banning of some of the games most notable figures from the sport for life and the establishment of the office of commissioner of baseball 506 chapter 18 to clean up the game.
boxing was troubled throughout its history by the influence of gambling and the frequent efforts of managers to fix fights in the interests of bettors.
horse racing as it became commercialized was openly organized around betting with the race tracks themselves establishing odds and taking bets.
the rise of spectator sports and gambling was largely a response to the desire of men to create a distinctively male culture in cities.
but not all sports were the province of men.
a number of sports were emerging in which women became important participants.
golf and tennis seldom attracted crowds in the late nineteenth century but both experienced a rapid increase in participation among relatively wealthy men and women.
bicycling and croquet also enjoyed widespread popularity in the 1890s among women as well as men.
womens colleges were beginning to introduce their students to strenuous sports as well track crew swimming and beginning in the late 1890s basketball challenging the once prevalent notion that vigorous exercise was dangerous to women.
music and theater many ethnic communities maintained their own theaters in which immigrants listened to the music of their homelands and heard comedians making light of their experiences in the new world.
italian theaters often drew on the traditions of italian opera to create sentimental musical events.
the yiddish theater built on the experiences of american ethnic theater jews and was the training ground for a remarkable group of musicians and playwrights who later went on to play a major role in mainstream english speaking theater.
urban theaters also introduced one of the most distinctively american entertainment forms the musical comedy which evolved gradually from the comic operettas of european theater.
george m cohan an irish vaudeville entertainer became the first great creator of musical comedies in the early twentieth century in the process of creating his many shows he wrote a series of patriotic songs yankee doodle dandy over there and youre a grand old flag that remained popular many decades later.
irving berlin a veteran of the yiddish theater wrote more than 1 000 songs for the musical theater during his long career including such popular favorites as alexanders ragtime band and god bless america vaudeville a form of theater adapted from french models was the most popular urban entertainment in the first decades of the twentieth century.
even saloons and small community theaters could afford to offer their customers vaudeville which consisted of a variety of acts musicians comedians magicians jugglers and others and was at least in the beginning inexpensive to produce.
as the economic potential of vaudeville grew some promoters most prominently florenz ziegfeld of new york staged much more elaborate spectacles.
vaudeville was also one of the few entertainment media open to black performers.
they brought to it elements of the minstrel shows they had earlier developed for black audiences in the late nineteenth century.
see patterns of popular culture pp.

bettmann corbis the age of the city 507 the movies the most important form of mass entertainment until the invention of radio and television was the movies.
thomas edison and others had created the technology of the motion picture in the 1880s.
not long after short films became available to individual viewers through peep shows in pool halls penny arcades and amusement parks.
soon larger projectors made it possible to project the images onto big screens which permitted substantial audiences to see films in theaters.
by 1900 americans were becoming attracted in large numbers to these early movies usually plotless films of trains or waterfalls or other spectacles designed mainly to show off the technology.
d w griffith car the birth of ried tbe motion picture into a new a nation era with his silent epics the birth of a nation 1915 intolerance 1916 and others which introduced serious plots and elaborate productions to filmmaking.
some of these films most notably the birth of a nation with its celebration of the ku klux kian and its demeaning portraits of african americans also contained notoriously racist messages an indication among other things that the audiences for these early films were overwhelmingly white.
nevertheless motion pictures were the first truly mass entertainment medium reaching all areas of the country and almost all groups in the population.
working class leisure leisure had a particular importance to working class men and women in part because it was a relatively new part of their lives and in part because it stood in such sharp contrast to the grueling environments in which many industrial workers labored.
more than most other groups in society workers spent their leisure time on the streets walking alone or in groups watching street entertainers meeting friends talking and joking.
for people with time but little money the life of the street was an appealing source of camaraderie and energy.
another important setting for the leisure time of working class men was the neighborhood saloon which became a place importance of where a worker could be sure of encoun the saloon tering a regular circle of friends.
saloons were often ethnically specific in part because they served particular neighborhoods dominated by particular national groups.
they also became political centers.
saloonkeepers were especially important figures in urban political machines largely because they had regular contact wkh so many men in a neighborhood.
when the anti saloon league and other temperance organizations attacked the saloon one of the reasons they cited was that eliminating saloons would weaken political machines.
opponents also noted correctly that saloons were sometimes places of crime a nickelodeon before the rise of the great movie palaces urban families flocked to nickelodeons small theaters that charged five cents for admission and showed many different films each day including serials dramas that drew audiences back into theaters day after day with new episodes of a running story.
the granger collection new york violence and prostitution an entryway into the dark underworld of urban life.
boxing was a particularly popular sport among working class men.
many workers could not afford to attend the great public boxing matches pairing such popular heroes as john l sullivan and gentleman jim corbett.
but there were less glittering boxing matches in small rings and even in saloons bare knuckled fights organized by ethnic clubs and other groups that gave men an opportunity to demonstrate their strength and courage something that the working world did not always provide them.
the fourth of july the fourth of july played a large role in the lives of many working class americans.
that was in part because in an age of six day and sometimes seven day workweeks and before regular vacations it was for many decades one of the few full days of leisure other than the sabbath during which activities were often restricted by law that many workers had.
fourth of july celebrations were one of the highlights of the year in many ethnic working class communities.
in worcester massachusetts for example the ancient order of hibernians an irish organization sponsored boisterous picnics for the irish working class of the city.
competing with them were irish temperance organizations which offered more sober and respectable entertainments to those relatively few workers who wished to avoid the heavy drinking at the hibernian affairs.
other ethnic groups organized their own fourth of july events picnics games parades making the day a celebration not just of the nations independence but of the cultures of importance of the fourth of july s 508 chapter 18 immigrant communities.
the city s affluent middle class in the meantime tended to stay away remaining indoors or organizing family picnics at resort areas outside the city.
mass communications urban industrial society created a vast market for new methods of transmitting news and information.
between 1870 and 1910 the circulation of daily newspapers increased nearly ninefold from under 3 million to more than 24 million a rate three times as great as the rate of population increase.
and while standards varied widely from one paper to another american journalism began to develop the beginnings of a professional identity.
salaries of reporters increased many newspapers began separating the reporting of news from the expression of opinion and newspapers themselves became important businesses.
one striking change was the emergence of national press services which made use of the telegraph to supply news and features to papers throughout the country and which contributed as a result to the standardization of the product.
by the turn of the century important newspaper chains had emerged as well.
the most powerful was william randolph hearst s which by 1914 controlled nine newspapers and two maga zines.
hearst and rival publisher joseph emergence of newspaper pulitzer helped popularize what became chains known as yellow journalism a deliber ately sensational often lurid style of reporting presented in bold graphics designed to reach a mass audience.
see patterns of popular culture pp.
another major change occurred in the nature of american magazines.
beginning in the 1880s new kinds of magazines appeared that were designed for a mass audience.
one of the pioneers was edward w bok who took over the ladies home journal in 1899 and by targeting a mass female audience built its circulation to over 700 000.
high culture in the age of the city in addition to the important changes in popular culture that accompanied the rise of cities and industry there were profound changes in the realm of high culture in the ideas and activities of intellectuals and elites.
even the notion of a distinction between highbrow and lowbrow culture was relatively new to the industrial era.
in the early nineteenth century many cultural activities attracted people of widely varying backgrounds and targeted people of all classes.
by the late nineteenth century however elites were developing a cultural and intellectual life quite separate from the popular amusements of the urban masses.
the literature of urban america some writers and artists the local color writers of the south example and mark twain in such novels as huckleberry finn and tom sumyerresponded to the new industrial civilization by evoking an older more natural world.
but others grappled directly with the modern order.
one of the strongest impulses in late nineteenth and early twentieth century american literature was the effort to social re create urban social reality.
this trend realism toward realism found an early voice in stephen crane who although best known for his novel of the civil war the red badge of courage 1895 was the author of an earlier powerful indictment of the plight of the working class.
crane created a sensation in 1893 when he published maggie a girl of the streets a grim picture of urban poverty and slum life.
theodore dreiser was even more influential in encouraging writers to abandon the genteel traditions of earlier times and turn to the social dislocations and injustices of the present.
he did so both in sister carrie and in other later novels including an american tragedy published in 1925.
many of dreiser s contemporaries followed him in chronicling the oppression of america s poor.
in 1901 frank norris published the octopus an account of a struggle between oppressed wheat farmers and powerful railroad interests in california.
the socialist writer upton sinclair published the jungle in 1906 a novel designed to reveal the depravity of capitalism.
it exposed abuses in the american meatpacking industry and while it did not inspire the kind of socialist response for which sinclair had hoped it did help produce legislative action to deal with the problem.
kate chopin a southern writer who explored the oppressive features of traditional marriage encountered widespread public abuse after publication of her shocking novel the awakening in 1899.
it described a young wife and mother who abandons her family in search of personal fulfillment.
it was formally banned in some communities.
william dean howells in the rise of silas lapham 1884 and other works described what he considered the shallowness and corruption in the search for wealth.
other critics of american society responded to the new civilization not by attacking it but by withdrawing from it.
the historian henry adams published a classic autobiography in 1906 the education of henry adams in which he portrayed himself as a man disillusioned with and unable to relate to his society even though he continued to live in it.
the novelist henry james lived the major part of his adult life in england and europe and produced a series of coldly realistic novels the american 1877 portrait of a lady 1881 the ambassadors 1903 and others that showed his ambivalence about the character of modern industrial civilization.
the growing popularity of literature helped spawn a remarkable network of clubs mostly formed and populated by women to bring readers together to talk about books.
reading clubs proliferated rapidly in cities and even small towns among african american as well as white women.
they made literature a social experience for hundreds of thousands of women and created a tradition that has continued into the twenty hrst century.
the age of the city 509 art in the age of the city american art through most of the nineteenth century had been overshadowed by the art of europe.
many american artists studied and even lived in europe.
but others broke from the old world traditions and experimented with new styles.
winslow homer was vigorously american in his paintings of new england maritime life and other native subjects.
james mcneil whistler was one of the first western artists to appreciate the beauty of japanese color prints and to introduce oriental concepts into american and european art.
by the first years of the new century some american artists were turning decisively away from the traditional academic ashcan style a style perhaps best exemplified in school america by the brilliant portraitist john singer sargent.
instead many younger painters were exploring the same grim aspects of modern life that were becoming the subject of american literature.
members of the so called ashcan school produced work startling in its naturalism and stark in its portrayal of the social realities of the era.
john sloan portrayed the dreariness of american urban slums george bellows caught the vigor and violence of his time in paintings and drawings of prize fights edward hopper explored the starkness and loneliness of the modern city.
the ashcan artists were also among the first americans to appreciate expressionism and abstraction and they showed their interest in new forms in 1913 when they helped stage the famous and controversial armory show in new york city which displayed works of the french postimpressionists and of some american moderns.
the work of these and other artists marked the beginning in america of an artistic movement known as modernism a movement that had counterparts in many other areas of cultural and intellectual life as well.
rejecting the heavy reliance on established forms that characterized the genteel tradition of the nineteenth century art world modernists rejected the grip of the past and embraced new subjects and new forms.
where the genteel tradition emphasized the dignified and elevated aspects of civilization and glorified the achievements of gifted elites modernism gloried in the ordinary even the coarse.
where the genteel tradition placed great importance on respect for the past and the maintenance of standards modernism looked to the future and gloried in the new.
eventually modernism developed strict orthodoxies of its own.
but in its early stages it seemed to promise an escape from rigid formal traditions and an unleashing of individual creativity.
the impact of darwinism the single most profound intellectual development in the late nineteenth century was the widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution associated most promi natural nently with the english naturalist charles selection darwin.
darwinism argued that the human species had evolved from earlier forms of life and most recently from simian creatures similar to apes through a process of natural selection it challenged the biblical story of the creation and almost every other tenet of traditional american religious faith.
history darwinism suggested was not the working out of a divine plan as most americans had always believed.
it was a random process dominated by the fiercest or luckiest competitors.
the theory of evolution met widespread resistance at first from educators theologians and even many scientists.
by the end of the century however the evolutionists had converted most members of the urban professional and educated classes.
even many middle class protestant religious leaders had accepted the doctrine making significant alterations in theology to accommodate it.
evolution had become enshrined in schools on the steps this painting is by george luks 1867 1933 an american artist who belonged to the so called ashcan school.
luks and others revolted against what they considered the sterile formalism of academic painting and chose instead to portray realistic scenes of ordinary life.
in 1913 they stirred the art world with a startling exhibition in new york known as the armory show.
in it they displayed not only their own work which was relatively conventional in technique even if sometimes daring in its choice of subjects but also the work of innovative european artists who were already beginning to explore wholly new artistic forms.
david david gallery superstock 510 chapter 18 and universities few serious scientists any longer questioned its basic validity.
unseen by most urban americans at the time however the rise of darwinism was contributing to a deep schism between the new cosmopolitan culture of the city which was receptive to new ideas such as evolution and a traditional provincial culture located mainly although not wholly in rural areas which remained wedded to fundamentalist religious beliefs and older values.
thus the late nineteenth century saw not only the rise of a liberal protestantism in tune with new scientific discoveries but also the beginning of an organized protestant fundamentalism rejecting evolution which would make its presence felt politically in the 1920s and again in the late twentieth century and beyond.
darwinism helped spawn other new intellectual currents.
there was the social darwinism of william graham sumner pragmatism anc others which industrialists used so enthusiastically to justify their favored position in american life.
but there were also more sophisticated philosophies among them a doctrine that became known as pragmatism which seemed peculiarly a product of america s changing material civilization.
william james a harvard psychologist and brother of the novelist henry james was the most prominent publicist of the new theory although earlier intellectuals such as charles s peirce and later ones such as john dewey were also important to its development and dissemination.
according to the pragmatists modern society should rely for guidance not on inherited ideals and moral principles but on the test of scientific inquiry.
no idea or institution not even religious faith was valid they claimed unless it worked and unless it stood the test of experience.
the ultimate test for us of what a truth means james wrote is the conduct it dictates or inspires a similar concern for scientific inquiry was intruding into the social sciences and challenging traditional orthodoxies.
economists such as richard t ely and simon patten argued for a more active and pragmatic use of scientific discipline.
sociologists such as edward a ross and lester frank ward urged applying the scientific method to the solution of social and political problems.
historians such as frederick jackson turner and charles beard argued that economic factors more than spiritual ideals had been the governing force in historical development.
john dewey proposed a new approach to education that placed less emphasis on the rote learning of traditional knowledge and more on a flexible democratic approach to schooling one that enabled students to acquire knowledge that would help them deal with the realities of their society.
the relativistic implications of darwinism also promoted growth of the growth of anthropology and encour anthropology aged some scholars to begin examining other cultures most significantly perhaps the culture of american indians in new ways.
a few white americans began to look at indian society as a coherent culture with its own norms and values that were worthy of respect and preservation even though different from those of white society.
but such ideas about native americans found very little support outside a few corners of the intellectual world until much later in the twentieth century.
dempsey and firpo the artist george bellows began painting fight scenes in the first years of the twentieth century when boxing appealed primarily to working class urban communities.
by 1924 when he painted this view of the dempsey firpo fight prizefighting had become one of the most popular sports in america.
whitney museum of american art new york usa bridgeman images toward universal schooling a society that was coming to depend increasingly on specialized skills and scientific knowledge was of course a society with a high demand for education.
the late nineteenth century therefore was a time of rapid expansion and reform of american schools and universities.
one example was the spread of free public primary and secondary education.
in 1860 there spread of were only 100 public public schools in the entire united education states.
by 1900 the number had reached 6 000 and by 1914 over 12 000.
by 1900 compulsory school attendance laws were in effect in thirty one states and territories.
but education was still far from universal.
rural areas lagged far behind urban industrial ones in funding public education.
and in the south many blacks had no access to schools.
educational reformers few of whom shared the relativistic views of anthropologists sought to pr vide educational opportunities for the indian tribes as well in an effort to civilize them and help the age of the city 511 william graham sumner william graham sumner was an influential scholar who was appointed the first professor of sociology at yale.
a dynamic writer and teacher he is best known for his promotion of social darwinism a now discredited theory that used the theory of evolution to explain differences among peoples.
the granger collection new york them adapt to white society.
in the 1870s reformers recruited small groups of indians to attend hampton institute a primarily black college.
in 1879 richard henry pratt a former army officer organized the carlisle indian industrial school in pennsylvania.
carlisle emphasized the kind of practical industrial education that booker t washington had urged at his school at tuskegee.
equally important it isolated indians from their tribes and tried to force them to assimilate to white norms.
the purpose pratt said was to kill the indian and save the man carlisle inspired other similar schools in the west.
ultimately the reform efforts failed both because of indian resistance and because of inadequate funding incompetent administration and poor teaching.
colleges and universities were also proliferating rapidly in the ute nineteenth century.
they benefited particularly from the morrill land grant act of the civil war era by which the federal land grant government had donated land to states for institutions the establishment of colleges.
after 1865 states in the south and west took particular advantage of the law.
in all sixty nine land grant institutions were established in the last decades of the century among them the state university systems of california illinois minnesota and wisconsin.
other universities benefited from millions of dollars contributed by business and financial tycoons.
rockefeller carnegie and others gave generously to such schools as the university of chicago columbia harvard northwestern princeton syracuse and yale.
other philanthropists founded new universities or reorganized and renamed older ones to perpetuate their family names vanderbilt johns hopkins cornell duke tulane and stanford.
education for women the post civil war era saw too an important expansion i of educational opportunities for women although such opportunities continued to lag far behind those available to men and were almost always denied to black women.
most public high schools accepted women readily but opportunities for higher education were few.
at the end of the civil war only three american colleges were coeducational.
in the years after the war some of the land grant col womens le es universities in the midwest and colleges such private universities as cornell and wesleyan began to admit women along with men.
but coeducation provided fewer opportunities than the creation of a network of women s colleges.
mount holyoke which had begun its life in 1836 as a seminary for women became a full fledged college in the 1880s.
at about the same time new female institutions were emerging vassar wellesley smith bryn mawr wells and goucher.
a few of the larger private universities created separate colleges for women on their campuses barnard at columbia and radcliffe at harvard for example.
proponents of women s colleges saw the institutions as places where female students would not be treated as second class citizens by predominantly male student bodies and faculties.
the female college was part of an important phenomenon in the history of modern american women the emergence of a distinctive women s community.
most faculty members and many administrators were women often unmarried.
and the life of the college produced a spirit of sorority and commitment among educated women that had important effects in later years as women became the leaders of many reform activities.
most female college graduates eventually married but many married at a later age than their non college educated counterparts and in some cases continued to pursue careers after marriage and motherhood.
a significant minority perhaps over 25 percent did not marry but devoted themselves exclusively to careers.
a leader at bryn mawr remarked our failures marry that was surely rhetorical excess.
the growth of female higher education clearly became for some women a liberating experience persuading them that they had roles to perform in society in addition to those of wives and mothers.
512 chapter 18 looking back the extraordinary growth of american cities in the last decades of the nineteenth century led to both great achievements and enormous problems.
cities became centers of learning art and commerce.
they produced great advances in technology transportation architecture and communications.
they provided their residents and their many visitors with varied and dazzling experiences so much so that many rural people left the countryside to move to the city and many more dreamed of doing so.
but cities were also places of congestion filth disease and corruption.
with populations expanding too rapidly for services to keep up most american cities in this era struggled with makeshift governments and makeshift techniques to solve the basic problems of providing water disposing of sewage building roads providing public transportation fighting fire stopping crime and preventing or curing disease.
city governments many of them dominated by political machines and ruled by party bosses were often models of inefficiency and corruption although in their informal way they also provided substantial services to the working class and immigrant constituencies who needed them most.
they also managed despite the administrative limitations of most municipal governments to oversee great public projects the building of parks museums opera houses and theaters usually in partnership with private developers.
the city brought together races ethnic groups and classes of extraordinary variety from the families of great wealth that the new industrial age was creating to the vast working class much of it consisting of immigrants that crowded into densely packed neighborhoods sharply divided by ethnicity.
the city also produced new forms of popular culture.
it produced new opportunities and risks for women.
it created temples of consumerism shops boutiques and above all the great department stores.
and it created forums for public recreation and entertainment parks theaters athletic fields amusement parks and later movie palaces.
urban life created such great anxiety among those who lived within the cities and among those who observed them from afar that in some cities middle class people armed themselves to prepare for the insurrections they expected from the poor.
but in fact american cities adapted reasonably successfully over time to the great demands their growth made of them and learned to govern themselves if not entirely honestly and efficiently at least adequately to allow them to survive and grow.

looking ahead 1.
what were the major social and economic problems that beset the united states in the late nineteenth century and how did the two major political parties respond to these problems.
what was populism what were its goals and to what degree were these goals achieved.
how did the united states become an imperial power.
setting the stage the united states approached the end of the nineteenth century as a fundamentally different nation from what it had been at the beginning of the civil war with rapid change came cascading social and political problems problems that the weak and conservative governments of the time showed little inclination or ability to address.
a catastrophic depression began in 1893 rapidly intensified and created devastating hardship for millions of americans.
farmers particularly hard hit by the depression responded by creating an agrarian political movement known as populism.
american workers facing massive unemployment staged large and occasionally violent strikes.
not since the civil war had american politics been so polarized and impassioned.
the presidential election of 1896 pitted the agrarian hero william jennings bryan against the solid conservative william mckinley.
supported by the mighty republican party and many eastern groups that looked with suspicion and unease at the agricultural demands coming from the west mckinley won an easy victory.
although mckinley did little in his first term in office to resolve the problems and grievances of the time the economy revived nevertheless.
having largely ignored the depression however mckinley took a great interest in another great national cause the plight of cuba in its war with spain.
in the spring of 1898 the united states declared war on spain and entered the conflict in cuba a brief but bloody war that ended with an american victory four months later.
the conflict had begun as a way to support cuban independence from the spanish.
but a group of fervent and influential imperialists worked to convert the war into an occasion for acquiring overseas possessions.
despite a powerful anti imperialist movement the acquisition of the former spanish colonies proceeded only to draw americans into yet another imperial war this one in the philippines where the americans not the spanish were the targets of local enmity.
the politics of equilibrium electoral stability the most striking feature of late nineteenth century politics was the remarkable stability of the party system.
from the end of reconstruction until the late 1890s the electorate was divided almost precisely evenly between the republicans and the democrats.
sixteen states were solidly and consistently republican and fourteen states most in the south were solidly and consistently democratic.
only five states most importantly new york and ohio were usually in doubt and their voters generally decided the results of national elections.
the republican party captured the presidency in all but two of the elections of the era but in the five presidential elections beginning in 1876 the average popular vote margin separating the democratic and republican candidates was 1 5 percent.
the congressional balance was similarly stable with the republicans generally controlling the senate and the democrats generally controlling the house.
as striking as the balance between the parties was the intensity of public loyalty to them.
in most of the country americans viewed their party affiliations with a passion and enthusiasm that is difficult for later generations to understand.
voter turnout in presidential elections between 1860 and 1900 averaged over 78 percent of all eligible voters as compared with only about 50 percent in most recent elections.
even in nonpresidential years from 60 to 80 percent of the voters turned out to cast ballots for con gressional and local candidates.
large groups of potential voters were disenfranchised in these years women in most states almost all blacks and many poor whites in the south.
but for adult white males there were few franchise restrictions.
what explains this extraordinary loyalty to the two political parties.
it was not certainly that the parties took distinct positions on important public issues.
they did so rarely.
party loyalties reflected other factors.
region was perhaps the most important.
to white southerners loyalty to the democratic party was a matter of unquestioned faith.
it was the vehicle by which they had triumphed over reconstruction and preserved white supremacy.
to many northerners white high turnout.
