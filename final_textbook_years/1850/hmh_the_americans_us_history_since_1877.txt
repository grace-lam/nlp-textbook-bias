one american s story in 1893 queen liliuokalani b le a o ka la ne realized that her reign in hawaii had come to an end.
more than 160 u s sailors and marines stood ready to aid the haoles white foreigners who planned to overthrow the hawaiian monarchy.
in an eloquent statement of protest the proud monarch surrendered to the superior force of the united states.
a personal voice queen liliuokalani 661 liliuokalani do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the constitutional government of the hawaiian kingdom.
now to avoid any collision of armed forces and perhaps the loss of life i do under this protest.
yield my authority until such time as the government of the united states shall undo the action of its representatives and reinstate me in the authority which i claim as the constitutional sovereign of the hawaiian islands.
quoted in those kings and queens of old hawaii u s ambassador to hawaii john l stevens informed the state department the hawaiian pear is now fully ripe and this is the golden hour for the united states to pluck it.
the annexation of hawaii was only one of the goals of america s empire builders in the late 19th century.
hawaiis queen lsi announced that if restored to power she would behead those who had conspired to depose her.
american expansionism americans had always sought to expand the size of their nation and throughout the 19th century they extended their control toward the pacific ocean.
however by the 1880s many american leaders had become convinced that the united states should join the imperialist powers of europe and establish colonies overseas.
imperialism the policy in which stronger nations extend their economic political or military control over weaker territories was already a trend around the world.
142 chapter 10 main idea analyzing effects how did european imperialism affect africa.
background in the late 1800s new farm machinery greatly improved grain production.
for example plows harrows threshing machines and reapers increased corn production by 264 percent and the wheat harvest by 252 percent.
player in the early 1900s the navys great white fleet so named because its ships were painted white was a sign of americas growing military power.
global competition european nations had been establishing colonies for centuries.
in the late 19th century africa had emerged as a prime target of european expansionism.
by the early 20th century only two countries in all of africa ethiopia and liberia remained independent.
imperialists also competed for territory in asia especially in china.
in its late 19th century reform era japan replaced its old feudal order with a strong central government.
hoping that military strength would bolster industrialization japan joined european nations in competition for china in the 1890s.
most americans gradually warmed to the idea of expansion overseas.
with a belief in manifest destiny they already had pushed the u s border to the pacific ocean.
three factors fueled the new american imperialism desire for military strength thirst for new markets belief in cultural superiority desire for military strength seeing that other nations were establishing a global military presence american leaders advised that the united states build up its own military strength.
one such leader was admiral alfred t mahan of the u s navy.
mahan urged government officials to build up american naval power in order to compete with other powerful nations.
as a result of the urging of mahan and others the united states built nine steel hulled cruisers between 1883 and 1890.
the construction of modern battleships such as the maine and the oregon transformed the country into the world s third largest naval power.
thirst for new markets in the late 19th century advances in technology enabled american farms and factories to produce far more than american citizens could consume.
now the united states needed raw materials for its factories and new markets for its agricultural and manufactured goods.
imperialists viewed foreign trade as the solution to american overproduction and the related problems of unemployment and economic depression.
admiral alfred t mahan 1840 1914 belief in cultural superiority cultural factors also were used to justify imperialism.
some americans combined the philosophy of social darwinism a belief that free market competition would lead to the survival of the fittest wit a belief in the racial superiority of anglo saxons.
some people therefore considered it a social responsibility to civilize the inhabitants of less developed countries and spread the benefits of western society.
in addition protestant christian missionaries felt they had a moral duty to convert others to their beliefs.
the united states acquires alaska an early supporter of american expansion was william seward secretary of state under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson.
in 1867 seward arranged for the u s to buy alaska from the russians for 7 2 million.
seward had some trouble persuading the house of representatives to approve funding for the purchase.
some people thought it was silly to buy what they called seward s icebox or seward s folly.
time showed how wrong they were.
in 1959 alaska became a state.
for about two cents an acre the united states had acquired a land rich in timber minerals and as it turned out oil.

what were the most dramatic changes in hawaiian population between 1853 and 1920.
how might these changes have affected the political climate there.
in 1867 the same year in which alaska was purchased the united states took over the midway islands which lie in the pacific ocean about 1300 miles north of hawaii.
no one lived on the islands so the event did not attract much attention.
hawaii was another question.
the hawaiian islands had been economically important to the united states for nearly a century.
since the 1790s american merchants had stopped there on their way to china and east india.
in the 1820s yankee missionaries founded christian schools and churches on the islands.
their children and grandchildren became sugar planters who sold most of their crop to the united states.
the cry for annexation in the mid 19th century american owned sugar plantations accounted for about three quarters of the islands wealth.
plantation owners imported thousands of laborers from japan portugal and china.
by 1900 foreigners and immigrant laborers outnumbered native hawaiians about three to one.
white planters profited from close ties with the united states.
in 1875 the united states agreed to import hawaiian sugar duty free.
over the next 15 years hawaiian sugar production increased nine times.
then the mckinley tariff of 1890 provoked a crisis by eliminating the duty free status of hawaiian sugar.
as a result hawaiian sugar growers faced competition in the american market.
american planters in hawaii called for the united states to annex the islands so they wouldn t have to pay the duty.
u s military and economic leaders already understood the value of the islands.
in 1887 they pressured hawaii to allow the united states to build a naval base at pearl harbor the kingdom s best port.
the base became a refueling station for american ships.

the end of a monarchy also in that year hawaii s king kalakaua had been strong armed by white business leaders.
they forced him to amend hawaii s constitution effectively limiting voting rights to only wealthy land owners.
but when kalakaua died in 1891 his sister queen liliuokalani came to power with a hawaii for hawaiians agenda.
she proposed removing the property owning qualifications for voting.
to prevent this from happening business groups encouraged by ambassador john l stevens organized a revolution.
with the help of marines they overthrew the queen and set up a government headed by sanford b dole.
president cleveland directed that the queen be restored to her throne.
when dole refused to surrender power cleveland formally recognized the republic of hawaii.
but he refused to consider annexation unless a majority of hawaiians favored it.
in 1897 william mckinley who favored annexation succeeded cleveland as president.
on august 12 1898 congress proclaimed hawaii an american territory although hawaiians had never had the chance to vote.
in 1959 hawaii became the 50th state of the united states.

its new overseas territories gave it more bases for trade and for resupplying its navy.
within a year it would capitalize on its new economic and military strength to acquire the pacific island of samoa.
expansionists expressed delight over the country s growing power but the quest for empire troubled many americans.
debate over the treaty the treaty of paris touched off a great debate in the united states.
some people who favored annexation believed that the united states had a duty to spread its values overseas.
president mckinley told a group of methodist ministers that he had prayed for guidance on philippine annexation and had concluded that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all the philippine islands and to educate the filipinos and uplift and christianize them.
in fact most filipinos had been christian for centuries.
strengthening the position of the united states as a world power was a key issue in the debate.
many americans wanted the philippines for their economic and strategic value.
located on the route to china the philippines would be useful as a place to refuel and resupply ships.
as a result many expansionists wanted to annex the philippines before they fell into the hands of germany japan or another nation.
other prominent americans presented a variety of arguments political moral and economic against annexation.
some felt that the treaty violated the declaration of independence by denying self government to the newly acquired territories.
the african american educator booker t washington argued that the united states should settle race related issues at home before taking on social problems elsewhere.
the labor leader samuel gompers feared that filipino immigrants would compete for american jobs.
on february 6 1899 the annexation question was settled with the senate s approval of the treaty of paris.

when puerto rico became part of the united states after the spanish american war many puerto ricans feared that the united states would not give them the measure of self rule that they had gained under the spanish.
puerto rican statesman and publisher luis munoz rivera was one of the most vocal advocates of puerto rican self rule.
between 1900 and 1916 he lived primarily in the united states and continually worked for the independence of his homeland.
finally in 1916 the u s congress facing possible war in europe and wishing to settle the issue of puerto rico invited mufioz rivera to speak.
on may 5 1916 munoz rivera stood before the u s house of representatives to discuss the future of puerto rico.
a personal voice luis munoz rivera a you citizens of a free fatherland with its own laws its own institutions and its lu own flag can appreciate the unhappiness of the small and solitary people that must await its laws from your authority.
when you acquire the certainty that you can found in puerto rico a republic like that founded in cuba and panama.
give us our independence and you will stand before humanity as a great creator of new nationalities and a great liberator of oppressed peoples.
quoted in the puerto ricans munoz rivera returned to puerto rico where he died in november 1916.
three months later the united states made puerto ricans u s citizens.
ruling puerto rico not all puerto ricans wanted independence as munoz rivera did.
some wanted statehood while still others hoped for some measure of local self government as an american territory.
as a result the united states gave puerto ricans no prom ises regarding independence after the spanish american war.
puerto rico ever since their transfer under the treaty of paris from spain to the united states puerto ricans have debated their status as shown above.
in 1967 1993 and 1998 puerto ricans rejected both statehood and independence in favor of commonwealth a status given the island in 1952.
as members of a commonwealth puerto ricans are u s citizens.
they can move freely between the island and the mainland and are subjected to the military draft but cannot vote in u s presidential elections.
a majority of puerto ricans have rejected statehood because they fear it would mean giving up their latino culture.
main idea analyzing issues why was puerto rico important to the united states.
background yellow fever damages many body parts especially the liver.
dr carlos finlay discovered that the disease is carried by mosquitoes.
clearing out the mosquitos breeding places helped eliminate the disease in cuba.
military rule during the spanish american war united states forces under general nelson a.
miles occupied the island.
as his soldiers took control general miles issued a statement assuring puerto ricans that the americans were there to bring you protection not only to yourselves but to your property to promote your prosperity and to bestow upon you the immunities and blessings of the liberal institutions of our government.
for the time being puerto rico would be controlled by the military until congress decided otherwise.
return to civil government although many puerto ricans had dreams of independence or statehood the united states had different plans for the island s future.
puerto rico was strategically important to the united states both for maintaining a u s presence in the caribbean and for protecting a future canal that american leaders wanted to build across the isthmus of panama.
in 1900 congress passed the foraker act which ended military rule and set up a civil government.
the act gave the president of the united states the power to appoint puerto rico s governor and members of the upper house of its legislature.
puerto ricans could elect only the members of the legislature s lower house.
in 1901 in the insular cases the u s supreme court ruled that the constitution did not automatically apply to people in acquired territories.
congress however retained the right to extend u s citizenship and it granted that right to puerto ricans in 1917.
it also gave them the right to elect both houses of their legislature.
cuba and the united states when the united states declared war against spain in 1898 it recognized cuba s independence from spain.
it also passed the teller amendment which stated that the united states had no intention of taking over any part of cuba.
the treaty of paris which ended the war further guaranteed cuba the independence that its nationalist leaders had been demanding for years.
american soldiers though officially independent cuba was occupied by american troops when the war ended.
jose martf the cuban patriot who had led the movement for independence from spain had feared that the united states would merely replace spain and dominate cuban politics.
in some ways marti s prediction came true.
under american occupation the same officials who had served spain remained in office.
cubans who protested this policy were imprisoned or exiled.
on the other hand the american military government provided food and clothing for thousands of families helped farmers put land back into cultivation and organized elementary schools.
through improvement of sanitation and medical research the military government helped eliminate yellow fever a disease that had killed hundreds of cubans each year.
america claims an empire 353 platt amendment in 1900 the newly formed cuban government wrote a constitution for an independent cuba.
the constitution however did not specify the relationship between cuba and the united states.
consequently in 1901 the united states insisted that cuba add to its constitution several provisions known as the platt amendment stating that cuba could not make treaties that might limit its independence or permit a foreign power to control any part of its territory the united states reserved the right to intervene in cuba cuba was not to go into debt that its government could not repay the united states could buy or lease land on the island for naval stations and refueling stations the united states made it clear that its army would not withdraw until cuba adopted the platt amendment.
in response a torchlight procession marched on the residence of governor general leonard wood in protest.
some protestors even called for a return to arms to defend their national honor against this american insult.
the u s government stood firm though and cubans reluctantly ratified the new constitution.
in 1903 the platt amendment became part of a treaty between the two nations and it remained in effect for 31 years.
under the terms of the treaty cuba became a u s protectorate a country whose affairs are partially controlled by a stronger power.
protecting american business interests the most important reason for the united states to maintain a strong political presence in cuba was to protect american businesses that had invested in the island s sugar tobacco and mining industries as well as in its railroads and public utilities.

philippine american war in february 1899 the filipinos led by aguinaldo rose in revolt.
the united states assumed almost the same role that spain had played imposing its authority on a colony that was fighting for freedom.
when aguinaldo turned to guerrilla tactics the united states forced filipinos to live in designated zones where poor sanitation starvation and disease killed thousands.
this was the very same practice that americans had condemned spain for using in cuba.
during the occupation white american soldiers looked on the filipinos as inferiors.
however many of the 70 000 u s troops sent to the philippines were african americans.
when african american newspapers questioned why blacks were helping to spread racial prejudice to the philippines some african american soldiers deserted to the filipino side and developed bonds of friendship with the filipinos.
it took the americans nearly three years to put down the rebellion.

foreign influence in china u s imperialists saw the philippines as a gateway to the rest of asia particularly to china.
china was seen as a vast potential market for american products.
it also presented american investors with new opportunities for large scale railroad construction.
weakened by war and foreign intervention china had become known as the sick man of asia.
france germany britain japan and russia had established prosperous settlements along the coast of china.
they also had carved out spheres of influence areas where each nation claimed special rights and economic privileges.
john hays open door notes the united states began to fear that china would be carved into colonies and american traders would be shut out.
to protect american interests u s secretary of state john hay issued in 1899 a series of policy statements called the open door notes.
the notes were letters addressed to the leaders of imperialist nations proposing that the nations share their trading rights with the united states thus creating an open door.
this meant that no single nation would have a monopoly on trade with any part of china.
the other imperialist powers reluctantly accepted this policy.

the boxers surrounded the european section of beijing and kept it under siege for several months.
the boxer rebellion in china although china kept its freedom europeans dominated most of china s large cities.
resentment simmered beneath the surface as some chinese formed secret societies pledged to rid the country of foreign devils.
the most famous of these secret groups were the boxers so named by westerners because members practiced martial arts.
the boxers killed hundreds of missionaries and other foreigners as well as chinese converts to christianity.
in august 1900 troops from britain france germany and japan joined about 2 500 american soldiers and marched on the chinese capital.
within two months the international forces put down the boxer rebellion.
thousands of chinese people died during the fighting.
protecting american rights after the boxer rebellion the united states feared that european nations would use their victory to take even greater control of china.
to prevent this john hay issued a second series of open door notes announcing that the united states would safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the chinese empire.
this policy paved the way for greater american influence in asia.
the open door policy reflected three deeply held american beliefs about the united states industrial capitalist economy.
first americans believed that the growth of the u s economy depended on exports.
second they felt the united states had a right to intervene abroad to keep foreign markets open.
third they feared that the closing of an area to american products citizens or ideas threatened u s survival.
these beliefs became the bedrock of american foreign policy.

america claims an empire 357 the impact of u s territorial gains in 1900 republican william mckinley a reluctant but confirmed imperialist was elected to a second term against democrat william jennings bryan who staunchly opposed imperialism.
mckinley s reelection confirmed that a majority of americans favored his policies.
under mckinley the united states had gained an empire that boosted its economy and marked its debut on the world stage.
yet even before mckinley was reelected an anti imperialist league had sprung into being.
the league included some of the most prominent people in america such as former president grover cleveland industrial leader andrew carnegie the social worker jane addams and many leading writers.
anti imperialists had different and sometimes conflicting reasons for their opposition but all agreed that it was wrong for the united states to rule other people without their consent.
the novelist mark twain questioned the motives for imperialism in a satirical piece written in 1901.
a personal voice mark twain shall we go on conferring our civilization upon the peoples that sit in darkness or shall we give those poor things a rest.
extending the blessings of civilization to our brother who sits in darkness has been a good trade and has paid well on the whole and there is money in it yet.

his great enthusiasm for physical activity boxing tennis swimming horseback riding and hunting provided cartoonists with additional material.
some cartoons portrayed roosevelt with the toy teddy bear that he inspired.
roosevelt had six children who became notorious for their rowdy antics.
their father once sent a message through the war department ordering them to call off their attack on the white house.
roosevelt thrived on the challenges of the presidency.
he wrote i do not believe that anyone else has ever enjoyed the white house as much as i have roosevelt the peacemaker in 1904 russia and japan russia s neighbor in east asia were both imperialist powers and they were competing for contro of korea.
the japanese took the first action in what would become the russo japanese war with a sudden attack on the russian pacific fleet.
to everyone s surprise japan destroyed it.
japan then proceeded to destroy a second fleet sent as reinforcement.
japan also won a series of land battles securing korea and manchuria.
as a result of these battles japan began to run out of men and money a fact that it did not want to reveal to russia.
instead japanese officials approached president roosevelt in secret and asked him to mediate peace negotiations.
roosevelt agreed and in 1905 russian and japanese delegates convened in portsmouth new hampshire.
the first meeting took place on the presidential yacht.
roosevelt had a charming way of greeting people with a grasp of the hand a broad grin and a hearty dee lighted.
soon the opposing delegates began to relax and cordially shook hands.
the japanese wanted sakhalin island off the coast of siberia and a large sum of money from russia.
russia refused.
roosevelt persuaded japan to accept half the island and forgo the cash payment.
in exchange russia agreed to let japan take over russian interests in manchuria and korea.
the successful efforts in negotiating the treaty of portsmouth won roosevelt the 1906 nobel peace prize.
as u s and japanese interests expanded in east asia the two nations continued diplomatic talks.
in later agreements they pledged to respect each other s possessions and interests in east asia and the pacific.
panama canal by the time roosevelt became president many americans including roosevelt felt that the united states needed a canal cutting across central america.
such a canal would greatly reduce travel time for commercial and military ships by providing a shortcut between the atlantic and pacific oceans.
as early as 1850 the united states and britain had agreed to share the rights to such a canal.
in the hay pauncefote treaty of 1901 however britain gave the united states exclusive rights to build and control a canal through central america.
engineers identified two possible routes for the proposed canal.
one through nicaragua posed fewer obstacles because much of it crossed a large lake.
the other route crossed through panama then a province of colombia and was shorter and filled with mountains and swamps.
site selection was influenced as much by human geographic factors as physical.
in the late 1800s a french company had tried to build a canal in panama.
after ten years the company gave up.
it sent an agent philippe bunau varilla to washington to convince the united states to buy its claim.
in 1903 the president and congress decided to use the panama route and agreed to buy the french company s route for 40 million.
7 before beginning work on the panama canal the united states had to get permission from colombia which then ruled panama.
when these negotiations broke down bunau varilla helped organize a panamanian rebellion against colombra.

states signed a treaty in which the united states agreed to pay panama 10 million plus an annual rent of 250 000 for an area of land across panama called the canal zone.
the payments were to begin in 1913.
constructing the canal due to the challenging physical geography its builders faced construction of the panama canal ranks as one of the world s greatest engineering feats.
builders fought diseases such as yellow fever and malaria and soft volcanic soil that proved difficult to remove.
work clearing brush and draining swamps began in 1904.
by 1913 the height of construction more than 43 400 workers were employed.
some had come from italy and spain three quarters were blacks from the british west indies.
more than 5 600 workers died from accidents or disease.
the total cost to the united states was about 380 million.

theodore roosevelt the roosevelt corollary financial factors drew the united states further into latin american affairs.
in the late 19th century many latin american nations had borrowed huge sums from european banks to build railroads and develop industries.
roosevelt feared that if these nations defaulted on their loans europeans might intervene.
he was determined to make the united states the predominant power in the caribbean and central america.
roosevelt reminded european powers of the monroe doctrine which had been issued in 1823 by president james monroe.
the monroe doctrine demanded that european countries stay out of the affairs of latin american nations.
roosevelt based his latin america policy on a west african proverb that said speak softly and carry a big stick.
in his december 1904 message to congress roosevelt added the roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine.
he warned that disorder in latin vocabulary america might force the united states to the exer actional cise of an international police power in effect the statement that corollary said that the united states would now use follows logically force to protect its economic interests in latin america.
from the f rst dollar diplomacy during the next decade the united states exercised its police power on several occasions.
for example when a 1911 rebellion in nicaragua left the nation near bankruptcy president william h taft roosevelt s successor arranged for american bankers to loan nicaragua enough money to pay its debts.
in return the bankers were given the right to recover their money by collecting nicaragua s customs duties.
the u s bankers also gained control of nicaragua s state owned railroad system and its national bank.
when nicaraguan citizens heard about this deal they revolted against president adolfo diaz.
to prop up 162 chapter 10 diaz s government some 2 000 marines were sent to nicaragua.
the revolt was put down but some marine detachments remained in the country until 1933.
the taft administration followed the policy of using the u s government to guarantee loans made to foreign countries by american businesspeople.
this policy was called dollar diplomacy by its critics and was often used to justify keeping european powers out of the caribbean.
woodrow wilsons missionary diplomacy the monroe doctrine issued by president james monroe in 1823 had warned other nations against expanding their influence in latin america.
the roosevelt corollary asserted in 1904 that the united states had a right to exercise international police power in the western hemisphere.
in 1913 president woodrow wilson gave the monroe doctrine a moral tone.
according to wilson s missionary diplomacy the united states had a moral responsibility to deny recognition to any latin american government it viewed as oppressive undemocratic or hostile to u s interests.
prior to this policy the united states recognized any government that controlled a nation regardless of that nation s policies or how it had come to power.
wilson s policy pressured nations in the western hemisphere to establish democratic governments.
almost immediately the mexican revolution put wilson s policy to the test.
main idea analyzing motives why did president wilson refuse to recognize huertas government.
the mexican revolution mexico had been ruled for more than three decades by a military dictator porfirio diaz.
a friend of the united states diaz had long encouraged foreign investments in his country.
as a result foreigners mostly americans owned a large share of mexican oil wells mines railroads and ranches.
while foreign investors and some mexican landowners and politicians had grown rich the common people of the country were desperately poor.
in 1911 mexican peasants and workers led by francisco madero overthrew diaz.
madero promised democratic reforms but he proved unable to satisfy the conflicting demands of landowners peasants factory workers and the urban middle class.
after two years general victoriano huerta took over the government.
within days madero was murdered.
wilson refused to recognize the government that huerta formed.
he called it a government of butchers.

intervention in mexico wilson adopted a plan of watchful waiting looking for an opportunity to act against huerta.
the opportunity came in april 1914 when one of huerta s officers arrested a small group of american sailors in tampico on mexico s eastern shore.
the mexicans quickly released them and apologized but wilson used the incident as an excuse to intervene in mexico and ordered u s marines to occupy veracruz an important mexican port.
eighteen americans and at least 200 mexicans died during the invasion.
the incident brought the united states and mexico close to war.
argentina brazil and chile stepped in to mediate the conflict.
they proposed that huerta step down and that u s troops withdraw without paying mexico for damages.
mexico rejected the plan and wilson refused to recognize a government that had come to power as a result of violence.
the huerta regime soon collapsed however and venustiano carranza a nationalist leader became president in 1915.
wilson withdrew the troops and formally recognized the carranza government.

in january 1916 carranza invited american engineers to operate mines in northern mexico.
before they reached the mines however villa s men took the americans off a train and shot them.
two months later some of villa s followers raided columbus new mexico and killed 17 americans.
americans held villa responsible.
i chasing villa with the american public demanding revenge president wilson ordered brigadier general john j pershing and an expeditionary force of about 15 000 soldiers into mexico to capture villa dead or alive.
for almost a year villa eluded pershing s forces.
wilson then called out 150 000 national guardsmen and stationed them along the mexican border.
in the meantime 164 chapter 10 mexicans grew angrier over the u s invasion of their land.
in june 1916 u s troops clashed with carranza s army resulting in deaths on both sides.
carranza demanded the withdrawal of u s troops but wilson refused.
war seemed imminent.
however in the end both sides backed down.
the united states facing war in europe needed peace on its southern border.
in february 1917 wilson ordered pershing to return home.
later that year mexico adopted a constitution that gave the government control of the nation s oil and mineral resources and placed strict regulations on foreign investors.
although carranza had called for the constitution of 1917 he failed to carry out its measures.
instead he ruled oppressively until 1920 when a moderate named alvaro obregon came to power.
obregon s presidency marked the end of civil war and the beginning of reform.
u s intervention in mexican affairs provided a clear model of american imperialist attitudes in the early years of the 20th century.
americans believed in the superiority of free enterprise democracy and the american government attempted to extend the reach of this economic and political system even through armed intervention.
the united states pursued and achieved several foreign policy goals in the early 20th century.
first it expanded its access to foreign markets in order to ensure the continued growth of the domestic economy.
second the united states built a modern navy to protect its interests abroad.

a glance at a world map during that time revealed the trade advantages of cutting through the world s great landmasses at two strategic points.
the first cut through the isthmus of suez in egypt was completed in 1869 and was a spectacular success.
a second cut this one through panama in central america would be especially advantageous to the united states.
such a cut or canal would substantially reduce the sailing time between the nation s atlantic and pacific ports.

the following passage describes views of american expansionism in regards to the annexation of hawaii.
it is mainly a secondary source but it quotes eyewitness accounts that are primary sources.
views on american expansionism during the late 1800s hawaii was swept up in american expansionism on one side native f hawaiians were shocked by the manipulation and eventual overthrow of their monarchy.
on the other side leaders in the united states wanted more control of the economic benefits and strategic location of hawaii.
by 1893 cries of annexation led to differing attitudes about the situation.
after queen liliuokalani was overthrown her niece princess kaiulani made a plea to president cleveland in 1893 to restore the hawaiian monarchy.
in her plea she wrote i seventy years ago christian america sent over christian men and women to give religion and civilization to hawaii today i a poor weak girl with not one of my people near me and all these j hawaiian statesmen against me have strength to stand up for the rights of my people.
even now i can hear the wail in my heart and it gives me strength and courage the strength that the seventy j millions of people who are in this free land will hear my cry and will refuse to let their flag cover.
dishonor to mine.
j at the time john l stevens was u s minister to hawaii.
in his brief a plea for annexation within an article called the hawaiian situation stevens described the hawaiian monarchy as extinct and argued that it was imperative that the united states annex hawaii.
he explained his reasoning a paramount reason why annexation should not be long postponed is that if it soon takes place the crown and government lands will be cut up and sold to american and christian caucasian people thus preventing the islands from being submerged and overrun by asiatics putting an end to japanese ambitions stimulated by our strong european rival.
president cleveland tried in vain to restore the monarchy unable to secure annexation at the time but managed to keep only five years later hawaii was named a u s territory.
business leaders were control of the hawaiian government.

there was a breathless hush as jeannette rankin of montana the first woman elected to congress stood up.
rankin declared i want to stand by my country but i cannot vote for war.
later she reflected on her action.
a personal voice jeannette rankin i believe that the first vote i cast was the most significant vote and a most significant act on the part of women because women are going to have to stop war.
i felt at the time that the first woman in congress should take the first stand that the first time the first woman had a chance to say no to war she should say it quoted in jeannette rankin first lady in congress after much debate as to whether the united states should join the fight congress voted in favor of u s entry into world war i.

as an industrial and imperial power the united states felt many of the same pressures that had led the nations of europe into devastating warfare.
historians generally cite four long term causes of the first world war nationalism imperialism militarism and the formation of a system of alliances.
hapter 11 main idea analyzing causes how did nationalism and imperialism lead to conflict in europe.
vocabulary alliance a formal agreement or union between nations nationalism throughout the 19th century politics in the western world were deeply influenced by the concept of nationalism a devotion to the interests and culture of one s nation.
often nationalism led to competitive and antagonistic rivalries among nations.
in this atmosphere of competition many feared germany s growing power in europe.
in addition various ethnic groups resented domination by others and longed for their nations to become independent.
many ethnic groups looked to larger nations for protection.
russia regarded itself as the protector of europe s slavic peoples no matter which government they lived under.
among these slavic peoples were the serbs.
serbia located in the balkans was an independent nation but millions of ethnic serbs lived under the rule of austria hungary.
as a result russia and austria hungary were rivals for influence over serbia.
imperialism for many centuries european nations had been building empires slowly extending their economic and political control over various peoples of the world.
colonies supplied the european imperial powers with raw materials and provided markets for manufactured goods.
as germany industrialized it competed with france and britain in the contest for colonies.
militarism empires were expensive to build and to defend.
the growth of nationalism and imperialism led to increased military spending.
because each nation wanted stronger armed forces than those of any potential enemy the imperial powers followed a policy of militarism the development of armed forces and their use as a tool of diplomacy.
by 1890 the strongest nation on the european continent was germany which had set up an army reserve system that drafted and trained young men.
britain was not initially alarmed by germany s military expansion.
as an island nation britain had always relied on its navy for defense and protection of its shipping routes and the british navy was the strongest in the world.
however in 1897 wilhelm ii germany s kaiser or emperor decided that his nation should also become a major sea power in order to compete more successfully against the british.
soon british and german shipyards competed to build the largest battleships and destroyers.
france italy japan and the united states quickly joined the naval arms race.
alliance system by 1907 there were two major defense alliances in europe.
the triple entente later known as the allies consisted of france britain and russia.
the triple alliance consisted of germany austria hungary and italy.
german emperor wilhelm ii center marches with two of his generals hindenburg left and ludendorff during world war i.
373 germany and austria hungary together with the ottoman empire an empire o mostly middle eastern lands controlled by the turks were later known as e central powers.
the alliances provided a measure of international security because nations were reluctant to disturb the balance of power.
as it turned out a spark set off a major conflict.
an assassination leads to war that spark flared in the balkan peninsula which was known as the powder keg of europe in addition to the ethnic rivalries among the balkan peoples europe s leading powers had interests there.
russia wanted access to the mediterranean sea.
germany wanted a rail link to the ottoman empire.
austria hungary which had taken control of bosnia in 1878 accused serbia of subverting its rule over bosnia.
the powder keg was ready to explode.
in june 1914 archduke franz ferdinand heir to the austrian throne visited the bosnian capital sarajevo.
as the royal entourage drove through the city serbian nationalist gavrilo princip stepped from the crowd and shot the archduke and his wife sophie.
princip was a member of the black hand an organization promoting serbian nationalism.
the assassinations touched off a diplomatic crisis.
on july 28 austria hungary declared what was expected to be a short war against serbia.
the alliance system pulled one nation after another into the conflict.
on august 1 germany obligated by treaty to support austria hungary declared war on russia.
on august 3 germany declared war on russia s ally france.
after germany invaded belgium britain declared war on germany and austria hungary.
the great war had begun.
crisis in the balkans after world war i bosnia became part of a country that eventually became known as yugoslavia.
although yugoslavia included various religious and ethnic groups the government was dominated by serbs.
in 1991 yugoslavia broke apart and bosnia declared independence in 1992.
however serbs wanted bosnia to remain part of serbian controlled yugoslavia.
a bloody civil war broke out.
this war became notorious for the mass murder and deportation of bosnian muslims a process known as ethnic cleansing in 1995 the united states helped negotiate a cease fire.
but peace in the balkans did not last.
in the late 1990s albanians in the province of kosovo also tried to break away from serbia.
serbias violent response which included the ethnic cleansing of albanians prompted nato to intervene.
kosovo declared its independence in 2008 despite serbias opposition.
main idea analyzing effects why were so many european nations pulled into the conflict.
the fighting starts on august 3 1914 germany invaded belgium following a strategy known as the schlieffen plan.
this plan called for a holding action against russia combined with a quick drive through belgium to paris after france had fallen the two german armies would defeat russia.
as german troops swept across belgium thousands of civilians fled in terror.
in brussels the belgian capital an american war correspondent described the first major refugee crisis of the 20th century.
a personal voice richard harding davis we found the side streets blocked with their carts.
into these they had thrown mattresses or bundles of grain and heaped upon them were families of three generations.

with half a chance it might have lived but it had none.
that dark bedroom killed it how the other half lives making a living in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was not easy.
natural and economic disasters had hit farmers hard in europe and in the united states and the promise of industrial jobs drew millions of people to american cities.
the urban population exploded from 10 million to 54 million between 1870 and 1920.
this growth revitalized the cities but also created serious problems that as riis observed had a powerful impact on the new urban poor.
as many as 12 people slept in rooms such as this one in new york city photographed by jacob riis around 1889.
urban opportunities the technological boom in the 19 th century contributed to the growingfndus trial strength of the united states.
the result was rapid urbanization or growth of cities mostly in the regions of the northeast and midwest.
chapter 7 main idea analyzing motives why did native born americans start the americanization movement.
immigrants settle in cities most of the immigrants who streamed into the united states in the late 19th century became city dwellers because cities were the cheapest and most convenient places to live.
cities also offered unskilled laborers steady jobs in mills and factories.
by 1890 there were twice as many irish residents in new york city as in dublin ireland.
by 1910 immigrant families made up more than half the total population of 18 major american cities.
the americanization movement was designed to assimilate people of wide ranging cultures into the dominant culture.
this social campaign was sponsored by the government and by concerned citizens.
schools and voluntary associations provided programs to teach immigrants skills needed for citizenship such as english literacy and american history and government.
subjects such as cooking and social etiquette were included in the curriculum to help the newcomers learn the ways of native born americans.
despite these efforts many immigrants did not wish to abandon their traditions.
ethnic communities provided the social support of other immigrants from the same country.
this enabled them to speak their own language and practice their customs and religion.
however these neighborhoods soon became overcrowded a problem that was intensified by the arrival of new transplants from america s rural areas.
migration from country to city rapid improvements in farming technology during the second half of the 19th century were good news for some farmers but bad news for others.
inventions such as the mccormick reaper and the steel plow made farming more efficient but meant that fewer laborers were needed to work the land.
as more and more farms merged many rural people moved to cities to find whatever work they could.
many of the southern farmers who lost their livelihoods were african americans.
between 1890 and 1910 about 200 000 african americans moved north and west to cities such as chicago and detroit in an effort to escape racial violence economic hardship and political oppression.
many found conditions only somewhat better than those they had left behind.
segregation and discrimination were often the reality in northern cities.
job competition between blacks and white immigrants caused further racial tension.
immigrants and urbanization 263 i i i urban problems as the urban population skyrocketed city governments faced the problems of how to provide residents with needed services and safe living conditions.
housing when the industrial age began working class families in cities had two housing options.
they could either buy a house on the outskirts of town where they would face transportation problems or rent cramped rooms in a boardinghouse in the central city.
as the urban population increased however new types of housing were designed.
for example row houses single family dwellings that shared side walls with other similar houses packed many singlefamily residences onto a single block.
after working class families left the central city immigrants often took over their old housing sometimes with two or three families occupying a one family residence.
as jacob riis pointed out these multifamily urban dwellings called tenements were overcrowded and unsanitary.
in 1879 to improve such slum conditions new york city passed a law that set minimum standards for plumbing and ventilation in apartments.
landlords began building tenements with air shafts that provided an outside window for each room.
since garbage was picked up infrequently people sometimes dumped it into the air shafts where it attracted vermin.
to keep out the stench residents nailed windows shut.
though established with good intent these new tenements soon became even worse places to live than the converted single family residences.
sanitation problems in big cities were overwhelming.
it was not unusual to see a dead horse in the street.
transportation innovations in mass transit transportation systems designed to move large numbers of people along fixed routes enabled workers to go to and from jobs more easily.
street cars were introduced in san francisco in 1873 and electric subways in boston in 1897.
by the early 20th century mass transit networks in many urban areas linked city neighborhoods to one another and to outlying communities.
cities struggled to repair old transit systems and to build new ones to meet the demand of expanding populations.
water cities also faced the problem of supplying safe drinking water.
as the urban population grew in the 1840s and 1850s cities such as new york and cleveland built public waterworks to handle the increasing demand.
as late as the 1860s however the residents of many cities had grossly inadequate piped water or none at all.
even in large cities like new york homes seldom had indoor plumbing and residents had to collect water in pails from faucets on the street and heat it for bathing.
the necessity of improving water quality to control diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever was obvious.
to make city water safer filtration was introduced in the 1870s and chlorination in 1908.
however in the early 20th century many city dwellers still had no access to safe water.
sanitation as the cities grew so did the challenge of keeping them clean.
horse manure piled up on the streets sewage flowed through open gutters and factories spewed foul smoke into the air.
without dependable trash collection people dumped their garbage on the streets.
although private contractors called scavengers were hired to sweep the streets collect garbage and clean outhouses they main idea j identifying problems what housing problems did urban working class families face.
vocabulary chlorination a method of purifying water by mixing it with the chemical chlorine 264 chapter 7 main idea analyzing effects how did conditions in cities affect peoples health.
often did not do the jobs properly.
by 1900 many cities had developed sewer lines and created sanitation departments.
however the task of providing hygienic living conditions was an ongoing challenge for urban leaders.
crime as the populations of cities increased pickpockets and thieves flourished.
although new york city organized the first full time salaried police force in 1844 it and most other city law enforcement units were too small to have much impact on crime.
fire the limited water supply in many cities contributed to another menace the spread of fires.
major fires occurred in almost every large american city during the 1870s and 1880s.
in addition to lacking water with which to combat blazes most cities were packed with wooden dwellings which were like kindling waiting to be ignited.
the use of candles and kerosene heaters also posed a fire hazard.
in san francisco deadly fires often broke out during earthquakes.
jack london described the fires that raged after the san francisco earthquake of 1906.
a personal voice jack london on wednesday morning at a quarter past five came the earthquake.
a minute later the flames were leaping upward.

all the shrewd contrivances and safeguards of man had been thrown out of gear by thirty seconds twitching of the earth crust the story of an eye witness at first most city firefighters were volunteers and not always available when they were needed.
cincinnati ohio tackled this problem when it established the nation s first paid fire department in 1853.
by 1900 most cities had full time professional fire departments.
the introduction of a practical automatic fire sprinkler in 1874 and the replacement of wood as a building material with brick stone or concrete also made cities safer.

immigrants and urbanization 265 i reformers mobilize.
as problems in cities mounted concerned americans worked to find solutions.
social welfare reformers targeted their efforts at relieving urban poverty.
the settlement house in the late 1800s with poverty a desperate problem some american reformers turned to great britain for inspiration.
in 1884 london reformers had founded toynbee hall the first of the settlement houses.
these were community centers in slum neighborhoods that provided assistance to local residents especially immigrants.
in addition to providing aid settlement houses taught immigrants many useful skills.
they provided social activities such as clubs and sports.
they also sent visiting nurses into the homes of the sick.
most settlement house workers were middle class college educated women who lived among the people they served.
the movement gave women new opportunities to lead organize and improve life for others.
settlement houses soon began appearing in u s cities.
one of the first was hull house in chicago founded by jane addams and ellen gates starr in 1889.
addams became one of the most influential members of the settlement house movement.
hull house was located in the middle of an urban neighborhood peopled by italian irish german greek bohemian and russian and polish jewish immigrants.
through english classes and job training programs offered at hull house addams worked to provide economic opportunities for the ethnic and religious minorities who inhabited the neighborhood.
settlement houses also sought political solutions by lobbying state and local government to resolve social and economic problems.
by 1910 about 400 settlement houses were operating in cities across the country.
the settlement houses helped cultivate social responsibility toward the urban poor.
many workers in the movement held strong religious views.
they believed in the social gospel the idea that religious faith should be expressed through good works.
they believed that churches had a moral duty to help solve society s problems and preached salvation through service to the poor.
their views contrasted with social darwinists who saw existence as a competitive struggle and argued that people were poor because of their own deficiencies.
they criticized the social gospel movement because they did not believe their reforms could help.

the emergence of political machines the late 19th century cities experienced rapid growth under inefficient government.
in a climate influenced by dog eat dog social darwinism cities were receptive to a new power structure the political machine and a new politician the city boss.
immigrants and urbanization 267 the political machine an organized group that controlled the activities of a political party in a city the political machine also offered services to voters and businesses in exchange for political or financial support n t e eca es after the civil war political machines gained control of local government in baltimore new york san francisco and other major cities.
the machine was organized like a pyramid.
at the pyramid s base were local precinct workers and captains who tried to gain voters support on a city block or in a neighborhood and who reported to a ward boss.
at election time the ward boss worked to secure the vote in all the precincts in the ward or electoral district.
ward bosses helped the poor and gained their votes by doing favors or providing services.
as martin lomasney elected ward boss of boston s west end in 1885 explained there s got to be in every ward somebody that any bloke can come to.
and get help.
help you understand none of your law and your justice but help.
at the top of the pyramid was the city boss who controlled the activities of the political party throughout the city.
precinct captains ward bosses and the city boss worked together to elect their candidates and guarantee the success of the machine.
main idea summarizing in what way did the structure of the political machine resemble a pyramid.
the role of the political boss whether or not the boss officially served as mayor he controlled access to municipal jobs and business licenses and influenced the courts and other municipal agencies.
bosses like roscoe conkling in new york used their power to build parks sewer systems and waterworks and gave money to schools hospitals and orphanages.
bosses could also provide government support for new businesses a service for which they were often paid extremely well.
it was not only money that motivated city bosses.
by solving urban problems bosses could reinforce voters loyalty win additional political support and extend their influence.
immigrants and the machine many precinct captains and political bosses were first generation or second generation immigrants.
few were educated beyond grammar school.
they entered politics early and worked their way up from the bottom.
they could speak to immigrants in their own language and understood the challenges that newcomers faced.
more important the bosses were able to provide solutions.
the machines helped immigrants with naturalization attaining full citizenship hous ing and jobs the newcomers most pressing needs.
in return the immigrants provided what the political bosses needed votes.

68 chapter 7 municipal graft and scandal while the well oiled political machines provided city dwellers with services many political bosses fell victim to corruption as their influence grew.
election fraud and graft when the loyalty of voters was not enough to carry an election some political machines turned to fraud.
using fake names party faithfuls cast as many votes as were needed to win.
once a political machine got its candidates into office it could take advantage of numerous opportunities for graft the illegal use of political influence for personal gain.
for example by helping a person find work on a construction project for the city a political machine could ask the worker to bill the city for more than the actual cost of materials and labor.
the worker then kicked back a portion of the earnings to the machine.
taking these kickbacks or illegal payments for their services enriched the political machines and individual politicians.
political machines also granted favors to businesses in return for cash and accepted bribes to allow illegal activities such as gambling to flourish.
politicians were able to get away with shady dealings because the police rarely interfered.
until about 1890 police forces were hired and fired by political bosses.
vocabulary extortion illegal use of ones official position to obtain property or funds the tweed ring scandal william m tweed known as boss tweed became head of tammany hall new york city s powerful democratic political machine in 1868.
between 1869 and 1871 boss tweed led the tweed ring a group of corrupt politicians in defrauding the city.
one scheme the construction of the new york county courthouse involved extravagant graft.
the project cost taxpayers 13 million while the actual construction cost was 3 million.
the difference went into the pockets of tweed and his followers.
thomas nast a political cartoonist helped arouse public outrage against tammany hall s graft and the tweed ring was finally broken in 1871.
tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and extortion and sentenced to 12 years in jail.
his sentence was reduced to one year but after leaving jail tweed was quickly arrested on another charge.
while serving a second sentence tweed escaped.
he was captured in spain when officials identified him from a thomas nast cartoon.

70 chapter 7 civil service replaces patronage the desire for power and money that made local politics corrupt in the industrial age also infected national politics.
patronage spurs reform since the beginning of the 19th century presidents had complained about the problem of patronage or the giving of government jobs to people who had helped a candidate get elected.
in andrew jackson s administration this policy was known as the spoils system.
people from cabinet members to workers who scrubbed the steps of the capitol owed their jobs to political connections.
as might be expected some government employees were not qualified for the positions they filled.
moreover political appointees whether qualified or not sometimes used their positions for personal gain.
reformers began to press for the elimination of patronage and the adoption of a merit system of hiring.
jobs in civil service government administration should go to the most qualified persons reformers believed.
it should not matter what political views they held or who recommended them.
reform under hayes garfield and arthur civil service reform made gradual progress under presidents hayes garfield and arthur.
republican president rutherford b hayes elected in 1876 could not convince congress to support reform so he used other means.
hayes named independents to his cabinet.
he also set up a commission to investigate the nation s customhouses which were notorious centers of patronage.
on the basis of the commission s report hayes fired two of the top officials of new york city s customhouse where jobs were controlled by the republican party.
these firings enraged the republican new york senator and political boss roscoe conkling and his supporters the stalwarts.
when hayes decided not to run for reelection in 1880 a free for all broke out at the republican convention between the stalwarts who opposed changes in the spoils system and reformers.
since neither stalwarts nor reformers could win a majority of delegates the convention settled on an independent presidential candidate ohio congressman james a garfield.
to balance out garfield s ties to reformers the republicans nominated for vice president chester a arthur one of conkling s supporters.
despite arthur s inclusion on the ticket garfield angered the stalwarts by giving reformers most of his patronage jobs once he was elected.
on july 2 1881 as president garfield walked through the washington d c train station he was shot two times by a mentally unbalanced lawyer named charles guiteau whom garfield had turned down for a job.
the would be assassin announced i did it and i will go to jail for it.

garfield finally died from his wounds on september 19.
despite his ties to the stalwarts chester arthur turned reformer when he became president.
his first message to congress urged legislators to pass a civil service law.
the resulting pendleton civil service act of 1883 authorized a bipartisan civil service commission to make main idea analyzing causes how did patronage contribute to government incompetence and fraud.
appointments to federal jobs through a merit system based on candidates performance on an examination.
by 1901 more than 40 percent of all federal jobs had been classified as civil service positions but the pendleton act had mixed consequences.
on the one hand public administration became more honest and efficient.
on the other hand because officials could no longer pressure employees for campaign contributions politicians turned to other sources for donations.
main idea analyzing effects what were the positive and the negative effects of the pendleton civil service act.
business buys influence with employees no longer a source of campaign contributions politicians turned to wealthy business owners.
therefore the alliance between government and big business became stronger than ever.
harrison cleveland and high tariffs big business hoped the government would preserve or even raise the tariffs that protected domestic industries from foreign competition.
the democratic party however opposed high tariffs because they increased prices.
in 1884 the democratic party won a presidential election for the first time in 28 years with candidate grover cleveland.
as president cleveland tried to lower tariff rates but congress refused to support him.
in 1888 cleveland ran for reelection on a low tariff platform against the former indiana senator benjamin harrison the grandson of president william henry harrison.
harrison s campaign was financed by large contributions from companies that wanted tariffs even higher than they were.
although cleveland won about 100 000 more popular votes than harrison harrison took a majority of the electoral votes and the presidency.
he signed the mckinley tariff act of 1890 which raised tariffs on manufactured goods to their highest level yet.
in 1892 cleveland was elected again the only president to serve two non consecutive terms.
he supported a bill for lowering the mckinley tariff but refused to sign it because it also provided for a federal income tax.
the wilson gorman tariff became law in 1894 without the president s signature.
in 1897 william mckinley was inaugurated president and raised tariffs once again.
the attempt to reduce the tariff had failed but the spirit of reform was not dead.
new developments in areas ranging from technology to mass culture would help redefine american society as the united states moved into the 20th century.

10 chapter 6 i i vocabulary entrepreneur a person who organizes operates and assumes the risk for a business venture black gold oil became a key commodity in the late 1800s valued as a fuel source and an industrial lubricant.
though native americans had made fuel and medicine from crude oil early settlers had little use for it.
then in the 1840s americans began using kerosene to light lamps after the canadian geologist abraham gesner discovered how to distill the fuel from oil or coal.
it wasn t until 1859 however when edwin l drake successfully used a steam engine to drill for oil near titusville pennsylvania that removing oil from beneath the earth s surface became practical.
this breakthrough started an oil boom that spread to kentucky ohio illinois indiana and eventually texas.
petroleum refining industries arose in cleveland and pittsburgh as entrepreneurs rushed to transform the oil into kerosene.
gasoline a byproduct of the refining process originally was thrown away.
but after the automobile became popular gasoline became the most important form of oil.
bessemer steel process oil was not the only natural resource that was plentiful in the united states.
there were also abundant deposits of coal and iron.
in 1887 prospectors discovered iron ore deposits more than 100 miles long and up to 3 miles wide in the mesabi range of minnesota.
at the same time coal production skyrocketed from 33 million tons in 1870 to more than 250 million tons in 1900.
iron is a dense metal but it is soft and tends to break and rust.
it also usually contains other elements such as carbon.
removing the carbon from iron produces a lighter more flexible and rust resistant metal steel.
the raw materials needed to make steel were readily available all that was needed was a cheap and efficient manufacturing process.
the bessemer process developed independently by the british manufacturer henry bessemer and american ironmaker william kelly around 1850 soon became widely used.
this technique involved injecting air into molten iron to remove the carbon and other impurities.
by 1880 american manufacturers were using the new method to produce more than 90 percent of the nation s steel.

it was eventually replaced by the open hearth process enabling manufacturers to produce quality steel from scrap metal as well as from raw materials.
new uses for steel the railroads with thousands of miles of track became the biggest customers for steel but inventors soon found additional uses for it.
joseph r hhhpn c harhpti wire and mccormick s and deere s farm main idea summarizing what natural resources were most important for industrialization.
historical spotlight illuminating the light bulb shortly after moving into a long wooden shed at menlo park thomas alva edison and his associates set to work to develop the perfect incandescent bulb.
arc lamps already lit some city streets and shops using an electric current passing between two sticks of carbon but they were glaring and inefficient.
edison hoped to create a long lasting lamp with a soft glow and began searching for a filament that would burn slowly and stay lit.
edison tried wires sticks blades of grass and even hairs from his assistants beards.
finally a piece of carbonized bamboo from japan did the trick.
edison s company used bamboo filaments until 1911 when it began using tungsten filaments which are still used today.
machines helped transform the plains into the food pro ducer of the nation.
steel changed the face of the nation as well as it made innovative construction possible.
one of the most remarkable structures was the brooklyn bridge.
completed in 1883 it spanned 1 595 feet of the east river in new york city.
its steel cables were supported by towers higher than any man made and weight bearing structure except the pyramids of egypt.
like those ancient marvels the completed bridge was called a wonder of the world.
around this time setting the stage for a new era of expansion upward as well as outward william le baron jenney designed the first skyscraper with a steel frame the home insurance building in chicago.
before jenney had his pioneering idea the weight of large buildings was supported entirely by their walls or by iron frames which limited the buildings height.
with a steel frame to support the weight however architects could build as high as they wanted.
as structures soared into the air not even the sky seemed to limit what americans could achieve.
inventions promote change by capitalizing on natural resources and their own ingenuity inventors changed more than the landscape.
their inventions affected the very way people lived and worked.
the power of electricity in 1876 thomas alva edison became a pioneer on the new industrial frontier when he established the world s first research laboratory in menlo park new jersey.
there edison perfected the incandescent light bulb patented in 1880 and later invented an entire system for producing and distributing electrical power.
another inventor george westinghouse along with edison added innovations that made electricity safer and less expensive.
the harnessing of electricity completely changed the nature of business in america.
by 1890 electric power ran numerous machines from fans to printing presses.
this inexpensive convenient source of energy soon became available in homes and spurred the invention of time saving appliances.
electric streetcars made urban travel cheap and efficient and also promoted the outward spread of cities more important electricity allowed manufacturers to locate their plants vocabulary incandescent giving off visible light as a result of being heated chapter 6 main idea analyzing effects how did electricity change american life.
wherever they wanted not just near sources of power such as rivers.
this enabled industry to grow as never before.
huge operations such as the armour and swift meatpacking plants and the efficient processes that they used became the models for new consumer industries.
jey inventions change lifestyles edison s light bulb was only one of several revolutionary inventions.
christopher sholes invented the typewriter in 1867 and changed the world of work.
next to the light bulb however perhaps the most dramatic invention was the telephone unveiled by alexander graham bell and thomas watson in 1876.
it opened the way for a worldwide communications network.
the typewriter and the telephone particularly affected office work and created new jobs for women.
although women made up less than 5 percent of all office workers in 1870 by 1910 they accounted for nearly 40 percent of the clerical work force.
new inventions also had a tremendous impact on factory work as well as on jobs that traditionally had been done at home.
for example women had previously sewn clothing by hand for their families.
with industrialization clothing could be mass produced in factories creating a need for garment workers many of whom were women.
industrialization freed some factory workers from backbreaking labor and helped improve workers standard of living.
by 1890 the average workweek had been reduced by about ten hours.
however many laborers felt that the mechanization of so many tasks reduced human workers worth.
as consumers though workers regained some of their lost power in the marketplace.
the country s expanding urban population provided a vast potential market for the new inventions and products of the late 1800s.
the typewriter shown here dates from around 1890.

in many instances a team or organization is only as good as its leader.
by influencing people to work toward common goals effective leaders are able to accomplish important tasks and effect change in the world.
there is no list of characteristics that a good leader must possess.
in fact good leadership can depend on the situation different leaders might behave in different ways depending on their position their goals their personalities and those of their followers.
however there are some qualities that can help an individual be an effective leader.
a desire to lead perhaps the most important quality is the desire to lead.
in order to lead effectively an individual must be committed to his or her cause and feel confident enough to advance that cause.
billy graham shown at left is a good example of an individual with a desire to lead.
he believes his purpose in life is to help people find a personal relationship with god.
since beginning his ministry in 1950 graham has worked tirelessly to accomplish that mission and share his faith with others.
he has written 31 books and conducted events in 185 countries.
he has even served as a spiritual adviser to presidents including dwight d eisenhower and richard nixon.
part of what enabled graham to reach so many people with his message was that he was committed to his cause.
judgment and decisiveness another important characteristic is the ability to act decisively and with good judgment.
in the face of complex issues with many factors a strong leader needs to determine an appropriate course of action to pursue.
by demonstrating these leadership qualities sonia sotomayor earned a place as a u s supreme court justice.
she is the only current member of the court with experience as a trial judge.
in that position she was required to hand down decisions on a variety of complex legal and constitutional issues and she earned a reputation as an able judge as a result of her thoughtful opinions.
she continues to employ her skills of judgment and decisiveness from the supreme court bench.
i i i i1 f i ll i 1 4 chapter 6 u strong social skills an effective leader must be able to work well with others.
a leader must be able to listen to the opinions of others and to use tact and diplomacy when interacting with team members to ensure achievement of common goals.
good leaders are able to use their strong social skills to communicate about their mission and to inspire others to follow them.
one of the best examples of a leader who used language to inspire a movement is martin luther king jr a baptist minister from atlanta king delivered his most famous speech known as the i have a dream speech at the march on washington on august 28 1963 in front of a crowd of more than 200 000 people.
in his speech king drew from patriotic and religious texts of the past to review african americans long struggle for freedom.
his rhetoric drew in his listeners and reached beyond them to communicate a moral basis for the civil rights movement to a vast national audience.
the speech inspired african americans to continue to work for change within their communities.
through this speech and his other writings king became a powerful voice of the african american civil rights movement.
his leadership helped the movement make significant progress toward achieving its goal of equality.
perseverance even the best leaders will face challenges.
when challenges arise the most important thing is how a leader deals with them.
perseverance involves persistence in the face of obstacles.
it requires tenacity and commitment to a belief or purpose.
great leaders do not give up in the face of difficulty instead they find a way to keep going.
andrew carnegies path to financial success required perseverance.
born in scotland to parents who hit tough economic times carnegie immigrated to the united states with his family at the age of 12.
he began working in a factory but through talent and persistence he advanced quickly to other more rewarding jobs.
carnegie began invest ing his earnings in the iron oil railroad and telegraph industries.
he was soon able to use the money from his investments to found his own company the carnegie steel company.
he used the business experience that he had gained to build his company up until it dominated the steel industry in the united states.
carnegies success can be attributed in part to his perseverance as he worked hard to overcome the challenges of his humble beginnings.
making generalizations what are some qualities of effective leadership.
what other qualities do you think might also be helpful for leaders to possess.
researching a leader choose one of the leaders discussed in this textbook.
do research to identify the qualities that made this leader effective.
did he or she excel in some areas but not in others.
write an essay explaining what your selected leader accomplished and which qualities helped him or her do so.

one american s in october 1884 the economist richard ely visited the town of pullman illinois to write about it for harper s magazine.
at first ely was impressed with the atmosphere of order planning and well being in the town george m pullman had designed for the employees of his railroad car factory.
but after talking at length with a dissatisfied company officer ely concluded the town had a fatal flaw it too greatly restricted its residents.
pullman employees were compelled to obey rules in which they had no say.
ely concluded that the idea of pullman is un american.
a personal voice richard t ely it is benevolent well wishing feudalism a medieval social system which desires the happiness of the people but in such way as shall please the authorities.
if free american institutions are to be preserved we want no race of men reared as underlings a social study the town of pullman was carefully laid out and strictly controlled.
136 chapter 6 as the railroads grew they came to influence many facets of american life including as in the town of pullman the personal lives of the country s citizens.
they caused the standard time and time zones to be set and influenced the growth of towns and communities.
however the unchecked power of railroad companies led to widespread abuses that spurred citizens to demand federal regulation of the industry.
railroads span time and space rails made local transit reliable and westward expansion possible for business as well as for people.
realizing how important railroads were for settling the west and developing the country the government made huge land grants and loans to the railroad companies.
main idea analyzing effects a what were the effects of railroad expansion.
a national network by 1856 the railroads extended west to the mississippi river and three years later they crossed the missouri.
just over a decade later crowds across the united states cheered as the central pacific and union pacific railroads met at promontory utah on may 10 1869.
a golden spike marked the spanning of the nation by the first transcontinental railroad.
other transcontinental lines followed and regional lines multiplied as well.
at the start of the civil war the nation had had about 30 000 miles of track.
by 1890 that figure was nearly six times greater.
romance and reality the railroads brought the dreams of available land adventure and a fresh start within the grasp of many americans.
this romance was made possible however only by the harsh lives of railroad workers.
the central pacific railroad employed thousands of chinese immigrants.
the union pacific hired irish immigrants and desperate out of work civil war veterans to lay track across treacherous terrain while enduring attacks by native americans.
accidents and diseases disabled and killed thousands of men each year.
in 1888 when the first railroad statistics were published the casualties totaled more than 2 000 employees killed and 20 000 injured.
railroad time in spite of these difficult working conditions the railroad laborers helped to transform the diverse regions of the country into a united nation.
though linked in space each community still operated on its own time with noon when the sun was directly overhead.
noon in boston for example was almost 12 minutes later than noon in new york.
travelers riding from maine to california might reset their watches 20 times.
in 1869 to remedy this problem professor c f dowd proposed that the earth s surface be divided into 24 time zones one for each hour of the day.
under his plan the united states would contain four zones the eastern central mountain and pacific time zones.
the railroad companies endorsed dowd s plan enthusiastically and many towns followed suit.
finally on november 18 1883 railroad crews and towns across the country synchronized their watches.
in 1884 an international conference set worldwide time zones that incorporated railroad time.
the u s congress however didn t officially adopt railroad time as the standard for the nation until 1918.
as strong a unifying force as the railroads were however they also opened the way for abuses that led to social and economic unrest.
spotlight historical chinese immigrants and the railroads although the railroads paid all their employees poorly asians usually earned less than whites.
the average pay for whites working a ten hour day was 40 to 60 a month plus free meals.
chinese immigrants hired by the central pacific performed similar tasks from dawn to dusk for about 35 a month and they had to supply their own food.
the immigrants working conditions were miserable.
in 1866 for example the railroad hired them to dig a tunnel through a granite mountain.
for five months of that year the chinese lived and worked in camps surrounded by banks of snow.
the total snowfall reached over 40 feet.
hundreds of the men were buried in avalanches or later found frozen still clutching their shovels or picks.
opportunities and opportunists the growth of the railroads influenced the industries and businesses in which americans worked.
iron coal steel lumber and glass industries grew rapidly as they tried to keep pace with the railroads demand for materials and parts.
the rapid spread of railroad lines also fostered the growth of towns helped establish new markets and offered rich opportunities for both visionaries and profiteers.
a new industrial age 237 on the wrong track while the railroads captured the imagination of most 19th century americans there were those who didnt get on the bandwagon.

who wants to travel so fast.
my grandfather did not and he was no fool new towns and markets by linking previously isolated cities towns and settlements the railroads promoted trade and interdependence.
as part of a nationwide network of suppliers and markets individual towns began to specialize in particular products.
chicago soon became known for its stockyards and minneapolis for its grain industries.
these cities prospered by selling large quantities of their products to the entire country.
new towns and communities also grew up along the railroad lines.
cities as diverse as abilene kansas flagstaff arizona denver colorado and seattle washington owed their prosperity if not their very existence to the railroads.
pullman the railroads helped cities not only grow up but branch out.
in 1880 for example george m pullman built a factory for manufacturing sleepers and other railroad cars on the illinois prairie.
the nearby town that pullman built for his employees followed in part the models of earlier industrial experiments in europe.
whereas new england textile manufacturers had traditionally provided housing for their workers the town of pullman provided for almost all of workers basic needs.
pullman residents lived in clean well constructed brick houses and apartment buildings with at least one window in every room a luxury for city dwellers.
in addition the town offered services and facilities such as doctors offices shops and an athletic field.
as richard ely observed however the town of pullman remained firmly under company control.
residents were not allowed to loiter on their front steps or to drink alcohol.
pullman hoped that his tightly controlled environment would ensure a stable work force.
however pullman s refusal to lower rents after cutting his employees pay led to a violent strike in 1894 credit mobilier pullman created his company town out of the desire for control and profit.
in some other railroad magnates or powerful and influential industrialists these desires turned into self serving corruption.
in one of the most infamous schemes stockholders in the union pacific railroad formed in 1864 a construction company called credit mobilier kred tt mo beuyer.
the stockholders gave this company a contract to lay track at two to three times the actual cost and pocketed the profits.
they donated shares of stock to about 20 representatives in congress in 1867.
a congressional investigation of the company spurred by reports in the new york sun eventually found that the officers of the union pacific had taken up to 23 million in stocks bonds and cash.
testimony implicated such well known and respected federal officials as vice president schuyler colfax and congressman james garfield who later became president.
although these public figures kept their profits and received little more than a slap on the wrist the reputation of the republican party was tarnished.
the grange and the railroads farmers were especially disturbed by what they viewed as railroad corruption.
the grangers members of the grange a farmers organization founded in 1867 began demanding governmental control over the railroad industry.

j main idea analyzing issues jgj how did the grangers who were largely poor farmers do battle with the giant railroad companies.
railroad abuses farmers were angry with railroad companies.
they were upset by misuse of government land grants which the railroads sold to other businesses rather than to settlers.
the railroads also entered into formal agreements to fix prices which helped keep farmers in their debt.
in addition they charged different customers different rates often demanding more for short than for long hauls.
granger laws in response to these abuses by the railroads the grangers took political action.
they sponsored state and local political candidates elected legislators and successfully pressed for laws to protect their interests.
in 1871 illinois authorized a commission to establish maximum freight and passenger rates and prohibit discrimination.
grangers throughout the west midwest and southeast convinced state legislators to pass similar laws called granger laws.
the railroads fought back challenging the constitutionality of the regulatory laws.
in 1877 however in the case of munn v illinois the supreme court upheld the granger laws by a vote of seven to two.
the states thus won the right to regulate the railroads for the benefit of farmers and consumers.
the grangers also helped establish an important principle the federal government s right to regulate private industry to serve the public interest.
d interstate commerce act the grangers triumph was short lived however.
in 1886 the supreme court ruled that a state could not regulate railroad traffic moving across state boundaries.
in response to public outrage congress passed the interstate commerce act in 1887.
its objective was to make railroad rates fair for all customers by requiring rates to be fair and reasonable.
to oversee the railroads the act established a five member interstate commerce commission icc.
unfortunately congress did not give the icc the power to enforce the provisions of the law.
due to poorly defined language in the act and resistance from the railroads the icc had difficulty regulating rates.
several court cases challenged the act costing government resources as most went in favor of the railroads.

do you think the artist means the comparison as a compliment or a criticism.
the reins held by the railroad magnates attach not only to the trains but also to the tracks and the railroad station.
what does this convey about the magnates control of the railroads.
the law had the most success in preventing the railroads from arranging special rates among themselves which offered consumers some protection.
not until 1906 under president theodore roosevelt did the icc gain the power it needed to be effective.
still the law was a historic milestone marking the first time that the federal government had regulated an industry and it served as a model for later attempts.
panic and consolidation corporate abuses mismanagement overbuilding and competition pushed many railroads to the brink of bankruptcy.
their financial problems played a major role in a nationwide economic collapse.
the panic of 1893 was the worst depression up to that time by the end of 1893 around 600 banks and 15 000 businesses had failed and by 1895 4 million people had lost their jobs.
large investment firms such as j p morgan company reorganized the railroads.

samuel gompers american federation of labor afl eugene v debs industrial workers of the world iww mary harris jones a favorable climate manypeople in the late 1800s believed that a strong work ethic made one successful the business world welcomed entrepreneurs risk takers who use their money and talents to launch new ventures.
during this time period social philosophers argued that this new definition of success could be explained scientifically.
a new industrial age 241 belief in free markets american entrepreneurs were working within free enterprise capitalism.
free enterprise is an economic system in which private businesses run most industries.
competition determines prices and wages.
by the late 1800s most business leaders believed in laissez faire le say fer capitalism.
the term laissez faire is french for to let do.
laissez faire capitalism allows companies to conduct business without intervention by the government.
business leaders believed that government regulation would destroy individual self reliance reduce profits and harm the economy.
social darwinism americans understood that there were inequalities in the free enterprise system.
but many thinkers believed that inequalities were part of the social order.
to explain why some people prospered and others did not economists social philosophers and business leaders embraced the philosophy of social darwinism.
this philosophy adapted the ideas of the british naturalist charles darwin and applied them to human society.
darwin had studied plants and animals and concluded that members of a species compete for survival.
those best adapted to their environment thrive and pass their traits to the next generation.
less suited members gradually die out.
darwin called this process natural selection.
the english philosopher herbert spencer used darwin s biological theories to explain the evolution of human society.
economists found in social darwinism a way to justify the doctrine of laissez faire.
stronger people businesses and nations would prosper.
weaker ones would fail.
according to social darwinists the market should not be regulated because no one had the right to interfere with this process.
monopolies and trusts although some business owners endorsed the natural law in theory in practice most entrepreneurs did everything they could to control the competition that threatened the growth of their business empires.
to gain dominance some companies pursued mergers.
a merger usually occurred when one corporation bought out the stock of another.
a firm that bought out all its competitors could achieve a monopoly or complete control over its industry s production wages and prices.
some corporations took a different approach to mergers they joined with competing companies in trust agreements.
participants in a trust turned their stock over to a group of trustees people who ran the separate companies as one large corporation.
in return the companies were entitled to dividends on profits earned by the trust.
trusts were not legal mergers but that did not prevent them from forming.
fewer control more as businesses grew ever larger in the late 1800s many corporate leaders amassed staggering fortunes.
some viewed these individuals as robber barons who profited unfairly while others saw them as captains of industry.
carnegie and steel by 1865 carnegie was so busy managing the money he had earned in dividends that he happily left his job at the pennsylvania railroad.
he entered the steel business in 1873 after touring a british steel mill and witnessing the awesome spectacle of the bessemer process in action.
by 1899 the carnegie steel main idea summarizing what strategies enabled big businesses to eliminate competition.
chapter 6 main idea summarizing what were andrew carnegies management and business strategies.
company manufactured more steel than all the factories in great britain.
carnegie s success was due in part to management practices that he initiated and that soon became widespread.
first he continually searched for ways to make better products more cheaply.
he incorporated new machinery and techniques such as accounting systems that enabled him to track precise costs.
second he attracted talented people by offering them stock in the company and he encouraged competition among his assistants.
in addition to improving his own manufacturing operation carnegie attempted to control as much of the steel industry as he could.
he did this mainly by vertical integration a process in which he bought out his suppliers coal fields and iron mines ore freighters and railroad lines in order to control the raw materials and transportation systems.
carnegie also attempted to buy out competing steel producers.
in this process known as horizontal integration companies producing similar products merge.
having gained control over his suppliers and having limited his competition carnegie controlled almost the entire steel industry.
by the time he sold his business in 1901 carnegie s companies produced by far the largest portion of the nation s steel m vertical and horizontal integration resources raw materials fields forests and farms manufacturing production and processing distribution shipping and transportation delivery to customers horizontal history video great minds in business andrew carnegie main idea evaluating 5 do you agree with carnegies defense of millionaires.
why or why not.
rockefeller and oil john d rockefeller entered the oil business in 1863 and proved himself to be a superb business leader.
his company standard oil began as a refinery.
using vertical integration rockefeller acquired companies that supplied his business.
he bought barrel factories oil fields oil storage facilities pipelines and railroad cars.
he also practiced horizontal integration by taking over competing companies.
in 1870 rockefellers company processed two or three percent of the country s crude oil.
within a decade it controlled 90 percent of the refining business.
rockefeller reaped huge profits by paying his employees extremely low wages and driving his competitors out of business by selling his oil at a lower price than it cost to produce it.
then when he controlled the market he hiked prices far above original levels.
a mixed legacy alarmed at the tactics of industrialists some americans came to view them as robber barons.
critics argued that these tycoons profited unfairly by squeezing out competitors and using other tough tactics.
however admirers credited these entrpreneurs with using their business skills to make the american economy more productive and in turn stronger.
industrialists were also philanthropists.
although rockefeller kept most of his assets he still gave away over 500 million establishing the rockefeller foundation providing funds to found the university of chicago and creating a medical institute that helped find a cure for yellow fever.
andrew carnegie donated about 90 percent of the wealth he accumulated during his lifetime his fortune still supports the arts and learning today.
it will be a great mistake for the community to shoot the millionaires he said for they are the bees that make the most honey and contribute most to the hive even after they have gorged themselves full.

government and business for a time the government was content to allow the laissez faire system to continue unregulated for fear of harming the economy.
however as corporations expanded the government grew uneasy about the power of these giants.
while industrialization was raising the standard of living for all americans income inequality was increasing as well.
sherman antitrust act in 1890 congress passed the sherman antitrust act.
this act made it illegal to form a trust that interfered with free trade.
it also prohibited monopolies and activities that hindered competition.
prosecuting companies under the sherman act was not easy however because the act didn t clearly define terms such as trust.
in addition if firms such as standard oil felt pressure from the government they simply reorganized into single corporations.
the supreme court threw out seven of the eight cases the federal government brought against trusts.
eventually the government stopped trying to enforce the sherman act and the consolidation of businesses continued.
business boom bypasses the south industrial growth concentrated in the north where natural and urban resources were plentiful.
the south was still trying to recover from the civil war hindered by a lack of capital money for investment.
after the war people were unwilling to invest in risky ventures.
northern businesses already owned 90 percent of the stock in the most profitable southern enterprise the railroads thereby keeping the south in a stranglehold.
the south remained mostly agricultural with farmers at the mercy of railroad rates.
entrepreneurs suffered not only from excessive transportation costs but also from high tariffs on raw materials and imported goods and from a lack of skilled workers.
the post reconstruction south seemed to have no way out of economic stagnation.
however growth in forestry and mining and in the tobacco furniture and textile industries offered hope.
i e i labor unions emerge as business leaders merged and consolidated their forces it seemed necessary for workers to do the same.
although northern wages were generally higher than southern wages exploitation and unsafe working conditions drew workers together across regions in a nationwide labor movement.
laborers skilled and unskilled female and male black and white joined together in unions to try to improve their lot.
long hours and danger one of the largest employers the steel mills often demanded a seven day workweek.
seamstresses like factory workers in most industries worked 12 or more hours a day six days a week.
employees were not entitled to vacation sick leave unemployment compensation or reimbursement for injuries suffered on the job.
yet injuries were common.
in dirty poorly ventilated factories workers had to perform repetitive mind dulling tasks sometimes with dangerous or faulty equipment.
in 1882 an average of 675 laborers were killed in work related accidents each week.
in addition wages were so low that most families could not survive unless everyone held a job.
between 1890 and 1910 for example the number of women working for wages main idea synthesizing how did economic factors limit industrialization in the south.
i doubled from 4 million to more than 8 million.
twenty percent of the boys and 10 percent of the girls under age 15 some as young as five years old also held full time jobs.
with little time or energy left for school child laborers forfeited their futures to help their families make ends meet.
in sweatshops or workshops in tenements rather than in factories workers had little choice but to put up with the conditions.
sweatshop employment which was tedious and required few skills was often the only avenue open to women and children.
jacob riis described the conditions faced by sweaters.
a personal voice jacob riis the bulk of the sweaters work is done in the tenements which the law that regulates factory labor does not reach.
in them the child works unchallenged from the day he is old enough to pull a thread.
there is no such thing as a dinner hour men and women eat while they work and the day is lengthened at both ends far into the night.
how the other half lives not surprisingly sweatshop jobs paid the lowest wages often as little as 27 cents for a child s 14 hour day.
in 1899 women earned an average of 267 a year nearly half of men s average pay of 498.
the very next year andrew carnegie made 23 million with no income tax.
main idea analyzing issues 4 how did industrial working conditions contribute to the growth of the labor movement.
vocabulary arbitration a method of settling disputes in which both sides submit their differences to a mutually approved judge early labor organizing skilled workers had formed small local unions since the late 1700s.
the first large scale national organization of laborers the national labor union nlu was formed in 1866 by ironworker william h sylvis.
the refusal of some nlu local chapters to admit african americans led to the creation of the colored national labor union cnlu.
nevertheless nlu membership grew to 640 000.
in 1868 the nlu persuaded congress to legalize an eight hour day for government workers.
nlu organizers concentrated on linking existing local unions.
in 1869 uriah stephens focused his attention on individual workers and organized the noble order of the knights of labor.
its motto was an injury to one is the concern of all.
membership in the knights of labor was officially open to all workers regardless of race gender or degree of skill.
like the nlu the knights supported an eight hour workday and advocated equal pay for equal work by men and women.
they saw strikes or refusals to work as a last resort and instead advocated arbitration.
at its height in 1886 the knights of labor had about 700 000 members.
although the knights declined after the failure of a series of strikes other unions continued to organize.
union movements diverge as labor activism spread it diversified.
two major types of unions made great gains under forceful leaders.
craft unionism one form of labor organization was craft unionism which included skilled workers from one or more trades.
jewish immigrant samuel gompers led the cigar makers international union to join other craft unions in 1886.
the american federation of labor afl historical spotlight african americans and the labor movement angered by their exclusion from the nlu african american laborers formed the colored national labor union cnlu in 1869.
led by isaac meyers a caulker from baltimore the cnlu emphasized cooperation between management and labor and the importance of political reform.
the cnlu disbanded in the early 1870s but many african american laborers found a home in the knights of labor the first union to welcome blacks and whites alike.
the great strike of 1877 brought whites and african americans together but the labor movement remained largely divided along racial lines.
management often hired african americans as strikebreakers which intensified white unions resistance to accepting blacks.
african americans continued to organize on their own but discrimination and their small numbers relative to white unions hurt black unions effectiveness.
a new industrial age 245 in new york citys union square in 1914 iww members protest violence against striking coal miners in colorado.
the strike is the weapon of the oppressed.
eugene v debs with gompers as its president focused on collective bargaining or negotiation between representatives of labor and management to reach written agreements on wages hours and working conditions.
unlike the knights of labor the afl used strikes as a major tactic.
successful strikes helped the afl win higher wages and shorter workweeks.
between 1890 and 1915 the average weekly wages in unionized industries rose from 17 50 to 24 and the average workweek fell from almost 54 5 hours to just under 49 hours.
industrial unionism some labor leaders felt that unions should include all laborers skilled and unskilled in a specific industry.
this concept captured the imagination of eugene v debs who attempted to form such an industrial union the american railway union aru.
most of the new union s members were unskilled and semiskilled laborers but skilled engineers and firemen joined too.
in 1894 the new union won a strike for higher wages.
within two months its membership climbed to 150 000 dwarfing the 90 000 enrolled in the four skilled railroad brotherhoods.
though the aru like the knights of labor never recovered after the failure of a major strike it added to the momentum of union organizing.
socialism and the iww in an attempt to solve the problems faced by workers eugene debs and some other labor activists eventually turned to socialism an economic and political system based on government control of business and property and equal distribution of wealth.
socialism carried to its extreme form communism as advocated by the german philosopher karl marx would result in the overthrow of the capitalist system.
most socialists in late 19th century america drew back from this goal however and worked within the labor movement to achieve better conditions for workers.
in 1905 a group of radical unionists and socialists in chicago organized the industrial workers of the world iww or the wobblies.
headed by william big bill haywood the wobblies included miners lumberers and cannery and dock workers.
unlike the aru the iww welcomed african americans but membership never topped 100 000.
its only major strike victory occurred in 1912.
yet the wobblies like other industrial unions gave dignity and a sense of solidarity to unskilled workers.
other labor activism in the west in april 1903 about 1 000 japanese and mexican workers organized a successful strike in the sugar beet fields of ventura county california.
they formed the sugar beet and farm laborers union of oxnard.
in wyoming the state federation of labor supported a union of chinese and japanese miners who sought the same wages and treatment as other union miners.
these small independent unions increased both the overall strength of the labor movement and the tension between labor and management.
main idea contrasting how did craft unions and industrial unions differ.
chapter 6 main idea analyzing causes how did the 1877 strike and haymarket cause the public to resent the labor movement.
strikes turn violent industry and government responded forcefully to union activity which they saw as a threat to the entire capitalist system.
the great strike of 1877 in july 1877 workers for the baltimore and ohio railroad b o struck to protest their second wage cut in two months.
the work stoppage spread to other lines.
most freight and even some passenger traffic covering over 50 000 miles was stopped for more than a week.
after several state governors asked president rutherford b hayes to intervene saying that the strikers were impeding interstate commerce federal troops ended the strike.
the haymarket affair encouraged by the impact of the 1877 strike labor leaders continued to press for change.
on the evening of may 4 1886 3 000 people gathered at chicago s haymarket square to protest police brutality a striker had been killed and several had been wounded at the mccormick harvester plant the day before.
rain began to fall at about 10 o clock and the crowd was dispersing when police arrived.
then someone tossed a bomb into the police line.
police fired on the workers seven police officers and several workers died in the chaos that followed.
no one ever learned who threw the bomb but the three speakers at the demonstration and five other radicals were charged with inciting a riot.
all eight were convicted four were hanged and one committed suicide in prison.
after haymarket the public began to turn against the labor movement.
the homestead strike despite the violence and rising public anger workers continued to strike.
the writer hamlin garland described conditions at the carnegie steel company s homestead plant in pennsylvania.
a personal voice hamlin garland everywhere.
groups of pale lean men slouched in faded garments grimy with the soot and grease of the mills.
a roar as of a hundred lions a thunder as of cannons.

which unions membership increased in 1889 1890.
what effect s did the haymarket riot have on union membership.
a new industrial age 247 key players eugene v debs 1855 1926 born in indiana eugene v debs left home at the age of 14 to work for the railroads.
in 1875 he helped organize a local lodge of the brotherhood of locomotive firemen and after attempts to unite the local railroad brotherhoods failed debs organized the american railway union.
while in prison following the pullman strike in 1894 debs read the works of karl marx and became increasingly disillusioned with capitalism.
he became a spokesperson for the socialist party of america and was its candidate for president five times.
in 1912 he won about 900 000 votes an amazing 6 percent of the total.
guards from the pinkerton detective agency to protect the plant so that he could hire scabs or strikebreakers to keep it operating.
in a pitched battle that left at least three detectives and nine workers dead the steelworkers forced out the pinkertons and kept the plant closed until the pennsylvania national guard arrived on july 12.
the strike continued until november but by then the union had lost much of its support and gave in to the company.
it would take 45 years for steelworkers to mobilize once again.
the pullman company strike strikes continued in other industries however.
during the panic of 1893 and the economic depression that followed the pullman company laid off more than 3 000 of its 5 800 employees and cut the wages of the rest by 25 to 50 percent without cutting the cost of its employee housing.
after paying their rent many workers took home less than 6 a week.
a strike was called in the spring of 1894 when the pullman company failed to restore wages or decrease rents.
eugene debs asked for arbitration but pullman refused to negotiate with the strikers.
so the aru began boycotting pullman trains.
after pullman hired strikebreakers the strike turned violent and president grover cleveland sent in federal troops.
in the bitter aftermath debs was jailed.
pullman fired most of the strikers and the railroads blacklisted many others so they could never again get rail road jobs.
women organize although women were barred from many unions they united behind powerful leaders to demand better working conditions equal pay for equal work and an end to child labor.
perhaps the most prominent organizer in the women s labor movement was mary harris jones.
jones supported the great strike of 1877 and later organized for the united mine workers of america umw.
she endured death threats and jail with the coal miners who gave her the nickname mother jones.
in 1903 to expose the cruelties of child labor she led 80 mill children many with hideous injuries on a march to the home of president theodore roosevelt.
their crusade influenced the passage of child labor laws.
other organizers also achieved significant gains for women.
in 1909 pauline newman just 16 years old became the first female organizer of the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu.
a garment worker from the age of eight newman also supported mother jones 1830 1930 mary harris mother jones was a native of ireland who immigrated to north america as a child.
she became involved in the american labor movement after receiving assistance from the knights of labor.
according to a reporter who followed the mother of the laboring class on her childrens march in 1903 she fights their battles with a mothers love jones continued fighting until her death at age 100.
jones was definitely not the kind of woman admired by industrialists.
god almighty made women she declared and the rockefeller gang of thieves made ladies chapter 6 main idea summarizing what factors made the triangle shirtwaist fire so lethal.
the uprising of the 20 000 a 1909 seamstresses strike that won labor agreements and improved working conditions for some strikers.
the public could no longer ignore conditions in garment factories after a fire broke out at the triangle shirtwaist factory in new york city on march 25 1911.
the fire spread swiftly through the oil soaked machines and piles of cloth engulfing the eighth ninth and tenth floors.
as workers attempted to flee they discovered that the company had locked all but one of the exit doors to prevent theft.
the unlocked door was blocked by fire.
the factory had no sprinkler system and the single fire escape collapsed almost immediately.
in all 146 women died some were found huddled with their faces raised to a small window.
public outrage flared after a jury acquitted the factory owners of manslaughter.
in response the state of new york set up a task force to study factory working conditions j j management and government pressure unions the more powerful the unions became the more employers came to fear them.
management refused to recognize unions as representatives of the workers.
many employers forbade union meetings fired union members and forced new employees to sign yellow dog contracts swearing that they would not join a union.
finally industrial leaders with the help of the courts turned the sherman antitrust act against labor.
all a company had to do was say that a strike picket line or boycott would hurt interstate trade and the state or federal government would issue an injunction against the labor action.
legal limitations made it more and more difficult for unions to be effective.
despite these pressures workers especially those in skilled jobs continued to view unions as a powerful tool.
by 1904 the afl had about 1 700 000 members in its affiliated unions by the eve of world war i afl membership would climb to over 2 million.
the fire departments ladders reached only to the sixth floor two floors below the burning triangle shirtwaist company.

senator john c calhoun was a sick man too sick to deliver his speech to the senate.
on march 4 1850 calhoun asked senator james m mason of virginia to read his speech for him.
a personal voice john c calhoun 661 have senators believed from the first that the agitation of the subject of slavery would if not prevented by some timely and effective measure end in disunion.
the agitation has been permitted to proceed.
until it has reached a period when it can no longer be disguised or denied that the union is in danger.
you have thus had forced upon you the greatest and the gravest question that can ever come under your consideration how can the union be preserved quoted in the compromise of 1850 as senator calhoun and other southern legislators demanded the expansion of slavery northerners just as vehemently called for its abolition.
once again the issue of slavery was deepening the gulf between the north and the south.
differences between north and south john c calhoun over the centuries the northern and southern sections of the united states had developed into two very different cultural and economic regions.
the distinction between north and south had its roots in the early 17th century when british colonists began settling virginia in the south and massachusetts in the north.
along with differences in geography and climate the two regions were noticeably dissimilar in their religious and cultural traditions.
however it was the southern dependence on the peculiar institution of slavery that increased tensions between the regions and that eventually brought them into conflict.
chapter 4 the union in peril developing historical perspective why did southerners want to increase the number of slave states.
the south with its plantation economy had come to rely on an enslaved labor force.
the north with its diversified industries was less dependent on slavery.
as the north industrialized northern opposition to slavery grew more intense.
the controversy over slavery only worsened as new territories and states were admitted to the union.
supporters of slavery saw an opportunity to create more slave states while opponents remained equally determined that slavery should not spread slavery in the territories the issue of slavery in california and in the western territories led to heated debates in the halls of congress and eventually to a fragile compromise.
statehood for california due in large part to the gold rush california had grown quickly and applied for statehood in december 1850.
california s new constitution forbade slavery a fact that alarmed and angered many southerners.
they had assumed that because most of california lay south of the missouri compromise line of 3630 the state would be open to slavery.
southerners wanted the 1820 compromise to apply to territories west of the louisiana purchase thus ensuring that california would become a slave state.
the compromise of 1850 as the 31st congress opened in december 1849 the question of statehood for california topped the agenda.
of equal concern was the border dispute in which the slave state of texas claimed the eastern half of the new mexico territory where the issue of slavery had not yet been settled.
as passions mounted threats of southern secession the formal withdrawal of a state from the union became more frequent.
once again henry clay worked to shape a compromise that both the north and the south could accept.
after obtaining support of the powerful massachusetts senator daniel webster clay presented to the senate a series of resolutions later called the compromise of 1850.
clay s compromise contained provisions to appease northerners as well as southerners.
to please the north the compromise provided that california be daniel webster i strongly supported clays compromise.

taylor s successor millard fillmore quickly made it clear that he supported the compromise.
at last in september after eight months of effort the compromise of 1850 became law.

harriet tubman was called moses by those she helped escape on the underground railroad.
in her later years tubman opened a home for elderly orphaned and needy african americans y protest resistance and violence the harsh terms of the fugitive slave act surprised many people.
under the law alleged fugitive slaves were not entitled to a trial by jury.
in addition anyone convicted of helping a fugitive was liable for a fine of 1 000 and imprisonment for up to six months.
infuriated by the fugitive slave act some northerners resisted it by organizing vigilance committees to send endangered african americans to safety in canada.
others resorted to violence to rescue fugitive slaves.
still others worked to help slaves escape from slavery.
the underground railroad attempting to escape from slavery was a dangerous process.
it meant traveling on foot at night without any sense of distance or direction except for the north star and other natural signs.
it meant avoiding patrols of armed men on horseback and struggling through forests and across rivers.
often it meant going without food for days at a time.
as time went on free african americans and white abolitionists developed a secret network of people who would at great risk to themselves hide fugitive slaves.
the system of escape routes they used became known as the underground railroad.
conductors on the routes hid fugitives in secret tunnels and false cupboards provided them with food and clothing and escorted or directed them to the next station.
once fugitives reached the north many chose to remain there.
others journeyed to canada to be completely out of reach of their owners c one of the most famous conductors was harriet tubman born a slave in maryland in 1820 or 1821.
in 1849 after tubman s owner died she heard rumors that she was about to be sold.
fearing this possibility tubman decided to make a break for freedom and succeeded in reaching philadelphia.
shortly after passage of the fugitive slave act tubman resolved to become a conductor on the underground railroad.
in all she made 19 trips back to the south and is said to have helped 300 slaves including her own parents flee to freedom.

while southerners criticized the book as an attack on the south.
the furor over uncle tom s cabin had barely begun to settle when the issue of slavery in the territories surfaced again.
tension in kansas and nebraska the compromise of 1850 had provided for popular sovereignty in new mexico and utah.
to senator stephen douglas popular sovereignty seemed like an excellent way to decide whether slavery would be allowed in the nebraska territory.
a personal voice stephen a douglas if the people of kansas want a slaveholding state let them have it and if they want a free state they have a right to it and it is not for the people of illinois or missouri or new york or kentucky to complain whatever the decision of kansas may be.
quoted in the civil war by geoffrey c ward the only difficulty was that unlike new mexico and utah the kansas and nebraska territory lay north of the missouri compromise line of 3630 and therefore was legally closed to slavery.
douglas introduced a bill in congress on january 23 1854 that would divide the area into two territories nebraska in the north and kansas in the south.
if passed the bill would repeal the missouri compromise and establish popular sovereignty for both territories.
congressional debate was bitter.
some northern congressmen saw the bill as part of a plot to turn the territories into slave states.
southerners strongly defended the proposed legislation.
after months of struggle the kansas nebraska act became law in 1854.
dy kansas the race for kansas was on.
both supporters and opponents of slavery attempted to populate kansas in order to win the vote on slavery in the territory.
by march 1855 kansas had enough settlers to hold an election for a territorial legislature.
however thousands of border ruffians from the slave state of missouri crossed into kansas voted illegally and won a fraudulent majority for the proslavery candidates.
a government was set up at lecompton and promptly issued a series of proslavery acts.
furious over these events abolitionists organized a rival government in topeka in the fall of 1855.
it wasn t long before bloody violence surfaced in the struggle for kansas earning the territory the name bleeding kansas violence in the senate violence was not restricted to kansas.

the widening gulf between the north and the south had far reaching implications for party politics as well.
as the two regions grew further apart the old national parties ruptured and new political parties emerged including a party for antislavery northerners.
a this 1856 cartoon with its ironic caption gives the northern view of preston brookss beating of charles sumner.
new political parties emerge main idea analyzing effects what impact did the slavery issue have on the democratic and whig parties.
by the end of 1856 the nation s political landscape had a very different appearance than it had exhibited in 1848.
the whig party had split over the issue of slavery and had lost support in both the north and the south.
the democratic party which had survived numerous crises in its history was still alive though scarred.
a new republican party had formed and was moving within striking distance of the presidency.
jy slavery divides whigs in 1852 the whig vote in the south fell dramatically which helped produce a victory for the democratic candidate franklin pierce.
in 1854 the kansas nebraska act completed the demise of the whigs.
unable to agree on a national platform the southern faction splintered as its members looked for a proslavery pro union party to join.
at the same time whigs in the north sought a political alternative of their own.
one alternative that appeared was the american party which soon became known as the know nothing party because members were instructed to answer questions about their activities by saying i know nothing.
the know nothings supported nativism the favoring of native born people over immigrants.
however like the whigs the know nothings split over the issue of slavery in the territories.
southern know nothings looked for another alternative to the democrats.
meanwhile northern know nothings began to edge toward the republican party.
review unit 161 1 free soil free speech free labor and free men free soilers campaign slogan 1848 two antislavery parties had also emerged during the 1840s.
the liberty party was formed for the purpose of pursuing the cause o a o 1 tion by passing new laws but received only a small percentage of vo es in the 1848 presidential election.
in that same election the free soil arty which opposed the extension of slavery into the territories received ten percent of the popular vote in the presidential election.
from this strong showing it was clear that many northerners opposed the extension of slavery in the territories.
the free soilers voice northern opposition to slavery in the territories was not necessarily based on positive feelings toward african americans.
it was not unusual for northerners to be free soilers without being abolitionists.
unlike abolitionists a number of northern free soilers supported racist laws prohibiting settlement by blacks in their communities and denying them the right to vote.
what free soilers primarily objected to was slaverys competition with free white workers or a wage based labor force upon which the north depended.
they feared that such competition would drive down wages.
free soilers detected a dangerous pattern in such events as the passage of the fugitive slave act and the repeal of the missouri compromise.
they were convinced that a conspiracy existed on the part of the diabolical slave power to spread slavery throughout the united states.
the new republican party in 1854 opponents of slavery in the territories formed a new political party the republican party.
the republicans were united in opposing the kansas nebraska act and in keeping slavery out of the territories.
apart from these issues however the republican party embraced a wide range of opinions.
as the party grew it took in free soilers antislavery whigs and democrats and nativists mostly from the north.
the conservative faction hoped to resurrect the missouri compromise.
at the opposite extreme were some radical abolitionists.
during the election of 1856 the republicans chose as their candidate john c fremont.
the democrats nominated james buchanan of pennsylvania.
if fremont had won the south might have seceded then and there.
however buchanan won and the threat of secession was temporarily averted.
main idea contrasting how did free soilers differ from abolitionists.

the controversy over first slavery related controversy arose on march 6 1857 just two days after slavery y he took office the dred scott decision a major supreme court decision was brought about by dred scott a slave whose owner took him from the slave state of missouri to free territory in illinois and wisconsin and back to missouri.
scott appealed to the supreme court for his freedom on the grounds that living in a free state illinois and a free territory wisconsin had made him a free man.
me case was in court for years.
finally on march 6 185 the supreme court ruled against dred scott.

lincoln douglas debates several months after the dred scott decision one of illinois s greatest political contests got underway the 1858 race for the u s senate between democratic incumbent stephen douglas and republican challenger congressman abraham lincoln.
to many outsiders it must have seemed like an uneven match.
douglas was a well known two term senator with an outstanding record and a large campaign chest while lincoln was a self educated man who had been elected to one term in congress in 1846.
to counteract douglas lincoln challenged the man known as the little giant to a series of debates on the issue of slavery in the territories.
douglas accepted the challenge and the stage was set for some of the most celebrated debates in u s history.
the two men s positions were simple and consistent.
neither wanted slavery in the territories but they disagreed on how to keep it out.
douglas believed deeply in popular sovereignty.
lincoln on the other hand believed that slavery was immoral.
however he did not expect individuals to give up slavery unless congress abolished slavery with an amendment.
in their second debate lincoln asked his opponent a crucial question could the settlers of a territory vote to exclude slavery before the territory became a state.
everyone knew that the dred scott decision said no that territories could not exclude slavery.
popular sovereignty lincoln implied was thus an empty phrase.
douglas replied that if the people of a territory were free soilers then all they had to do was elect representatives who would not enforce slave property laws in that territory.
in other words people could get around dred scott.
douglas won the senate seat but his response had widened the split in the democratic party.
as for lincoln his attacks on the vast moral evil of slavery drew national attention and some republicans began thinking of him as an excellent candidate for the presidency in 1860.
jjy harpers ferry while politicians debated the slavery issue the abolitionist john brown was studying the slave uprisings that had occurred in ancient rome and more recently on the french island of haiti.
he believed that the time was ripe for similar uprisings in the united states.
brown secretly obtained financial backing from several prominent northern abolitionists on the night of october 16 1859 he led a band of 21 men black and white into harpers ferry virginia now west virginia.
his aim was to seize the federal arsenal there and start a general slave uprising.

public reaction to brown s execution was immediate and intense in both sections of the country.

the response was equally extreme in the south where mobs assaulted whites who were suspected of holding antislavery views.
lincoln is elected president as the 1860 presidential election approached the republicans nominated abraham lincoln.
lincoln appeared to be moderate in his views.
although he pledged to halt the further spread of slavery he also tried to reassure southerners that a republican administration would not interfere with their slaves or with them about their slaves.
nonetheless many southerners viewed him as an enemy.
as the campaign developed three major candidates besides lincoln vied for office.
the democratic party finally split over slavery.
northern democrats rallied behind douglas and his doctrine of popular sovereignty.
southern democrats who supported the dred scott decision lined up behind vice president john c breckinridge of kentucky.
former know nothings and whigs from the south organized the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee as their candidate.
lincoln emerged as the winner with less than half the popular vote and with no electoral votes from the south.
he did not even appear on the ballot in most of the slave states because of southern hostility toward him.
the outlook for the union was grim jy southern secession lincoln s victory convinced southerners who had viewed the struggle over slavery partly as a conflict between the states right of self determination and federal government control that they had lost their political voice in the national government.

in february 1861 delegates from the secessionist states met in montgomery alabama where they formed the confederate states of america or confederacy.
they also drew up a constitution that closely resembled that of the united states but with a few notable differences.
the most important difference was that it protected and recognized slavery in new territories.
the confederates then unanimously elected former senator jefferson davis of mississippi as president.
the north had heard threats of secession before.
when it finally happened no one was shocked.
but one key question remained in everyone s mind would the north allow the south to leave the union without a fight.
spotlight secession and the border states four slave states maryland kentucky missouri and delaware were undecided about secession.
lincoln believed that these states would be essential to the success of the union if war broke out.
they had large populations numerous factories and strategic access to the ohio river.
moreover maryland nearly surrounded washington d c the seat of government.
lincoln faced a choice free the slaves and make abolitionists happy or ignore slavery for the moment to keep from alienating the border states.
he chose the latter but that did not prevent violent conflicts between secessionists and unionists in maryland kentucky and missouri.
with the intervention of the militia and some political maneuvering in those states legislatures lincoln kept the four border states in the union.

review unit 165 s is v a dred scott v sandford 1857 origins of the case dred scott s slave master had brought him from the slave state of missouri to live for a time in free territory and in the free state of illinois.
eventually they returned to missouri.
scott believed that because he had lived in free territory he should be free.
in 1854 he sued in federal court for his freedom.
the court ruled against him and he appealed to the supreme court.
the ruling the supreme court ruled that african americans were not and could never be citizens.
thus dred scott had no right even to file a lawsuit and remained enslaved.
legal reasoning the court s decision based primarily on chief justice roger taney s written opinion made two key findings.
first it held that because scott was a slave he was not a citizen and had no right to sue in a united states court.
we think they slaves are not included and were not intended to be included under the word citizens in the constitution and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the united states this could have been the end of the matter but taney went further.
he said that by banning slavery congress was in effect taking away property.
such an action he wrote violated the fifth amendment which guarantees the right not to be deprived of property without due process of law such as a hearing.
thus all congressional efforts to ban slavery in the territories were prohibited.
justices john mclean and benjamin curtis strongly dissented on both points.
they showed that the u s constitution state constitutions and other laws had recognized african americans as citizens.
they also pointed to the clause in the constitution giving congress the power to make all needful rules and regulations to govern u s territories.
in their view this clause gave congress the power to prohibit slavery in the territories.
chief justice roger taney legal sources u s constitution u s constitution article 4 section 2 1789 no person held to service or labor in one state.
escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor.
u s constitution article 4 section 3 1789 the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states.
u s constitution fifth amendment 1791 no person shall be.
deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law.
related cases ableman v booth 1858 the court decided that the fugitive slave act was c stitutional and that laws passed in northern states that prohibited the return of fugitive slaves were unconstitutional.
why it mattered taney s opinion in dred scott had far reaching consequences.
legally the opinion greatly expanded the reach of slavery.
politically it heightened the sectional tensions that would lead to the civil war.
before the court decided dred scott americans widely accepted the idea that congress and the states could limit slavery.
as the dissenters argued many previous acts of congress had limited slavery for example the northwest ordinance had banned slavery in the northwest territory and no one had claimed that those acts violated property rights.
taney s opinion in dred scott however was a major change.
this expansion of slaveholders rights cast doubt on whether free states could prevent slave owners from bringing or even selling slaves into free areas.
as a result dred scott intensified the slavery debate as no single event had before.
in going beyond what was needed to settle the case before him taney s ruling became a political act and threw into question the legitimacy of the court.
further taney s opinion took the extreme proslavery position and installed it as the national law.
it not only negated all the compromises made to date by pro and antislavery forces but it seemed to preclude any possible future compromises.
historical impact it took four years of bitter civil war to find out if taney s opinion would stand as the law of the land.
it would not.
immediately after the civil war the federal government moved to abolish slavery with the thirteenth amendment 1865 and then to extend state and national citizenship with the fourteenth amendment 1868 to z a ll persons born or naturalized in the united states.
the wording of these amend contemporary newspaper article describing the dred scott case.
ments was expressly intended to nullify dred scott.
these amendments meant that dred scott would no longer be used as a precedent an earlier ruling that can be used to justify a current one.
instead it is now pointed to as an important lesson on the limits of the supreme court s power as a key step on the road to the civil war and as one of the worst decisions ever made by the supreme court.

nearly one fourth of the 100 000 men who fought there were killed wounded or captured.
as grant pushed toward the mississippi river david g farragut commanding a union fleet of about 40 ships seized new orleans the confederacy s largest city and busiest port.
see the fall of new orleans map below.
by june farragut had taken control of much of the lower mississippi.
between grant and farragut the union had nearly achieved its goal of cutting the confederacy in two.
only port hudson louisiana and vicksburg mississippi still stood in the way.
the war for the capitals in the spring of 1862 while mcclellan was leading his army toward richmond he met a confederate army commanded by general joseph e johnston.
see the battles of the east map on page 171.
after a series of battles johnston was wounded and command of the army passed on to robert e lee.
lee was very different from mcclellan modest rather than vain and willing to go beyond military textbooks in his tactics.
determined to save the confederate capital lee drove mcclellan away from richmond.

in september his troops crossed the potomac into the union state of maryland.
at this point mcclellan had an incredible stroke of luck.
a union corporal found a copy of lee s orders wrapped around some cigars.
the plan revealed that lee s and stonewall jackson s armies were separated for the moment.
mcclellan ordered his men to pursue lee and the two sides fought on september 17 near a creek called the antietam an te tem.
the clash proved to be the bloodiest single day battle in american history with casualties totaling more than 26 000.
the next day instead of pursuing the battered confederate army into virginia and possibly ending the war mcclellan did nothing.
as a result lincoln removed him from command.
historical spotlight main idea drawing conclusions why did both the union and confederacy care about british neutrality.
the politics of war after secession occurred many southerners believed that dependence on southern cotton would force great britain to formally recognize the confederacy as an independent nation.
unfortunately for the south britain had accumulated a huge cotton inventory just before the outbreak of war.
instead of importing southern cotton the british now needed northern wheat and corn.
britain decided that neutrality was the best policy.
boys in war both the union and confederate armies had soldiers who were under 18 years of age.
examination of some confederate recruiting lists for 1861 1862 reveals that approximately 5 percent were 17 or younger with some as young as 13.
the percentage of boys in the union army was lower perhaps 1 5 percent.
these figures however do not count the great number of boys who ran away to follow each army without officially enlisting.
review unit 171 key players abraham lincoln 1809 1865 people question why lincoln believed so passionately in the union.
a possible answer lies in his life story.
he was born into poverty the son of illiterate parents.
lincoln once said that in his boyhood there was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for educa tion yet he hungered for knowledge.
apart from a years worth of school lincoln educated himself and after working as rail splitter flatboatman storekeeper and surveyor he taught himself to be a lawyer.
this led to careers in politics and law and eventually to the white house.
perhaps because of this upward mobility lincoln fought passionately to preserve the democracy he described as the last best hope of earth jefferson davis 1808 1889 davis who was named after thomas jefferson was born in kentucky but grew up in mississippi.
after graduating from west point he served in the military then settled down as a planter before going into politics.
he served terms in the u s senate.
his election as president of the confederacy dismayed him.
as his wife varina wrote i thought his genius was military but as a party manager he would not succeed.
he did not know the arts of the politician.
varina was right.
davis fought frequently with other confederate leaders and was blamed for the refusal of many southern states to put the confederacys welfare above their own.
history video emancipation proclamation 7 proclaiming emancipation as jefferson davis s confederacy struggled in vain to gain foreign recognition abolitionist feeling grew in the north.
although lincoln disliked slavery he did not believe that the federal government had the power to abolish it where it already existed.
as the war progressed however lincoln did find a way to use his constitutional war powers to end slavery.
the confederacy used the labor of slaves to build fortifications and grow food.
lincoln s powers as commander in chief allowed him to order his troops to seize enemy resources.
therefore he decided that just as he could order the union army to take confederate supplies he could also authorize the army to emancipate slaves.
emancipation was not just a moral issue it became a weapon of war.
on january 1 1863 lincoln issued his emancipation proclamation.
the following portion captured national attention.
from the emancipation proclamation abraham lincoln i do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within these said designated states and parts of states are and henceforward shall be free and that the executive government of the united states including the military and naval authorities thereof will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.
and i hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence unless in necessary self defense and i recommend to them that in all cases when allowed they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.
and i further declare and make known that such persons of suitable condition will be received into the armed service of the united states to garrison forts positions stations and other places and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.
and upon this sincerely believed to be an act of justice warranted by the constitution upon military necessity i invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of almighty god from the emancipation proclamation january 1 1863 172 chapter 4 the union in peril i main idea analyzing motives in what way was the emancipation proclamation a part of lincolns military strategy.
the proclamation did not free any slaves immediately because it applied only to areas behind confederate lines outside union control.
nevertheless for many the proclamation gave the war a moral purpose by turning the struggle into a fight to free the slaves.
it also ensured that compromise was no longer possible.
both sides face political dissent neither side in the civil war was completely unified.
the north harbored thousands of confederate sympathizers while the south had thousands of union sympathizers.
lincoln dealt forcefully with disloyalty and dissent.
he suspended the writ of habeas corpus which prevents the government from holding citizens without formally charging them with crimes.
jefferson davis also adopted this practice.
life during wartime vocabulary desertion the act of abandoning an assigned post or duty the war led to social upheaval and political unrest in both the north and the south.
as the fighting intensified heavy casualties and widespread desertions led each side to impose conscription a draft that forced men to serve in the army.
in the north conscription led to draft riots the most violent of which took place in new york city.
sweeping changes occurred in the wartime economies of both sides as well as in the roles played by african americans and women.
african americans fight for freedom although african americans made up only 1 percent of the north s population by war s end about 180 000 african americans had fought for the union about 10 percent of the northern army.
in spite of their dedication african american soldiers in the union army suffered discrimination.
they served in separate regiments commanded by white officers and earned lower pay for most of the war.
soldiers suffer on both sides both union and confederate soldiers had marched off to war thinking it would be a glorious affair.
they were soon disillusioned not just by heavy battlefield casualties but also by such unhealthy conditions as filthy surroundings a limited diet and inadequate medical care.
in the 1860s the technology of killing had outrun the technology of medical care.
except when fighting or marching most soldiers lived amid heaps of rubbish and open latrines.
as a result body lice dysentery and diarrhea were common.
if conditions in the army camps were bad those in war prisons were atrocious.
the confederate camps were especially overcrowded and unsanitary.
the south s lack of food and tent canvas also contributed to the appalling conditions.
prison camps in the north were only slightly better.
northern prisons provided wounded union troops recuperate after battle near a makeshift field hospital.
more space and adequate amounts of food.
however thousands of confederate prisoners housed in quarters with little or no heat contracted pneumonia and died.
historians estimate that 15 percent of union prisoners in southern prisons died while 12 percent of confederate prisoners died in northern prisons.
women work to improve conditions although women did not fight thousands contributed to the war effort.
some 3 000 women served as union army nurses.
one dedicated union nurse was clara barton who went on to found the american red cross after the war.
barton cared for the sick and wounded often at the front lines of battle.
thousands of southern women also volunteered for nursing duty.
sally tompkins for example performed so heroically in her hospital duties that she eventually was commissioned as a captain.
both sides benefited because women devoted so much time and energy to nursing.
women s help was desperately needed as a series of battles in the mississippi valley and in the east soon sent casualties flooding into northern and southern hospitals alike.
union nurses such as clara barton above and louisa may alcott faced the hazards of disease in field hospitals.
background after the war clara barton became the first woman to head a u s government agency whose employees helped family members to track down missing soldiers.
the war affects regional economies in general the war expanded the north s economy and shattered the south s.
the confederacy soon faced a food shortage due to the drain of manpower into the army the union occupation of food growing areas and the loss of enslaved field workers.
food prices skyrocketed and the inflation rate rose 7 000 percent.
overall the war s effect on the economy of the north was much more positive.
the army s need for supplies supported woolen mills steel foundries and many other industries.
the economic boom had a dark side however.
wages did not keep up with prices and many people s standard of living declined.
when white male workers went out on strike employees hired free blacks immigrants and women to replace them for lower wages.
as the northern economy grew congress decided to help pay for the war by collecting the nation s first income tax a tax that takes a specified percentage of an individual s income.

mary chesnut was the daughter of a south carolina governor and the wife of a u s senator who resigned his office to serve in the confederate government.
during the war she recorded her observations and thoughts in a diary.
in 1864 chesnut went to hear benjamin h palmer a minister and professor speak about the war.
in her diary she described how palmer s pessimistic words filled her with foreboding about the future of the confederacy.
mary chesnut a personal voice mary chesnut september 21st.

he spoke of these times of our agony.
and then came the cry help us oh god.
vain is the help of man and so we came away shaken to the depths.
quoted in mary chesnuts civil war by september 1864 the northern armies had won several decisive battles.
mary chesnut must already have had some idea of the threat posed to her way of life however.
in 1863 she wrote that the south the only world we cared for had been literally kicked to pieces.
the tide turns the year 1863 actually had begun well for the south.
in december 1862 lee s army had defeated the union army of the potomac at fredericksburg virginia.
then in may the south defeated the north again at chancellorsville virginia.
review unit 175 the north s only consolation after chancellorsville came as the result of an accident.
as general stonewall jackson returned from a patrol on may 2 confederate guards accidentally shot him in the left arm.
a surgeon amputated his arm the following day.
when lee heard the news he exclaimed he has lost his left arm but i have lost my right.
the true loss was still to come jackson caught pneumonia and died on may 10.
despite jackson s death lee decided to press his military advantage and invade the north.
he needed supplies and he thought that a major confederate victory on northern soil might tip the balance of public opinion in the union to the proslavery politicians.
accordingly he crossed the potomac into maryland and then pushed on into pennsylvania.
the battle of gettysburg near the sleepy town of gettysburg in southern pennsylvania the most decisive battle of the war was fought.
the battle of gettysburg began on july 1 when confederate soldiers led by a p hill encountered several brigades of union cavalry under the command of john buford an experienced officer from illinois.
buford ordered his men to take defensive positions on the hills and ridges surrounding the town.
when hill s troops marched toward the town from the west buford s men were waiting.
the shooting attracted more troops and both sides called for reinforcements.

by the second day of battle the confederates had driven the union troops from gettysburg and had taken control of the town.
however the north still held positions on cemetery ridge the high ground south of gettysburg.
on july 2 lee ordered general james longstreet to attack cemetery ridge.
at about 4 00 p m longstreet s troops advanced from seminary ridge where they were positioned in a peach orchard and wheat field that stood between them and most of the union army on cemetery ridge.
the confederates repeatedly attacked the union lines.
although the union troops were forced to concede some territory their lines withheld the withering confederate onslaught.
on july 3 lee ordered an artillery barrage on the center of the union lines on cemetery ridge.
for two hours the two armies fired at one another in a vicious exchange that could be heard in pittsburgh.
believing they had silenced the union guns the confederates then charged the lines.
confederate forces marched across the farmland between their position and the union high ground.
suddenly northern artillery renewed its barrage and the infantry fired on the rebels as well.
devastated the confederates staggered back to their lines.
after the battle lee gave up any hopes of invading the north and led his army back to virginia.
the three day battle produced staggering losses 23 000 union men and 28 000 confederates were killed or wounded.
total casualties were more than 30 percent.
despite the devastation northerners were enthusiastic about breaking the charm of robert lee s invincibility.
the gettysburg address in november 1863 a ceremony was held to dedicate a cemetery in gettysburg.
there president lincoln spoke for a little more than two minutes.
according to some contemporary historians lincoln s gettysburg address remade america.
before lincoln s speech people said the united states are afterward they said the united states is in other words the speech helped the country to realize that it was not just a collection of individual states it was one unified nation.
the gettysburg address abraham lincoln four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
we are met on a great battle field of that war.
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
but in a larger sense we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground.
the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here.
it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth the gettysburg address november 19 1863 t 1 history video gettysburg address insn review unit 177 history through photojournalism j mathew bradys photographs the civil war marked the first time in united states history that photography a resource since 1839 played a major role in a military conflict.
hundreds of photographers traveled with the troops working both privately and for the military.
the most famous civil war photographer was mathew brady who employed about 20 photographers to meet the public demand for pictures from the battlefront.
this was the beginning of american news photography or photojournalism.
many of bradys photographs are a mix of realism and artificiality.
due to the primitive level of photographic technology subjects had to be carefully posed and remain still during the long exposure times.
in this 1864 photograph brady posed a kneeling soldier offering a canteen of water beside a wounded soldier with his arm in a sling.

178 chapter 4 the union in peril main idea making inferences why was the union so intent on gaining control of the mississippi river.
grant wins at vicksburg while meade s army of the potomac was destroying confederate hopes in gettysburg union general ulysses s grant fought to take vicksburg one of the two remaining confederate strongholds on the mississippi river.
vicksburg itself was particularly important because it rested on bluffs above the river from which guns could control all water traffic.
in the winter of 1862 1863 grant tried several schemes to reach vicksburg and take it from the confederates.
nothing seemed to work until the spring of 1863.
grant began by weakening the confederate defenses that protected vicksburg.
he sent benjamin grierson to lead his cavalry brigade through the heart of mississippi.
grierson succeeded in destroying rail lines and distracting confederate forces from union infantry working its way toward vicksburg.
grant was able to land his troops south of vicksburg on april 30 and immediately sent his men in search of confederate troops in mississippi.
in 18 days union forces had sacked jackson the capital of the state.
their confidence growing with every victory grant and his troops rushed to vicksburg hoping to take the city while the rebels were reeling from their losses.
grant ordered two frontal attacks on vicksburg neither of which succeeded.
so in the last week of may 1863 grant settled in for a siege.
he set up a steady barrage of artillery shelling the city from both the river and the land for several hours a day forcing the city s residents into caves that they dug out of the yellow clay hillsides.
after food supplies ran so low that people were reduced to eating dogs and mules the confederate command of vicksburg asked grant for terms of surrender.
the city fell on july 4.
five days later port hudson louisiana the last confederate holdout on the mississippi also fell.
the union had achieved another of its major military objectives and the confederacy was cut in two.
mw ii review unit 179 the confederacy wears down the twin defeats at gettysburg and vicksburg cost the south much of its limited manpower.

thereafter he went by the name u s grant.
grant once said of himself a military life had no charms for me yet a military man was what he was destined to be.
he fought in the war with mexico even though he termed it wicked because he believed his duty was to serve his country.
his next post was in the west where grant grew so lonely for his family that he resigned.
when the civil war broke out the illinois governor made grant a colonel of volunteers because george mcclellan had been too busy to see him.
however once grant began fighting in tennessee lincoln was quick to recognize his special strength.
when newspapers demanded grants dismissal after shiloh lincoln replied firmly i cant spare this man.
he fights robert e lee 1807 1870 lee was an aristocrat related to some of virginias leading families.
in fact his father had been one of george washingtons favorite lieutenants and his wife mary ann randolph custis was the great granddaughter of martha washington.
his sense of family honor may have contributed to his allegiance to his state.
as a man who believed slavery was evil lee fought for the confederacy only because of his loyalty to his beloved virginia.
i did only what my duty demanded.
i could have taken no other course without dishonor he said.
as a general lee was tactically brilliant but he seldom challenged confederate civilian leaders about their failure to provide his army with adequate food clothing or weapons.
on the other hand his soldiers almost worshiped him because he never abused them and always insisted on sharing their hardships.
his men called him uncle robert just as the union troops called grant uncle sam.
ly unrealistic however in part because southern morale was weakening.
many confederate soliders had deserted while newspapers state legislatures and individuals throughout the south began to call openly for peace.
worse yet for the confederacy lincoln finally found not just one but two generals who would fight.
total war in march 1864 president lincoln appointed ulysses s grant commander of all union armies.
grant in turn appointed william tecumseh sherman as commander of the military division of the mississippi.
these two appointments would change the course of the war.
old friends and comrades in arms both men believed in waging total war.
they reasoned that it was the strength of the people s will that was keeping the war going.
if the union could destroy the southern population s will to fight the confederacy would collapse.
grant s overall strategy was to decimate lee s army in virginia while sherman raided georgia.
even if his casualties ran twice as high as those of lee and they did the north could afford it the south could not.

the election of 1864 despite the war politics in the union went on as usual.
as the 1864 presidential election approached lincoln faced heavy opposition from the democrats and from a faction within his own party.
a number of northerners were dismayed at the war s length and its high casualty rates.
lincoln was pessimistic about his chances.
i am going to be beaten he said in august and unless some great change takes place badly beaten.
however some great change did take place.
news of general sherman s victories inspired the north and helped lincoln win reelection.
the surrender at appomattox on april 3 1865 union troops conquered richmond the confederate capital.
southerners had abandoned the city the day before setting it afire to keep the northerners from taking it.
on april 9 1865 in a virginia town called appomattox ap a mauaks court house lee and grant met at a private home to arrange a confederate surrender.
at lincoln s request the terms were generous.
grant paroled lee s soldiers and sent them home with their possessions and three days worth of rations.
officers were permitted to keep their side arms.
within a month all remaining confederate resistance collapsed.
after four long years the civil war was over.
the war changes the nation the civil war caused tremendous political economic technological and social change in the united states.
it also exacted a high price in terms of human life.

the term also refers to the process the federal government used to readmit chapter 4 the union in peril vocabulary amnesty a general pardon by a government usually for political offenses the defeated confederate states to the union.
complicating the process was the fact that abraham lincoln andrew johnson and the members of congress all had different ideas about how reconstruction should be handled.
lincoln s plan lincoln made it clear that he favored a lenient reconstruction policy.
in december 1863 lincoln announced his proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction also known as the ten percent plan.
under this plan the government would pardon all confederates except high ranking officials and those accused of crimes against prisoners of war who would swear allegiance to the union.
as soon as ten percent of those who had voted in 1860 took this oath of allegiance a confederate state could form a new state government and send representatives and senators to congress.
under lincoln s terms four states arkansas louisiana tennessee and virginia moved toward readmission to the union.
however lincoln s reconstruction plan angered a minority of republicans in congress known as radical republicans.
the radicals led by senator charles sumner of massachusetts and representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania wanted to destroy the political power of former slaveholders.
most of all they wanted african americans to be given full citizenship and the right to vote.
clearing battlefields of human remains was just one of many tasks facing reconstruction governments.
main idea contrasting how did the views of presidents lincoln and johnson on reconstruction differ from the views of the radical republicans.
johnson s plan for reconstruction lincoln was assassinated before he could fully implement his reconstruction plan.
in may 1865 his successor andrew johnson announced his own plan.
johnson s plan differed little from lincoln s.
the major difference was that johnson tried to break the planters power by excluding high ranking confederates and wealthy southern landowners from taking the oath needed for voting privileges.
however johnson also pardoned more than 13 000 former confederates because he believed that white men alone must manage the south.
aj the seven remaining ex confederate states quickly agreed to johnson s terms.
in the following months these states except for texas set up new state governments and elected representatives to congress.
in december 1865 the newly elected southern legislators arrived in washington to take their seats.
congress however refused to admit the new southern legislators.
at the same time moderate republicans pushed for new laws to remedy weaknesses they saw in johnson s plan.
in 1866 congress voted to enlarge the freedmen s bureau and passed the civil rights act of 1866.
that law gave african americans citizenship and forbade states from passing discriminatory laws black codes that severely restricted african americans lives.
johnson shocked everyone when he vetoed both the freedmen s bureau act and the civil rights act.
congress johnson contended had gone far beyond anything contemplated by the authors of the constitution.
congressional reconstruction angered by johnson s actions radical and moderate republican factions decided to work together to shift the control of the reconstruction process from the executive branch to the legislature.
in mid 1866 they overrode the president s vetoes of the civil rights act and freedmen s bureau act.
in addition congress drafted the fourteenth amendment which prevented states from denying rights and privileges to any u s citizen now defined as all persons born or naturalized in the united states.
this definition was expressly intended to overrule and nullify the dred scott decision.
review unit 185 in the 1866 elections moderate and radical republicans gained control of congress.
they joined together to pass the reconstruction act of 1867 which did not recognize state governments except tennessee formed under the lincoln and johnson plans.
the act divided the former confederate states into five military districts.
the states were required to grant african american men the vote and to ratify the fourteenth amendment in order to reenter the union.
when johnson vetoed the reconstruction legislation congress promptly overrode the veto.
johnson impeached because the radicals thought johnson was blocking reconstruction they looked for grounds on which to impeach him.
they found grounds when johnson removed secretary of war edwin stanton from office in 1868.
johnson s removal of the cabinet member violated the tenure of office act which stated that a president could not remove cabinet officers during the term of the president who had appointed them without the senate s approval.
the house impeached johnson but he remained in office after the senate voted not to convict.
u s grant elected in the 1868 presidential election the civil war hero ulysses s grant won by a margin of only 306 000 votes out of almost 6 million ballots cast.
more than 500 000 southern african americans had voted.
of this number 9 out of 10 voted for grant.
the importance of the african american vote to the republican party was obvious.
after the election the radicals introduced the fifteenth amendment which states that no one can be kept from voting leaders punishment because of race color or previous condition of servitude.
the andrew johnson fifteenth amendment which was ratified by the states in 1870 was an important victory for the radicals.
i say as to the reconstructing society under the congressional reconstruction program state constitutional conventions met and southern voters elected new republican dominated governments.
by 1870 all of the former confederate states had completed the process.
however even after all the states were back in the union the republicans did not end the process of reconstruction because they wanted to make economic changes in the south.
conditions in the postwar south the war had devastated the south economically.
southern planters returned home to find that the value of their property had plummeted.
throughout the south many small farms were ruined.
the region s population was also devastated.
hundreds of thousands of southern men had died in the war.
the republican governments began public works programs to repair the physical damage and to provide social services.
politics in the postwar south another difficulty facing the new republican governments was that the three groups that constituted the republican party in the south scalawags carpetbaggers and african americans often had conflicting goals.
scalawags were white southerners who joined the republican party manv were small farmers who wanted to improve their economic position and did not want the former wealthy planters to regain power.
carpetbaggers were northerners who moved to the south after the war.
this negative name came from the misconception that they arrived with so few belongings that thev car ried everything in small traveling bags made of carpeting y main idea analyzing effects how did the election of 1866 affect the process of reconstruction.

nast created or popularized symbols that have become part of americas visual heritage symbols that include the democratic donkey the republican elephant uncle sam and santa claus.

a carpet bag the third and largest group of southern republicans african americans gained voting rights as a result of the fifteenth amendment.
during reconstruction african american men registered to vote for the first time nine out of ten of them supported the republican party.
although many former slaves could neither read nor write and were politically inexperienced they were eager to exercise their voting rights.
main idea contrasting 5 why did scalawags carpetbaggers and african americans support the republicans.
a personal voice william beverly nash we are not prepared for this suffrage.
but we can learn.
give a man tools and let him commence to use them and in time he will earn a trade.
so it is with voting.
we may not understand it at the start but in time we shall learn to do our duty 99 quoted in the trouble they seen black people tell the story of reconstruction the differing goals of scalawags carpetbaggers and african americans led to a lack of unity in the republican party.
in particular few scalawags shared the republican commitment to civil rights for african americans.
the new status of african americans required fundamental changes in the attitudes of most southern whites.
however many white southerners refused to accept blacks new status and resisted the idea of equal rights q former slaves improve their lives before the civil war african americans had been denied full membership in many churches.
during reconstruction african americans founded their own churches which often became the center of the african american community and the only institutions that african americans fully controlled.
many african american ministers emerged as influential community leaders who also played an important role in the broader political life of the country.
with 95 of former slaves illiterate former slaves required education to become economically self sufficient.
in most of the southern states the first public school systems were established by the reconstruction governments.
the new african american churches aided by missionaries from northern churches and by 6 million from the freedmen s bureau worked to create and run these and other review unit 187 til w7 sfiwot to hiram revels 1822 1901 schools.
atlanta fisk and howard universities for instance were all founded by religious groups such as the american missionary association.
thousands of african americans also took advantage of their new freedom by migrating to reunite with family members or to find jobs in southern towns and cities.
african americans in reconstruction after the war african americans took an active role in the political process.
not only did they vote but for the first time they held office in local state and federal government.
nevertheless even though there were almost as many black citizens as white citizens in the south african american officeholders remained in the minority.
out of 125 southerners elected to the u s congress during congressional reconstruction only 16 were african americans.
among these was hiram revels the first african main idea hiram revels of mississippi pictured above on the far left was born of free parents in fayetteville north carolina.
because he could not obtain an education in the south he attended knox college in illinois.
as an african methodist episcopal minister he recruited african americans to fight for the union during the civil war and also served as an army chaplain.
in 1865 revels settled in mississippi where he helped organize african american schools and churches.
he served on the natchez city council and then was elected to mississippis state senate in 1869.
in 1870 revels became the first african american elected to the u s senate.
land for cash and american senator.
african americans also served in political offices on the state and local levels.
in january 1865 general sherman had promised the former slaves who followed his army 40 acres per family and the use of army mules.
for the most part however former slaves received no land.
most republicans considered private property a basic american right and thus refused to help redistribute it.
as a result many plantation owners in the south retained their land.
sharecropping and tenant farming without their own land freed african americans as well as poor white farmers could not grow crops to sell or to use to feed their families.
therefore economic necessity forced many former slaves and impoverished whites to become sharecroppers.
in the system of sharecropping landowners divided their land and assigned each head of household a few acres along with seed and tools.
sharecroppers kept a small share of their crops and gave the rest to the landowners.
in theory croppers who saved a little might even rent keep all their harvest in a system known as tenant farming.
forming generalizations how did southern african americans respond to their new status.
the collapse of reconstruction most white southerners swallowed whatever resentment they felt over african american suffrage and participation in government.
some whites expressed thei feelings by refusing to register to vote.
others were frustrated by their loss of polit ical power and by the south s economic stagnation.
these were the people wh formed vigilante groups and used violence to intimidate african americans.
opposition to reconstruction the most notorious and widespread of th southern vigilante groups was the ku klux kian kkk.
the kian s goals were t destroy the republican party to throw out the reconstruction governments to ai the planter class and to prevent african americans from exercising their politica rights.
to achieve these goals the kian and other groups killed perhaps 20 001 men women and children.
in addition to violence some white southerner refused to hire or do business with african americans who voted republican.
to curtail kian violence and democratic intimidation congress passed series of enforcement acts in 1870 and 1871.
one act provided for the federa vocabulary vigilante one who takes law enforcement into ones own hands 88 chapter 4 the union in peril main idea summarizing how did southern democrats regain political power.
background the twelfth amendment 1804 gives the house of representatives the power to elect the president if no candidate has a majority of electoral votes.
supervision of elections in southern states.
another act gave the president the power to use federal troops in areas where the kian was active.
although congress seemed to shore up republican power with the enforcement acts it soon passed legislation that severely weakened the power of the republican party in the south.
in may 1872 congress passed the amnesty act which returned the right to vote and the right to hold federal and state offices to about 150 000 former confederates.
in the same year congress allowed the freedmen s bureau to expire.
these actions allowed southern democrats to regain political power.
support for reconstruction fades eventually support for reconstruction weakened.
the breakdown of republican unity made it even harder for the radicals to continue to impose their reconstruction plan on the south.
in addition a series of bank failures known as the panic of 1873 triggered a five year depression which diverted attention in the north away from the south s problems.
the supreme court also began to undo some of the social and political changes that the radicals had made.
although political violence continued in the south and african americans were denied civil and political rights republicans slowly retreated from the policies of reconstruction.
democrats redeem the south as the republicans hold on the south loosened southern democrats began to regain control of the region.
as a result of redemption as the democrats called their return to power and a political deal made during the national election of 1876 congressional reconstruction came to an end.
in the election of 1876 democratic candidate samuel j tilden won the popular vote but was one vote short of the electoral victory.
southern democrats in congress agreed to accept hayes if federal troops were withdrawn from the south.
after republican leaders agreed to the demands hayes was elected and reconstruction ended in the south.
reconstruction ended without much real progress in the battle against discrimination.
however the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments remained part of the constitution.
in the 20th century these amendments provided the necessary constitutional foundation for important civil rights legislation.

the union and the confederacy although originally part of the same country the union and confederacy soon found many differences between them.
twenty three states stayed in the union whereas the confederacy was made up of 11 former states.

the union had many natural resources to help it fight the war while the smaller confederacy contained few factories and fewer sources of food production.

one americans story zitkala sa was born a sioux in 1876.
as she grew up on the great plains she learned the ways of her people.
when zitkala sa was eight years old she was sent to a quaker school in indiana.
though her mother warned her of the white men s lies zitkala sa was not prepared for the loss of dignity and identity she experienced which was symbolized by the cutting of her hair.
a personal voice zitkala sa i cried aloud.
and heard them gnaw off one of my thick braids.
then i lost my spirit.
since the day i was taken from my mother i had suffered extreme indignities.
and now my long hair was shingled like a cowards.
in my anguish i moaned for my mother but no one came.
now i was only one of many little animals driven by a herder.
the school days of an indian girl zitkala sa experienced firsthand the clash of two very different cultures that occurred as ever growing numbers of white settlers moved onto the great plains.
in the resulting struggle the native american way of life was changed forever.
the culture of the plains indians zitkala sa knew very little about the world east of the mississippi river.
most easterners knew equally little about the west picturing a vast desert occupied by savage tribes.
that view could not have been more inaccurate.
in fact distinctive and highly developed native american ways of life existed on the great plains the grassland extending through the west central portion of the united states see map on page 205.
chapter 5 vocabulary coup a feat of bravery performed in battle main idea summarizing how did the horse influence native american life on the great plains.
to the east near the lower missouri river tribes such as the osage and iowa had for more than a century hunted and planted crops and settled in small villages.
farther west nomadic tribes such as the sioux and cheyenne gathered wild foods and hunted buffalo.
peoples of the plains abiding by tribal law traded and produced beautifully crafted tools and clothing.
the horse and the buffalo after the spanish brought horses to new mexico in 1598 the native american way of life began to change.
as the native peoples acquired horses and then guns they were able to travel farther and hunt more efficiently.
by the mid 1700s almost all the tribes on the great plains had left their farms to roam the plains and hunt buffalo.
their increased mobility often led to war when hunters in one tribe trespassed on other tribes hunting grounds.
for the young men of a tribe taking part in war parties and raids was a way to win prestige.
a plains warrior gained honor by killing his enemies as well as by counting coup this practice involved touching a live enemy with a coup stick and escaping unharmed.
and sometimes warring tribes would call a truce so that they could trade goods share news or enjoy harvest festivals.
native americans made tepees from buffalo hides and also used the skins for clothing shoes and blankets.
buffalo meat was dried into jerky or mixed with berries and fat to make a staple food called pemmican.
while the horse gave native americans speed and mobility the buffalo provided many of their basic needs and was central to life on the plains.

young men trained to become hunters and warriors.
the women helped butcher the game and prepared the hides that the men brought back to the camp young women sometimes chose their own husbands.
the plains indian tribes believed that powerful spirits controlled events in the natural world.
men or women who showed particular sensitivity to the spirits became medicine men or women or shamans.
children learned proper behavior and culture through stories and myths games and good examples.
despite their communal way of life however no individual was allowed to dominate the group.
the leaders of a tribe ruled by counsel rather than by force and land was held in common for the use of the whole tribe.
settlers push westward the culture of the white settlers differed in many ways from that of the native americans on the plains.
unlike native americans who believed that land could not be owned the settlers believed that owning land making a mining claim or starting a business would give them a stake in the country.
they argued that the native americans had forfeited their rights to the land because they hadn t settled down to improve it.
concluding that the plains were unsettled migrants streamed westward along railroad and wagon trails to claim the land.
the lure of silver and gold the prospect of striking it rich was one powerful attraction of the west.

fortune seekers of every description including irish german polish chinese and african american men crowded the camps and boomtowns.
a few hardy business minded women tried their luck too working as laundresses freight haulers or miners.
cities such as virginia city nevada and helena montana originated as mining camps on native american land.
the government restricts native americans while allowing more settlers to move westward the arrival of the railroads also influenced the government s policy toward the native americans who lived on the plains.
in 1834 the federal government had passed an act that designated the entire great plains as one enormous reservation or land set aside for native american tribes.
in the 1850s however the government changed its policy and created treaties that defined specific boundaries for each tribe.
most native americans spurned the government treaties and continued to hunt on their traditional lands clashing with settlers and miners with tragic results.
massacre at sand creek one of the most tragic events occurred in 1864.
most of the cheyenne assuming they were under the protection of the u s government had peacefully returned to colorado s sand creek reserve for the winter.
yet general s r curtis u s army commander in the west sent a telegram to militia colonel john chivington that read i want no peace till the indians suffer more in response chivington and his troops descended on the cheyenne and arapaho about 200 warriors and 500 women and children camped at sand creek.

the sioux chief red cloud mahpiua luta had unsuccessfully appealed to the government to end white settlement on the trail.
in december 1866 the warrior crazy horse ambushed captain william j fetterman and his company at lodge trail ridge.
over 80 soldiers were killed.
native americans called this fight the battle of the hundred slain.
whites called it the fetterman massacre.
skirmishes continued until the government agreed to close the bozeman trail.

quoted in bury my heart at wounded knee red river war in late 1868 war broke out yet again as the kiowa and comanche engaged in six years of raiding that finally led to the red river war of 1874 1875.
the u s army responded by herding the people of friendly tribes onto reservations while opening fire on all others.
general philip sheridan a union army veteran gave orders to destroy their villages and ponies to kill and hang all warriors and to bring back all women and children.
with such tactics the army crushed resistance on the southern plains.

main idea analyzing effects what were the results of custers last stand.
z n y around 1870 the government s indian policy changed again.
most government officials and reformers came to support assimilation a plan under which native americans would give up their way of life and become americanized this movement entailed a wholesale attack on native american beliefs and practices starting with tribal identity.
the bureau of indian affairs established boarding schools where native american children were sent to learn about white culture.
d wes act in 1887 congress passed the dawes act a significant step in he americanization process.
the act broke up the reservations and gave some reservation land to individual native americans 160 acres to each head of 6 chapter 5 household and 80 acres to each unmarried adult.
the government would sell the remainder of the reservations to settlers and the resulting income would be used by native americans to buy farm implements.
by 1932 whites had taken about two thirds of the territory that had been set aside for native americans.
in the end the native americans received no money from the sale of these lands.
the destruction of the buffalo perhaps the most significant blow to tribal life on the plains was the destruction of the buffalo.
tourists and fur traders shot buffalo for sport.
u s general sheridan noted with approval that buffalo hunters were destroying the plains indians main source of food clothing shelter and fuel.
in 1800 approximately 65 million buffalo roamed the plains by 1890 fewer than 1000 remained.
in 1900 the united states sheltered in yellowstone national park a single wild herd of buffalo.
the battle of wounded knee the sioux continued to suffer poverty and disease.
in desperation they turned to a paiute prophet who promised that if the sioux performed a ritual called the ghost dance native american lands and way of life would be restored.
the ghost dance movement spread rapidly among the 25 000 sioux on the dakota reservation.

and in the words of soy redthunder another tribe member we look at it as homecoming within minutes the seventh cavalry slaughtered as many as 300 mostly unarmed native americans including several children.
the soldiers left the corpses to freeze on the ground.
this event the battle of wounded knee brought the indian wars and an entire era to a bitter end.
the events of this period changed the demographic composition of the american west.
lured by economic opportunities and supported by government policies that sought to move native americans onto reservations and to convince them to abandon their traditional culture new settlers seeking a better life moved in and took over these lands.
as you can see on the map on page 205 the land occupied by native americans decreased dramatically.
for the most part they were replaced by individuals from three major groups white americans from the east african americans from the south and immigrants.
cattle becomes big business as the great herds of buffalo disappeared and native americans were forced onto smaller and less desirable reserver ations horses and cattle flourished on the plains.
as cattle ranchers opened up the great plains to big business ranching from texas to kansas became a profitable investment.
vaqueros and cowboys american settlers had never managed large herds on the open range and they learned from their mexican neighbors how to round up rope brand and care for the animals.
the animals themselves the texas longhorns were sturdy short tempered breeds accustomed to the dry grasslands of southern spain.
spanish settlers raised longhorns for food and brought horses to use as work animals and for transportation.
as american as the cowboy seems today his way of life stemmed directly from that of those first spanish ranchers in mexico.
the cowboy s clothes food and vocabulary were heavily influenced by the mexican vaquero who was the first to wear spurs which he attached with straps to his bare feet and used to control his horse.
his chaparreras or leather overalls became known as chaps.
he ate charqui or jerky dried strips of meat.
the spanish bronco caballo or rough horse that ran wild became known as a bronco or bronc.

in his skills dress and speech the mexican vaquero was the true forerunner of the american buckaroo or cowboy.
despite the plentiful herds of western cattle cowboys were not in great demand until the railroads reached the great plains.
before the civil war ranchers for the most part didn t stray far from their homesteads with their cattle.
there were of course some exceptions.
during the california gold rush in 1849 some hardy cattlemen on horseback braved a long trek or drive through apache territory and across the desert to collect 25 to 125 a head for their cattle.
in 1854 two ranchers drove their cattle 700 miles to muncie indiana where they put them on stock cars bound for new york city.
when the cattle were unloaded in new york the stampede that followed caused a panic on third avenue.
parts of the country were not ready for the mass transportation of animals.
growing demand for beef after the civil war the demand for beef skyrocketed partly due to the rapidly growing cities.
the chicago union stock yards opened in 1865 and by spring 1866 the railroads were running regularly through sedalia missouri.
from sedalia texas ranchers could ship their cattle to chicago and markets throughout the east.
they found however that the route to sedalia presented several obstacles including thunderstorms and rain swollen rivers.
also in 1866 farmers angry about trampled crops blockaded cattle in baxter springs kansas preventing them from reaching sedalia.
some herds then had to be sold at cut rate prices others died of starvation.
jp the cow town the next year cattlemen found a more convenient route.
illinois cattle dealer joseph mccoy approached several western towns with plans to create a shipping yard where the trails and rail lines came together.
the tiny kansas town of abilene enthusiastically agreed to the plan.
mccoy built cattle pens a three story hotel and helped survey the chisholm trail the major cattle route from san antonio texas through oklahoma to kansas.
thirty five thousand head of cattle were shipped out of the yard in abilene during its first history video wild west cattle drive no w 90w 209 history through stampeded by lightning 1908 painter and sculptor frederic remington is best known for his romantic and spirited depictions of the western frontier.
remington liked to paint in a single dominant color.
native americans cowboys at work and other familiar western scenes were all subjects of remingtons work.
what do you learn about the work of the cowboy in this painting.
year in operation.
the following year business more than doubled to 75 000 head.
soon ranchers were hiring cowboys to drive their cattle to abilene.
within a few years the chisholm trail had worn wide and deep.
1 a day in the life of a cowboy the meeting of the chisholm trail and the railroad in abilene ushered in the heyday of the cowboy.
as many as 55 000 worked the plains between 1866 and 1885.
although folklore and postcards depicted the cowboy as anglo american about 25 percent of them were african american and at least 12 percent were mexican.
the romanticized american cowboy of myth rode the open range herding cattle and fighting villains.
meanwhile the real life cowboy was doing nonstop work.
a days work a cowboy worked 10 to 14 hours a day on a ranch and 14 or more on the trail alert at all times for dangers that might harm or upset the herds.
some cowboys were as young as 15 most were broken down by the time they were 40.
a cowboy might own his saddle but his trail horse usually belonged to his boss.
he was an expert rider and roper.
his gun might be used to protect the herd from wild or diseased animals rather than to hurt or chase outlaws.
roundup the cowboy s season began with a spring roundup in which he and other hands from the ranch herded all the longhorns they could find on the open range into a large corral.
they kept the herd penned there for several days until the cattle were so hungry that they preferred grazing to running away.
then the cowboys sorted through the herd claiming the cattle that were marked with the brand of their ranch and calves that still needed to be branded.
after the herd was gathered and branded the trail boss chose a crew for the long drive.
the long drive this overland transport or long drive of the animals often lasted about three months.
a typical drive included one cowboy for every 250 to 300 head of cattle a cook who also drove the chuck wagon and set up camp and a wrangler who cared for the extra horses.
a trail boss earned 100 or more a month for supervising the drive and negotiating with settlers and native americans chapter 5 main idea comparing how did the cowboys life differ from the myth about it.
during the long drive the cowboy was in the saddle from dawn to dusk.
he slept on the ground and bathed in rivers.
he risked death and loss every day of the drive especially at river crossings where cattle often hesitated and were swept away.
because lightning was a constant danger cowboys piled their spurs buckles and other metal objects at the edge of their camp to avoid attracting lightning bolts.
thunder or even a sneeze could cause a stampede.
3 legends of the west legendary figures like james butler wild bill hickok and martha jane burke calamity jane actually never dealt with cows.
hickok served as a scout and a spy during the civil war and later as a marshal in abilene kansas.
he was a violent man who was shot and killed while holding a pair of aces and a pair of eights in a poker game a hand still known as the dead man s hand.
calamity jane was an expert sharpshooter who dressed as a man.
she may have been a scout for colonel george custer.
the wild west show in the 1880s william f cody toured the country with a show called buffalo bills wild west.
the show featured trick riding and roping exhibitions.
it thrilled audiences with mock battles between cowboys and indians.
wild bill hickok annie oakley calamity jane shown here and even sitting bull toured in wild west shows.
their performances helped make western life a part of american mythology.
the end of the open range almost as quickly as cattle herds multiplied and ranching became big business the cattle frontier met its end.
overgrazing of the land extended bad weather and the invention of barbed wire were largely responsible.
between 1883 and 1887 alternating patterns of dry summers and harsh winters wiped out whole herds.
most ranchers then turned to smaller herds of high grade stock that would yield more meat per animal.
ranchers fenced the land with barbed wire invented by illinois farmer joseph f glidden.
it was cheap and easy to use and helped to turn the open plains into a series of fenced in ranches.
the era of the wide open west was over.

changes on the western frontier 211 geography spotlight the klondike gold rush gold.
shouted the headline of the seattle post intelligencer on july 17 1897.
a huge gold strike had been made along the klondike river in canada s remote yukon territory near the alaska border.
soon gold was discovered on the alaska side of the border as well.
as word reached seattle and spread the lure of gold inspired thousands of people to rush to the west.
over the next year about 100 000 americans stampeded to the klondike in search of fortune.
the region s physical geography and its human geographic factors such as communication and transportation networks human environment interaction and economic development had a significant impact on the klondike gold rush.

in july 1897 the steamer portland docked in seattle with a group of successful klondike gold miners and their riches aboard.
newspapers and telegraphs carried word of their success around the world.
about 10 000 seattle residents headed for alaska to try their luck.
people from elsewhere began to flock to seattle hoping to make it north to the goldfields before winter.
from seattle there were two main routes one mostly by water through the bering sea to the yukon river and one primarily over land involving a boat to skagwav alaska followed by a trek along the dyea trail over chilkoot pass or the white pass trail over white pass.
unfortunately the water route was expensive so many mfoers were forced to use the grueling overland routes.
the trip was long cold and difficult.
for examse at a certain point the dyea trail became too steep for pack animals and miners had to lug their supplies up a steep snow staircase often making several trips.
conditions were arsh and starvation malnutrition and exposure to cold were serious problems manv gave up and several died.

human environment interaction miners efforts to reach the klondike goldfields were further complicated by the supplies they had to bring with them.
canadian officials required that miners bring enough provisions for a year or nearly a ton of goods.
prospectors brought groceries clothing hardware tents and sleds.
prospectors made slow progress on their journeys north having to move a years worth of supplies over rough terrain.
the image at left shows men with their supplies preparing to tackle chilkoot pass around 1898.
those who reached the goldfields still had to deal with the issue of how to find and extract gold.
some gold could be found in creeks but most was in the soil around the creeks.
in the winter miners used fires to heat the frozen ground which allowed them to haul out mounds of frozen gravel.
then during the summer they would shovel the gravel into a sluice a trough through which water flowed and the water would carry off lightweight materials leaving the gold to sink to the bottom.
the mother and son prospecting team shown above are using a sluice in fairbanks alaska.
economic development and population shifts unfortunately the odds of striking it rich were not good as the graphic above shows.
most of the prospectors who reached the klondike came away disappointed.
the best gold bearing creeks had already been claimed and the reports of gold for the taking had been greatly exaggerated.
the greatest economic impact was on the towns in the region.
for instance as many as three fourths of the prospectors passed through seattle and the money from the supplies they purchased there boosted the economy considerably.
cities also developed near the goldfields.

when esther clark hill was a girl on the kansas prairie in the 1800s her father often left the family to go on hunting or trading expeditions.
his trips left esther s mother aliena clark alone on the farm.
esther remembered her mother holding on to the reins of a runaway mule team her black hair tumbling out of its pins and over her shoulders her face set and white while one small girl clung with chattering teeth to the sides of the rocking wagon.
the men in the settlement spoke admiringly about leny s nerve and esther thought that daily life presented a challenge even greater than driving a runaway team.
a personal voice esther clark hill i think as much courage as it took to hang onto the reins that day it took more to live twenty four hours at a time month in and out on the lonely and lovely prairie without giving up to the loneliness.
quoted in pioneer women as the railroads penetrated the frontier and the days of the free ranging cowboy ended hundreds of thousands of families migrated west lured by vast tracts of cheap fertile land.
in their effort to establish a new life they endured extreme hardships and loneliness.
plains settlers like this woman depicted in harvey dunns painting pioneer woman had to be strong and self reliant.
settlers move westward to farm it took over 250 years from the first settlement at jamestown until 1870 to turn 400 million acres of forests and prairies into flourishing farms.
settling the second 400 million acres took only 30 years from 1870 to 1900.
human geographic factors such as federal land policy and the completion of transcontinental railroad lines made this rapid settlement possible.

dollars for laying track in the west.
in one grant both the union pacific and the central pacific received 10 square miles of public land for every mile of track laid in a state and 20 square miles of land for every mile of track laid in a territory.
in the 1860s the two companies began a race to lay track.
the central pacific moved eastward from sacramento and the union pacific moved westward from omaha.
civil war veterans irish and chinese immigrants african americans and mexican americans did most of the grueling labor.
in late 1868 workers for the union pacific cut their way through the solid rock of the mountains laying up to eight miles of track a day.
both companies had reached utah by the spring of 1869.
fifteen years later the country boasted five transcontinental railroads.
the rails to the east and west coasts were forever linked.
the railroad companies sold some of their land to farmers for two to ten dollars an acre.
some companies successfully sent agents to europe to recruit buyers.
by 1880 44 percent of the settlers in nebraska and more than 70 percent of those in minnesota and wisconsin were immigrants.
y government support for settlement another powerful attraction of the west was the land itself.
in 1862 congress passed the homestead act offering 160 acres of land free to any citizen or intended citizen who was head of the household.
from 1862 to 1900 up to 600 000 families took advantage of the government s offer.
several thousand settlers were exodusters african americans who moved from the post reconstruction south to kansas.
despite the massive response by homesteaders or settlers on this free land private speculators and railroad and state government agents sometimes used the law for their own gain.
cattlemen fenced open lands while miners and woodcutters claimed national resources.
only about 10 percent of the land was actually settled by the families for whom it was intended.
in addition not all plots of land were of equal value.
although 160 acres could provide a decent living in the fertile soil of iowa or minnesota settlers on drier western land required larger plots to make farming worthwhile.
eventually the government strengthened the homestead act and passed more legislation to encourage settlers.
in 1889 a major land giveaway in what is now oklahoma attracted thousands of people.
in less than a day land hungry settlers claimed 2 million acres in a massive land rush.
some took possession of the land before the government officially declared it open.
because these settlers claimed land sooner than they were supposed to oklahoma came to be known as the sooner state.

the closing of the frontier these federal policies provided significant economic incentives that changed the country forever as settlers gobbled up western land.
the transcontinental railroad made it easier than ever for settlers to reach points further west.
it also presented a source of land as railroads sold their federal allotments to settlers.
the homestead act with its offer of free land also had a huge economic impact as nearly 2 million people applied for claims.
for decades the u s census bureau had monitored the extent of american settlement.
the frontier according to the bureau existed at the point where the population totaled fewer than 2 people per square mile.
in 1890 the census bureau declared that the country no longer had a continuous frontier line the frontier no longer existed.
to many the frontier was what had made america unique.
in an 1893 essay entitled the significance of the frontier in american history the historian frederick jackson turner agreed.
a personal voice frederick jackson turner american social development has been continually beginning over again on the frontier.
this perennial rebirth this fluidity of american life this expansion westward with its new opportunities its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society furnish the forces dominating american character.
the significance of the frontier in american history today many historians question turner s view.
they think he gave too much importance to the frontier in the nation s development and in shaping a special american character.
settlers meet the challenges of the plains while the physical geography of the plains included the fertile land that lured settlers it also caused extreme hardships such as droughts floods fires blizzards and locust plagues.
still settlers found ways to adapt and the number of people living west of the mississippi river grew from 1 to almost 30 percent of the nation s population between 1850 and 1900.
dugouts and soddies since trees were scarce most settlers built their homes from the land itself.
many pioneers dug their homes into the sides of ravines or small hills.
a stovepipe jutting from the ground was often the only clear sign of such a dugout home.
those who moved to the broad flat plains often made freestanding houses by stacking blocks of prairie turf.
like a dugout a sod home or soddy was warm in a pioneer family stands in front of their soddy near coburg nebraska in 1887.

soddies were small however and offered little light or air.
they were havens for snakes insects and other pests.
although they were fireproof they leaked continuously when it rained.
womens work virtually alone on the flat endless prairie homesteaders had to be almost superhumanly self sufficient.
women often worked beside the men in the fields plowing the land and planting and harvesting the predominant crop wheat.
they sheared the sheep and carded wool to make clothes for their families.
they hauled water from wells that they had helped to dig and made soap and candles from tallow.
at harvest time they canned fruits and vegetables.
they were skilled in doctoring from snakebites to crushed limbs.
women also sponsored schools and churches in an effort to build strong communities.
technical support for farmers establishing a homestead was challenging.
once accomplished it was farming the prairie year in and year out that became an overwhelming task.
in 1837 john deere had invented a steel plow that could slice through heavy soil.
in 1847 cyrus mccormick began to mass produce a reaping machine.
but a mass market for these devices didn t fully develop until the late 1800s with the migration of farmers onto the plains.
other new and improved devices made farm work speedier the spring tooth harrow to prepare the soil 1869 the grain drill to plant the seed 1841 barbed wire to fence the land 1874 and the corn binder 1878.
then came a reaper that could cut and thresh wheat in one pass.
by 1890 there were more than 900 manufacturers of farm equipment.
in 1830 producing a bushel of grain took about 183 minutes.
by 1900 with the use of these machines it took only 10 minutes.
these inventions made more grain available for a wider market.
agricultural education the federal government supported farmers by financing agricultural education.
the morrill act of 1862 and 1890 gave federal land to the states to help finance agricultural colleges and the hatch act of 1887 established agricultural experiment stations to inform farmers of new developments.
agricultural researchers developed grains for arid soil and techniques for dry farming which helped the land to retain moisture.

changes on the western frontier 217 bonanza farms like this one required the labor of hundreds of farm hands and horses.
farmers in debt elaborate machinery was expensive and farmers often had to borrow money to buy it.
when prices for wheat were higher farmers could usually repay their loans.
when wheat prices fell however farmers needed to raise more crops to make ends meet.
this situation gave rise to a new type of farming in the late 1870s.
railroad companies and investors created bonanza farms enormous single crop spreads of 15 000 50 000 acres.
the cass cheney dalrymple farm near cassleton north dakota for example covered 24 square miles.
by 1900 the average farmer had nearly 150 acres under cultivation.
some farmers mortgaged their land to buy more property and as farms grew bigger so did farmers debts.
between 1885 and 1890 much of the plains experienced drought and the large single crop operations couldn t compete with smaller farms which could be more flexible in the crops they grew.
the bonanza farms slowly folded into bankruptcy.
farmers also felt pressure from the rising cost of shipping grain.
railroads charged western farmers a higher fee than they did farmers in the east.
also the railroads sometimes charged more for short hauls for which there was no competing transportation than for long hauls.
the railroads claimed that they were merely doing business but farmers resented being taken advantage of.
no other system of taxation has borne as heavily on the people as those extortions and inequalities of railroad charges wrote henry demarest lloyd in an article in the march 1881 edition of atlantic monthly.
many farmers found themselves growing as much grain as they could grow on as much land as they could acquire which resulted in going further into debt.
but they were not defeated by these conditions.
instead these challenging conditions drew farmers together in a common cause.

lease joked that her tongue was loose at both ends and hung on a swivel but her golden voice and deep blue eyes hypnotized her listeners.

quoted in the populist uprising farmers had endured great hardships in helping to transform the plains from the great american desert into the breadbasket of the nation yet every year they reaped less and less of the bounty they had sowed with their sweat.
farmers unite to address common problems in the late 1800s many farmers were trapped in a vicious economic cycle.
prices for crops were falling and farmers often mortgaged their farms so that they could buy more land and produce more crops.
good farming land was becoming scarce though and banks were foreclosing on the mortgages of increasing numbers of farmers who couldn t make payments on their loans.
moreover the railroads were taking advantage of farmers by charging excessive prices for shipping and storage.

changes on the western frontier 219 analyzing political cartoons j the plight of the farmers farmers were particularly hard hit in the decades leading to the financial panic of 1893.
they regarded big business interests as insurmountable enemies who were bringing them to their knees and leaving them with debts at every turn.
this cartoon is a warning of the dangers confronting not only the farmers but the entire nation.
skillbuilder analyzing political cartoons 1.
how does this cartoon depict the plight of the farmers.
2 who does the cartoonist suggest is responsible for the farmers plight.
economic distress the troubles of the farmers were part of a larger economic problem affecting the entire nation.
during the civil war the united states had issued almost 500 million in paper money called greenbacks.
greenbacks could not be exchanged for silver or gold money.
they were worth less than hard money of the same face value.
hard money included both coins and paper money printed in yellow ink that could be exchanged for gold.
after the war the government began to take the greenbacks out of circulation.
retiring the greenbacks caused some discontent.
it increased the value of the money that stayed in circulation.
it meant that farmers who had borrowed money had to pay back their loans in dollars that were worth more than the dollars they had borrowed.
at the same time they were receiving less money for their crops.
between 1867 and 1887 for example the price of a bushel of wheat fell from 2 00 to 68 cents.
in effect farmers lost money at every turn.
throughout the 1870s the farmers and other debtors pushed the government to issue more money into circulation.
those tactics failed although the bland allison act of 1878 required the government to buy and coin at least 2 million to 4 million worth of silver each month.
it wasn t enough to support the increase in the money supply that the farmers wanted.
problems with the railroads meanwhile farmers paid outrageously high prices to transport grain.
lack of competition among the railroads meant that it might cost more to ship grain from the dakotas to minneapolis by rail than from chicago to england by boat.
also railroads made secret agreements with middlemen grain brokers and merchants that allowed the railroads to control grain storage prices and to influence the market price of crops.
many farmers mortgaged their farms for credit with which to buy seed and supplies.
suppliers charged high rates of interest sometimes charging more for items bought on credit than they did for cash purchases.
farmers got caught in a cycle of credit that meant longer hours and more debt every year.

120 chapter 5 vocabulary regulate to control or direct according to a rule or law husbandry an organization for farmers that became popularly known as the grange.
its original purpose was to provide a social outlet and an educational forum for isolated farm families.
by the 1870s however grange members spent most of their time and energy fighting the railroads.
the grange s battle plan included teaching its members how to organize how to set up farmers cooperatives and how to sponsor state legislation to regulate railroads.
the grange gave rise to other organizations such as farmers alliances.
these groups included many others who sympathized with farmers.
alliances sent lecturers from town to town to educate people about topics such as lower interest rates on loans and government control over railroads and banks.
spellbinding speakers such as mary elizabeth lease helped get the message across.
membership grew to more than 4 million mostly in the south and the west.
the southern alliance made up of white southern farmers was the largest.
about 250 000 african americans belonged to the colored farmers national alliance.
some alliance members promoted cooperation between black and white alliances but most members accepted the separation of the organizations.
historical spotlight the colored farmers national alliance a white baptist missionary r m humphrey organized the colored farmers national alliance in 1886 in houston texas.
like their counterparts in the white alliances members of the local colored farmers alliances promoted cooperative buying and selling.
unlike white organizations however the black alliances had to work mostly in secret to avoid racially motivated violence at the hands of angry landowners and suppliers.
the rise and fall of populism main idea summarizing q what was the populist party platform.
leaders of the alliance movement realized that to make far reaching changes they would need to build a base of political power.
populism the movement of the people was born with the founding of the populist or people s party in 1892.
on july 2 1892 a populist party convention in omaha nebraska demanded reforms to lift the burden of debt from farmers and other workers and to give the people a greater voice in their government.
the populist party platform the economic reforms proposed by the populists included an increase in the money supply which would produce a rise in prices received for goods and services a graduated income tax and a federal loan program.
the proposed governmental reforms included the election of u s senators by popular vote single terms for the president and the vice president and a secret ballot to end vote fraud.
finally the populists called for an eight hour workday and restrictions on immigration.
the proposed changes were so attractive to struggling farmers and desperate laborers that in 1892 the populist presidential candidate won almost 10 percent of the total vote.
in the west the people s party elected five senators three governors and about 1 500 state legislators.
the populists programs eventually became the platform of the democratic party and kept alive the concept that the government is responsible for reforming social injustices.
the panic of 1893 during the 1880s farmers were overextended with debts and loans.
railroad construction had expanded faster than markets.
in february 1893 the philadelphia and reading railroad went bankrupt followed by the erie the northern pacific the union pacific and the santa fe.
the government s gold supply had worn thin partly due to its obligation to purchase silver.
people panicked and traded paper money for gold.
the panic also spread to wall street where the prices of stocks fell rapidly.
the price of silver then plunged causing silver mines to close.
by the end of the year over 15 000 businesses and 500 banks had collapsed.
changes on the western frontier 221 yi v player william jennings bryan 1860 1925 william jennings bryan might be considered a patron saint of lost causes largely because he let beliefs not politics guide his actions.
he resigned his position as secretary of state 1913 1915 under woodrow wilson for example to protest the presidents movement away from neutrality regarding the war in europe.
near the end of his life he went to tennessee to assist the prosecution in the scopes monkey trial contesting the teaching of evolution in public schools.
he is perhaps best characterized by a quote from his own cross of gold speech the humblest citizen in all the land when clad in the armor of a righteous cause is stronger than all the hosts of error investments declined and consumer purchases wages and prices also fell.
panic deepened into depression as 3 million people lost their jobs.
by december 1894 a fifth of the work force was unemployed.
many farm families suffered both hunger and unemployment.
silver or gold populists watched as the two major political parties became deeply divided in a struggle between different regions and economic interests.
business owners and bankers of the industrialized northeast were republicans the farmers and laborers of the agrarian south and west were democrats.
the central issue of the campaign was which metal would be the basis of the nation s monetary system.
on one side were the silverites who favored bimetallism a monetary system in which the government would give citizens either gold or silver in exchange for paper currency or checks.
on the other side were president cleveland and the gold bugs who favored the gold standard backing dollars solely with gold.
the backing of currency was an important campaign issue because people regarded paper money as worthless if it could not be turned in for gold or silver.
because silver was more plentiful than gold backing currency with both metals as the silverites advocated would make more currency with less value per dollar available.
supporters of bimetallism hoped that this measure would stimulate the stagnant economy.
retaining the gold standard would provide a more stable but expensive currency.
bryan and the cross of gold stepping into the debate the populist party called for bimetallism and free coinage of silver.
yet their strategy was undecided should they join forces with sympathetic candidates in the major parties and risk losing their political identity or should they nominate their own candidates and risk losing the election.
as the 1896 campaign progressed the republican party stated its firm commitment to the gold standard and nominated ohioan william mckinley for president.
after much debate the democratic party came out in favor of a combined gold and silver standard including unlimited coinage of silver.
at the democratic convention former nebraska congressman william jennings bryan editor of the omaha world herald delivered an impassioned address to the assembled main idea analyzing causes what caused the panic of 1893.

222 chapter 5 main idea analyzing issues why was the metal that backed paper currency such an important issue in the 1896 presidential campaign.
an excerpt of what has become known as the cross of gold speech follows.
a personal voice william jennings bryan having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world supported by the commercial interests the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.
democratic convention speech chicago july 8 1896 bryan won the democratic nomination.
when the populist convention met two weeks later the delegates were both pleased and frustrated.
they liked bryan and the democratic platform but they detested the democratic vice presidential candidate maine banker arthur sewall.
nor did they like giving up their identity as a party.
they compromised by endorsing bryan nominating their own candidate thomas watson of georgia for vice president and keeping their party organization intact.
the end of populism bryan faced a difficult campaign.
his free silver stand had led gold bug democrats to nominate their own candidate.
it also weakened his support in cities where consumers feared inflation because it would make goods more expensive.
in addition bryan s meager funds could not match the millions backing mckinley.
bryan tried to make up for lack of funds by campaigning in 27 states and sometimes making 20 speeches a day.
mckinley on the other hand campaigned from his front porch while thousands of well known people toured the country speaking on his behalf.
mckinley got approximately 7 million votes and bryan about 6 5 million.
as expected mckinley carried the east while bryan carried the south and the farm vote of the middle west.
the voters of the industrial middle west with their fear of inflation brought mckinley into office.
with mckinley s election populism collapsed burying the hopes of the farmers.
the movement left two powerful legacies however a message that the downtrodden could organize and have political impact and an agenda of reforms many of which would be enacted in the 20th century.

those who could not venture there in person enjoyed reading about the west in colorful tales by writers such as mark twain samuel clemens and bret harte.
dime novels cheaply bound adventure stories that sold for a dime were also enormously popular in the second half of the 19th century.

one day pattillo higgins noticed bubbles in the springs around spindletop a hill near beaumont in southeastern texas.
this and other signs convinced him that oil was underground.
if higgins found oil it could serve as a fuel source around which a vibrant industrial city would develop.
higgins who had been a mechanic and a lumber merchant couldn t convince geologists or investors that oil was present but he didn t give up.
a magazine ad seeking investors got one response from captain anthony f lucas an experienced prospector who also believed that there was oil at spindletop.
when other investors were slow to send money higgins kept his faith not only in spindletop but in lucas.
a personal voice pattillo higgins captain lucas.
these experts come and tell you this or that cant happen because it has never happened before.

pattillo higgins quoted in spindletop in 1900 the two men found investors and they began to drill that autumn.

mw the brooklyn bridge connecting brooklyn to the island of manhattan in new york city opened in 1883.
it took 14 years to build.
each day laborers descended to work in a caisson or watertight chamber that took them deep beneath the east river.
e f farrington a mechanic who worked on the bridge described the working conditions.
a personal voice e f farrington 66 inside the caisson everything wore an unreal weird appearance.
there was a confused sensation in the head.
what with the flaming lights the deep shadows the confusing noise of hammers drills and chains the half naked forms flitting about.
one might if of a poetic temperament get a realizing sense of dantes inferno.
quoted in the great bridge in 1883 new yorkers celebrated the opening of the worlds longest suspension bridge the 1 595 foot long brooklyn bridge.
four years later trains ran across the bridge 24 hours a day and carried more than 30 million travelers each year.
technology and city life engineering innovations such as the brooklyn bridge laid the groundwork for modern american life.
cities in every industrial area of the country expanded both outward and upward.
in 1870 only 25 american cities had populations of 50 000 or more by 1890 58 cities could make that claim.
by the turn of the 20th century due to the increasing number of industrial jobs four out of ten americans made their homes in cities.
in response to these changes technological advances began to meet the nation s needs for communication transportation and space.
one remedy for more urban space was to build toward the sky.
276 chapter 8 j main idea analyzing causes how did new technologies make the building of skyscrapers practical.
summarizing how did electric transit impact urban life.
vocabulary promenade a public place for walking skyscrapers architects were able to design taller buildings because of two factors the invention of elevators and the development of internal steel skeletons to bear the weight of buildings.
in 1890 1891 architect louis sullivan designed the ten story wainwright building in st louis.
he called the new breed of skyscraper a proud and soaring thing the tall building s appearance was graceful because its steel framework supported both floors and walls.
the skyscraper became america s greatest contribution to architecture a new thing under the sun according to the architect frank lloyd wright who studied under sullivan.
skyscrapers solved the practical problem of how to make the best use of limited and expensive space.
the unusual form of another skyscraper the flatiron building seemed perfect for its location at one of new york s busiest intersections.
daniel burnham designed this slender 285 foot tower in 1902.
the flatiron building and other new buildings served as symbols of a rich and optimistic society.
electric transit as skyscrapers expanded upward changes in transportation allowed cities to spread outward.
before the civil war horses had drawn the earliest streetcars over iron rails embedded in city streets.
in some cities during the 1870s and 1880s underground moving cables powered streetcar lines.
electricity however transformed urban transportation.
in 1888 richmond virginia became the first american city to electrify its urban transit.
other cities followed.
by the turn of the twentieth century intricate networks of electric streetcars also called trolley cars ran from outlying neighborhoods to downtown offices and department stores.
new railroad lines also fed the growth of suburbs allowing residents to commute to downtown jobs.
new york s northern suburbs alone supplied 100 000 commuters each day to the central business district.
a few large cities moved their streetcars far above street level creating elevated or el trains.
other cities like new york built subways by moving their rail lines underground.
these streetcars elevated trains and subways enabled cities to annex suburban developments that mushroomed along the advancing transportation routes.
s engineering and urban planning steel cable suspension bridges like the brooklyn bridge also brought cities sections closer together.
sometimes these bridges provided recreational opportunities.
in his design for the brooklyn bridge for example john augustus roebling provided an elevated promenade whose principal use will be to allow people of leisure and old and young invalids to promenade over the bridge on fine days.
this need for open spaces in the midst of crowded commercial cities inspired the emerging science of urban planning.
city planners sought to restore a measure of serenity to the environment by designing recreational areas.
landscape architect frederick law olmsted spearheaded the movement for planned urban parks.
in 1857 olmsted along with english born architect calvert vaux helped draw up a plan for greensward which was selected to become central park in new york city.
olmsted envisioned the park as a rustic haven in the center of the busy city.
the finished park featured boating and the flatiron building shown here under construction stands at the intersection of fifth avenue and 23rd street in new york city.
hn jiii jin vr nonij tennis facilities a zoo and bicycle paths.
olmsted hoped that the park s beauty would soothe the city s inhabitants and let them enjoy a natural setting.
a personal voice frederick law olmsted the main object and justification of the park is simply to produce a certain influence in the minds of people and through this to make life in the city healthier and happier.
the character of this influence is to be produced by means of scenes through observation of which the mind may be more or less lifted out of moods and habits.
quoted in frederick law olmsted s new york in the 1870s olmsted planned landscaping for washington d c and st louis.
he also drew the initial designs for the emerald necklace boston s parks system.
boston s back bay area originally a 450 acre swamp was drained and developed by urban planners into an area of elegant streets and cultural attractions including olmsted s parks.
city planning by contrast chicago with its explosive growth from 30 000 people in 1850 to 300 000 in 1870 represented a nightmare of unregulated expansion.
fortunately for the city a local architect daniel burnham was intrigued history through architecture the chicago plan this map from daniel burnhams original plan of chicago looks deceptively like an ordinary map today.
but at the time it was almost revolutionary in its vision and it inspired city planners all over the country.
qchicagos lakefront first burnham designed the white city to host the 1893 worlds columbian exposition.
his greatest legacy to chicago may have been his idea for a lakefront park system complete with beaches playing fields and playgrounds.

rl is a 1 71 neighborhood parks though not all cities could claim a lakefront vista for recreation most cities sprinkled neighborhood parks where their residents needed them.
urban planners provided for local parks such as lincoln park in chicago so that the sweet breath of plant life would be available to everyone.
bb0e0s5f ii j i r vi x qharbors for cities on the great lakes the shipping business depended on accessible harbors.
burnham saw the advantage of harbors for recreation and commercial purposes but he advocated moving the harbors away from the central business districts to free space for public use.
the civic center burnham redesigned the street pattern to create a group of long streets that would converge on a grand plaza a practice reflected in other american cities.
the convergence of major thoroughfares at a city s center helped create a unified city from a host of neighborhoods.

178 chapter 8 j main idea summarizing q list three major changes in cities near the turn of the century.
what effect did each have.
vocabulary internal combustion engine an engine in which fuel is burned within the engine rather than in an external furnace by the prospect of remaking the city.
his motto was make no little plans.
they have no magic to stir men s blood.
he oversaw the transformation of a swampy area near lake michigan into a glistening white city for chicago s 1893 world s columbian exposition.
majestic exhibition halls statues the first ferris wheel and a lagoon greeted more than 21 million visitors who came to the city.
many urban planners saw in burnham s white city glorious visions of future cities.
burnham however left chicago an even more important legacy an overall plan for the city crowned by elegant parks strung along lake michigan.
as a result chicago s lakefront today features curving banks of grass and sandy beaches instead of a jumbled mass of piers and warehouses.
new technologies new developments in communication brought the nation closer together.
in addition to a railroad network that now spanned the nation advances in printing aviation and photography helped to speed the transfer of information.
a revolution in printing by 1890 the literacy rate in the united states had risen to nearly 90 percent.
publishers turned out ever increasing numbers of books magazines and newspapers to meet the growing demand of the reading public.
a series of technological advances in printing aided their efforts.
american mills began to produce huge quantities of cheap paper from wood pulp.
the new paper proved durable enough to withstand high speed presses.
the electrically powered web perfecting press for example printed on both sides of a continuous paper roll rather than on just one side.
it then cut folded and counted the pages as they came down the line.
faster production and lower costs made newspapers and magazines more affordable.
people could now buy newspapers for a penny a copy.
airplanes in the early 20th century brothers orville and wilbur wright bicycle manufacturers from dayton ohio experimented with new engines powerful enough to keep heavier than air craft aloft.
first the wright brothers built a glider.
then they commissioned a four cylinder internal combustion engine chose a propeller and designed a biplane with a 40 4 wingspan.
their first successful flight on december 17 1903 at kitty hawk north carolina covered 120 feet and lasted 12 seconds.
orville later described the take off.

the garden city urban planning in the united states had european counterparts.
in tomorrow a peaceful path to social reform 1898 for example the british city planner ebenezer howard wrote of a planned residential community called a garden city.
howard wanted to combine the benefits of urban life with easy access to nature.
his city plan was based on concentric circles with a town at the center and a wide circle of rural land on the perimeter.
the town center included a garden concert hall museum theater library and hospital.
the circle around the town center included a park a shopping center a conservatory a residential area and industry.
six wide avenues radiated out from the town center.
in 1903 letchworth england served as the model for howards garden city.

life at the turn of the 20th century 279 technology early airplane engines and their weights aviation pioneers in 1892 orville and wilbur wright opened a bicycle shop in dayton ohio.
they used the profits to fund experiments in aeronautics the construction of aircraft.
in 1903 the wright brothers took a gasoline powered airplane that they had designed to a sandy hill outside kitty hawk north carolina.
the airplane was powered by a 4 cylinder 12 horse power piston engine designed and constructed by the bicycle shops mechanic charles taylor.
the piston a solid cylinder fit snugly into a hollow cylinder that moves back and forth under pressure was standard until jet propelled aircraft came into service in the 1940s.

280 chapter 8 8 within two years the wright brothers had increased their flights to 24 miles.
by 1920 convinced of the great potential of flight the u s government had established the first transcontinental airmail service.
photography explosion before the 1880s photography was a professional activity.
because of the time required to take a picture and the weight of the equipment a photographer could not shoot a moving object.
in addition photographers had to develop their shots immediately.
new techniques eliminated the need to develop pictures right away.
george eastman developed a series of more convenient alternatives to the heavy glass plates previously used.
now instead of carrying their darkrooms around with them photographers could use flexible film coated with gelatin emulsions and could send their film to a studio for processing.
when professional photographers were slow to begin using the new film eastman decided to aim his product at the masses.
in 1888 eastman introduced his kodak camera.
the purchase price of 25 included a 100 picture roll of film.
after taking the pictures the photographer would send the camera back to eastman s rochester new york factory.
for 10 the pictures were developed and returned with the camera reloaded.
easily held and operated the kodak prompted millions of americans to become amateur photographers.
the camera also helped to create the field of photojournalism.
reporters could now photograph events as they occurred.
when the wright brothers first flew their simple airplane at kitty hawk an amateur photographer captured the first successful flight on film.
george eastman 1854 1932 in 1877 when george eastman took up photography as a hobby he had to lug more than 100 pounds of equipment for one day s outing.
to lighten his load he replaced heavy glass plates with film that could be rolled onto a spool.
in 1888 eastman sold his first roll film camera.

william torrey harris was an educational reformer who saw the public schools as a great instrument to lift all classes of people into.
civilized life.
as u s commissioner of education from 1889 to 1906 harris promoted the ideas of great educators like horace mann and john dewey particularly the belief that schools exist for the children and not the teachers.
schools according to harris should properly prepare students for full participation in community life.
a personal voice william torrey harris every educational method must be looked at from two points of view first its capacity to secure the development of rationality or of the true adjustment of the individual to the social whole and second its capacity to strengthen the individuality of the pupil and avoid the danger of obliterating the personality of the child by securing blind obedience in place of intelligent cooperation and by mechanical memorizing in place of rational insight.
quoted in public schools and moral education e b.
du bois niagara movement many other middle class reformers agreed with harris and viewed the public compulsory schools as training grounds for employment and citizenship.
people believed that attendance laws economic development depended on scientific and technological knowledge.
as though slow to be a result they viewed education as a key to greater security and social status enforced helped others saw the public schools as the best opportunity to assimilate the millions m class ooms of immigrants entering american society.
most people also believed that public the turn education was necessary for a stable and prosperous democratic nation.
cen expanding public education although most states had established public schools by the civil war many school age children still received no formal schooling.
the majority of students who went to school left within four years and few went to high school 82 chapter 8 i main idea drawing conclusions why did american children begin attending school at a younger age.
schools for children between 1865 and 1895 states passed laws requiring 12 to 16 weeks annually of school attendance by students between the ages of 8 and 14.
the curriculum emphasized reading writing and arithmetic.
however the emphasis on rote memorization and the uneven quality of teachers drew criticism.
strict rules and physical punishment made many students miserable.
one 13 year old boy explained to a chicago school inspector why he hid in a warehouse basement instead of going to school.
a personal voice they hits ye if yer dont learn and they hits ye if ye whisper and they hits ye if ye have string in yer pocket and they hits ye if yer seat squeaks and they hits ye if ye dont stan up in time and they hits ye if yer late and they hits ye if ye fer get the page.
anonymous schoolboy quoted in the one best system in spite of such problems children began attending school at a younger age.
kindergartens which had been created outside the public school system to offer childcare for employed mothers became increasingly popular.
the number of kindergartens surged from 200 in 1880 to 3 000 in 1900 and under the guidance of william torrey harris public school systems began to add kindergartens to their programs.
although the pattern in public education in this era was one of growth opportunities differed sharply for white and black students.
in 1880 about 62 percent of white children attended elementary school compared to about 34 percent of african american children.
not until the 1940s would public school education become available to the majority of black children living in the south.
the growth of high schools in the new industrial age the economy demanded advanced technical and managerial skills.
moreover business leaders like andrew carnegie pointed out that keeping workers loyal to capitalism required society to provide ladders upon which the aspiring can rise.
by early 1900 more than half a million students attended high school.
the curriculum expanded to include courses in science civics and social studies.
and new vocational courses prepared male graduates for industrial jobs in drafting carpentry and mechanics and female graduates for office work.

by 1910 about 3 percent of african americans between the ages of 15 and 19 attended high school but a majority of these students still attended private schools.
education for immigrants unlike african americans immigrants were encouraged to go to school.
of the nearly 10 million european immigrants settled in the united states between 1860 and 1890 many were jewish people fleeing poverty and systematic oppression in eastern europe.
most immigrants sent their children to america s free public schools where they quickly became americanized years after she became a citizen the russian jewish immigrant mary antin recalled the large numbers of non english speaking immigrant children.
by the end of the school year they could recite patriotic verses in honor of george washington and abraham lincoln.
with plenty of enthusiasm some people resented the suppression of their native languages in favor of english.
catholics were especially concerned because many public school systems had mandatory readings from the protestant king james version of the bible.
catholic communities often set up parochial schools to give their children a catholic education.
thousands of adult immigrants attended night school to learn english and to qualify for american citizenship.
employers often offered daytime programs to americanize their workers.
at his model t plant in highland park michigan henry ford established a sociology department because men of many nations must be taught american ways the english language and the right way to live ford s ideas were not universally accepted.

at the same time an even smaller minority only 2 3 percent of america s young people attended colleges and universities.
changes in universities between 1880 and 1920 college enrollments more than quadrupled.

du bois the first african american to receive a doctorate from harvard in 1895 strongly disagreed with washington s gradual approach.
in 1905 du bois founded the niagara movement which insisted that blacks should seek a liberal arts education so that the african american community would have well educated leaders.
du bois proposed that a group of educated blacks the most talented tenth of the community attempt to achieve immediate inclusion into mainstream american life.
we are americans not only by birth and by citizenship du bois argued but by our political ideals and the greatest of those ideals is that all men are created equal.
by the turn of the 20th century millions of people received the education they needed to cope with a rapidly changing world.

african americans were not the only group to experience violence and racial discrimination.
native americans mexican residents and chinese immigrants also encountered bitter forms of oppression particularly in the american west.
african americans fight legal discrimination as african americans exercised their newly won political and social rights during reconstruction they faced hostile and often violent opposition from whites.
african americans eventually fell victim to laws restricting their civil rights but never stopped fighting for equality.
for at least ten years after the end of reconstruction in 1877 african americans in the south continued to vote and occasionally to hold political office.
by the turn of the 20th century however southern states had adopted a broad system of legal policies of racial discrimination and devised methods to weaken african american political power.
286 chapter 8 voting restrictions all southern states imposed new voting restrictions and denied legal equality to african americans.
some states for example limited the vote to people who could read and required registration officials to administer a literacy test to test reading.
blacks trying to vote were often asked more difficult questions than whites or given a test in a foreign language.
officials could pass or fail applicants as they wished.
another requirement was the poll tax an annual tax that had to be paid before qualifying to vote.
black as well as white sharecroppers were often too poor to pay the poll tax.
to reinstate white voters who may have failed the literacy test or could not pay the poll tax several southern states added the grandfather clause to their constitutions.
the clause stated that even if a man failed the literacy test or could not afford the poll tax he was still entitled to vote if he his father or his grandfather had been eligible to vote before january 1 1867.
the date is important because before that time freed slaves did not have the right to vote.
the grandfather clause therefore did not allow them to vote.

jim crow laws during the 1870s and 1880s the supreme court failed to overturn the poll tax or the grandfather clause even though the laws undermined all federal protections for african americans civil rights.
at the same time that blacks lost voting rights southern states passed racial segregation laws to separate white and black people in public and private facilities.
these laws came to be known as jim crow laws after a popular old minstrel song that ended in the words jump jim crow.
racial segregation was put into effect in schools hospitals parks and transportation systems throughout the south.
plessy v ferguson eventually a legal case reached the u s supreme court to test the constitutionality of segregation.
in 1896 in plessy v ferguson the supreme court ruled that the separation of races in public accommodations was legal and did not violate the fourteenth amendment.
the decision established the doctrine of separate but equal which allowed states to maintain segregated facilities for blacks and whites as long as they provided equal service.
the decision permitted legalized racial segregation for almost 60 years.
see plessy v ferguson page 290.
a turn of the century race relations african americans faced not only formal discrimination but also informal rules and customs called racial etiquette that regulated relationships between whites and blacks.
usually these customs belittled and humiliated african americans enforcing their second class status.
for example blacks and whites never shook hands since shaking hands would have implied equality.
blacks also had to yield the sidewalk to white pedestrians and black men always had to remove their hats for whites.

in all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress 9 9 atlanta exposition address 1895 washington hoped that improving the economic skills of african americans would pave the way for long term gains.
people like ida b.
wells and w e b.
du bois however thought that the problems of inequality were too urgent to postpone.
violence african americans and others who did not follow the racial etiquette could face severe punishment or death.
all too often blacks who were accused of violating the etiquette were lynched.
between 1882 and 1892 more than 1 400 african american men and women were shot burned or hanged without trial in the south.
lynching peaked in the 1880s and 1890s but continued well into the 20th century.
discrimination in the north most african americans lived in the segregated south but by 1900 a number of blacks had moved to northern cities.
many blacks migrated to northern cities in search of better paying jobs and social equality.
but after their arrival african americans found that there was racial discrimination in the north as well.
african americans found themselves forced into segregated neighborhoods.
they also faced discrimination in the workplace.
labor unions often discouraged black membership and employers hired african american labor only as a last resort and fired blacks before white employees.
sometimes the competition between african americans and working class whites became violent as in the new york city race riot of 1900.
violence erupted after a young black man believing that his wife was being mistreated by a white policeman killed the policeman.
word of the killing spread and whites retaliated by attacking blacks.
northern blacks however were not alone in facing discrimination.
non whites in the west also faced oppression.
discrimination in the west historical spotlight washington vs du bois booker t washington argued for a gradual approach to racial equality suggesting that it is at the bottom of life we must begin and not at the top ten years later w e b.

vocabulary peon a worker bound in servitude to a landlord creditor mexicans were accustomed to the region s hot dry climate.
but the work was grueling and the railroads made them work for less money than other ethnic groups.
mexicans were also vital to the development of mining and agriculture in the southwest.
when the 1902 national reclamation act gave government assistance for irrigation projects many southwest desert areas bloomed.
mexican workers became the major labor force in the agricultural industries of the region.
some mexicans however as well as african americans in the southwest were forced into debt peonage a system that bound laborers into slavery in order to work off a debt to the employer.
not until 1911 did the supreme court declare involuntary peonage a violation of the thirteenth amendment.
excluding the chinese by 1880 more than 100 000 chinese immigrants lived in the united states.
white people s fear of job competition with the chinese immigrants often pushed the chinese into segregated schools and neighborhoods.
strong opposition to chinese immigration developed and not only in the west.
see chinese exclusion act page 259.
racial discrimination posed terrible legal and economic problems for nonwhites throughout the united states at the turn of the century.

he was arrested tried and convicted in the district court of new orleans for breaking louisiana s segregation law.
plessy appealed claiming that he had been denied equal protection under the law.
the supreme court handed down its decision on may 18 1896.
the ruling the court ruled that separate but equal facilities for blacks and whites did not violate the constitution.
legal reasoning plessy claimed that segregation violated his right to equal protection under the law.
moreover he claimed that being of mixed descent he was entitled to every recog nition right privilege and immunity secured to the citizens of the united states of the white race.
justice henry b.
brown writing for the majority ruled the object of the fourteenth amendment was.
undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law but it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color or to enforce social as distinguished from political equality or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.
laws permitting and even requiring their separation in places where they are liable to be brought into contact do not necessarily imply the inferiority of either race to the other 99 in truth segregation laws did perpetrate an unequal and inferior status for african americans.
justice john marshall harlan understood this fact and dissented from the majority opinion.
he wrote in justice john marshall harlan respect of civil rights all citizens are equal before the law.

cumming v board of education of richmond county 1899 the court ruled that the federal government cannot prevent segregation in local school facilities because education is a local not federal issue.
chapter 8 i i white colored one result of jim crow laws was separate drinking fountains for whites and african americans.
why it mattered in the decades following the civil war 1861 1865 southern state legislatures passed laws that aimed to limit civil rights for african americans.
the black codes of the 1860s and later jim crow laws were intended to deprive african americans of their newly won political and social rights granted during reconstruction.
plessy was one of several supreme court cases brought by african americans to protect their rights against segregation.
in these cases the court regularly ignored the fourteenth amendment and upheld state laws that denied blacks their rights.
plessy was the most important of these cases because the court used it to establish the separate but equal doctrine.
as a result city and state governments across the south and in some other states maintained their segregation laws for more than half of the 20th century.
these laws limited african americans access to most public facilities including restaurants schools and hospitals.
without exception the facilities reserved for whites were superior to those reserved for nonwhites.
signs reading colored only and whites only served as constant reminders that facilities in segregated societies were separate but not equal.
historical impact it took many decades to abolish legal segregation.
during the first half of the 20th century the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp led the legal fight to overturn plessy.
although they won a few cases over the years it was not until 1954 in brown v board of education that the court overturned any part of plessy.
in that case the supreme court said that separate but equal was unconstitutional in public education but it did not completely overturn the separate but equal doctrine.
in later years the court did overturn the separate but equal doctrine and it used the brown decision to do so.
for example in 1955 rosa parks was convicted for violating a montgomery alabama law for segregated seating on buses.
a federal court overturned the conviction finding such segregation unconstitutional.
the case was appealed to the supreme court which upheld without comment the lower court s decision.
in doing so in this and similar cases the court signaled that the reasoning behind plessy no longer applied.
as secretary of the montgomery chapter of the naacp rosa parks had protested segregation through everyday acts long before sepember 1955.

dime novels typically told glorified adventure tales of the west and featured heroes like edward wheeler s deadwood dick.
wheeler published his first deadwood dick novel in 1877 and in less than a decade produced over 30 more.
some readers wanted a more realistic portrayal of american life.

urban shopping growing city populations made promising targets for enterprising merchants.
the nation s earliest form of a shopping center opened in cleveland ohio in 1890.
the glass topped arcade contained four levels of jewelry leather goods and stationery shops.
the arcade also provided band music on sundays so that cleveland residents could spend their sunday afternoons strolling through the elegant environment and gazing at the window displays.
retail shopping districts formed where public transportation could easily bring shoppers from outlying areas.
to anchor these retail shopping districts ambitious merchants started something quite new the modern department store.

i one third of the population of the south is of the negro race.
no enterprise seeking the material civil or moral welfare of this section can disregard this element of our population and reach the highest success to those of my race who depend on bettering their condition in a foreign land or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly relations.
with the southern white man who is their next door neighbor i would say cast down your bucket where you are cast it down in making friends in every manly way of the people of all races whom we are surrounded no race can prosper till it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.
it is at the bottom of life we must begin and not at the top.
nor should we permit our grievances to overshadow our opportunities.
to those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the south were i permitted i would repeat what i say to my own race.
cast down your bucket where you are.
cast it down among the 8 000 000 negroes whose habits you know whose loyalty and love you have tested in days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your firesides.
casting down your bucket among my people helping and encouraging them as you are doing on these grounds and to education of head hand and heart you will find that they will buy your s surplus land make blossom the waste places in your fields and run your.
while doing this you can be sure in the future as you have been in i the past that you and your families will be surrounded by the most patient faithful law abiding and unresentful people that the world has seen in i all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.
