702 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction few owners however willingly freed their slaves until forced to by the arrival of union soldiers.
a north carolina planter pledged that he and other whites will never get along with the free negroes because they were an inferior race similarly a mississippi planter predicted that these niggers will all be slaves again in twelve months at wars end in the spring of 1865 henry adams left the louisiana plantation where he had been enslaved to see whether i am free by going without a pass a group of whites confronted him on the road asked his owners name and beat him when he declared that i now belong to no one some newly freed slaves rushed to give themselves new names to symbolize their changed status.
others left plantations and farms for towns and cities where as one of them said freedom was free er the ratification of the thirteenth amendment to the u s constitution in december 1865 was intended to end all doubt about the status of former slaves by abolishing slavery everywhere.
now the nation faced the huge task of reconstructing and reuniting a war ravaged south while transforming ex slaves into free workers and equal citizens.
it would not be easy.
freedom did not bring independence or s elf reliance for millions of former slaves.
at the same time many white southerners resented and resisted efforts to reconstruct their region.
as a south carolina planter told a federal official in the fall of 1865 the war is not over during the reconstruction era from 1865 to 1877 political leaders wrestled with how best to bring the confederate states back into the union and how best to help former slaves make the transition from bondage to citizenship.
those turbulent years witnessed a complex debate about the role of the federal government in ensuring civil rights.
some northerners wanted the former confederate states returned to the union with little or no changes in their social political and economic life.
others called for former confederate political and military leaders to be imprisoned or executed and the south rebuilt in the image of the rest of the nation.
the editors of the nations most popular magazine harpers weekly expressed this vengeful attitude when they declared that the forgive and forget policy.
is mere political insanity and suicide although the reconstruction era lasted only twelve years it was one of the most significant periods in u s history.
at the center of the debate over how best to restore the union were questions of continuing significance who is deserving of citizenship and what does it entail.
what rights should all americans enjoy.
what role should the federal government play in ensuring freedom and equality.
those questions are still shaping american life nearly 150 years later.
the wars aftermath in the south 703 the wars aftermath in the south the postwar south presented a sharp contrast to the victorious north where the economy had been strengthened by the war efforts.
between 1860 and 1870 northern wealth grew by 50 percent while southern wealth dropped 60 percent.
along the path that general william tecumseh shermans union army had blazed across georgia and the carolinas one observer reported in 1866 the countryside looked for many miles like a broad black streak of ruin and desolation burned out columbia south carolina said another witness was a wilderness of ruins charleston the birthplace of secession had become a place of vacant houses of widowed women of rotting wharves of deserted warehouses of weed wild gardens of miles of grass grown streets of acres of pitiful and voiceless barrenness throughout the south property values had collapsed.

amanda worthington a planters wife from mississippi saw her whole world destroyed.
in the fall of 1865 she assessed the damage none of us can realize that we are no longer w ealthy yet thanks to the yankees the cause of all unhappiness such is the case union soldiers who fanned out across the defeated south to impose order were cursed and spat upon.
a virginia woman expressed a spirited defiance common among her circle of confederate friends every day every hour that i live increases my hatred and detestation and loathing of that race.
they yankees disgrace our common humanity.
as a people i consider them vastly inferior to the better classes of our slaves fervent southern nationalists both men and women implanted in their children a similar hatred of yankees and a defiance of northern rule.
one mother said that she trained her children to fear god love the south and live to avenge her many of the largest southern cities richmond atlanta charleston were in ruins most southern railroads were damaged or destroyed.
cotton that had not been destroyed by invading union armies was now seized by federal troops.
emancipation had eliminated 4 billion invested in slaves and left the agricultural economy in confusion.
it would take decades before farm production regained its p re war levels.
in 1860 just before the war began the south generated 30 percent of the nations wealth in 1870 only ten years later it produced but 12 percent.
many southerners were homeless and hungry emotionally exhausted and physically disabled.
lives had been shattered literally.
countless families had lost sons and husbands and many surviving war veterans returned home with one or more limbs missing.
in 1866 the state of mississippi spent a fifth of its annual budget on artificial limbs for confederate soldiers.
confederate general braxton bragg returned to his once prosperous alabama home to find all all was lost except my debts rebuilding the former confederacy would not be easy and the issues related to reconstruction were often complicated and controversial.
for example the process of forming new state governments required first determining the official status of the states that had seceded were they now conquered territories.
if so then the constitution assigned congress authority to r e create their state governments.
but what if as abraham lincoln had argued the confederate states had never officially left the union because the act of secession was itself illegal.
in that circumstance the president would be responsible for re forming state governments.
whichever branch of government congress or the presidency directed the reconstruction of the south it would have to address the most difficult debates over political r econstruction 705 issue what would be the political social and economic status of the freed slaves.
were they citizens.
if not what was their status as americans.
what the freed slaves wanted most was to become s elf reliant as soon as possible.
that meant being able to control their labor reunite with their family members gain education for their children enjoy full participation in political life and create their own community organizations and social life.
many whites were just as determined to prevent that from happening.
debates over political r econstruction the reconstruction of former confederate states actually began during the war and went through several phases the first of which was presidential reconstruction.
in 1862 with union forces advancing into the south president lincoln had named army generals to serve as temporary military governors for conquered confederate areas.
by the end of 1863 he had formulated a plan to reestablish governments in states liberated from confederate rule.
lincolns plan in late 1863 president lincoln issued a proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction under which any confederate state could recreate a union government once a number equal to 10 percent of those who had voted in 1860 swore allegiance to the constitution.
they also received a presidential pardon acquitting them of treason.
certain groups however were denied pardons confederate government officials senior officers of the confederate army and navy judges congressmen and military officers of the united states who had left their posts to aid the rebellion and those who had abused captured african american soldiers.
congressional plans a few conservative and most moderate republicans supported lincolns program that immediately restored pro union southern governments.
however the radical republicans argued that congress not the president should supervise reconstruction.
the radical republicans favored a drastic transformation of southern society that would grant e x slaves full citizenship rights.
many radicals motivated primarily by religious values and moral ideals believed that all people regardless of race were equal in gods eyes.
they wanted no compromise with the sin of racism.
the radicals also hoped to replace the white democratic planter elite with a new generation of small farmers along with wage earning and middle class 706 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction republicans.
the middling classes who own the soil and work it with their own hands explained radical leader thaddeus stevens are the main support of every free government the wade davis bill in 1864 with the war still raging the radical republicans tried to take charge of reconstruction by passing the w ade davis bill sponsored by senator benjamin franklin wade of ohio and representative henry winter davis of maryland.
unlike lincolns 10 percent plan the wade davis bill required that a majority of white males swear their allegiance to the union before a confederate state could be readmitted.
but the wade davis bill never became law lincoln vetoed it as being too harsh.
in retaliation republicans issued the wade davis manifesto which accused lincoln of exceeding his constitutional authority.
unfazed lincoln moved ahead with his efforts to restore the confederate states to the union.
he also acted boldly to provide assistance to the freed slaves in the south.
the freedmens bureau in early 1865 congress approved the thirteenth amendment to the constitution officially abolishing slavery in the united states.
the amendment and the war that enabled it liberated 4 million slaves.
yet what did freedom mean for the former slaves most of whom had no land no home no food no jobs and no education.
throughout the major northern cities people had formed freedmens aid societies to raise funds and recruit volunteers to help the african americans in the south.
many churches did the same.
but the needs far exceeded such grassroots efforts.
it soon fell to the federal government to address the desperate plight of the former slaves.
on march 3 1865 congress created the freedmens bureau within the war department to assist the freedmen and their wives and children it was the first federal experiment in providing assistance directly to people rather than to states.
in may 1865 general oliver o howard commissioner of the freedmens bureau declared that freed slaves must be free to choose their own employers and be paid for their labor he sent agents to the south to negotiate labor contracts between blacks and white landowners many of whom resisted.
the bureau also provided the former slaves with medical care and food and clothing and also helped set up schools.
by 1870 the bureau was supervising nearly 4 000 new schools serving almost 250 000 students many of whose teachers were initially women volunteers from the north.
the freedmens bureau also helped former slaves reconnect with family members.
marriages that had been prohibited during slavery were now made legal.
debates over political r econstruction 707 freedmens school in virginia throughout the former confederate states the freedmens bureau set up schools for former slaves such as this one.
freed slaves and land a few northerners argued that what the ex slaves needed most was their own land.
a new englander traveling in the postwar south noted that the sole ambition of the freedman was.
to become the owner of a little piece of land there to erect a humble home and to dwell in peace and security at his own free will and pleasure in coastal south carolina and in mississippi former slaves had been given land by union armies that had taken control of confederate areas during the war.
even northern abolitionists balked at radical proposals to confiscate white owned land and distribute it to the freed slaves however.
citizenship and legal rights were one thing wholesale confiscation of property and land redistribution quite another.
nonetheless the discussions fueled false rumors that freed slaves everywhere would get forty acres and a mule a slogan that swept across the south.
ulysses s grant still general in chief of the u s army reported that the mistaken belief among the freed slaves that they would receive their own farmland was seriously interfering with their willingness to sign labor contracts agreeing to work as farmhands for pay.
in july 1865 hundreds of freed slaves gathered near an old church on st helena island off the south carolina coast.
there v irginia born freeman 708 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction martin delaney the highest ranking officer in the u s.
colored troops addressed them.
before the civil war he had been a prominent abolitionist in the north.
now major delaney assured the gathering that slavery had indeed been absolutely abolished but abolition he stressed was less the result of abraham lincolns leadership than it was the outcome of former slaves and free blacks like him deciding to resist and undermine the confederacy.
slavery was dead and freedom was now in their hands.
yes yes yes his listeners shouted.
major martin delaney delaney urged delaney then noted that many of former slaves to achieve economic s elf sufficiency by accepting paying jobs the white planters in the area claimed from whites.
that the former slaves were lazy and have not the intelligence to get on for yourselves without being guided and driven to the work by white overseers delaney dismissed such assumptions as lies intended to restore a system of forced labor for blacks.
he then told the freed slaves that their best hope was to become s elf sustaining farmers get a community and get all the lands you can if you cannot get any singly then grow as much vegetables etc as you want for your families on the other part of land you cultivate rice and cotton they must find ways to become economically self reliant he stressed.
otherwise they would find themselves slaves again.
several white planters attended delaneys talk and an army officer at the scene reported that they listened with horror depicted in their faces when de laney urged the former slaves to become independent farmers.
the planters predicted that such speeches would incite open rebellion among southern blacks.
wage slavery the intensity of racial prejudice in the south often thwarted the efforts of freedmens bureau agents as well as federal troops to protect and assist the former slaves.
in late june 1865 for example a white planter in the lowcountry of south carolina near charleston signed a contract with s ixty five of his former slaves calling for them to attend cultivate his fields according to the usual system of planting rice provision lands and to conform to all reasonable rules regulations as may be prescribed by the debates over political r econstruction 709 white owner.
in exchange the workers would receive half of the crop raised after having deducted the seed of rice corn peas potatoes any workers who violated the terms of the contract could be evicted from the plantation leaving them jobless and homeless.
a federal army officer who witnessed the contract reported that he expected more trouble on this place than any other on the river another officer objected to the contracts provision that the owner could require workers to cut wood or dig ditches without compensation.
but most worrisome was that the contract essentially enslaved the workers because no matter how much they are abused they cannot leave without permission of the owner if they chose to leave they would forfeit any right to a portion of the crop.
across the former confederacy it was evident that the former white economic elite was determined to continue to control and constrain african americans.
death of a president the possibility of a lenient federal reconstruction of the confederacy would die with abraham lincoln.
the president offered his last view of reconstruction in the final speech of his life.
on april 11 1865 he rejected calls by radicals for a vengeful peace.
he wanted no persecution no bloody work no hangings of confederate leaders and no extreme efforts to restructure southern social and economic life.
three days later on april 14 abraham lincoln and his wife mary went to see a play at fords theatre in washington d c with his trusted bodyguard called away to richmond lincoln was defenseless as john wilkes booth a popular actor and a rabid confederate slipped into the unguarded presidential box and shot the president in the head.
lincoln booth claimed was the cause of all the nations troubles and god had directed him to kill the president.
as the mortally wounded lincoln slumped forward booth stabbed a military aide and jumped from the box to the stage breaking his leg in the process.
booth limped out a stage door mounted a waiting horse and fled the city.
lincoln died nine hours later.
at the same time that booth was shooting the president other confederate assassins were hunting vice president andrew johnson and secretary of state william h seward.
johnson escaped injury because his w ould be assassin got drunk in the bar of the vice presidents hotel.
seward and four others including his son however suffered severe knife wounds when attacked at home.
the nation extracted a full measure of vengeance from the conspirators.
after a desperate eleven day manhunt soldiers and deputies pursued booth into virginia.
he was starving and despairing he wrote in his diary nursing a broken leg while being hunted like a dog booths pursuers finally found 710 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction and killed him at sunrise in a burning barn.
three of his collaborators were convicted by a military court and hanged as was mary surratt who owned the washington boardinghouse where the assassinations had been planned.
some people celebrated lincolns death.
theyve shot abe lincoln a massachusetts democrat shouted.
hes dead and im glad hes dead a republican congressman from indiana reported that the presidents death is a god send to the radicals.
most felt otherwise however.
the outpouring of grief after lincolns death was overwhelming.
planned events celebrating victory were canceled.
even a richmond virginia newspaper called the assassination the heaviest blow which has fallen on the people of the south confederate president jefferson davis fleeing federal troops learned about lincolns murder in charlotte north carolina.
he too worried that the assassination would be disastrous for our people general ulysses s grant observed that the fallen president was incontestably the greatest man i ever knew lincolns body lay in state for several days in washington d c before being transported 1 600 miles by train on april 21 for burial in springfield illinois.
in philadelphia 300 000 mourners paid their last respects in new york city 500 000 people viewed lincolns body.
on may 4 lincoln was laid to rest for eternity.
johnsons paying respect the only photograph of lincoln in his coffin displayed here in new yorks city hall rotunda.
plan lincolns shocking death propelled into the white house andrew johnson of tennessee a pro union democrat who was the only senator from a seceding state to remain in washington.
he had been added to lincolns national union ticket in 1864 solely to help the president win reelection.
humorless and insecure combative and obstinate johnson nursed fierce prejudices he hated both the white southern elite and the idea of racial equality.
he also had a weakness for liquor.
at the inaugural ceremonies in early 1865 he had delivered his v ice presidential address in a state of slurring drunkenness.
like lincoln and his hero andrew jackson johnson was a self made man.
debates over political r econstruction 711 born in poverty in raleigh north carolina he never attended school.
at age thirteen he relocated to greeneville in the mountains of east tennessee where he was apprenticed to a tailor who helped him learn to read.
eventually as the self proclaimed friend of the common man he served as the mayor a state legislator governor congressional representative and u s senator.
johnsons supporters were primarily small farmers and the working poor.
he called himself a jacksonian democrat in the strictest meaning of the term.
i am for putting down the confederate rebellion because it is a war of wealthy plantation owners against democracy he had long disliked the planter elite whom he damned as a pampered bloated corrupted aristocracy johnson however hated african americans too.
he shared the racist attitudes of most southern whites rich and poor.
damn the negroes he exclaimed to a friend during the war.
i am fighting those traitorous aristocrats their masters johnson maintained that white men alone must manage the south as a states rights democrat he also strongly opposed republican economic policies designed to spur industrial development.
and he also insisted that the federal government should be as small and inactive as possible.
with congress in recess johnson was temporarily in control of what he called the restoration of the union.
he needed to put his plan in place over the next seven months before the new congress convened and the radical republicans would take charge.
in may 1865 johnson issued a new proclamation of amnesty that excluded not only those e x confederates whom lincoln had barred from a presidential pardon but also anyone with property worth more than 20 000.
johnson also wanted to prosecute robert e lee and other high ranking confederate officers for treason.
he finally backed down when ulysses s grant threatened to resign if the president persisted in his efforts to put lee and others on trial.
johnson was determined to keep the wealthiest southerners from regain ing political power.
surprisingly however he eventually pardoned most andrew johnson a pro union of the white aristocrats he claimed democrat from tennessee.
to despise.
what brought about this 712 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction change of heart.
johnson had decided that he could buy the political support of prominent southerners by pardoning them improving his chances of reelection.
johnsons restoration plan included the appointment of a unionist as provisional governor in each southern state a position with the authority to call a convention of men elected by loyal that is not confederate voters.
his plan required that each state convention ratify the thirteenth amendment ending slavery before the state could be readmitted to the union.
johnson also encouraged the conventions to give a few blacks voting rights especially those with some education or with military service so as to disarm the republican radicals who are wild upon giving all african americans the right to vote.
except for mississippi each state of the former confederacy held a convention that met johnsons requirements but ignored his suggestion about voting rights for blacks.
the radicals rebel johnsons initial assault on the southern planter elite won him the support of the radical republicans but not for long.
many radicals who wanted reconstruction to provide social and political equality for blacks were infuriated by johnsons efforts to bring the south back into the union as quickly as possible.
the iron willed thaddeus stevens viewed the confederate states as conquered provinces to be readmitted to the union by the u s congress not the president.
president johnson however balked at such an expansion of federal authority.
he was committed to the states rights to control their affairs.
white men alone must manage the south johnson told a visitor.
by the end of 1865 the radical republicans had gained a majority in congress and were warring with andrew johnson over the control of reconstruction.
on december 4 1865 the president announced that the south had been restored to the union.
the final step in reconstruction he added would be for congress to admit the newly elected southern representatives to the house and senate.
republicans however were not about to welcome back former confederate leaders who had been elected to congress.
georgia for example had elected alexander stephens former vice president of the confederacy.
across the south four confederate generals eight colonels six confederate cabinet members and several confederate legislators were also elected to congress.
outraged republicans denied seats to all such rebel officials and appointed a congressional committee to develop a new plan to reconstruct the south.
johnson versus the radicals president johnson started a war with congress over reconstruction when he vetoed a bill that renewed debates over political r econstruction 713 funding for the freedmens bureau and allowed the federal agency to begin providing homesteads and schools to former slaves in the south as well as the border states.
thaddeus stevens and other radicals realized that johnson and the democrats were trying to redefine the civil war as a conflict between states rights and federal power not a struggle over slavery.
in mid march 1866 the radical led congress passed the pathbreaking civil rights act which announced that all persons born in the united states except indians were citizens entitled to full and equal benefit of all laws the new legislation enraged johnson.
congress he fumed had no authority to grant citizenship to lazy former slaves who did not deserve it and he argued that the civil rights act discriminated against the white race so he vetoed both bills.
now it was the republicans turn to be infuriated.
in april 1866 congress overrode johnsons vetoes.
from that point on johnson a stubborn uncompromising loner steadily lost both public and political support.
soon thereafter in the spring and summer of 1866 rampaging white vig ilantes and policemen in the south many of them former confederate soldiers murdered and wounded hundreds of african americans during riots in memphis and new orleans.
we are going to shoot down all these god damned niggers a white policeman threatened.
a memphis newspaper glorified the killing of african americans the negroes now know to their sorrow that it is best not to arouse the fury of the white man northerners were incensed.
the massacres radical republicans argued resulted from andrew johnsons lenient policy toward white supremacists.
witness memphis witness new orleans.
slavery is dead.

rights protections to blacks.
714 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction black codes the violence directed against southern blacks was partly triggered by african american protests over restrictive laws being passed by the new all white southern state legislatures in 1865 and 1866.
these black codes as a white southerner explained were intended to make sure the ex slave was not a free man he was a free negro a northerner visiting the south said the black codes in each state were designed to enforce a widespread insistence that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large the black codes differed from state to state but their shared purpose was clear to restore white supremacy.
while black marriages were recognized for the first time african americans could not vote serve on juries or in the militia testify against whites or attend public schools.
they could not own farmland in mississippi or city property in south carolina.
in alabama they could not own guns.
in mississippi every black male over the age of eighteen had to be apprenticed to a white preferably a former slave owner.
the texas black code prohibited blacks from marrying whites and from holding elected office.
virtually all of the state black codes required that adult freed slaves sign annual labor contracts.
otherwise they would be jailed as vagrants if they could not pay the vagrancy fi ne and most of them could n ot they were forced to work for whites as convict laborers in chain gangs in part states employed this convict lease system as a means of increasing government revenue and cutting the expenses of holding prisoners.
but convict leasing at its worst was one of the most exploitative labor systems in history as people convicted of crimes mostly african americans who were often falsely accused were hired out by county and state governments to work for individuals and businesses coal mines lumber camps brickyards railroads quarries mills and plantations.
convict leasing was a thinly disguised form of neo slavery.
the black codes angered republicans.
we republicans must see to it senator william stewart of nevada resolved that the man made free by the constitution of the united states is a freeman indeed and that is what they set out to do.
a former slave who had served in the union army shared the disbelief felt by most african americans at the black codes if you call this freedom what do you call slavery fourteenth amendment to ensure the legality of the new federal civil rights act the congressional joint committee on reconstruction proposed in april 1866 a pathbreaking fourteenth amendment to the u s constitution.
it guaranteed citizenship to anyone born or naturalized in the united states except native americans.
it also prohibited any efforts debates over political r econstruction 715 to violate the civil rights of citizens black or white to deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law or to deny any person.
the equal protection of the laws with the fourteenth amendment congress gave the federal government responsibility for protecting and enforcing the civil rights of virtually all americans.
the amendment was approved by congress on june 16 1866.
not a single democrat in the house or the senate voted for it.
all states in the former confederacy were required to ratify the amendment before they could be readmitted to the union and to congress.
again president johnson seethed.
this is a country for white men he insisted and by god as long as i am president it shall be a government by white men johnson urged the southern states to refuse to ratify the amendment.
he predicted that the democrats would win the congressional elections in november and then nix the new amendment.
but johnson was steadily losing support in the north.
new york newspaper editor horace greeley called johnson an aching tooth in the national jaw a screeching infant in a crowded lecture room johnson versus radicals to win votes for democratic candidates johnson went on a speaking tour of the midwest during which he denounced radical republicans as traitors who should be hanged.
several of his speeches backfired however.
in cleveland ohio johnson exchanged hot tempered insults with a heckler.
at another stop while the president was speaking from the back of a railway car the engineer mistakenly pulled the train out of the station making the president appear quite the fool.
republicans charged that such unseemly incidents confirmed johnsons image as a ludicrous boor and a drunken imbecile in the end the 1866 congressional elections were a devastating defeat for johnson and the democrats in each house radical republican candidates won more than a two thirds majority the margin required to override presidential vetoes.
congressional republicans would now take over from the president the process of reconstructing the former confederacy.
congress takes charge on march 2 1867 the new congress passed over johnsons vetoes three crucial new laws creating what came to be called congressional reconstruction the military reconstruction act the command of the army act and the tenure of office act.
the military reconstruction act was the capstone of the congressional reconstruction plan.
it abolished all new governments in the rebel states established under president johnsons lenient reconstruction policies.
in 716 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction their place congress established military control over ten of the eleven former confederate states.
tennessee was exempted because it had already ratified the fourteenth amendment.
the other ten e x confederate states were divided into five military districts each commanded by a general who acted as governor.
the military reconstruction act required each state to create a new constitution that guaranteed the right to vote for all adult males black or white rich or poor landless or property owners.
w omen black or white did not yet have the vote and were not included in the discussions.
the military reconstruction act also stipulated that the new state constitutions in each of the former confederate states were to be drafted by conventions elected by male citizens of whatever race color or previous condition each state constitution had to guarantee the right of african american males to vote.
once a constitution was ratified by a majority of voters and accepted by congress other criteria had to be met.
the new state legislature had to ratify the fourteenth amendment and once the amendment became part of the constitution any given state would be entitled to representation in congress.
several hundred african american delegates participated in the statewide constitutional conventions.
the command of the army act required that the president issue all army orders through g eneral in chief ulysses s grant.
the radical republicans feared that president johnson would appoint generals to head up the military districts who would be too lenient.
so they bypassed the president and entrusted grant to enforce congressional reconstruction in the south.
the tenure of office act required senate permission for the president to remove any federal official whose appointment the senate had confirmed.
this act was intended to prevent johnson from firing secretary of war edwin stanton the presidents most outspoken critic in the cabinet.
congressional reconstruction embodied the most sweeping peacetime legislation in american history to that point.
its various measures sought to ensure that freed slaves could participate in the creation of new state governments in the former confederacy.
as thaddeus stevens explained the congressional reconstruction plan was designed to create a perfect republic based on the principle of equal rights for all citizens.
this is the promise of america he insisted.
no less impeaching the president the first two years of congressional reconstruction produced dramatic changes in the south as new state legislatures rewrote their constitutions and ratified the fourteenth amendment.
radical republicans now seemed fully in control of reconstruction but one debates over political r econstruction 717 person still stood in their w ay andrew johnson.
during 1867 and early 1868 more and more radicals decided that the defiant democratic president must be removed from office if their reconstruction program were to succeed.
johnson himself opened the door to impeachment the formal process by which congress charges the president with high crimes and misdemeanors when in violation of the tenure of office act he fired secretary of war edwin stanton who had refused to resign from the cabinet despite his harsh criticism of the presidents reconstruction policy.
johnson who considered the tenure of office act an illegal restriction of presidential power fired stanton on august 12 1867 and replaced him with ulysses s grant.
to the republicans this was a declaration of war.
john f farnsworth an illinois congressman denounced the president as an ungrateful despicable besotted traitorous man the radicals now saw their chance.
by removing stanton without congressional approval johnson had violated the law.
on february 24 1868 the republican dominated house passed eleven articles of impeachment that is specific charges against the president most of which dealt with stantons trial of andrew johnson in this harpers weekly illustration johnson is seated at the center of the foreground among his defense committee.
the galleries of the senate are packed with men and women watching the trial.
718 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction ring and all of which were flimsy.
in reality the essential grievance against fi the president was that he had opposed the policies of the radical republicans.
according to secretary of the navy gideon welles radicals were so angry at johnson that they would have tried to remove him had he been accused of stepping on a dogs tail the first senate trial of a sitting president began on march 5 1868 with chief justice salmon p chase presiding.
it was a dramatic spectacle before a packed gallery of journalists foreign dignitaries corporate executives and political officials.
as the trial began thaddeus stevens the radical leader warned the president unfortunate unhappy man behold your doom the five week trial ended in stunning fashion but not as the radicals had hoped.
the senate voted 35 to 19 for conviction only one vote short of the two thirds needed for removal from office.
senator edmund g ross a young radical from kansas cast the deciding vote in favor of acquittal knowing that his vote would ruin his political career.
i almost literally looked down into my open grave ross explained afterward.
friendships position fortune everything that makes life desirable.
were about to be swept away by the breath of my mouth ross was thereafter shunned by the republicans.
he lost his reelection campaign and died in near poverty.
the effort to remove johnson was in the end a grave political mistake for it weakened public support for congressional reconstruction.
nevertheless the radical cause did gain something to avoid being convicted johnson had privately agreed to stop obstructing congressional reconstruction.
republican rule in the south in june 1868 congressional republicans announced that eight southern states were allowed again to send delegates to congress.
the remaining former confederate states virginia mississippi and t exas were readmitted in 1870 with the added requirement that they ratify the fifteenth amendment which gave voting rights to african american men.
as black leader frederick douglass himself a former slave had declared in 1865 slavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot the fifteenth amendment prohibited states from denying any man the vote on grounds of race color or previous condition of servitude but susan b anthony and elizabeth cady stanton seasoned leaders of the movement to secure an honorable independence and voting rights for women demanded that the amendment be revised to include women.
as anthony stressed in a famous speech the u s constitution said we the people not we the white male citizens nor yet we the male citizens but we the whole blacks under reconstruction 719 people who formed the union women as well as men most men however remained unreconstructed when it came to voting rights for women.
radical republicans tried to deflect the issue by declaring that it was the negros hour women would have to wait another fifty years as it turned out.
blacks under reconstruction when a federal official asked garrison frazier a former slave in georgia if he and others wanted to live among whites he said that they preferred to live by ourselves for there is a prejudice against us in the south that will take years to get over in forging new lives frazier and many other former slaves set about creating their own social institutions.
freed but not equal african americans in the postwar south were active agents in affecting the course of reconstruction.
it was not an easy process however because whites both northern and southern still practiced racism.
a northern journalist traveling in the south after the war reported that the whites seem wholly unable to comprehend that freedom for the negro means the same thing as freedom for them once the excitement of freedom wore off most southern blacks realized that their best chance to make a living was by doing farmwork for their former owners.
in fact the freedmens bureau and the federal soldiers urged and even ordered them to sign labor contracts with local whites.
many planters however conspired to control the wages paid to freedmen.
it seems humiliating to be compelled to bargain and haggle with our own servants about wages complained a white planters daughter.
white southerners also used terror intimidation and violence to suppress black efforts to gain social and economic equality.
in many respects the war had not ended as armed men organized to thwart federal efforts to reconstruct the south.
in july 1866 a black woman in clinch county georgia was arrested and given sixty five lashes for using abusive language during an encounter with a white woman.
the civil war had brought freedom to enslaved african americans but it did not bring them protection against exploitation or abuse.
after emancipation union soldiers and northern observers in the south often commented that freed slaves did not go far away from where they had been enslaved.
but why would they leave what they knew so well.
as a group of african americans explained they did not want to abandon land 720 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction they had laid their fathers bones upon a union officer noted that southern blacks seemed more attached to familiar places than any other group in the nation.
participation in the union army or navy had provided many freedmen with training in leadership.
black military veterans would form the core of the first generation of african american political leaders in the postwar south.
military service gave many former slaves their first opportunities to learn to read and write and army life also alerted them to new opportunities for economic advancement social respectability and civic leadership.
fighting for the union cause also instilled a fervent sense of nationalism.
a virginia freedman explained that the united states was now our c ountry made emphatically so by the blood of our brethren black churches and schools african american religious life in the south was transformed during and after the war.
many former slaves identified with the biblical hebrews who were led out of slavery into the promised land emancipation demonstrated that god was on their side.
before the war slaves who were allowed to attend white churches were forced to sit in the back.
after the war with the help of many northern christian the first african church on the eve of its move to a new building the first african church of richmond virginia was featured in a short article including illustrations such as this one in harpers weekly in june 1874.
blacks under reconstruction 721 missionaries both black and white e x slaves eagerly established their own african american churches.
the black churches were the first social institution the former slaves could control and quickly became the crossroads for black community life.
black ministers emerged as social and political leaders as well as preachers.
one could not be a real minister one of them claimed without looking out for the political interests of his people many african americans became baptists or methodists in part because these were already the largest denominations in the south and in part because they reached out to the working poor.
in 1866 alone the african methodist episcopal ame church gained 50 000 members.
by 1890 more than 1 3 million african americans in the south had become baptists nearly three times as many as had joined any other denomination.
african american communities also rushed to establish schools.
education said a freed slave in mississippi was the next best thing to liberty starting schools said another former slave was the first proof of freedom.
most plantation owners had denied education to blacks in part because they feared that literate slaves would read abolitionist literature and organize uprisings.
after the war the white elite worried that formal education would distract poor whites and blacks from their work in the fields or encourage them to leave the south in search of better social and economic opportunities.
they didnt want us to learn nothin claimed one former slave.
white opposition made education all the more important to african americans.
south carolinas mary mcleod bethune rejoiced in the opportunity the whole world opened to me when i learned to read she walked five miles to school as a child then earned a scholarship to college and went on to become the first black woman to found a school that became a four year college what is today known as b ethune cookman university in daytona beach florida.
politics and african americans participation in the union army or navy had given many former slaves their first opportunity to express their loyalty to the american nation.
a virginia freedman explained that the united states was now our country paid for by the blood of our brethren who died while serving in the union military during the civil war.
serving in the military enabled many former slaves to learn to read and write and develop leadership qualities suitable for political roles after the war.
groups encouraging freed slaves to embrace the republican party were organized throughout the south.
they were chiefly sponsored by the union league founded in philadelphia in 1862.
league recruiters in the south 722 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction enrolled african americans and loyal whites initiated them into the secrets and rituals of the order and instructed them in their rights and duties the union league was so successful in its recruiting efforts among african americans that in 1867 it had e ighty eight chapters in south carolina alone.
the league claimed to have enrolled almost every adult black male in the state.
of course any african american participation in southern political life was a first.
some 600 blacks most of them former s laves served as state legislators under congressional reconstruction.
in louisiana pinckney pinchback a northern free black and former union soldier was elected lieutenant governor.
several other african americans were elected lieutenant governor state treasurer or secretary of state.
there were two black senators in congress hiram revels and blanche k bruce both mississippi natives who had been educated in the north as well as fourteen black members of the u s house of representatives.
white southerners were appalled at the election of black politicians.
democrat extremists claimed that radicals were trying to organize a hell in the south by putting the caucasian race under the rule of their own negroes southern whites complained that freed slaves were illiterate and had no civic african american political figures of reconstruction blanche k bruce left and hiram revels right served in the u s senate.
frederick douglass center was a major figure in the abolitionist movement.
blacks under reconstruction 723 experience or appreciation of political issues and processes.
in this regard blacks were no different from millions of poor or immigrant white males who had been allowed to vote in many jurisdictions for years.
some freedmen frankly confessed their disadvantages.
beverly nash an african american delegate to the south carolina convention of 1868 told his colleagues i believe my friends and fellow citizens we are not prepared for this suffrage the vote.
but we can learn.
give a man tools and let him commence to use them and in time he will learn a trade.
so it is with voting land labor and disappointment a few northerners argued that what the former slaves needed most was their own land where they could gain economic self sufficiency.
what is freedom ohio congressman james a garfield a former general and future president asked in 1865.
is it the bare privilege of not being chained.
if this is all then freedom is a bitter mockery a cruel delusion freed slaves felt the same way.
freedom explained a black minister from georgia meant the freedom for blacks to reap the fruit of our own labor and take care of ourselves in several southern states former slaves had been given land by union armies after they had taken control of confederate areas during the war.
but freedmen voting in new orleans the fifteenth amendment ratified in 1870 guaranteed at the federal level the right of citizens to vote regardless of race color or previous condition of servitude but former slaves had been registering to v ote and voting in large numbers in some state elections since 1867 as in this scene.
724 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction transfers of white owned property to former slaves were reversed during 1865 by president andrew johnson.
in south carolina the union general responsible for evicting former slaves urged them to lay aside their bitter feelings and become reconciled to their old masters but the assembled freedmen shouted no never and cant do it they knew that ownership of land was the foundation of their freedom.
yes they had no deeds or titles for the land they now worked but it had been earned by the sweat of our brows said a group of alabama freedmen.
president johnson however insisted that the federal government had no right to take land from former confederates.
tens of thousands of former slaves were forced to return their farms to the white owners.
in addition it was virtually impossible for former slaves to get loans to buy farmland because so few banks were willing to lend to blacks.
their sense of betrayal was profound.
reconstruction of the south would not include the redistribution of southern property.
an ex slave in mississippi whose farm was returned to its white owner said the former slaves were left with nothing no land no house not so much as a place to lay our head most former slaves were farm workers.
after the war their lack of cash and land led to the system of sharecropping where the landowner provided land seed and tools to a poor farmer in exchange for a share of the c rop which essentially re enslaved the workers because as a federal army officer objected no matter how much they are abused they cannot leave without permission of the owner if they chose to leave they would forfeit any right to a portion of the crop and any workers who violated the terms of the contract could be evicted from the plantation leaving them jobless and homeless.
across the former confederacy most white plantation owners and small farmers were determined to continue to control african americans.
many freed blacks preferred sharecropping over working for wages since it freed them from day to day supervision by white landowners.
but over sharecroppers a family is shown time most sharecroppers black and outside their virginia home in this 1899 white found themselves deep in debt photograph taken by frances benjamin to the landowner with little choice but johnston one of the earliest american to remain tied to the same discouragfemale photojournalists.
ing system of dependence that over blacks under reconstruction 725 the years felt much like slavery.
as a former slave acknowledged he and others had discovered that freedom could make folks proud but it didnt make em rich tensions among southern blacks african americans in the postwar south were by no means a uniform community.
they had their own differences and disputes especially between the few who owned property and the many who did not.
in north carolina for example less than 7 percent of blacks owned land by 1870 and most of them owned only a few acres half of black property owners had fewer than twenty acres.
affluent northern blacks and the southern free black elite most of whom were city dwellers and mulattos people of mixed parentage often opposed efforts to redistribute land to the freedmen and many insisted that political equality did not mean social equality.
as an african american leader in alabama stressed we do not ask that the ignorant and degraded shall be put on a social equality with the refined and intelligent in general however unity rather than dissension prevailed and african americans focused on common concerns such as full equality under the law.
all we ask said a black member of the state constitutional convention in mississippi is justice and to be treated like human beings with little or no training or political experience many african americans served in state governments with distinction.
nonetheless the scornful label black reconstruction used by critics then and since distorts african american political influence.
such criticism also overlooks the political clout of the large number of white republicans especially in the mountain areas of the upper south who also favored the radical plan for reconstruction.
only south carolinas republican state convention had a black majority.
louisianas was evenly divided racially and in only two other state conventions were more than 20 percent of the members black florida and virginia.
the texas convention was only 10 percent black and north carolinas was 11 percent but that did not stop a white newspaper from calling it a group of baboons monkeys mules.
and other jackasses carpetbaggers and scalawags most of the offices in the new southern state governments went to white republicans who were dismissed as carpetbaggers or scalawags carpetbaggers critics argued were scheming northerners who rushed south with all their belongings in cheap suitcases made of carpeting carpetbags to grab political power.
some northerners in the postwar south were indeed corrupt opportunists.
however most were union military veterans drawn to the south by the 726 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction desire to rebuild the regions devastated economy.
new yorker george spencer for example arrived in alabama with the union army during the war and decided to pursue his chances of making a fortune in selling cotton and building railroads.
he eventually was elected to the u s senate and later found guilty of political corruption.
many other so called carpetbaggers were well educated middle class teachers social workers attorneys physicians editors and ministers motivated by a genuine desire to help the carpetbagger the cartoonists caption free blacks and poor whites improve to this critique of carpetbaggers reads the quality of their lives.
union general the bag in front of him filled with adelbert ames a native of maine who others faults he always sees.
the one behind him filled with his own faults he won the medal of honor stayed in the never sees south after the war because he felt a sense of mission with a large m to help the former slaves develop healthy communities.
he served as the military governor of mississippi before being elected a republican u s senator in 1870.
from 1874 to 1876 ames was mississippis governor before resigning in the face of a resurgent white democratic party.
as ames witnessed the war still exists in a very important phase here the scalawags or white southern republicans were especially hated by southern democrats who considered them traitors.
a nashville newspaper editor called them the merest trash most scalawags had been unionists opposed to secession.
they were especially prominent in mountain counties as far south as georgia and alabama and especially in the hills of eastern tennessee.
among the scalawags were several distinguished figures including the former confederate general james longstreet who decided after appomattox that the old south must change its ways.
he became a successful cotton broker in new orleans joined the republican party and supported the radical reconstruction program.
other scalawags were former whigs attracted by the republican partys activist economic program of industrial and commercial expansion.
another unlikely scalawag was joseph e brown the confederate governor of georgia who urged southerners to support republicans because they were the only source of economic investment in the devastated region.
what the blacks under reconstruction 727 diverse scalawags had in common was a willingness to work with republicans to rebuild the southern economy.
southern resistance and white redemption most southern whites viewed secession not as a mistake but as a noble lost cause they used all means possible legal and illegal to redeem their beloved south from northern control republican rule and black assertiveness.
an alabama planter admitted that southern whites simply cant learn to treat the freedmen like human beings white southern ministers for example assured their congregations that god endorsed white supremacy.

728 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction denominations of the north and south many northern religionists became apostles of forgiveness for their southern white brethren.
even abolitionists such as the reverend henry ward beecher whose sister harriet beecher stowe had written uncle toms cabin 1857 called for southern whites rather than federal officials or african americans themselves to govern the south after the war.
the civil war had brought freedom to enslaved african americans but it did not bring them protection against exploitation or abuse.
the black codes created in 1865 and 1866 were the first of many continuing efforts to deny equality to african americans.
with each passing year resistance to congressional reconstruction and radical republican radical rule became more and more violent.
hundreds were killed and many more injured in systematic efforts to keep blacks in their place in texas a white farmer d b whitesides told a former slave named charles brown that his newfound freedom would do him damned little good.
as i intend to shoot you and he did shooting brown in the chest as he tried to flee.
whitesides then rode his horse beside brown and asked i got you did i brown yes a bleeding brown replied.
you got me good whitesides yelled that the wound would teach niggers like you to put on airs because you are free such ugly incidents revealed a harsh truth the death of slavery did not mean the birth of true freedom for many african americans.
for a growing number of southern whites resistance to radical reconstruction became more and more violent.
several secret terrorist groups including the ku klux klan the knights of the white camelia the white line and the white league as well as local militia units emerged to harass intimidate and even kill scalawags carpetbaggers and african americans.
the ku klux klan kkk was worse than slavery this thomas formed in 1866 in pulaski tennessee.
nast cartoon condemns the ku klux the name ku klux was derived from klan for promoting conditions worse the greek word kuklos meaning cirthan slavery for southern blacks after cle or band and klan came from the the civil war.
english word clan or family.
the klan blacks under reconstruction 729 and other groups like it began initially as a social club with costumes and secret rituals.
but its members most of them former confederate soldiers soon began harassing blacks and white republicans.
federal general philip sheridan called them terrorists intent on suppressing black political participation.
their motives were varied anger over the confederate defeat resentment against federal soldiers occupying the south complaints about having to pay black workers and an almost paranoid fear that former slaves might seek violent revenge against whites.
klansmen rode about at night spreading rumors issuing threats and burning schools and churches.
we are going to kill all the negroes a white supremacist declared during one massacre.
the legacy of republican rule one by one the republican state governments were gradually overturned.
yet they left behind an important accomplishment the new constitutions they created remained in effect for years and later constitutions incorporated many of their most progressive features.
among the most significant innovations brought about by the republican state governments were protecting black voting rights restructuring legislatures to reflect shifting populations and making more state offices elective to weaken the good old boy tradition of rewarding political supporters with state government jobs.
in south carolina former confederate leaders opposed the republican state legislature not simply because of its black members but because poor whites were also enjoying political clout for the first time thereby threatening the traditional power of wealthy white plantation owners and merchants.
given the hostile circumstances under which republican state governments operated in the south their achievements were remarkable.
they constructed an extensive railroad network and established public though racially segregated school systems schools funded by state governments and open to all children.
some 600 000 black pupils were enrolled in southern schools by 1877.
the radicals also gave more attention to the poor and to orphanages asylums and institutions for the deaf and blind of both races.
public roads bridges and buildings were repaired or rebuilt.
african americans achieved rights and opportunities that would repeatedly be violated in coming decades but would never completely be taken away at least in principle equality before the law and the rights to own property attend schools learn to read and write enter professions and carry on business.
yet several republican state governments also engaged in corrupt practices.
bribes and kickbacks whereby companies received government contracts in 730 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction return for giving government officials cash or stock were commonplace.
in louisiana a twenty six year old carpetbagger henry clay warmoth a union war veteran and an attorney somehow turned an annual salary of 8 000 into a million dollar fortune over four years as governor.
he was eventually impeached and removed from office.
i dont pretend to be honest he admitted.
i only pretend to be as honest as anybody in politics as was true in the north and the midwest at the time southern state governments awarded money to corporations notably railroads under conditions that invited shady dealings and outright corruption.
in fact some railroad officials received state funds but never built any railroads.
such corruption was not invented by the radical republican regimes nor did it die with them.
governor warmoth recognized as much corruption is the fashion in louisiana he explained.
the grant administration andrew johnsons crippled presidency created an opportunity for republicans to elect one of their own in 1868.
both parties wooed ulysses s grant the lion of vicksburg credited by most americans with the union victory in the civil war.
his falling out with president johnson however had pushed him toward the republicans who unanimously nominated him as their presidential candidate.
the election of 1868 the republican party platform endorsed congressional reconstruction.
more important however were the public expectations driving the candidacy of ulysses s grant whose campaign slogan was let us have peace grant promised that if elected he would enforce the laws and promote prosperity for all.
the democrats charged that the radical republicans were subjecting the south to military despotism and negro supremacy they nominated horatio seymour the wartime governor of new york and a passionate critic of congressional reconstruction.
his running mate francis p blair jr a former union general from missouri who had served in congress appealed directly to white bigotry when he denounced republicans for promoting equality for a semi barbarous race of black men who sought to subject the white women to their unbridled lust a democrat later said that blairs stupid and indefensible remarks cost seymour a close election.
grant swept the electoral college 214 to 80 but his popular majority was only 307 000 out of almost 6 million votes.
more the grant administration 731 than 500 000 african american voters mostly in the south accounted for grants margin of victory.
the efforts of radical republicans to ensure that voting rights for southern blacks had paid off.
as frederick douglass the revered black leader explained the republican party is the ship and all else is the sea as far as black voters were concerned.
grant the youngest president ever forty six years old at the time of his inauguration had proved himself a great military leader but he was not a strong politician.
he passively followed the lead of congress and was often blind to the political forces and s elf serving influence peddlers around him.
members of his own party would become his greatest disappointments and worst enemies.
a failure as a store the working mans banner this keeper and farmer before the civil war campaign banner makes reference grant was awestruck by men of wealth to the working class origins of who lavished gifts on him.
he also ulysses s grant and his v ice presidential candidate henry wilson showed poor judgment in his selection by depicting grant as a tanner of hides of cabinet members often favoring and wilson as a shoemaker.
friendship and loyalty over integrity and ability.
during grants two terms in office his seven cabinet positions changed twenty four times.
some of the men betrayed his trust and engaged in criminal behavior.
his former comrade in arms general william t sherman said he felt sorry for grant because so many supposedly loyal republicans used the president for their own selfish gains.
carl schurz a union war hero who became a republican senator from missouri expressed frustration that grant was misled by cunning advisers who prostituted his administration.
scandals president grants administration was quickly mired in scandal.
in the summer of 1869 two unprincipled financial schemers jay gould and the colorful james fisk jr known as diamond jim both infamous for bribing politicians and judges plotted with abel corbin the presidents 732 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction rother in law to corner the gold market.
they intended to create a public b craze for gold by purchasing massive quantities of the precious metal to drive up its value.
the only danger to the complicated scheme lay in the possibility that the federal treasury would burst the bubble by selling large amounts of its gold supply which would deflate the value of gold by putting more in circulation.
when grant was seen in public with gould and fisk people assumed that he supported their scheme.
as the false rumor spread in new york citys financial district that the president endorsed the run up in gold its value soared.
on september 24 1869 soon to be remembered as black friday the scheme to drive up the price of gold worked at least at first.
starting at 150 an ounce the bidding for gold started to rise first to 160 then 165 leading more and more investors across the nation and around the world to join the stampede.
then around noon president grant and his treasury secretary realized what was happening and began selling huge amounts of government gold.
within fifteen minutes the bubble created by fisk and gould burst and the price of gold plummeted to 138.
people who had bought gold in large amounts lost fortunes.
their agony said a new yorker made one feel as if the battle of gettysburg had been lost and the rebels were marching down broadway soon the turmoil spread to the entire stock market claiming thousands of victims.
as fisk noted it was each man drag out his own corpse for weeks after the gold bubble collapsed financial markets were paralyzed and business confidence was shaken.
congressman james garfield wrote privately to a friend that president grant had compromised his office by his indiscreet acceptance of gifts from fisk and gould and that any investigation of black friday would lead into the parlor of the president the plot to corner the gold market was only the first of several scandals that rocked the grant administration.
the secretary of war it was revealed had accepted bribes from merchants who traded with indians at army posts in the west.
in st louis whiskey distillers dubbed the whiskey ring in the p ress bribed federal agents in an effort to avoid taxes bilking the government out of millions of dollars in revenue.
grants personal secretary was embroiled in the scheme caught taking secret payments for confidential information he shared.
various congressional committees investigated most of the scandals but uncovered no evidence that grant was involved his poor choice of associates however earned him widespread criticism.
democrats scolded republicans for their monstrous corruption and extravagance and reinforced the public suspicion that elected officials were less servants of the people than they were s elf serving bandits.
the grant administration 733 the money supply complex financial issues especially monetary p olicy dominated grants presidency.
prior to the civil war the economy operated on a gold standard state banks issued paper money that could be exchanged for an equal value of gold coins.
so both gold coins and state bank notes circulated as currency.
greenbacks so called because of the dye color used on the printed dollars were issued during the civil war to help pay for the war.
when a nations supply of money grows faster than the economy itself prices for goods and services increase inflation.
this happened when the greenbacks were issued.
after the war the u s treasury assumed that the greenbacks would be recalled from circulation so that consumer prices would decline and the nation could return to a hard money c urrency gold silver and copper coins which had always been viewed as more reliable in value than paper currency.
the most vocal supporters of a return to hard money were eastern creditors mostly bankers and merchants who did not want their debtors to pay them in paper currency.
critics of the gold standard tended to be farmers and other debtors.
these s o called s oft money advocates opposed taking greenbacks out of circulation because shrinking the supply of money would bring lower prices deflation for their crops and livestock thereby reducing their income and making it harder for them to pay their l ong term debts.
in 1868 congressional supporters of such a soft money policy mostly democrats forced the treasury to stop withdrawing greenbacks.
president grant sided with the hard money camp.
on march 18 1869 he signed the public credit act which said that the investors who purchased government bonds to help finance the war effort must be paid back in gold.
the public credit act led to a decline in consumer prices that hurt debtors and helped creditors.
it also ignited a ferocious political debate over the merits of hard and soft money that would last throughout the nineteenth century a nd beyond.
financial panic president grants effort to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation unintentionally helped cause a major economic collapse.
during 1873 two dozen overextended railroads stopped paying their bills forcing jay cooke and company the nations leading business lender to go bankrupt and close its headquarters doors in philadelphia on september 18 1873.
the shocking news created a snowballing effect as h ard pressed banks began shutting down.
a republican senator sent president grant an urgent telegram from new york city results of today indicate imminent danger of general national bank panic 734 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction the resulting panic of 1873 triggered a deep depression.
tens of thousands of businesses closed millions of workers lost their jobs and those with jobs saw their wages slashed.
in the major cities the unemployed and homeless roamed the streets and formed long lines at charity soup kitchens.
the depression led the u s treasury to reverse course and begin printing more greenbacks.
for a time the supporters of paper money celebrated but in 1874 grant after a period of agonized reflection overruled his cabinet and vetoed a bill to issue even more greenbacks.
his decision pleased the financial community but also ignited a barrage of criticism.
a prominent republican edwards pierrepont telegraphed grant that his veto represented the bravest battle and biggest victory of your life a tennessee republican congressman however called the veto of the currency bill cold blooded murder in the end grants decision only prolonged what was then the worst depression in the nations history.
liberal republicans the sudden collapse of the economy in 1873 helped further distract northerners from the controversy over reconstructing the south and divided republicans into two warring factions the liberals or conscience republicans and the capitalists or stalwart republicans.
the liberal republicans led by senators charles sumner and carl schurz called for the best elements in both national parties to join together.
their goal was to oust the tyrannical grant from the presidency end federal reconstruction efforts in the south lower the tariffs intended to line the pockets of big corporations and promote civil service reforms to end the partisan tyranny of the patronage system whereby new presidents rewarded the selfish greed of political supporters with federal government jobs.
the liberal republicans charged that grant and his cronies were pursuing policies and making decisions solely to benefit themselves putting profits above principles.
in 1872 the breakaway liberal republicans many of whom were newspaper editors suspicious of the working classes held their own national convention in cincinnati at which they accused the grant administration of corruption incompetence and despotism they then committed political suicide by nominating an unlikely and ill suited presidential candidate horace greeley the editor of the new york tribune and a longtime champion of a variety of causes abolitionism socialism vegetarianism and spiritualism.
his image as an eccentric who repeatedly reversed his political positions was complemented by his record of hostility to the democrats whose support the liberal republicans needed if they were going to win the election.
the democrats nevertheless gave their nomination to greeley.
southern democrats liked his criticism of federal reconstruction policies in the south.
the grant administration 735 his new york tribune for example claimed that ignorant superstitious semi barbarian former slaves were extremely indolent and will make no exertion beyond what is necessary to obtain food enough to satisfy their hunger moreover radical republicans had given the vote to ignorant former slaves whose nigger government exercised absolute political supremacy in several states and was transferring the wealth from the most intelligent and influential southern whites to themselves.
georgia democrat robert toombs a former confederate official agreed with greeley and his newspaper arguing that the dangerous irresponsible element among the lower classes was threatening to attack the interests of the landed proprietors most northerners however were appalled at greeleys candidacy.
by nominating greeley said the new york times the liberal republicans and democrats had killed any chance of electoral victory.
in the 1872 balloting greeley carried only six southern states and none in the north.
grant won t hirty one states and carried the national election by 3 598 235 votes to greeleys 2 834 761.
an exhausted greeley confessed that he was the worst beaten man who ever ran for high office he died three weeks later.
grant was delighted that the soreheads and thieves who had deserted the republican party were defeated and he promised to be a better president by avoiding the mistakes he had made in his first term as a novice statesman.
white terror president grant initially fought hard to enforce federal efforts to reconstruct the postwar south.
but southern resistance to radical rule increased and turned brutally violent.
in grayson county texas a white man and two friends murdered three former slaves because they wanted to thin the niggers out and drive them to their holes klansmen focused their program of murder violence and intimidation on prominent republicans black and white elected officials teachers in black schools state militias.
they intentionally avoided clashes with federal troops.
in mississippi they killed a black republican leader in front of his family.
three white scalawag republicans were murdered in georgia in 1870.
that same year an armed mob of whites assaulted a republican political rally in alabama killing four blacks and wounding fifty four.
an alabama republican pleaded with president grant to intervene against the klansmen.
give us poor people some guarantee of our lives g t f boulding wrote.
we are hunted and shot down as if we were wild beasts in south carolina white supremacists were especially a ctive and violent.
in 1871 some 500 masked men laid siege to south carolinas union county jail and eventually lynched eight black prisoners.
in march 1871 the klan killed thirty african americans in meridian mississippi.
general william t sherman reported that the violence across the south was c ommonplace and went 736 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction unpunished any southern citizen may kill or abuse a negro or union man republican with as much safety as one of our frontiersmen may kill an indian at the urging of president grant republicans in congress responded with three enforcement acts 1870 1871.
the first of these measures imposed penalties on anyone who interfered with any citizens right to vote.
the second dispatched federal supervisors and marshals to monitor elections in southern districts where political terrorism flourished.
the third called the ku klux klan act outlawed the main activities of the k kk forming conspiracies wearing disguises resisting officers and intimidating officials.
in general however the enforcement acts were not consistently enforced.
as a result the efforts of southern whites to use violence to thwart reconstruction escalated.
on easter sunday in 1873 in colfax louisiana a mob of white vigilantes most of them ex confederate soldiers disappointed by local election results used a cannon rifles and pistols to attack a group of black republicans in the courthouse slaughtering e ighty one and burning down the building.
it was the bloodiest racial incident during the reconstruction period.
a visit from the ku klux klan african americans in the south lived in constant fear of racial violence as this 1872 engraving from harpers weekly published to elicit northern sympathy illustrates.
the grant administration 737 southern redeemers the ku klux klans impact on southern politics varied from state to state.
in the upper south it played only a modest role in helping democrats win local elections.
in the lower south however klan violence and intimidation had more serious effects.
in overwhelmingly black yazoo county mississippi vengeful whites used terrorism to reverse the political balance of power.
in the 1873 elections for example the republicans cast 2 449 votes and the democrats 638 two years later the democrats polled 4 049 votes the republicans 7.
throughout the south the activities of white supremacists disheartened black and white republicans alike.
we are helpless and unable to organize wrote a mississippi scalawag.
we dare not attempt to canvass campaign for candidates or make public speeches at the same time northerners displayed a growing weariness with using federal troops to reconstruct the south.
the plain truth is noted the new york herald the north has got tired of the negro president grant however desperately wanted to use more federal force to preserve peace and asked congress to pass new legislation that would leave my duties perfectly clear congress responded with the civil rights act of 1875 the most comprehensive guarantee of civil rights to that point.
it said that people of all races must be granted equal access to hotels and restaurants railroads and stagecoaches theaters and other places of public entertainment.
unfortunately for grant however the new law provided little authority to enforce its provisions.
those who felt their rights were being violated had to file suit in court and the penalties for violators were modest.
public interest in protecting civil rights in the south continued to wane as other issues emerged to distract northerners.
western expansion indian wars and economic issues surged to the forefront of voter concerns.
republican political control in the south gradually loosened as all white conservative parties mobilized the a nti reconstruction vote.
white d emocrats the so called redeemers who supposedly saved the south from republican control and black rule used the race issue to excite the white electorate and intimidate black voters.
where persuasion failed to work democrats used trickery.
as one enthusiastic democrat boasted the white and black republicans may outvote us but we can outcount them republican political control ended in virginia and tennessee as early as 1869 in georgia and north carolina it collapsed in 1870 although north carolina had a republican governor until 1876.
reconstruction lasted longest in the lower south where whites abandoned klan robes for barefaced intimidation in paramilitary groups such as the mississippi rifle club and the south 738 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction carolina red shirts.
the last radical republican regimes collapsed however after the elections of 1876 and the return to power of the old white political elite in the south further undermined the countrys commitment to congressional reconstruction.
the contested election of 1877 president grant wanted to run for an unprecedented third term in 1876 but many republicans had lost confidence in his leadership.
in the summer of 1875 grant acknowledged the inevitable announced that he would retire and admitted that he had entered the white house with no political training and had made errors in judgment james gillespie blaine of maine former speaker of the house was the likeliest republican to succeed grant but his candidacy crumbled when it was revealed that he had promised political favors to railroad executives in exchange for shares of stock in the company.
the scandal led the republican convention to pass over blaine in favor of ohios favorite son rutherford b hayes.
elected governor of ohio three times most recently as a hard money gold advocate hayes also was a civil service reformer eager to reduce the number of federal jobs subject to political appointment.
but his chief virtue was that he offended neither radicals nor reformers.
as a journalist put it he was obnoxious to no one the democratic convention was uncharacteristically harmonious from the start.
on the second ballot the nomination went to samuel j tilden a wealthy corporate lawyer and reform governor of new york.
the 1876 campaign avoided controversial issues.
both candidates favored relaxing federal military authority in the south.
in the absence of strong ideological differences democrats highlighted the scandals embroiling the republicans.
in response republicans avoided discussion of the depression and repeatedly waved the bloody shirt linking the democrats to secession civil war and the violence committed against republicans in the south.
as robert g ingersoll the most celebrated republican public speaker of the time insisted the man that assassinated abraham lincoln was a democrat.
soldiers every scar you have on your heroic bodies was given you by a democrat despite the lack of major issues the 1876 election generated the most votes of any national election in u s history to that point.
early returns pointed to a victory for tilden.
nationwide he outpolled hayes by almost 300 000 votes by midnight following election day tilden had won 184 electoral votes just one short of the total needed for victory.
overnight however republican activists realized that the election hinged on 19 disputed electoral votes from florida louisiana and south carolina.

why were the electoral votes of several states disputed.
what was the compromise of 1877.
wwn64 figure m16 2 1st proof the democrats needed only one of the challenged votes to claim victory the republicans needed all nineteen.
republicans in those key states had engaged in election fraud while democrats had used physical intimidation to keep black voters at home.
but all three states were governed by a republican who appointed the election boards each of which reported narrow victories for hayes.
the democrats immediately challenged the results.
in all three states rival election boards submitted conflicting vote counts.
the nation watched and wondered as days then weeks passed with no solution.
on january 29 1877 congress set up an electoral commission to settle the dispute.
it met daily for weeks trying to verify the disputed vote counts.
740 chapter 16 the era of r econstruction the compromise of 1877 this illustration represents the compromise between republicans and southern democrats that elected rutherford b hayes and ended radical reconstruction.
finally on march 1 1877 the commission voted 8 to 7 in favor of hayes.
the next day the house of representatives declared hayes president by an electoral vote of 185 to 184.
tilden decided not to protest the decision.
his campaign manager explained that they preferred four years of hayess administration to four years of civil war hayess victory hinged on the defection of key southern democrats who it turned out had made a number of secret deals with the republicans.
on february 26 1877 prominent ohio republicans and powerful southern democrats struck a private bargain the compromise of 1877 at wormleys hotel in washington d c.
the republicans promised that if hayes were named president he would remove the last federal troops from the south.
the end of reconstruction in 1877 newly inaugurated president hayes withdrew federal troops from louisiana and south carolina whose republican governments collapsed soon thereafter.
hayes insisted that it was not his fault the practical destruction of the republican organization in the south was accomplished before my southern policy was announced over the next thirty years the protection of black civil rights in the south crumbled.
as henry adams a former louisiana slave observed in 1877 the whole south every state in the s outh has got back into the hands of the reconstructions significance 741 very men that held us as slaves new white state governments rewrote their constitutions rid their administrations of carpetbaggers scalawags and blacks and cut spending.
the yankees helped free us so they say a former north carolina slave named thomas hall remembered but in 1877 they let us be put back in slavery again reconstructions significance congressional reconstruction gave african americans an opportunity to experience freedom but not security or equality.
as thomas hall noted in acknowledging the end of reconstruction african americans were still dependent on the southern white man for work food and clothing and most southern whites remained hostile to the notion of civil rights and social equality.
the collapse of congressional reconstruction in 1877 had tragic consequences as the south aggressively renewed traditional patterns of discrimination against african americans.
black activist w e b dubois called the effort to make slaves into citizens a splendid failure yet for all of the unfulfilled promises of congressional reconstruction it left an enduring legacy the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
if reconstructions experiment in interracial democracy did not provide true social equality or substantial economic opportunities for african americans it did create the essential constitutional foundation for future advances in the quest for equality and civil rights and not just for african americans but for women and other minority groups.
until the pivotal reconstruction era the states were responsible for protecting citizens rights.
thereafter thanks to the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments blacks had gained equal rights in theory and the federal government had assumed responsibility for ensuring that states treated blacks equally.
a hundred years later the cause of civil rights would be embraced again by the federal g overnment this time permanently.
chapter review summary reconstruction challenges with the defeat of the confederacy and the passage of the thirteenth amendment the federal government had to develop policies and procedures to address a number of vexing questions what was the status of the defeated states and how would they be reintegrated into the nations political life.
what would be the political status of the former slaves and what would the federal government do to integrate them into the nations social and economic fabric.
reconstruction over time abraham lincoln and his successor southerner andrew johnson wanted a lenient plan for reconstruction.
the freedmens bureau helped to educate and aid freed slaves negotiate labor contracts and reunite families.
lincolns assassination led many northerners to favor the radical republicans who wanted to end the grasp of the old plantation elite on the souths society and economy.
whites resisted and established black codes to restrict the freedom of former slaves.
congressional reconstruction responded by stipulating that former confederate states had to ratify the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the u s constitution to protect the rights of african americans.
congress also passed the military reconstruction act which used federal troops to enforce the voting and civil rights of african americans.
views of reconstruction many former slaves found comfort in their families and in the churches they established but land ownership reverted to the old white elite reducing newly freed blacks to sharecropping.
african americans enthusiastically participated in politics with many serving as elected officials.
along with white southern republicans scalawags and northern carpetbaggers they worked to rebuild the southern economy.
many white southerners however supported the ku klux klans violent intimidation of the supporters of reconstruction and pursued redemption or white democratic control of southern state governments.
political and economic developments and the end of reconstruction scandals during the grant administration involved an attempt to corner the gold market and the whiskey rings plan to steal millions of dollars in tax revenue.
in the face of these troubles and the economic downturn caused by both the panic of 1873 and disagreement over whether to continue the use of greenbacks or return to the gold standard northern support for the status quo in government eroded and weakened reconstruction.
southern white redeemers were elected in 1874 successfully reversing the political progress of republicans and blacks.
in the compromise of 1877 democrats agreed to the election of republican rutherford b hayes who put an end to the radical republican administrations in the southern states.
the significance of reconstruction southern state governments quickly renewed long standing patterns of discrimination against african americans but the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments remained enshrined in the constitution creating the essential constitutional foundation for future advances in civil rights.

pa r t f ive growing pains the defeat of the confederacy in 1865 restored the union and in the process helped accelerate americas transformation into an agricultural empire and an industrial powerhouse.
a stronger sense of nationalism began to replace the regional conflicts of the prewar era.
during and after the civil war the republican led congress pushed through legislation to promote industrial and commercial development and western expansion at the same time that it was reconstructing the former confederate states.
the united states forged a dynamic new industrial economy serving an increasingly national and international market for american goods.
yet that progress and the process of settling the rest of the continent was tarnished by the relentless and ruthless relocation of native americans onto reservations and the exploitation of the continents natural resources.
fueled by innovations in mass production and mass marketing and by advances in transportation and communications such as transcontinental railroads and transatlantic telegraph systems huge corporations began to dominate the economy by the end of the nineteenth century.
as the prominent social theorist william graham sumner remarked the process of industrial development controls us all because we are all in it.
it creates the conditions of our own existence sets the limits of our social activity and regulates the bonds of our social relations late nineteenth century american life drew much of its energy from the mushrooming industrial cities.
this is the age of cities declared midwestern writer hamlin garland.
we are now predominantly urban but the transition from an economy made up of mostly small local and regional businesses to one dominated by large scale national and international corporations affected rural life as well.
as early as 1869 novelist harriet beecher stowe reported that the simple pastoral america is a thing forever gone.
the hurry of railroads and the rush and roar of business had displaced the jeffersonian ideal of america as a nation of small farms.
she exaggerated of course.
small farms and small towns survived the impact of the industrial revolution but farm folk as one new englander stressed must now understand farming as a business if they do not it will go hard with them the friction between the new forces of the national marketplace and the traditional folkways of small scale family farming generated social unrest and political revolts what one writer called a seismic shock a cyclonic violence during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
the clash between tradition and modernity sleepy farms and bustling c ities peaked during the 1890s one of the most strife ridden decades in american history.
a deep economic depression political activism by farmers and violent conflicts between industrial workers and employers transformed the presidential campaign of 1896 into a clash between rival visions of americas future.
747 the republican candidate william mckinley campaigned on modern urban and industrial values.
by contrast william jennings bryan the nominee of both the democratic and the populist parties was an eloquent defender of americas rural past.
mckinleys victory proved to be a turning point in american political and social history.
by 1900 the united states had emerged as one of the worlds greatest industrial powers and it would thereafter assume a new leadership role in world affairs for good and for ill business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 carnegie steel company steelworkers operate the massive and dangerous bessemer converters at andrew carnegies huge steel mill in pittsburgh pennsylvania.
t he civil war devastated the economy of the south.
in the north however the need to supply the massive union armies with shoes boots uniforms weapons supplies food wagons and railroads ushered in an era of unprecedented industrial development.
the scope of the war favored large scale business enterprises and hastened the maturation of a truly national economy.
an indiana congressman told business leaders in 1864 that the war effort had sparked the development of resources and capabilities such as you never before dreamed you possessed during the war years the number of manufacturing companies in the united states almost doubled.
in 1865 ohios john sherman a powerful u s senator wrote a letter to his brother william t sherman the celebrated union general in which he observed that the northern states had emerged from the war unimpaired the process of m ass producing mountains of goods for the war effort had given a widened scope to the ideas of leading capitalists far higher than anything undertaken in this country.
they talk of millions as confidently as before they talked of thousands between the end of the war and 1900 america experienced explosive growth.
the nations population tripled agricultural production more than doubled and manufacturing output grew six times over.
when the civil war ended there was not a single industrial corporation listed on the new york stock exchange.
by 1900 there were dozens of them employing hundreds of thousands of managers clerks and workers.

how effective were the efforts of workers to organize unions to promote their interests during this era.
750 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 the world more than double that of its closest rival great britain.
by 1900 american industries and corporate farms dominated global markets in steel and oil wheat and cotton.
such phenomenal growth caused profound social changes the most visible of which was the sudden prospering of large industrial cities such as pittsburgh chicago and cleveland.
millions of young adults left farms and villages to work in factories mines and mills and to revel in the energies of city life.
in growing numbers women left the cult of domesticity at home and entered the urban industrial workplace as clerks typists secretaries teachers nurses and seamstresses.
while a few people made enormous fortunes however most laborers remained in unskilled l ow wage jobs.
big business a term commonly used to refer to the giant corporations that emerged after the civil war was as untamed and reckless as the cow towns and mining camps of the west.
new technologies and business practices outpaced the ability of the outdated legal system to craft new laws and fashion rules of ethics to govern the rapidly changing economy.
business owners took advantage of this lawless environment to build fortunes destroy reputations exploit both workers and the environment and gouge consumers.
yet out of the scramble for profits emerged an u ndreamed of prosperity and a rising standard of living that became the envy of the world.
in the process of generating wealth capitalism fosters inequality.
people with different talents opportunities and resources receive unequal rewards from their labors and innovations.
in a capitalist democracy like america the tensions between equal political rights and unequal economic status produce inherent social instability.
the overwhelming influence exercised by the business tycoons led to tensions that spurred the formation of labor unions and farm associations.
increasingly those tensions erupted into violent clashes that demanded government intervention and produced class conflict.
industrial and agricultural growth several factors converged during the second half of the nineteenth century to accelerate the nations industrial development.
perhaps the most important was the creation of new transportation systems canals steamboats railroads along with instantaneous communication networks telegraph and later telephone which combined to create a truly national marketplace for the sale and distribution of goods and services.
in addition americans enjoyed the benefits of vast and valuable natural resources land forests minerals oil coal water and iron ore at the same time a rising tide of immigrants created an army of low wage high energy industrial and agricultural growth 751 workers while expanding the pool of consumers eager to buy new products.
between 1865 and 1900 more than 15 million newcomers arrived in the united states.
a new generation of business leaders drove the transition to an u rban industrial society.
investment banker jay cooke marveled at the new breed of cold blooded capitalists who emerged during and after the civil war most of them northerners and all of them driven by the same all pervading all engrossing anxiety to grow rich the uncommon men who spearheaded the postwar economic boom elicited both praise and scorn.
admirers called them captains of industry while critics called them robber barons because they controlled the flow of money and commerce.
whatever the label the p ost civil war business tycoons were shrewd men determined to create large enterprises never before imagined.
they were proponents of free enterprise and self reliance who were convinced that what was good for their businesses was good for the country as a whole.
hated feared envied or admired the titans of the industrial era were the catalysts for a new america of cities and factories prosperity amid poverty and growing social strife and political corruption.
bigness was the driving goal of industrial capitalism.
mass scale and size were the watchwords of the day.
daring entrepreneurs took advantage of new money making opportunities technologies and political lobbying including bribery to build gigantic corporations called trusts that dominated industries such as oil refining steel sugar and meatpacking.
the promoters of big business scrambled for wealth by ruthlessly improving efficiency and productivity cutting costs buying politicians and suppressing competition.
these predatory men cornelius vanderbilt john d r ockefeller andrew carnegie and j p morgan among others w anted to dominate their industries.
when vanderbilt a commodore first of steamboats and then r ailroads learned that some rivals had tried to steal one of his properties while he was away he penned a brief message gentlemen you have undertaken to cheat me.
i will not sue you for law takes too long.
i will ruin you and he did.
corporate agriculture at the same time that the manufacturing sector was experiencing rapid growth the agricultural sector was also shifting to a large scale industrial model of operation.
giant corporate owned bonanza farms spread across the west.
they were run like factories by professional college educated managers who during harvest season would hire hundreds of migrant workers to bring in the crops usually wheat or corn destined for eastern or foreign markets.
752 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 the farm sector stimulated the industrial s ector and vice versa.
in the west bonanza farms using the latest machinery and scientific techniques became internationally famous for their productivity.
by 1870 the united states had become the worlds leading agricultural producer.
and with the growth of the commercial cattle industry the process of slaughtering packing and shipping cattle hogs and sheep evolved into a major industry itself especially in chicago the nations fastest growing city and the largest slaughterhouse in the world.
technological i nnovations america has always nurtured a culture of invention and innovation.
abraham lincoln had often praised the nations peculiar talent for discoveries and inventions which was especially evident in the decades after the civil war.
inventors scientists research laboratories and business owners developed labor saving machinery and m ass production techniques such as the use of interchangeable parts that spurred dramatic advances in efficiency productivity and the size of industrial enterprises.
such innovations helped businesses turn out more products more cheaply while enabling more people to buy more of them.
technological advances created economies of scale whereby larger business enterprises including huge commercial farms could afford expensive new machinery and large workforces that boosted their productivity.
after the civil war technological improvements spurred phenomenal increases in industrial productivity.
the u s patent office which had recorded only 276 inventions during the 1790s registered almost 235 000 new patents in the 1890s.
the list of innovations was lengthy barbed wire mechanical harvesters reapers and new technologies business executives combines refrigerated railcars air brakes watch alexander graham bell at the for trains steam turbines typewriters new york end of the first l ong distance sewing machines vacuum cleaners electelephone call to chicago 1892 tric motors and countless others.
industrial and agricultural growth 753 bells telephone few if any inventions could rival the importance of the telephone.
in 1875 t wenty eight year old alexander graham bell began experimenting with the concept of a speaking telegraph or talking through wires.
the following year he developed a primitive electric speaking telephone that enabled him to send a famous message to his assistant in another room mr.
watson come here i want to see you bell then patented his device and started a company the american telephone and telegraph company at t to begin manufacturing telephones.
five years later he perfected the long distance telephone lines that revolutionized communication.
by 1895 there were more than 300 000 telephones in use.
bells patent became the most valuable one ever issued.
typewriters and sewing machines other inventions changed the nature of work.
typewriters for example transformed the operations of business offices.
because women showed greater dexterity in their fingers business owners hired them to operate typewriters in part because they could be paid much less than men.
clerical positions soon became the fastest growing job category for women.
likewise the introduction of sewing machines for the mass production of clothing and linens opened new doors to w omen if not usually pleasant office typists in new roles enabled by typewriters women served as clerks or secretaries at many offices such as the remington typewriter company pictured here.
754 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 ones to walk through.
s o called sweatshops emerged in the major cities where large numbers of mostly young women often immigrants worked long hours in cramped stifling conditions.
thomas edison no american inventor was more influential or prolific than thomas alva edison.
as a boy in michigan he could not sit still he loved to make things and do things his mother h ome schooled him and allowed him to explore the outdoors and perform chemical experiments except when he mussed things up edison later said his mother was the making of me.
she understood me she let me follow my bent his bent was toward telegraphy and electricity.
he built his own telegraph set and dreamed of being a telegraph operator sending messages in morse code.
when edison was twelve he began working for the local railroad selling newspapers food and candy to passengers.
being poor he explained i already knew that money is a valuable thing one day he was late for the train and ran after it.
a conductor reached down and lifted him into the train by his ears.
edison felt something snap in his head and soon he was deaf.
despite losing his hearing however he said that his work as a trainboy was the happiest time of my life it was in 1862 early in the civil war that the deaf solitary edison fastened on his real passion being a telegraph operator first in cincinnati then in louisville then in boston since the clicking key enabled him to listen to others and tinker with the equipment.
despite having no formal scientific education the s elf taught edison developed an insatiable curiosity and mechanical genius.
in january 1869 at the age of t wenty one he announced that he would hereafter devote his full time to bringing out his inventions he moved to new york city to be closer to the center of americas financial district.
he developed dozens of new machines including a stock market ticker that would report the t ransactions on wall street in real time.
soon job offers and real money flooded his way.
edison however had a different goal he wanted to become a full time inventor an electrical engineer devoted to creating new products.
in 1876 he moved into his science village in menlo park new jersey twenty five miles southwest of new york city.
there edison became a mass production inventor promising to produce a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every six months or so in the nations first industrial research laboratory edison and his assistants created the first phonograph in 1877 and a l ong lasting electric lightbulb in 1879.
he also improved upon the telephone.
by the ripe age of thirty edison was the nations foremost inventor.
altogether he created or perfected industrial and agricultural growth 755 hundreds of new devices and processes including the storage battery dictaphone mimeograph copier electric motor and motion picture camera and projector.
edison soon became world famous.
a magazine saluted him as the wizard of menlo park and called him one of the wonders of the world president rutherford b hayes invited him to the white house and congress honored him.
george westinghouse and electric power until the 1880s buildings and streets were lit mostly by kerosene or gas lamps.
in 1882 the edison electric illuminating company later renamed general electric supplied electrical current to e ighty five customers in new york city launching the electric utility industry.
several companies that made lightbulbs merged into the edison general electric company in 1888.
the use of direct electrical current however limited edisons lighting system to a radius of about two miles.
to cover greater distances required an alternating current which could be transmitted at high voltage and then stepped down by transformers.
george westinghouse inventor of the railway air brake developed the first a lternating current electric system in 1886 and set up the westinghouse electric company to manufacture the equipment.
edison resisted the new method as too risky but the westinghouse system of transmitting electricity over long distances won the battle of the currents and the edison companies had to switch over to ac alternating current from dc direct current.
after the invention in 1887 of the a lternating current motor by a croatian immigrant named nikola tesla westinghouse improved upon it and the company began selling dynamos.
the invention of dynamos or electric motors dramatically increased the power speed and efficiency of machinery.
electricity enabled factories to be located wherever the owners wished factories and mills no longer had to cluster around waterfalls and coal deposits to have a ready supply of energy.
electricity also spurred urban growth by improving lighting facilitating the development of trolley and subway systems and stimulating the creation of elevators that enabled the construction of taller buildings.
the railroad revolution more than any other industry the railroads symbolized the impact of innovative technologies on industrial development and the maturation of a truly national economy.
no other form of transportation played so large a role in the development of the interconnected national marketplace.
756 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 trains and time railroads compressed time and distance.
they moved masses of people and goods faster and farther than any other form of transportation.
the railroad network prompted the creation of uniform national and international time zones and spurred the use of wristwatches for the trains were scheduled to run on time.
towns that had rail stations thrived those that did not died.
a towns connection to a railroad observed anthony trollope a celebrated british writer touring the united states was the first necessity of life and gives the only hope of wealth although the first great wave of railroad building occurred in the 1850s the most spectacular growth took place during the quarter century after the civil war.
from about 35 000 miles of track in 1865 the national rail network grew to nearly 200 000 miles by 1897.
such a sprawling railroad system was expensive and the long term debt required to finance it would become a major cause of the financial panic of 1893 and the ensuing depression.
trains and the industrial era railroads were americas first truly big business the first beneficiary of the great financial market known chinese railroad workers using horse drawn carts picks shovels and dynamite chinese laborers played a large role in constructing the transcontinental central pacific railroad track.
industrial and agricultural growth 757 as wall street in new york city the first industry to have operations in several states and the first to develop a large scale management bureaucracy.
the railroad boom was the essential catalyst for americas transition to an urban industrial economy.
for a century from the 1860s to the 1960s most people entered or left a city through its railroad stations.
trains opened the west to economic development enabled federal troops to suppress indian resistance ferried millions of european and asian immigrants across the country helped transform commercial agriculture into a major international industry and transported raw materials to factories and finished goods to retailers.
railroads were expensive enterprises however.
locomotives railcars called rolling stock and the construction of track trestles and bridges required enormous investments.
railroads became the first industry to contract with investment banks to raise capital by selling shares of stock to investors around the world.
they also stimulated other industries through their mammoth purchases of iron and steel coal timber leather for seats and glass.
in addition railroad companies were the nations largest employers.
by the 1870s the pennsylvania railroad alone had 55 000 employees as many as the entire federal government.
the downside of the railroad boom many developers however cared more about making money than building safe railroads.
companies often overlooked dangerous working conditions that caused thousands of laborers to be killed or injured.
too many unneeded railroads were built by the 1880s there were twice as many railroad companies as the economy could support.
some railroads were poorly or even criminally managed and went bankrupt.
those that succeeded often broke the rules.
railroad lobbyists helped to corrupt state and federal legislators by buying the votes of politicians with cash or shares of stock in the new railroad companies.
admitted charles francis adams jr head of the union pacific railroad our method of doing business is founded upon lying cheating and stealing all bad things building the transcontinentals for decades visionaries had dreamed of the united states being the first nation in the world to build a railroad spanning a continent.
in the 1860s the dream became reality as construction began on the first of four rail lines that would bridge the n ation and as one promoter boasted establish our empire on the pacific 758 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 the work of giants the transcontinental railroads were in the words of general william t sherman the work of giants their construction required heroic feats by the surveyors engineers and laborers who laid the rails built the bridges and gouged out the tunnels through rugged mountains.
the first transcontinental railroads were much more expensive to build than were the shorter trunk lines in the east.
because the western routes passed through vast stretches of unpopulated plains and deserts construction materials as well as workers and their food and water had to be hauled long distances.
locomotives railcars rails ties spikes and much more were often shipped from the east coast to san francisco and then moved by train to the remote construction sites.
the construction process was like managing a moving army.
herds of cattle horses mules and oxen had to be fed and tended.
huge mobile camps called hell on wheels had to be built to house the crews and then picked up and transported as the tracks progressed.
the camps even included tents for dance halls saloons gambling and prostitution.
nightlife in the construction camps was raucous.
as a british reporter wrote soldiers herdsmen teamsters women railroad men are dancing singing or gambling.
there are men here who would murder a fellow creature for five dollars.
nay there are men who have already done it.
not a day passes but a dead body is found somewhere in the vicinity with pockets rifled of their contents the pacific railway act 1862 before the civil war construction of a transcontinental line had been delayed because northern and southern congressmen clashed over the choice of routes.
secession and the departure of southern congressmen for the confederacy in 1861 finally permitted republicans in congress to pass the pacific railway act in 1862.
it authorized construction along a north central route by two competing companies the union pacific railroad up westward from omaha nebraska across the prairie and the central pacific railroad cp eastward from sacramento california through the sierra nevada.
both companies began construction during the war but most of the work was done after 1865.
the risks were enormous.
there was no guarantee that the cp could cross the sierra nevada east of sacramento.
collis huntington one of the cp owners was so nervous about the undertaking that he refused to attend a ceremony celebrating the laying of the first rail.
if you want to jubilate over driving the first spike he wrote one of his partners go ahead and do it.
those mountains over there look too ugly.
we may fail and if we do i want as few people to know it as i can industrial and agricultural growth 759 constructing a railroad across the continent entailed feats of daring engineering and construction often punctuated by heartbreak and heroism.
laying rail around and through the mountains required extensive use of gunpowder dynamite and costly tunnels and bridges harsh weather caused frequent work disruptions.
many workers were killed or injured in the process.
at times some 15 000 people mostly men worked for each of the companies as they literally raced against each other to complete their tasks.
the company that laid the most track in the shortest time would be awarded more money by congress.
the competition led both companies to cut corners.
collis huntington one of the cp owners confessed that his goal was to build the cheapest road that i could.
so that it moves ahead fast if bridges or trestles collapsed under the weight of freight trains they could be fixed later.
mark hopkins one of huntingtons partners agreed noting that his goal was to build as poor a road as we can railroad workers the up crews were composed largely of young unmarried former civil war soldiers both union and confederate along with e x slaves and irish and german immigrants.
the cp crews were mainly young chinese workers lured to america by the california gold rush or by the railroad jobs.
most of these coolie laborers were single men eager to make money to take back to china where they could then afford to marry and buy a parcel of land.
their temporary status and dreams of a good life made them more willing than american laborers to endure the low pay dangerous working conditions and intense racial prejudice.
what distinguished the chinese from other laborers was their disciplined ability to work together in accomplishing daunting tasks.
mark twain described the chinese as quiet peaceable tractable free from drunkenness and they are as industrious as the day is long.
a disorderly chinaman is rare and a lazy one does not exist.
he is a great convenience to e verybody even to the worst class of white men for he bears the most of their sins suffering fines for their petty thefts imprisonment for their robberies and death for their murders laying track the process of building the rail lines involved a series of sequential tasks.
first came the surveyors who selected and mapped the routes and measured the grade changes.
engineers then designed the bridges trestles tunnels and snowsheds.
tree cutters and graders followed by preparing the rail beds.
wooden cross ties were then placed in the ground and leveled before thirty foot long iron rails weighing 560 pounds were laid atop them.
next came spikers who used special hammers to wallop t wo pound spikes attaching the rails to the ties.
finally workers shoveled gravel between the ties to stabilize them against the weight of rolling trains.
a journalist reported that all this work is executed with great rapidity and mechanical regularity.
760 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 yet for all of its precision and efficiency the process of building the lines faced constant interruptions terrible weather late deliveries of key items accidents epidemics or indian attacks.
arthur ferguson a supervisor who kept a daily journal frequently noted the hazards of constructing the first transcontinental in 1868 may 17 two more men drowned in the river yesterday.
june 4 at about sunrise were attacked by indians and succeeded in shooting one.
june 21 indians killed two men.
both had been horribly mutilated about the face by cuts made by a knife or a tomahawk.
june 30 four men were killed and scalped today about two miles above camp.
but it was not only indians doing the killing.
workers often fought and killed each other.
on june 7 ferguson recorded that two men were shot this evening in a drunken r ow one was instantly killed and the other is not expected to live the race to the finish the drama of constructing the first transcontinental railroad seized the nations imagination.
every major news the union pacific meets the central pacific on may 10 1869 the celebration of the first transcontinental railroads completion took place in promontory utah.
industrial and agricultural growth 761 paper carried stories about the progress of the two competing companies.
finally on may 10 1869 former california governor leland stanford one of the owners of the central pacific drove a gold spike to complete the line at promontory summit in the utah territory north of the great salt lake.
the union pacific had built 1 086 miles of track compared with the central pacifics 689.
the railroad builders had changed the landscape and widened the horizons of american ambition.
the golden spike used to connect the final rails symbolized the uniting of east and west just as robert e lees surrender four years earlier had come to represent the reunion of north and south.
soon the entire process would be repeated as other companies constructed more lines across the continent.

figure m17 1 first proof 762 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 the rise of big business the transcontinental railroads were the first of many i nvestor owned publicly traded corporations during the industrial era.
the emergence of big business was one of the most significant developments in american history.
corporations grew much larger and more powerful transacting business across the nation and abroad.
they were also much more influential politically as they worked to influence governors legislators congress and presidents.
before the civil war most businesses had been small local enterprises.
after 1865 much of america suddenly got bigger towns and cities ships locomotives factories machines mines and mills and business organizations followed the same path.
the rapid expansion in businesses however created problems.
the growing wealth and influence of our large corporations warned the new york times is one of the most alarming phenomena of our time.
our public companies already wield gigantic power and they use it like unscrupulous giants the growth of corporations as businesses grew they took one of several different forms.
some were owned by an individual usually their founder others were partnerships involving several owners.
increasingly however large companies that served national and international markets were converted into corporations legal entities that separate the ownership of an enterprise from the management of its operations.
once a corporation is registered chartered or incorporated with a state government it can raise money to operate capital by selling shares of stock representing partial ownership of the company to people not otherwise involved with it.
shareholders elect a board of directors who appoint and evaluate the corporations executives management.
one of the most important benefits of a corporation is limited legal liability stockholders share in its profits but cannot be held liable for its debts if it fails.
fighting competition competition is supposed to be the great virtue of capitalism since it forces businesses to place a premium on efficiency and produce better products at the lowest cost.
as many businesses became giant corporations however some business titans came to view competition as a burden rather than a blessing.
competition many owners argued created a chaotic and wasteful economic the rise of big business 763 environment.
financier j p morgan for example claimed that bitter destructive competition always led to destruction and ruin to eliminate cutthroat competition and thereby stabilize production wages and prices rival companies selling similar products often formed pools whereby they secretly agreed to keep production and prices at specified levels.
such pools rarely lasted long however because they were unenforceable.
one or more participants usually violated the agreement by cutting prices or increasing p roduction or both.
the more effective strategy for the most aggressive companies was to get rid of weaker competitors by driving them out of business or buying them out.
strategies like these as well as the methods used to carry them out led critics to call the corporate titans robber barons in the process of forming huge companies and eliminating competition many business leaders cut corners bribed politicians double crossed partners exploited workers hired strikebreakers and broke laws.
when asked how people might react to the shady methods he used to build his network of railroads william henry vanderbilt famously replied the public be damned the barons of business most of the men few women had such opportunities who created big businesses in the late nineteenth century were driven by a compulsive desire to become rich and influential.
moreover during and after the civil war becoming rich emerged as a national ideal sanctified by many religious leaders.
to secure wealth is an honorable ambition stressed russell conwell a prominent baptist minister who crisscrossed the nation preaching a sermon called acres of diamonds in which he celebrated the benefits of hard work and its just rewards.
money is power he explained and every good man and woman ought to strive for power to do good with it when obtained.
i say get rich.
get rich the industrial and financial giants personified the values that conwell celebrated.
they were men of grit and genius who found i nnovative and at times unethical ways to increase production create efficiencies and eliminate competition.
the captains of industry were also mercilessly adept at cutting costs and lowering prices.
several of the post civil war business barons stood out for their extraordinary accomplishments john d rockefeller and andrew carnegie for their innovations in organization j pierpont morgan for his development of investment banking and richard sears and alvah roebuck for their creation of mail order retailing.
in their different ways each dealt a mortal blow to the s mall scale economy of the early republic fostering vast enterprises that 764 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 f orever altered the size and scope of business and industry.
john d rockefeller born in new york in 1839 john d rockefeller moved as a child to cleveland ohio nestled beside lake erie.
soon thereafter his c on man father abandoned the family.
raised by his mother a devout baptist rockefeller developed a single minded passion for systematic organization.
as a young man in the 1860s he decided to bring order and rationality to the new b oom and bust oil industry.
he was ambitious disciplined and obsessed with precision efficiency tidiness and money.
a childhood friend recalled that he was mad about money though sane about everything else rockefeljohn d rockefeller co founder of the standard oil company.
ler said little rarely smiled and hardly ever laughed.
the railroad and shipping connections around cleveland made it a strategic location for serving the booming oil fields of nearby western pennsylvania.
the first oil well in the united states began producing in 1859 in titusville pennsylvania and led to the pennsylvania oil rush of the 1860s.
because oil could be refined into kerosene which was widely used for lighting heating and cooking the economic importance of the oil rush soon outstripped that of the california gold rush ten years earlier.
well before the end of the civil war oil refineries sprang up in pittsburgh and cleveland.
of the two cities cleveland had better rail service so rockefeller focused his energies there.
in 1870 rockefeller teamed with his brother william and two other businessmen henry m flagler and samuel andrews inventor of an inexpensive means of refining crude oil to establish the standard oil company of ohio.
although the company quickly became the largest oil refiner in the nation john rockefeller wanted to eliminate his competitors and take control of the entire industry in large part because he believed his competitors were inefficient and distracting.
during the 1870s rockefeller used various schemes to eliminate his competitors.
early on he pursued a strategy that came to be called horizontal the rise of big business 765 integration in which a dominant corporation buys or forces out most of its competitors.
rockefeller viewed competition as a form of warfare.
in a few cases he hired former competitors as executives but only the big ones he said those who have already proved they can do a big business.
as for the others unfortunately they will have to die by 1879 standard oil controlled more than 90 percent of the nations oil refining business.
still rockefeller intended to secure the entire refining business of the world his goal was a monopoly a business so large that it effectively controls an entire industry.
rockefeller was an innovative genius with the fierce focus of a shark and the pinched priorities of a bookkeeper obsessed with the smallest details.
he methodically reduced expenses incorporated the latest technologies and eliminated any hint of waste while paying nobody a profit because he shipped so much oil by rail he forced railroads to pay him secret rebates on the s hipments enabling him to pay less for shipping than his competitors paid.
most important instead of depending upon the products or services of other firms known as middlemen standard oil eventually owned everything it needed to produce refine and deliver oil from wells to the finished product.
the company had its own pipelines built factories to make its own wagons and storage barrels did its own hauling owned its own storage tanks the rise of oil crowding this pennsylvania farm are wooden derricks that extracted crude oil.
766 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 and tanker ships.
in economic terms this business strategy is called vertical integration.
rockefellers standard oil company was both horizontally and vertically integrated.
during the 1870s standard oil bought so many of its competitors that it developed a virtual monopoly over the industry.
many state legislatures responded by outlawing the practice of one corporation owning stock in competing ones.
in 1882 rockefeller tried to get around such laws by organizing the standard oil trust.
a trust gives a person or corporation the trustee the legal power to manage another persons money or another company.
instead of owning other companies outright the standard oil trust controlled more than thirty companies by having their stockholders transfer their shares in trust to rockefeller and eight other trustees.
in return the stockholders received trust certificates which paid them annual dividends from the trusts earnings.
the standard oil trust was rockefellers attempt to hide his virtual monopoly over the american oil industry.
soon however the formation of huge corporate trusts a practice widely copied by other industries generated intense criticism.
in 1890 congress responded by passing the sherman a nti trust act with only one dissenting vote.
it declared that corporate efforts to monopolize industries and thereby restrain competition were illegal.
but the bills language was so vague that it proved to be virtually toothless.
state laws against monopolies were initially more effective than the sherman act.
in 1892 ohios supreme court ordered the standard oil trust dissolved.
a furious rockefeller then developed another way to maintain control of his numerous companies a holding company which is a huge corporation that controls other companies by holding most or all of their stock certificates.
a holding company produces nothing itself it simply owns a majority of the stock in other companies.
rockefeller was convinced that ending competition among companies was a good thing for the nation.
monopolies he insisted were the natural result of capitalism at work.
it is too late he declared in 1899 to argue about the advantages of huge industrial combinations.
they are a necessity.
the day of individualism is gone.
never to return that year rockefeller brought his empire under the direction of the standard oil company of new jersey a gigantic holding company.
a wall street investor spoke for many business observers when he asked how can you beat the standard oil party after all they have control of all the industries are getting all the railroads and the street railways and will in a few years own the whole country.
i can see no stopping them the rise of big business 767 andrew carnegie like rockefeller andrew carnegie who created the largest steel company in the world rose to wealth from boyhood poverty.
born in scotland the son of weavers he migrated with his family in 1848 to western pennsylvania.
at age thirteen he went to work in a textile mill.
in 1853 he became personal secretary to thomas scott then district superintendent of the pennsylvania railroad and later its president.
when scott moved up the shrewd and charming carnegie became superin tendent in a region teeming with treasure during the civil war when scott became assistant secretary of war in charge of transportation carnegie went with him to washington d c and helped develop a military tele andrew carnegie established the carnegie steel company and became graph system.
the wealthiest man in the world.
the ambitious carnegie worked his way up from telegraphy to railroading to bridge building and then to steelmaking and investments.
in the early 1870s he decided to concentrate on the manufacture of iron and steel and be master in that a tiny man barely five feet tall carnegie wanted to tower over the steel industry just as john d rockefeller was doing with oil.
like rockefeller carnegie accumulated vast wealth and he often treated his workers ruthlessly.
until the m id nineteenth century steel which is stronger and more flexible than iron could be made only from wrought iron itself expensive since it had to be imported from s weden and could only be manufactured in small quantities.
bars of wrought iron were heated with charcoal over several days to add carbon and produce steel.
it took three tons of coke a high burning fuel derived from coal to produce one ton of steel.
as a result steel was too costly to make in large quantities.
that changed in the 1850s when englands sir henry bessemer invented the bessemer converter a process by which high quality steel could be produced more quickly by blasting oxygen through the molten iron in a furnace.
in the early 1870s carnegie decided to concentrate on steel because 768 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 essemers process had made it so inexpensive to produce and the railroad b industry required massive amounts of it.
as more steel was produced its price dropped and its industrial uses soared.
in 1860 the united states produced only 13 000 tons of steel.
by 1880 production had reached 1 4 million tons annually.
between 1880 and 1900 carnegie dominated the steel industry acquiring competitors or driving them out of business by cutting prices and taking their customers.
by 1900 the united states was producing more steel than great britain and germany combined.
carnegie was a resilient promoter salesman and organizer.
he insisted upon up to date machinery and equipment expanded production quickly and cheaply by purchasing struggling companies and preached a philosophy of continuous innovation to reduce operating costs.
he also sought to expand his industry by vertical integration gaining control of every phase of the steelmaking business.
he owned coal mines in west virginia bought huge deposits of iron ore in michigan and wisconsin and transported the ore in his own ships across the great lakes and then by rail to his steel mills in pittsburgh.
the result was phenomenal.
by 1900 the carnegie steel company with 20 000 employees was the largest industrial company in the world.
and carnegie worked his people hard.
his mills operated nonstop with two 12 hour shifts every day and night.
carnegie insisted that what he rockefeller and other titans of industry were doing in forging dominant corporations was simply the wave of the future.
rockefeller agreed saying that the formation of huge trusts was simply the working out of a law of nature and a law of god j pierpont morgan j pierpont morgan despite his privileged upbringing and financial success he was s elf conscious about his deformed nose caused by chronic skin diseases.
unlike rockefeller and carnegie j pierpont morgan was born to wealth in connecticut.
his father was a partner in a large english bank.
after attending school in switzerland and college in germany morgan was sent in 1857 the rise of big business 769 to work in new york city for a new enterprise j pierpont morgan and company.
the firm under various names invested european money into american businesses.
it grew into a financial power by helping competing corporations merge and by purchasing massive amounts of stock in american companies and selling them at a profit.
morgan took over poorly run companies appointed new executives and supervised operations.
like rockefeller and carnegie he believed in capitalism but hated the chaos of competition.
in his view high profits required order and stability and stability required consolidating competitors into trusts that he would own and manipulate.
morgan recognized early on the importance of railroads and by the 1890s he controlled a sixth of the nations railway system.
but his crowning triumph was the consolidation of the steel industry.
after a rapid series of mergers he bought out andrew carnegies huge steel and iron holdings in 1901.
morgan added scores of related companies to form the united states steel corporation the worlds first b illion dollar corporation employing 168 000 people.
it was the climactic event in the efforts of the great financial capitalists to reduce competition and form e ver larger corporations capable of dominating their industries.
sears and roebuck after the civil war american inventors helped manufacturers produce a vast number of new products.
but the most important economic challenge was extending commerce to the millions who lived on isolated farms and in small towns.
a traveling salesman from chicago named aaron montgomery ward decided that he could reach more people by mail than on foot and thus eliminate the middlemen whose services increased the retail price of goods.
beginning in the early 1870s montgomery ward and company began selling goods at a 40 percent discount through mail order catalogs.
by the end of the century a new retailer had come to dominate the mail order industry sears roebuck and company founded by two midwestern entrepreneurs richard sears and alvah roebuck.
the sears roebuck catalog in 1897 was 786 pages long.
it featured groceries drugs tools furniture household products musical instruments farm implements shoes clothes books and sporting goods.
the companys ability to buy goods in high volume from wholesalers enabled it to sell items at prices below those offered in rural general stores.
by 1907 sears roebuck and company headquartered in chicago had become one of the largest businesses in the nation.
the sears catalog helped create a national market and transformed the lives of millions of people.
with the advent of free rural mail delivery in 1898 and the widespread distribution of the catalogs families on farms and in small 770 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 towns and villages could purchase by mail the products that heretofore were either prohibitively expensive or available only to city dwellers.
by the turn of the century 6 million sears catalogs were being distributed each year and the catalog had become the most widely read book in the nation after the bible.
the gospel of wealth however harsh the methods employed by the captains of industry the men were convinced that they benefited the public by accelerating americas transformation into an industrial colossus.
in their eyes it was a law of societal evolution that those most talented at producing wealth should accumulate cover of the 1897 sears roebuck and enormous personal fortunes.
company catalog sears roebucks extensive mail order business and some of them however insisted discounted prices allowed its many that great wealth brought great responproducts to reach customers in cities sibilities.
in his essay the gospel and in the backcountry.
of wealth 1889 andrew carnegie argued that not evil but good has come to the anglo saxon race from the accumulation of wealth by those who have the ability and energy that produces it but he also felt the need to justify his wealth and denounced the worship of money he and john d rockefeller gave much of their money back to society.
by 1900 rockefeller had become the worlds leading philanthropist.
i have always regarded it as a religious duty he said late in life to get all i could honorably and to give all i could he donated more than 500 million during his lifetime including tens of millions to baptist causes and 35 million to found the university of chicago.
his philanthropic influence continues today through the rockefeller foundation.
as for carnegie after retiring from business at age sixty five he declared that the man who dies rich dies disgraced and devoted himself to dispensing his 400 million fortune.
calling himself a distributor of wealth he disliked the term philanthropy he gave huge sums to numerous universities built the alliance of business and politics 771 celebrating big business a lavish dinner celebrated the merger of the carnegie and morgan interests in 1901.
the shape of the banquet table is meant to symbolize a rail.
2 500 public libraries and helped fund churches hospitals parks and halls for meetings and concerts including new york citys carnegie hall.
the alliance of business and politics the building of big businesses depended on more than just e ntrepreneurial energy.
most of the corporate titans developed cozy relationships with local state and federal officials a process of buying influence lobbying that continues to this day.
big business has legitimate political interests but because of its size and resources it also at times exercises a corrupt influence on government.
nowhere was this conflicting role more evident than during the decades after the civil war.
the new york times noted that the largest corporations control the legislatures republicans and big business during and after the civil war the republican party and state and federal governments grew increasingly allied with big business.
a key element of this alliance was tariff policy.
since 1789 the federal government had imposed tariffs taxes on imported goods to raise revenue and to benefit american manufacturers by 772 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 enalizing their foreign competitors.
in 1861 as the civil war was starting p the republican dominated congress enacted the morrill tariff which doubled tax rates on hundreds of imported items as a means of raising money for the war and rewarding the businesses that supported the republican party.
after the war president ulysses s grant and later republican presidents and congresses continued the partys commitment to high tariffs despite complaints that the tariffs increased consumer prices at home by restricting foreign imports and thereby relieving american manufacturers of the need to keep their prices down.
farmers in the south and midwest resented tariffs because while they had to sell their crops in an open world market they had to buy manufactured goods whose prices were artificially high because of tariffs.
during the civil war congress passed other key pieces of legislation related to the economy.
the legal tender act of 1862 authorized the federal government to issue paper money greenbacks to help pay for the war.
having a uniform paper currency was essential to a modern national economy.
to that end the national banking act 1863 created national banks authorized to issue greenbacks which discouraged state banks from continuing to issue their own paper money.
congress also took steps to tie the new states and territories of the west into the national economy.
in the homestead act of 1862 congress provided free 160 acre or even larger homesteads to settlers in the west.
by encouraging western settlement the homestead act created new markets for goods and services and spurred railroad construction to connect frontier communities with major cities.
the morrill land grant act of the same year transferred to each state 30 000 acres of federal land for each member of congress the state had.
the sale of those lands provided funds for states to create colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts such as iowa state university and kansas state university.
the land grant universities were created specifically to support economic growth by providing technical training needed by farmers and rapidly g rowing industries such as mining steel petroleum transportation forestry and construction engineering.
laissez faire equally important in propelling the postwar economic boom was what government did not do.
in 1870 historian henry adams expressed concern that there was no authority capable of restraining the leaders of the nations largest corporations.
at the time the federal government did not regulate the activities of big businesses impose high corporate taxes or provide any meaningful oversight of business operations or working conditions.
an industrial society 773 homesteaders an african american family poses outside their log and sod cabin in 1889.
in general both congress and the presidents opposed government interference in the economy and accepted the economic doctrine of laissez faire a french phrase meaning let them do as they will business leaders spent time and money ensuring that government officials stayed out of their businesses.
for their part the politicians were usually eager to help the titans of industry in exchange for campaign c ontributions or bribes for looking the other way.
an industrial society industrialization transformed not only the economy and the workplace but also the nations social life.
class divisions became more visible.
the growing gap between rich and poor was like social dynamite said the reverend josiah strong in 1885.
massachusetts reformer lydia maria child reported that the rich do not intermarry with the middle classes the middle classes do not intermarry with the laboring class nor did different classes mix socially 774 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 the nouveaux riches upper class members of new york city society pose for a photograph at the james hazen hyde ball on january 31 1905.
the ways of the wealthy the financiers and industrialists who dominated social economic and political life in post civil war america amassed so much fabulous wealth and showed it off so publicly that the period is still called the gilded age the name derived from a popular novel by mark twain and charles d udley warner the gilded age a tale of today which mocked the crooked dealings of political leaders and the business elite.
in 1861 there were only a few dozen millionaires in the united states.
by 1900 there were more than 4 000.
most of them were white protestants who voted republican except for a small number of wealthy southern democrats.
many of the nouveaux riches french for newly rich indulged in what came to be called conspicuous consumption competing to host the fanciest parties and live in the most extravagantly furnished houses.
one tycoon gave a lavish dinner honoring his dog and presented it with a 15 000 diamond necklace.
at a party at new yorks delmonicos restaurant the guests smoked cigarettes wrapped in 100 bills.
mrs bradley martin received such a torrent an industrial society 775 of criticism after spending 368 000 on a banquet that she and her husband fled to england.
when they were not attending parties the rich were relaxing in monumental mansions overlooking the cliffs at newport rhode island atop nob hill in san francisco along chicagos lake shore drive and new york citys fifth avenue and down the main line in suburban philadelphia.
who knows how to be rich in america asked e l godkin a magazine editor.
plenty of people know how to get money but.
to be rich properly is indeed a fine art.
it requires culture imagination and character a growing middle class it was left to the fast growing middle class to display good character by practicing such traditional virtues as self discipline and restraint simplicity and frugality.
the term middle class had first appeared in the 1830s and had become commonplace by the 1870s as more and more americans came to view themselves as members of a distinct social class between the ragged and the rich.
the middle class explained the chicago writer george ade in an 1895 essay the advantage of being middle class meant those people who work either with hand or brain who are neither poverty stricken nor offensively rich accompanying the spread of huge corporations after the civil war was a rapidly growing middle class enjoying a rising standard of living.
while the rich were getting richer many other people were also becoming better off in terms of their income and quality of life.
most middle class americans working outside the home were salaried employees of large businesses who made up a new class of white collar professionals editors engineers accountants supervisors managers marketers and realtors.
others mostly unmarried women were a growing share of the total clerks secretaries salespeople and government employees including teachers and librarians.
during the 1870s the number of office clerks quadrupled and the number of accountants and bookkeepers doubled.
at the same time the number of attorneys physicians professors journalists nurses and social workers rose dramatically.
middle class women the growing presence of m iddle class women in the workforce partly reflected the increasing number of women who were gaining access to higher education.
dozens of womens colleges were founded after the civil war and many formerly a ll male colleges began admitting women.
by 1900 a third of college students were women.
after a struggle of many years a new york woman boasted it is now pretty generally admitted that women possess the capacity to swallow intellectual food that was formerly considered the diet of men exclusively 776 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 to be sure college women were often steered into home economics classes and finishing courses intended to perfect their housekeeping or social skills.
still the doors of the p rofessions law medicine science and the arts were at least partially opened.
in this context then the woman question that created so much public discussion and controversy in the second half of the nineteenth century involved far more than the issue of voting rights it also concerned the liberation of at least some women from the home and from longstanding limits on their social roles and even character traits.
middle class women also took advantage of other public venues for interaction charitable associations womens clubs literary societies and church work.
if there is one thing that pervades and characterizes what is called the womans movement e l youmans a prominent science writer remarked it is the spirit of revolt against the home and the determination to escape from it into the outer spheres of activity neurasthenia women who tried to escape the cult of domesticity and pursue careers outside the home often paid a high price.
many contracted college women by the end of the century women made up more than a third of college students.
here an astronomy class at new yorks vassar college is underway in 1880.
an industrial society 777 a peculiar affliction which male physicians called neurasthenia a draining psychological and physical disorder whose symptoms usually included insomnia hysteria headaches depression and a general state of fatigue.
although neurasthenia plagued both sexes it most often affected college educated m iddle class women.
some prominent doctors sought to use the prevalence of neurasthenia to force women back into the cult of domesticity george m beard a neurologist who popularized the term neurasthenia concluded incorrectly that women were more nervous immeasurably than men and that female neurasthenics tended to be overly active outside the home.
this explanation led one doctor to insist that the malady provided the best argument against higher education of women many women objected to such self serving male arguments.
charlotte perkins gilman for instance wrote her short story the yellow wallpaper to expose the horrors of the rest cure she was subjected to at age t wenty seven.

there she and other social workers helped immigrants adapt to american life and mentored young women to learn of life from life itself addams and others helped convince many middle class women to enter the real world.
by 1890 a magazine called the arena would urge progressive minded people to recognize the traditional view of women as homebodies for what it was hollow false and unreal the ladies home journal not all middle class women however wanted to venture out into the world.
many of them identified more with the domestic life that was the focus of numerous mass circulation magazines the most popular of which was the ladies home journal.
by 1910 it had almost 2 million subscribers the largest circulation of any magazine in the world.
edward bok a dutch immigrant raised in brooklyn new york became editor of ladies home journal in 1889 at the age of twenty six.
under his direction for the next thirty years the magazine provided a great clearing house of information to the large and rapidly growing urban middle class.
the journal included sections on sewing cooking religion politics and fiction.
bok was no feminist my idea he stressed is to keep women in the home there he believed they would maintain a high moral tone for society for women were better purer conscientious and morally stronger than men bok saw the middle class woman as the crucial steadying influence mennens toilet powder this between the unrest among the lower advertisement appeared in the classes and the rottenness among the independence day edition of ladies home journal in 1908 suggesting that upper classes a homemakers ability to protect her boks view of the ideal life for a family from skin discomforts was her woman included a healthful diet own declaration of independence.
simple serviceable clothing a clean an industrial society 779 healthy dwelling place open air exercise and good reading he preached contentment rather than conspicuous consumption a message directed not just to his middle class readers but also to the working poor.
in a christmas editorial though bok recognized that it is a hard thing for those who have little to believe that the greatest happiness of life is with them that it is not with those who have abundance the working class the continuing demand for unskilled workers by railroads factories mills mines slaughterhouses and sweatshops attracted new groups to the workforce immigrants above all but also growing numbers of women and children.
in addition millions of rural folk especially young people formed a migratory stream from the agricultural regions of the south and midwest to cities and factories across the country.
although wage levels rose overall during the gilded age there was a great disparity in pay for skilled and unskilled workers.
during the recessions and depressions that occurred about every six years unskilled workers were the first to be laid off or to have their wages slashed.
in addition working conditions were difficult and often dangerous for those at the bottom of the occupational scale.
the average workweek was fifty nine hours or nearly six 10 hour days.
american industry had the highest rate of workplace accidents and deaths in the world and there were virtually no safety regulations or government inspections.
few machines had safety devices few factories or mills had fire escapes.
respiratory diseases were common in mines and u nventilated buildings especially textile mills.
between 1888 and 1894 there were 16 000 railroad workers killed and 170 000 maimed in on the job accidents.
the united states was also the only industrial nation with no insurance program to cover medical expenses for on the job injuries.
working women industrial development after the civil war transformed the nature of the workplace.
mills mines factories and large businesses needed far more unskilled workers than skilled ones.
employers often recruited women and children for the unskilled jobs because they were willing to work for lower wages than men received.
in addition to operating sewing machines or tending to textile machines spinning yarn or thread millions of women worked as maids cooks or nannies.
in the manufacturing sector womens wages averaged 7 a week compared to 10 for unskilled men.
780 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 a social worker reported that it was widely assumed in many factories that a married woman would accept lower wages because she has a man to support her which was not always the case.
the number of women working outside the home tripled between 1870 and 1900 when 5 million women 17 percent of all women held full time jobs.
in a letter to the editor of the nation in 1867 a working woman described the changing nature of gender roles in american life.
most middle class women she acknowledged still lived in a world of love of a sweet and guarded domesticity of d rawing rooms and boudoirs of dainty coquetries of quiet graces where they flourish like fair flowers in a south window but each year thousands of women were entering a different world of mud carts ledgers packing boxes counting houses paste oils leather iron boards committees big boots and men who.
meet women on a cool business level of dollars and cents child labor most young people had always worked in america farms required everyone to pitch in.
in the late nineteenth century however millions of children took up work outside the home sorting coal stitching clothes shucking oysters peeling shrimp canning food blowing glass tending looms children in industry these four young boys performed the dangerous work of mine helpers in west virginia around 1900.
the dreadful chill of change 781 and operating other kinds of machinery.
child labor increased as parents desperate for income felt forced to put their children to work.
by 1880 one of every six children under age fourteen was working full time by 1900 the united states had almost 2 million child laborers.
in pennsylvania west virginia and eastern kentucky soot smeared boys worked in the coal mines.
in new england and the south children labored in dusty textile mills where during the night shift they had water thrown in their faces to keep them awake.
in the southern mills a fourth of the employees were below the age of fifteen and children as young as eight worked alongside adults twelve hours a day six days a week.
as a result they received little or no education.
factories mills mines and canneries were especially dangerous places for children who suffered three times as many accidents as adult workers and suffered higher rates of respiratory diseases.
a child working in a southern textile mill was only half as likely to reach the age of twenty as a child who did not work in a mill.
the dreadful chill of change when novelist henry james returned to the united states in the early twentieth century after a long stay in england he was shocked by the dreadful chill of change u rban industrial development and western expansion had generated unparalleled prosperity but the united states he feared had lost much of its social stability and cohesion.
in 1885 another writer said that the working poor were unleashing a seismic shock a cyclonic violence that threatened to tear society apart.
organized labor the efforts of the working poor to form unions to improve their pay and working conditions faced formidable obstacles during the gilded age.
many executives fought against unions.
they blacklisted union organizers by circulating their names to keep them from being hired fired labor leaders and often hired scabs nonunion workers to replace workers who went on strike.
another factor impeding the growth of unions was that much of the workforce was made up of immigrants who spoke different languages and often distrusted people from other ethnic groups.
nonetheless with or without unions workers began to stage strikes that often led to violence.
perhaps at no time before or since have class tensions both social and cultural been so bitter.
782 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 the molly maguires during the early 1870s violence erupted in the eastern pennsylvania coalfields when a secret irish american group called the molly maguires took economic justice into their own hands.
the mollies took their name from an irish patriot who had led the resistance against the british.
outraged by dangerous working conditions in the mines and the owners brutal efforts to suppress union activity the mollies used intimidation beatings and killings to avenge the wrongs done to irish workers.
their terrorism reached its peak in 1874 1875 prompting mine owners to hire men from the pinkerton detective agency commonly referred to as pinkertons to stop the movement.
one of the agents who infiltrated the mollies uncovered enough evidence to have the leaders indicted for the coalfield murders.
in 1876 twenty four molly maguires were convicted by a non irish jury ten were hanged.
the great railroad strike 1877 after the financial panic of 1873 the major rail lines fearful of a recession had slashed workers wages.
in 1877 the companies announced another 10 percent wage cut which led most of the railroad workers at martinsburg west virginia to walk off the job and block the tracks to shut down all rail traffic.
the strike spread to hundreds of other cities and towns.
tens of thousands of workers walked off the job and the resulting violence left more than 100 people dead and millions of dollars in damaged property.
in pittsburgh thousands of striking workers burned t hirty nine buildings and destroyed more than 1 000 railcars and locomotives.
the violence was not directed solely at employers either.
workers who refused to join the strike or participate in the riots were harassed and beaten.
the great railroad strike became one of the most spectacular incidents of widespread violence in american history and revealed how polarized the working poor and business elites had become.
local and state officials interpreted the growing insurgency as evidence of communist ideology born in europe.
governors mobilized state militia units to suppress the rioters.
in philadelphia the militia dispersed a crowd at the cost of twenty six lives but looting and burning continued until president rutherford b hayes dispatched federal troops finally to end it.
a reporter described the scene as the most horrible ever witnessed except in the carnage of war.
there were fifty miles of hot rails ten tracks side by side with as many miles of ties turned into glowing coals and tons on tons of iron car skeletons and wheels almost at white heat eventually the disgruntled workers lacking organized bargaining power had little choice but to return to work.
the strike had failed.
for many americans the railroad strike raised the possibility of what a pittsburgh newspaper saw as a great civil war in this country between labor the dreadful chill of change 783 and capital many workers felt that violence was their only option.
the working people everywhere are with us a unionist told a reporter.
they know what it is to bring up a family on ninety cents a day to live on beans and corn meal week in and week out to run in debt at the company stores until you cannot get trusted any longer to see the wife breaking down.
and the children growing sharp and fierce like wolves day after day because they dont get enough to eat equally disturbing to those in positions of corporate and political power was the presence of many women among the protesters.
a baltimore journalist noted that the singular part of the disturbances is the very active part taken by the women who are the wives and mothers of the railroad firemen president hayes knew that the army had suppressed the strikers but had not solved the underlying problems.
the strikes have been put down by force he wrote in his diary.
but now for the real remedy.
cant something be done by education of the strikers by judicious control of the capitalists by wise general policy to end or diminish the evil it was a fair question that largely went unanswered.
the sand lot incident in california the national railroad strike indirectly gave rise to a w orking class political movement.
in 1877 a the chinese must go in this advertisement for the missouri steam washer the american made washing machine drives a chinese laundryman back to china playing on the growing anti chinese sentiments in the 1880s.
784 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 meeting held in a sandy san francisco vacant lot to express sympathy for the railroad strikers ended with attacks on passing chinese workers.
in the aftermath of the so called s and lot incident white mobs attacked chinatown.
the chinese were handy scapegoats for frustrated white laborers who believed the asians had taken their jobs.
soon an irish immigrant denis kearney had organized the workingmens party of california whose platform called for the united states to stop chinese immigration.
kearney lectured the sand lotters about the foreign peril and blasted the railroad barons for exploiting the poor.
the workingmens movement peaked in 1879 when it elected a number of state legislators and the mayor of san francisco.
although kearney failed to build a lasting movement his anti chinese theme became a national issue.
in 1882 congress voted to prohibit chinese immigration for ten years.
the national labor union as the size and power of corporations increased efforts to build a national labor union movement gained momentum.
during the civil war because of the increased demand for skilled labor so called craft unions made up of workers expert at a particular handicraft grew in strength and number.
yet there was no overall connection among such groups until 1866 when the national labor union nlu convened in baltimore.
the nlu was more interested in advocating for improved workplace conditions than in bargaining with employers about wages and hours.
the group promoted an eight hour workday workers cooperatives in which workers collectively would create and own their own l arge scale manufacturing and mining operations greenbackism the printing of paper money to inflate the currency and thereby relieve debtors and equal voting rights for women and african americans.
like most such organizations in the nineteenth century however the nlu did not allow women as members.
as one official explained the attitude of male unionists woman was created to be mans companion not his competitor in the workplace who would cause his wages to fall.
the nlu also discriminated against african american workers.
they were forced to organize black only unions of their own.
w e b dubois an outspoken black civil rights activist charged that the white worker did not want the negro in his unions did not believe in him as a man after the nlus head william sylvis died suddenly in 1869 its support declined and by 1872 the union had disbanded.
the nlu was not a total failure however.
it was influential in persuading congress to enact an e ight hour workday for federal employees and to repeal the 1864 contract labor act which had been passed to encourage the importation of laborers by allowing the dreadful chill of change 785 employers to pay for the passage of foreign workers to america.
in exchange the workers were committed to labor for a specified number of years.
employers had taken advantage of the contract labor act to recruit foreign laborers willing to work for lower wages than their american counterparts.
the knights of labor in 1869 another national labor group had emerged the noble order of the knights of labor.
the union grew slowly at first but even as other unions collapsed during the depression of the 1870s it spread more rapidly.
the knights of labor endorsed most of the reforms advanced by previous workingmens groups including the creation of bureaus of labor statistics and mechanics lien laws to ensure payment of wages the elimination of convict labor competition the establishment of the eight hour day and worker cooperatives and the use of paper currency.
one reform the group advocated was far ahead of the times equal pay for equal work by men and women.
the knights of labor allowed as members all who had ever worked for wages except lawyers doctors bankers and those who sold liquor.
such inclusiveness was both a strength and a weakness.
by recruiting all types of workers the knights grew very large but they also struggled with internal tensions between skilled and unskilled workers.
knights of labor this national union was the most egalitarian union during the gilded age.
786 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 in 1879 terence v powderly the t hirty year old mayor of scranton pennsylvania became head of the knights of labor.
born of irish immigrant parents powderly had started working for a railroad at age sixteen.
frail sensitive to criticism and indecisive he was in many ways unsuited to the job.
he was opposed to strikes and when they did occur he did not always support the groups involved.
yet the knights owed their greatest growth to strikes that occurred under his leadership.
in the early 1880s the knights increased their membership from about 100 000 to more than 700 000 mother jones one of the most colorful and beloved labor agitators at the end of the nineteenth century was a remarkable woman known simply as mother jones.
white haired pink cheeked and dressed in matronly black dresses and hats she was a tireless champion of the working poor who used fiery rhetoric to excite crowds and attract media attention.
she led marches dodged bullets served jail terms and confronted business titans and police with disarming courage.
in 1913 a district attorney called her the most dangerous woman in america born in cork ireland in 1837 mary harris was the second of five children in a poor catholic family that fled the irish potato famine at midcentury and settled in toronto.
in 1861 she moved to memphis tennessee and began teaching.
there as the civil war was erupting she met and married george jones an iron molder and staunch union member.
they had four children and then disaster struck.
in 1867 a yellow fever epidemic devastated memphis killing mary joness husband and four children.
the g rief stricken thirty seven year old widow moved to chicago and took up dressmaking only to see her shop home and belongings destroyed in the great fire of 1871.
having lost her family and her finances and angry at the social inequality and injustices she saw around her mary jones drifted into the labor movement and soon emerged as its most passionate advocate.
c hicago was then the seedbed of labor radicalism and the union culture nurtured in mary jones a lifelong dedication to the cause of wage workers and their families.
the gritty woman who had lost her family now declared herself the mother of the fledgling labor movement.
she joined the knights of labor as an organizer and public speaker.
in the late 1880s she became an ardent speaker for the united mine workers umw various other unions and the socialist party.
for the next thirty years she crisscrossed the nation recruiting union members supporting strikers her boys raising funds walking picket lines defying court injunctions berating politicians and spending time in prison.
the dreadful chill of change 787 wherever mother jones went she promoted higher wages shorter hours safer workplaces and restrictions on child labor.
coal miners said the umw president have had no more staunch supporter no more able defender than the one we all love to call mother during a miners strike in west virginia jones was arrested convicted of conspiracy that resulted in murder and sentenced to twenty years in prison.
the outcry over her plight helped spur a senate committee to investigate conditions in the coal mines the governor set her free.
mother jones was especially determined to end the exploitation of children in the workplace.
in 1903 she organized a highly publicized weeklong march of child workers from pennsylvania to the new york home of president theodore roosevelt.
the children were physically stunted and mutilated most of them missing fingers or hands from machinery accidents.
president roosevelt refused to see the ragtag children but as mother jones explained our march had done its work.
we had drawn the attention of the nation to the crime of child labor soon the pennsylvania state legislature increased the legal working age to fourteen.
mother jones lost most of the strikes she participated in but over the course of her long life she saw average wages increase working conditions improve and child labor diminish.
her commitment to the cause of social justice never wavered.
at age eighty three she was arrested after joining a miners strike in colorado and jailed in solitary confinement.
at her funeral in 1930 one speaker urged people to remember her famous rallying cry pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living anarchism one of the many challenges facing the labor union movement during the gilded age was growing hostility from m iddle class americans who came to view unionized workers especially those involved in clashes with police as radicals or anarchists anarchists believed that government any government was a device used by powerful capitalists to oppress and exploit the working poor.
they dreamed of the elimination of government altogether and some were willing to use bombs and bullets to achieve their revolutionary goal.
many european anarchists immigrated to the united states during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
although most of them disavowed violence the terrorists among them ensured that the label anarchist provoked frightening images in the minds of many americans.
labor related violence increased during the 1880s as the gap between the rich and working poor widened.
between 1880 and 1900 some 6 6 million hourly workers participated in more than 23 000 strikes nationwide.
chicago 788 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 was a hotbed of labor unrest and a magnet for immigrants especially german and irish laborers some of whom were socialists or anarchists who endorsed violence.
the chicago labor movements foremost demand was for an e ight hour workday and what came to be called the haymarket riot grew indirectly out of prolonged agitation for this goal.
the haymarket riot 1886 in 1886 some 40 000 chicago workers went on strike in support of an e ight hour workday.
on may 3 violent clashes between strikers and nonunion scabs hired to replace striking w orkers erupted outside the mccormick harvesting machine company plant.
the police arrived shots rang out and two strikers were killed.
the killings infuriated the leaders of the tiny but outspoken anarchist movement in chicago.
august spies a g erman born anarchist leader printed leaflets in english and german demanding revenge and calling workingmen to arms a mass protest was planned for the following night at haymarket square.
on the evening of may 4 after listening to speeches complaining about low wages and long working hours the crowd of angry laborers was beginning to break up when police arrived and ordered them to disperse.
at that point someone threw a bomb that left dozens of maimed and dying policemen scattered in the street.
the police then fired into the fleeing crowd resulting in more casualties.
seven policemen were killed and sixty more wounded in what journalists called americas first terrorist bombing.
the next day chicagos mayor banned all labor meetings in the city and newspapers printed sensational headlines about anarchists terrorizing chicago.
one new york newspaper demanded stern punishment for the few l ong haired wild eyed bad smelling atheistic reckless foreign wretches who promoted such unrest.
during the summer of 1886 seven anarchist leaders all but one of them german speakers were sentenced to death despite the lack of evidence linking them to the bomb thrower whose identity was never determined.
after being sentenced to be hanged louis lingg declared that he was innocent but was in favor of using force to end the abuses of the capitalist system.
lawyers for the anarchists appealed the convictions to the illinois supreme court.
meanwhile petitioners from around the world appealed for clemency.
one of the petitioners was samuel gompers the founding president of the american federation of labor afl.
i abhor anarchy gompers stressed but i also abhor injustice when meted out even to the most despicable being on earth on november 10 1887 louis lingg committed suicide in his cell.
that same day the governor commuted the sentences of two of the convicted con the dreadful chill of change 789 spirators to life imprisonment.
the next day as armed police and soldiers surrounded the cook county jail the four remaining condemned men were hanged.
some 200 000 people lined the streets of chicago as the caskets of those executed were taken for burial.
to labor militants around the world the executed anarchists were working class martyrs to the police and the economic elite in chicago they were demonic assassins.
a backlash against unions after the haymarket riot tensions between workers and management reached a fever pitch.
in 1886 alone there were 1 400 strikes across the country involving 700 000 workers.
but the violence in chicago had also triggered widespread hostility to the knights of labor and labor groups in general.
despite his best efforts union leader terence powderly could never separate in the public mind the knights from the anarchists since one of those convicted of conspiracy in the bombing was a member of the union.
powderly clung to leadership until 1893 but after that the union evaporated.
yet the knights did attain some lasting achievements among them an 1880 federal law providing for the arbitration of labor disputes and the creation of the federal bureau of labor statistics in 1884.
another of their successes was the foran act of 1885 which though poorly enforced penalized employers who imported immigrant workers.
by their example the knights also spread the idea of unionism and initiated a new type of organization the industrial union which included all skilled and unskilled workers within a particular industry such as railroad workers or miners.
gompers and the afl the craft unions representing skilled workers generally opposed efforts to unite with industrial unionism.
samuel gompers the head of the american federation of labor strikes an assertive pose.
790 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 leaders of the craft unions feared that joining with unskilled laborers would mean a loss of their identity and bargaining power.
thus in 1886 delegates from twenty five craft unions organized the american federation of labor afl.
its structure differed from that of the knights of labor in that it was a federation of many separate national unions each of which was largely free to act on its own in dealing with business owners.
samuel gompers served as president of the afl from its founding until his death in 1924 with only one years interruption.
born in england gompers came to the united states as a teenager joined the cigar makers union in 1864 and became president of his new york city local union in 1877.
unlike terence powderly and the knights of labor gompers focused on concrete economic g ains higher wages shorter hours and better working conditions.
the afl at first grew slowly but by the turn of the century it claimed 500 000 members in affiliated unions.
in 1914 on the eve of world war i it had 2 million and in 1920 it reached a peak of 4 million.
but even then the afl embraced less than 15 percent of the nations nonagricultural workers.
in fact all unions including the so called railroad brotherhoods unaffiliated with the afl accounted for little more than 18 percent of those workers.
organized labors strongholds were in transportation and the building trades.
most of the larger manufacturing industries including steel textiles tobacco and meatpacking remained almost untouched.
gompers never opposed industrial unions and several became important affiliates of the afl the united mine workers the international ladies garment workers and the amalgamated clothing workers.
but the afl had its greatest success in organizing skilled workers.
two incidents in the 1890s stalled the emerging industrial union movement the homestead steel strike of 1892 and the pullman strike of 1894.
these violent labor conflicts were the climactic economic events of the gilded age and represented a test of strength for the organized labor movement.
they also served to reshape the political landscape.
the homestead steel strike the amalgamated association of iron and steel workers founded in 1876 was the nations largest craft union.
at the massive steel mill at homestead pennsylvania along the monongahela river near pittsburgh the union had enjoyed friendly relations with andrew carnegies company until henry clay frick became chief executive in 1889.
a showdown was delayed until 1892 however when the union contract came up for renewal.
carnegie who had previously expressed sympathy for the dreadful chill of change 791 the unions went on a lengthy hunting trip in his native scotland intentionally leaving the rigid frick to handle the difficult negotiations.
carnegie knew what was in the works a cost cutting reduction in the number of highly paid skilled workers through the use of l abor saving machinery even though the corporation was enjoying high profits.
it was a deliberate attempt to smash the union.
am with you to the end carnegie wrote to frick after leaving for scotland.
william jones the mill manager disagreed with his bosses.
he opposed cutting wages because our men are working hard and faithfully.
now mark what i tell you.
our labor is the cheapest in the country joness protests did little good.
as negotiations dragged on the company announced on june 25 that it would stop negotiating with the 3 800 workers on june 29 unless an agreement was reached.
a s trike or more properly a lockout in which management closed down the mill to try to force the union to make c oncessions would begin on that date.
frick told journalists that he was determined to have absolute control of our plant and business frick ordered construction of a twelve foot high fence around the plant and equipped it with watchtowers searchlights barbed wire and high pressure water cannons.
he also hired a private army of 316 pinkerton agents to protect what was soon dubbed fort frick.
before dawn on july 6 1892 the pinkertons floated up the monongahela river on two barges pulled by a tugboat.
thousands of unionists and their supporters many of them armed were waiting on shore.
a f ourteen hour battle broke out in which seven workers and three pinkertons were killed and dozens wounded.
hundreds of women on shore shouted kill the pinkertons in the end the pinkertons surrendered having agreed to be tried for murder and were marched away to taunts from crowds lining the streets.
a week later the pennsylvania governor dispatched 4 000 state militiamen to homestead where they surrounded the steel mill and dispersed the picketing workers.
frick then hired strikebreakers to operate the mill.
he refused to resume negotiations i will never recognize the union never never the strike dragged on until november but by then the union was dead and its leaders had been charged with murder and treason.
the union cause was not helped when alexander berkman a lithuanian anarchist tried to assassinate frick on july 23 shooting him twice in the neck and stabbing him three times.
despite his wounds frick fought back fiercely and with the help of staff members subdued the would be assassin.
much of the local sympathy for the strikers evaporated.
as a union leader explained berkmans bullets went straight through the heart of the homestead 792 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 strike penniless and demoralized the defeated workers ended their walkout on november 20 and accepted the companys harsh wage cuts.
only a fifth of the strikers were hired back the rest were blacklisted to prevent other steel mills from hiring them.
carnegie and frick with the support of local state and national government officials had eliminated the union.
after the homestead strike none of carnegies steel plants employed unionized workers.
within a few years carnegie could confide to a friend that he was ashamed to tell you how large his profits were from the homestead plant.
with each passing year carnegie nursed regrets about how frick handled the homestead strike.
in the end an embittered frick split with carnegie after he learned that his boss had been telling lies about him and making insults about his character.
frick told carnegie that he had grown tired of your business methods your absurd newspaper interviews and personal remarks and unwarranted interference in matters you know nothing about when carnegie sought to reconcile with his former lieutenant frick told the messenger you can say to andrew carnegie that i will meet him in hell where we are both going the pullman strike the pullman strike of 1894 was even more notable as it paralyzed the economies of the twenty seven states and territories in the western half of the nation.
it involved a dispute at pullman illinois a model industrial suburb of chicago owned by the pullman palace car company which made passenger train cars called pullmans or sleeping cars.
employees were required to live in the towns 1 400 cottages which had been built to high standards with gas heat and indoor plumbing.
with 12 000 residents the town also boasted a library a theater a school parks and playgrounds and a glass roofed shopping mall owned by the company.
there were no saloons social clubs newspapers or private property not owned by the company.
no political activities were allowed.
as a company town pullman was of much higher quality than the villages in the south owned by textile mills and the death rate was less than half of that in neighboring communities.
yet over time many workers complained that they did not like living under the thumb of the companys owner george pullman.
during the depression of 1893 pullman laid off 3 000 of his 5 800 employees and cut wages 25 to 40 percent for the rest but did not lower rents for housing or the price of food in the company store.
in the spring of 1894 desperate workers joined the american railway union founded the previous year by eugene v debs.
the dreadful chill of change 793 eugene v debs founder of the american railway union and later the presidential candidate for the socialist party of america.
the charismatic debs was a child of working class immigrants who had quit school at age fourteen to work for an indiana railroad.
by the early 1890s he had become a tireless spokesman for labor radicalism and he worked to organize all railway w orkers skilled or u nskilled into the american railway union which soon became a powerful organization.
he quickly turned his attention to the pullman controversy urging the workers to obey the laws and avoid violence.
after george pullman fired three members of a workers grievance committee the workers went on strike on may 11 1894.
in june after pullman refused debss plea for a negotiated settlement the railway union workers stopped handling trains containing pullman railcars.
by the end of july they had shut down most of the railroads in the midwest and cut off all traffic through chicago.
to keep the trains running railroad executives hired strikebreakers and the u s attorney general a former attorney for railroad companies swore in 3 400 special deputies to protect them.
angry workers assaulted strikebreakers and destroyed property.
finally on july 3 president grover cleveland sent 2 000 federal troops into the chicago area claiming it was his duty to ensure delivery of the mail.
meanwhile the attorney general convinced a federal judge to sign an injunction an official court decree prohibiting the labor union from interfering.
794 chapter 17 business and labor in the industrial era 1860 1900 the pullman strike federal troops guarding the railroads 1894.
on july 13 the union called off the strike.
a few days later a court cited debs for violating the injunction he served six months in jail.
the supreme court upheld the decree in the case of in re debs 1895 on broad grounds of national sovereignty the strong arm of the national government may be put forth to brush away all obstructions to the freedom of interstate commerce or the transportation of the mails debs emerged from jail a socialist who would later run for president.
in 1897 george pullman died of a heart attack and the following year the city of chicago annexed the town of pullman.
a reporter for the nation noted that despite the towns attractive features what the workers wanted most was the chance to own a house of their own.
pullman he explained overlooked this peculiar american characteristic economic success and excess for all of the stress and strain caused by swift industrialization american productivity soared in the late nineteenth century.
by 1900 the united states was producing a third of the worlds goods and millions of immigrants from around the world continued to risk all in hopes of chasing the american dream.
corporate empires generated enormous fortunes for a few and real improvements in the quality of life for many.
the majority of workers now labored in factories and mines rather than on farms.
one can hardly believe observed philosopher john dewey there has been a revolution in history so rapid so extensive so complete the dreadful chill of change 795 the urban industrial revolution and the gigantic new corporations it created transformed the size scope and power of the american economy for good and for ill as the twentieth century dawned an unregulated capitalist economy had grown corrupt and recklessly out of balance and only government intervention could restore economic fairness and social stability.
chapter review summary the causes of industrial growth during the late nineteenth century agricultural and industrial production increased sharply.
the national railroad network grew to nearly 200 000 miles the most extensive in the world.
the surge of industrialization expanded use of electrical power and the application of scientific research to industrial processes.
the bessemer converter allowed for the mass production of steel which was used to construct railroads ships bridges and buildings.
the rise of big business many businesses grew to enormous size and power often ignoring ethics and the law in doing so.
entrepreneurs like john d rockefeller andrew carnegie and j pierpont morgan were extraordinarily skilled at gaining control of particular industries.
companies such as standard oil and carnegie steel practiced both vertical integration through which they controlled all the enterprises needed to produce and distribute their products and horizontal integration in which they absorbed or eliminated their competitors.
to consolidate their holdings and sidestep laws prohibiting monopolies they created trusts and eventually holding companies.
j pierpont morgan and company an investment bank pioneered methods for consolidating corporations and eliminating competition all in an effort to bring order and stability to the marketplace.
the alliance of business and politics the federal government encouraged economic growth after the civil war by imposing high tariffs on imported products granting public land to railroad companies and settlers in the west establishing a stable currency and encouraging the creation of universities to spur technical innovation and research.
equally important local state and federal governments made little effort to regulate the activities of businesses.
this laissez faire policy allowed entrepreneurs to experiment with new methods of organization but also created conditions for rampant corruption and abuse.
a changed social order while the business and financial elite showed off their new wealth with extravagant homes and parties the urban and industrial workforce was largely composed of unskilled workers including recent immigrants former farmers and growing numbers of women and children.
child labor sometimes involved children as young as eight working twelve hour days.
business owners and managers showed little concern for workplace safety and accidents and work related diseases were common.
with industrialization and the rise of big business also came an increase in the number of people who considered themselves middle class.
growing numbers of women went to college took business and professional jobs and participated in other public activities.
organized labor it was difficult for unskilled workers to organize effectively into unions in part because of racial and ethnic tensions among laborers language barriers and the efforts of owners and supervisors to undermine unionizing efforts.
business owners often hired strikebreakers usually desperate immigrant workers who were willing to take jobs at the prevailing wage.
nevertheless several unions did advocate for workers rights at a national level.
the national labor union and the knights of labor organized strikes and lobbied for workers in the 1870s and 1880s but both groups eventually fell apart.
after the violence associated with the haymarket riot the homestead steel strike and the pullman strike many americans grew fearful of unions and viewed them as politically radical.
craft unions made up solely of skilled workers became more successful at organizing as the american federation of labor focused on better working conditions and avoided involvement in politics.

this illustration shows a cutaway of the comstock lode revealing the complex network of shafts and supports as well as the various tasks performed by miners within its tunnels.
a fter the civil war the devastated south and the untamed west provided enticing frontiers for economic enterprise.
the south had to be rebuilt while the sparsely settled territories and states west of the mississippi river were ripe for the development of farms businesses railroads and towns.
bankers and financiers in america and in europe took advantage of these conditions to invest heavily in both regions but especially in the far western region between the mississippi river and california.
the great plains had long been viewed as a barren landscape suitable only for indians and animals.
half of texas for instance was still not settled at the end of the civil war.
after 1865 however the federal government encouraged western settlement and economic development in what was then called indian country two thirds of native americans in 1865 lived on the great plains often warring with one another over rival hunting rights to the vast buffalo herds.
the construction of transcontinental railroads the military conquest of the indians and the policy of distributing g overnment owned lands at low cost to settlers ranchers miners and railroads combined to lure millions of pioneers and enterprising capitalists westward.

640 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 however much jefferson davis and other southerners argued that secession and the war were about states rights the states of the lower south seceded in 1860 1861 to protect slavery.
the evidence is overwhelming.
the south carolina declaration on the immediate causes of secession for example was quite clear on the reasons for secession highlighting the increasing hostility on the part of the n on slaveholding states to the institution of slavery mississippi only mentioned one reason for seceding preserving slavery.
georgian alexander stephens the vice president of the confederate states of america was equally emphatic saying that slavery was the immediate cause of secession and war.
and as lincoln noted in his second inaugural address everyone knew that slavery was somehow the cause of the war certainly that was true for nathan bedford forrest a tennessee slave trader and wealthy planter who would become one of the confederacys most valued and controversial cavalry generals.
years after the war he exploded while listening to confederate veterans giving flowery orations in which they claimed that the south had fought the civil war to defend states rights.
the plain speaking forrest stood and shouted that he fought for one reason to keep his niggers and other folks niggers on april 15 three days after the confederate attack on fort sumter lincoln called upon the loyal states to supply 75 000 soldiers to suppress the rebellion.
senator stephen douglas insisted that there are only two sides to the question of civil war.
every man must be for the united states or against it.
there can be no neutrals in this war only patriots or traitors the civil war would force e veryone men and women white and black immigrants and native americans free and e nslaved to choose sides.
thousands of southerners fought for the union thousands of northerners fought for the confederacy.
thousands of european volunteers fought on each side.
choosing sides the first seven states to secede were all from the lower s outh south carolina mississippi florida alabama georgia louisiana and t exas where the cotton economy was strongest and slaves the most numerous.
all the states in the upper south especially tennessee and virginia had areas mainly in the mountains where whites were poor slaves were scarce and union support was strong.
nevertheless the outbreak of actual fighting led four more southern slave states to join the confederacy virginia arkansas tennessee and north carolina.
in east tennessee however the mountain counties would provide more union soldiers than confederate fighters.
thirty nine counties in mountainous choosing sides 641 western virginia were so loyal to the union that they split off and formed the new state of west virginia in october 1861.
of the slaveholding states along the border between north and south delaware remained firmly in the union but maryland kentucky and missouri went through bitter struggles to decide which side to support.
i think to lose kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game lincoln said to a friend explaining the situation in the state where he was born.
if kentucky were to join the confederacy we cannot hold missouri nor as i think mary land lincoln hoped to have god on my side but i must have kentucky the president was so determined to keep slaveholding kentucky on the union side that he muffled all talk of abolition.
if maryland had seceded confederates would have surrounded washington d c to keep maryland in the union lincoln had pro confederate secession 1860 1861 illinois kansas territory in wv missouri kentucky unorganized territory texas feb 1 1861 pa ohio tennessee may 7 1861 ar may 6 ms jan 9 al jan 11 md nj de va april 17 nc may 20 sc dec 20 georgia jan 19 louisiana jan 26 1861 florida jan 10 states seceding before fort sumters surrender mexico 200 miles 100 200 kilometers states seceding after fort sumters surrender slave states adhering to the union free states and territories adhering to the union why did south carolina and six other states secede from the union before the siege at fort sumter.

figure m15 1 1st proof how did lincoln keep maryland in the union.
642 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 leaders arrested including baltimores mayor and chief of police.
the fragile neutrality of kentucky lasted until september 3 when confederate and union armies moved into the divided state.
kentucky voters elected a secessionist governor and a unionist majority in the state legislature as did missouri a state with many european immigrants especially germans.
when a p ro confederate militia gathered in st louis hoping to take control of the federal arsenal it was surprised and disarmed by german immigrants eager to teach the german haters a never to be forgotten lesson the german militiamen then chased the p ro confederate governor across the border to arkansas.
when news of the civil war reached missouri 4 200 men volunteered to join the union army all but 100 of them were german americans.
on the eve of the civil war the u s army had only 16 400 men about 1 000 of whom were officers.
of them about 25 percent like future confederate general robert e lee resigned to join the confederate army.
on the other hand many southerners made great sacrifices to remain loyal to the union.
some left their native region once the fighting began others remained in the south but found ways to support the union.
some 100 000 men from the southern states fought against the confederacy.
regional advantages once battle lines were finally drawn the union held twenty three states including four border slave states missouri kentucky maryland and delaware while the confederacy had eleven states.
the population count was about 22 million in the union some 400 000 of whom were enslaved african americans to 9 million in the confederacy of whom about 3 5 million were enslaved.
to help balance the odds the confederacy mobilized 80 percent of its military age white men a third of whom would die during the four year war.
an even greater advantage for the north was its superior industrial development.
as southerner rhett butler complains in the classic movie gone with the wind 1939 why all we have in the south is cotton and slaves and arrogance the hated yankees he adds have the factories the foundries the shipyards the iron and coal mines all the things we havent got the southern states produced just 7 percent of the nations manufactured goods on the eve of the war.
the union states produced 97 percent of the firearms and 96 percent of the railroad equipment.
the north also had a huge advantage in transportation particularly ships.
at the start of the war the union had ninety warships the south had no navy at all.
federal gunboats and transports played a direct role in securing the unions control of the mississippi river and its larger tributaries which provided easy invasion routes into the center of the confederacy.
early on choosing sides 643 the u s watervliet arsenal in watervliet new york the north had a huge advantage in industrial development and its foundries turned out most of the firearms used by union forces.
the union navys blockade of the major southern ports sharply reduced the amount of cotton that could be exported to britain and france as well as the flow of goods including military weapons imported from europe.
in addition the union had more wagons and horses than the confederacy and an even more impressive edge in the number of railroad locomotives.
the confederates however had major geographic and emotional advantages they could fight a war on their own territory in defense of their homeland.
in warfare it is usually easier to defend than to attack since defending troops have the opportunity to dig protective trenches and fortifications.
in the civil war 90 percent of the time armies that assaulted well defended positions were mauled.
many confederate leaders thought that if they could hold out long enough disgruntled northern voters might convince lincoln and congress to end the war.
as the two sides mobilized the confederacy had more experienced military leaders and better horsemen.
many confederates also displayed a brash sense of confidence.
after all had not the revolutionaries of 1776 defeated a much stronger british army.
britain could not conquer three million americans a louisianan declared and the world cannot conquer the south the wars early strategies the two sides initially had quite different goals.
the confederacy sought to convince the union and the world to recognize its independence.
the united 644 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 states on the other hand fought to restore the union.
the future of slavery was not yet an issue.
after the fall of fort sumter neither side was ready to wage war but excited newspaper editors and politicians on both sides pressured the generals to strike quickly.
forward to richmond screamed a new york newspaper headline.
in the summer of 1861 jefferson davis told general pierre g t beauregard to rush the main confederate army to manassas junction a railroad crossing in northern virginia about twenty five miles southwest of washington.
president lincoln hoped that the union army often called federals would overrun the outnumbered confederates often called rebels and quickly push on to richmond only 107 miles to the south.
what a picnic predicted a new york soldier to go down south for three months and clean up the whole business first bull run when word reached washington d c that the two armies were converging for battle hundreds of civilians packed picnic lunches and went to watch the spectacle assuming that the first clash of arms would be short glorious and bloodless.
it was a hot dry day on july 21 1861 when 37 000 untested union recruits breezily marched to battle some of them breaking ranks to eat blackberries or drink water from streams along the way.
many of them died with the berry juice still staining their lips as they engaged the confederates dug in behind a branch of the potomac river called first bull run moments before battle a spectator in a top hat chats with union soldiers bottom right while an artist sketches the passing troops breezily heading to war at left.
choosing sides 645 bull run near the manassas junction railroad station.
for most of the soldiers the battle at bull run was their first taste of the chaos and confusion of combat.
many were disoriented by the smoke from gunpowder and saltpeter the deafening roar of cannon fire the screaming of fallen comrades and the distinctive sound of bullets whizzing past.
because neither side yet wore s tandard colored uniforms the soldiers had trouble deciding friend from foe.
the union troops almost won the battle early in the afternoon.
we fired a volley wrote a massachusetts private and saw the rebels running.
the boys were saying constantly in great glee weve whipped them well hang jeff davis from a sour apple tree theyre running the war is over but confederate reinforcements poured in to tip the balance.
amid the furious fighting a south carolina officer rallied his troops by pointing to the courageous example of thomas jacksons men look.
there is general jackson with his virginians standing like a stone wall jackson ordered his men to charge the faltering union ranks urging them to yell like furies from that day forward stonewall became jacksons popular nickname and he would be the most celebrated and feared confederate commander.
the union armys retreat from bull run turned into a panicked rout the great skedaddle as fleeing soldiers and terrified civilians clogged the road to washington d c.
the victorious confederates however were so disorganized and exhausted that they failed to give chase.
as the armies moved on they left behind a battlefield strewn with the dead and the dying mangled men and bloated horses and mules all scattered among discarded knapsacks canteens blankets rifles wagons and cannons.
stonewall jackson sent his wife a letter reporting that we fought a great battle and gained a great victory for which all the glory is due to god alone his union counterpart general william t sherman admitted that the federals had suffered a terrible defeat during which many inexperienced soldiers degenerated into an armed mob the news of the confederate victory triggered sharp criticism of president lincoln.
michigan senator zachariah chandler a republican dismissed the president as timid vacillating inefficient an ohio republican was even more critical denouncing lincoln as an admitted failure who has no will no courage no executive capacity lincoln however learned from defeat.
the hallmark of his presidency was his ability to acknowledge his mistakes and move forward.
with each passing year he would grow more sure of himself as a wartime leader.
the first battle of bull run or first manassas was a sobering experience for both sides each of which miscalculated the others strength and tenacity.
the federals most often named battles for natural features the confederates for nearby towns thus bull run manassas antietam sharpsburg stones river murfreesboro and the like.
646 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 much of the romance of war the colorful uniforms bright flags marching bands and rousing songs gave way to the agonizing realization that this would be a long costly grim struggle.
harpers weekly bluntly warned from the fearful day at bull run dates war.
not polite war not incredulous war but war that breaks hearts and blights homes the unions anaconda plan the battle of bull run demonstrated that the war would not be decided with one sudden stroke.
general winfield scott the seventy five year old commander of the union war effort devised a three pronged strategy that called first for the army of the potomac the main union army to defend washington d c and exert constant pressure on the confederate capital at richmond.

why did the confederates not pursue the retreating union army.
wwn64 figure m15 2 1st proof choosing sides 647 at the same time the federal navys blockade of southern ports would cut off the confederacys access to foreign goods and weapons.
the final component of the plan called for other union armies to divide the confederacy by pushing south along the crucial inland water routes the mississippi tennessee and cumberland rivers.
this so called anaconda plan was intended to slowly trap and crush the southern resistance like an anaconda snake strangling its prey.
confederate strategy confederate president jefferson davis was better prepared than lincoln at the start of the war to guide military strategy.
a graduate of the u s military academy at west point he had served with distinction both as an officer during the m exican american war and as u s secretary of war from 1853 to 1857.
if the war could be prolonged davis and others hoped then the british or french desperate for southern cotton might be persuaded to join their cause.
or perhaps a long war would influence public sentiment in the north and force lincoln to seek a negotiated settlement.
so while armies were forming in the south confederate diplomats were seeking military and financial assistance in london and paris and confederate sympathizers in the north were urging an end to the unions war effort.
the confederate representatives in paris won a promise from france to recognize the confederacy as a new nation if great britain would do the same.
but the british refused partly in response to pressure from president lincoln and partly out of britains desire to maintain its trade with the united states.
confederate leaders had assumed that britain would support the south in order to get its cotton.
the cards are in our hands crowed the mercury a charleston newspaper.
and we intend to play them out to the bankruptcy of every cotton factory in great britain and france for the acknowledgement of our independence as it turned out however the british were able to import enough cotton from india to maintain production.
in the end confederate diplomacy in europe was more successful in getting military supplies than in gaining official recognition of the confederacy as an independent nation.
forming armies once fighting began president lincoln called for 500 000 more men a staggering number at the time and one that the confederacy struggled to match.
and volunteers are the only topics of conversation or thought wrote a student at ohios oberlin college.

charleston wrote mary chesnut the literary wife of a prominent planter was crowded with soldiers who feared the war will be over before they get a sight of the fun tennessees twenty one year old sam watkins reported that everyone in his town was eager for the war the basic unit of the nineteenth century u s army was the regiment about 1 000 soldiers and during the civil war most regiments were made up of friends neighbors and relatives from the same local community.
ethnic groups also formed their own regiments.
a quarter of the union troops were foreign born.
the union army for example included a scandinavian regiment the 15th wisconsin infantry a french regiment the 55th new york infantry a polish legion the 58th new york infantry and a mixed regiment of poles hungarians germans spaniards and italians the 39th new york infantry.
many immigrant soldiers did not speak english.
immigrants were attracted to serve for many reasons a strong belief in the union cause cash bonuses regular pay or the need for a steady job.
whatever the reason the high proportion of immigrants in the union army gave it an ethnic diversity absent in the confederate ranks.
many of the first confederate army units chose flamboyant names the frontier guards rough and ready grays game cocks tigers cherokee lincoln killers tallapoosa thrashers and raccoon roughs.
because the confederacy had a smaller male population than the north jefferson davis was forced to enact a conscription law mandatory military draft.
on april 16 1862 all white males between eighteen and thirty five were required to serve in the army for three years.
from this time until the end of the war a tennessee soldier wrote a soldier was simply a machine a conscript.
all our pride and valor had gone and we were sick of war and cursed the southern confederacy the confederate conscription law included controversial loopholes.
a draftee might avoid service either by paying a substitute who was not of draft age or by paying 500 to the government.
elected officials and key civilian workers as well as planters with twenty or more slaves were exempted from military service.
many among the planter elite argued that if they left to fight their slaves would escape or riot.
equally galling to many confederate soldiers was the behavior of wealthy officers who brought their enslaved servants with them to army camps.
choosing sides 649 the u s army recruiting office in city hall park new york city the sign advertises the money offered to those willing to serve 677 to new recruits 777 to veteran soldiers and 15 to anyone who brought in a recruit.
the union waited nearly a year to force men into service.
in 1863 with the war going badly for the federal armies the government began to draft men.
as in the south northerners found ways to avoid military service.
exemptions were granted to selected federal and state officeholders and to others on medical or compassionate grounds or a draftee might pay 300 to avoid service.
such exemptions led to bitter complaints on both sides about the conflict being a rich mans war and a poor mans fight the civil war also divided families.
lincolns wife had four brothers who fought for the rebel side.
the son of lincolns attorney general edward bates fought for the confederacy.
in june 1862 two brothers alexander and james campbell fought against each other at the battle of secessionville on james island south carolina.
alexander joined union forces in assaulting a confederate fort one of whose defenders was his brother.
afterward james wrote his brother expressing astonishment that alexander had been among the union attackers.
doing my best to beat you but i hope that you and i will never again meet face to face but if they should he urged his brother to do your duty to your cause for i can assure you i will strive to discharge my duty to my country my cause the life of a soldier the average civil war soldier or sailor was twenty five years old stood five feet eight inches and weighed 143 pounds.
650 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 a third of the southern soldiers could neither read nor write.
one in nine would be killed or wounded.
half of the union soldiers and two thirds of the confederates were farmers.
army camps featured their own libraries theatrical stages churches and numerous mascot p ets and monotonous routine.
because most of the fighting was seasonal in the spring and summer soldiers spent far more time preparing for war than actually fighting.
a pennsylvania private wrote home that the first thing in the morning is drill.
then drill then drill again.
then drill drill a little more drill then drill lastly drill life in army camps was difficult at best.
when not training soldiers spent time outdoors in makeshift shelters or in small tents talking reading books newspapers or letters playing cards or checkers singing songs smoking pipes washing and mending clothes and fighting swarms of lice ticks chiggers and mosquitoes.
their diet was plain and dull baked bread crackers called hardtack salted meat pork or beef and coffee.
a favorite camp song included the following lyrics let us close our game of poker take our tin cups in our hand while we gather round the cooks tent door where dry mummies of hard crackers are given to each man o hard crackers come again no more.
some soldiers could not stand the rigors and strains of combat and camp life.
des ertions soared with each passing year as did incidents of drunkenness thievery and insubordination.
punishments varied.
some deserters were executed either shot or hanged.
others were tied to a ball and chain forced to bury dead horses or tend to animals or drummed out of the service.
most of those who served on either side however came to view their military experience as beneficial.
charles biddlecom for example concluded that the army was a very good school for hot heads such as i was military service helped him mature into a man.
mixed motives several million mostly young and inexperienced americans fought in the civil war.
as in all great wars their motives for doing so varied dramatically.
sullivan ballou a t hirty two year old rhode island lawyer and legislator who enlisted in the union army wrote his wife that he would have loved nothing more than to have stayed with his family and seen their sons grow to honorable manhood but his ultimate priority was serving his country.
he felt a great debt to those who went before us through the choosing sides 651 union soldiers smoking their pipes these soldiers share a moment of rest and a bottle of whiskey.
blood and sufferings of the revolution a week later ballou was killed in the first battle of bull run.
in his last letter to his wife he had expressed a premonition of death do not mourn me dead.
wait for me for we shall meet again southerners felt the same sense of patriotism and manly honor.
an alabama planter explained to his anxious wife why he had to fight.
my honor my duty your reputation that of my darling little boy he stressed forced him to don a uniform when our bleeding country needs the services of every man as the months passed and the suffering grew however many combatants on both sides saw their initial enthusiasm fade.
charles biddlecom a farmer from upstate new york volunteered in may 1861 as an enlisted man in the union army.
he was eager to get the fuss with the south over and whip the southern whelps by 1863 however biddlecom had had enough of war.
sick with dysentery overrun with lice and miserably lonesome he and three comrades were forced to live in a little dog kennel just four feet high.
although he still hated slaveholders he now felt it might have been better in the end to have let the south go out peaceably and tried her hand at making a nation like many other soldiers and sailors on both sides biddlecoms moods and motives for fighting fluctuated wildly depending upon the course of the war.
in 1864 he confessed that the union army was worn out discouraged and demoralized he stuck it out to preserve his sense of manly honor but 652 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 as for men fighting from pure love of country i think them as few as white blackbirds he declared that he was neither a union saver nor a freedom shrieker at one point he had heard enough about a war to free the slaves to hell with the devilish twaddle about freedom by the time the war ended however biddlecoms emotions had again reversed themselves with the union victory.
he celebrated the defeat of the confederacy for affirming that freedom shall extend over the whole nation the greatest nation of earth showed that it would not surrender to traitors in arms blacks in the south as had happened during the revolutionary war and the war of 1812 enslaved african americans took advantage of the confusion created by the war to run away engage in sabotage join the union war effort or pursue their own interests.
a plantation owner in tennessee was disgusted by the wars effect on his slaves as he confessed in his diary my negroes all at home but working only as they see fit doing little some slaves had reported that they would serve the federals rather than work on the farm later he revealed that when union armies arrived in the area his slaves had stampeded to join the yankees many of my servants have run away and most of those left had just as well be gone they being totally demoralized and ungovernable some enslaved blacks escaped and served as spies or guides for union forces others joined the union army or navy.
fighting in the west kansas the most intense fighting west of the mississippi occurred along the k ansas missouri border where the disputes that had developed between the pro slavery and a nti slavery settlers in the 1850s turned into brutal guerrilla warfare.
the most prominent pro confederate leader in the area was william quantrill.
he and his followers mostly teenagers fought under a black flag meaning that they would kill anyone who surrendered.
in destroying lawrence kansas in 1863 quantrill ordered his men to kill every male and burn every house by the end of the day 182 boys and men had been massacred.
their opponents the j ayhawkers responded in kind.
they tortured and hanged pro confederate prisoners burned houses and destroyed livestock.
many indian nations got caught up in the war on both sides and in oklahoma they fought against each other.
indians among the five civilized tribes held african american slaves and felt a bond with southern whites.
oklahomas proximity to texas influenced the choctaws and chickasaws to support the confederacy.
the cherokees creeks and seminoles were more divided in fighting in the west 653 their loyalties.
the cherokees for example split in two some supporting the union and others the south.
kentucky and tennessee little happened of military significance east of the appalachian mountains before may 1862.
on the other hand important battles occurred in the west from the appalachians to the mississippi river.
in western kentucky confederate general albert sidney johnston had perhaps 40 000 men stretched over some 150 miles.
early in 1862 general ulysses s grant made the first union thrust against the weak center of johnstons overextended lines.
moving on boats out of cairo illinois and paducah kentucky the union army steamed up the tennessee river and captured fort henry in northern tennessee on february 6.
the relentless grant then moved quickly overland to attack nearby fort donelson on the cumberland river where on february 16 some 12 000 confederates surrendered.
this first major union victory touched off wild celebrations throughout the north.
president lincolns delight however was tempered by the death of his eleven year old son willie who succumbed to typhoid fever.
the tragedy overwhelmed the president.
a white house staff member said she had never seen a man so bowed down in grief shiloh after defeats in kentucky and tennessee the confederate forces in the west fled southward before regrouping under general johnston at corinth in northern mississippi near the tennessee border.
their goal was to protect the memphis and charleston railroad linking the lower mississippi valley and the atlantic coast.
while planning his attack on corinth grant made a costly mistake when he exposed his 42 000 troops on a rolling plateau between lick and snake creeks flowing into the tennessee river.
johnston recognized grants blunder and at dawn on sunday april 6 he launched a surprise attack urging his men to be worthy of your race and lineage worthy of the women of the south the 44 000 confederates struck at shiloh a whitewashed methodist chapel in the center of the union camp in southwestern tennessee.
most of grants troops were still sleeping or eating breakfast many died in their bedrolls.
after a day of confused fighting and terrible losses on both sides including confederate general johnston the fleeing union soldiers were pinned against the river.
one of them wrote that this is going to be a great battle such as i have been anxious to see for a long time and i think i have seen enough of it the new confederate commander pierre g t beauregard telegraphed president jefferson davis that his army had scored a complete victory driving the enemy from every position but his celebration was premature.

reinforced by 25 000 fresh union troops grants army took the offensive at dawn the next day and the confederates glumly withdrew twenty miles to corinth.
the union troops were too battered and weary to pursue.
confederate private sam watkins observed that those yankees were whipped fairly whipped and according to all the rules of war they ought to have retreated.
but they didnt another rebel soldier wrote home to his family that his first battle fighting in the west 655 had shaken him oh god forever keep me out of such another fight.
i was not scared.
i was just in danger shiloh a hebrew word meaning place of peace was the largest and costliest battle in which americans had ever engaged to that point.
viewing the battle said general sherman would have cured anybody of war of the 100 000 men who participated a quarter of them were killed or wounded seven times the casualties at the battle of bull run.
grant remembered that the battlefield was so littered with corpses that he could not walk in any direction without stepping on dead bodies he now realized that the only way the war would end would be through complete conquest like bull run earlier and so many battles to come shiloh was a story of missed opportunities and lucky accidents.
throughout the civil war winning armies would fail to pursue their retreating foes thus allowing the wounded opponent to slip away and fight again.
after shiloh union general henry halleck already jealous of grants success spread a false rumor that grant had been drinking during the battle.
some urged lincoln to fire grant but the president refused i cant spare this man he fights halleck however took grants place as field commander and as a result the union thrust in the mississippi valley southward ground to a halt.
new orleans just three weeks after the battle of shiloh however the union won a great naval victory at new orleans as sixty year old david g farraguts warships blasted their way past confederate forts under cover of darkness to take control of the largest city in the confederacy.
union general benjamin f butler a c ross eyed massachusetts democrat thereafter served as the military governor of captured new orleans.
when a confederate sympathizer ripped down a union flag butler had him hanged.
after a rebel woman leaned out her window and emptied her chamber pot on the head of newly promoted admiral farragut general butler decreed that any woman who was disrespectful of union soldiers would be treated as a woman of the town plying her avocation that is as a prostitute.
residents of the captured towns thereafter referred to general butler as the beast but they also quit harassing union soldiers and sailors.
the loss of new orleans was a devastating blow to the confederate economy.
the union army gained control of 1 500 cotton plantations and liberated 50 000 slaves in the mississippi valley.
as a result the slave system in louisiana was forever destroyed and worthless reported a northern journalist.
perryville in the late summer of 1862 general braxton braggs army of mississippi 30 000 strong used railroads to link up with general edmund 656 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 kirby smiths army of east tennessee.
their goal was to invade the north by taking control of the border state of kentucky.
they hoped to recruit volunteers for the confederacy as well as push the union army out of the state across the ohio river.
the confederates met the union army of ohio led by general don carlos buell at the central kentucky village of perryville in october 1862.
the outnumbered confederates attacked the union lines pushing them back more than a mile.
when bragg learned that union reinforcements were approaching however he ordered the army of mississippi to withdraw south toward tennessee.
after the battle of perryville the union retained control of kentucky for the rest of the war.
fighting in the east the fighting in the east remained fairly quiet for nine months after the battle of bull run.
in the wake of the union defeat lincoln had appointed glamorous general george b mcclellan stonewall jacksons classmate at west point and a former railroad president as head of the army of the potomac.
the thirty four year old mcclellan who encouraged journalists to call him little napoleon set about building the unions most powerful best trained army.
yet for all of his boundless self confidence i can do it all and demonstrated organizational ability mcclellans paralyzing cautiousness would prove crippling.
months passed while he remained in a state of perpetual preparation building and training his massive army to meet the superior numbers of confederates he mistakenly believed were facing him.
tardy george m cclellan always found a reason to do something other than engage the confederates in battle.
lincoln finally lost his patience and ordered mcclellan to attack.
mcclellans peninsular campaign in mid march 1862 mcclellan moved his huge army of 122 000 men on 400 ships and barges down the potomac river and the chesapeake bay to the mouth of the james river at the tip of the yorktown peninsula within sixty miles of the c onfederate capital of richmond virginia.
thousands of residents fled the city in panic but mcclellan overestimated the number of confederate defenders and waited too long to strike.
a frustrated lincoln told mcclellan that the war could be won only by engaging the rebel army.
once more lincoln told his commanding general let me tell you it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow on may 31 1862 confederate general joseph e johnston struck first at mcclellans army along the chickahominy river six miles east of richmond.

why did president lincoln demote mcclellan after the peninsular campaign.
wwn64 figure m15 4 1st proof r einforcements who somehow crossed the swollen river prevented a disastrous union defeat.
both sides took heavy casualties and johnston was severely wounded.
at this point robert e lee assumed command of the confederates main army the army of northern virginia a development that changed the course of the war.
the brilliant dignified lee had graduated second in his class at west point and during the mexican american war he had impressed general winfield scott as the very best soldier i ever saw in the field in 1857 scott predicted that lee would become americas greatest military leader.
lee would prove to be a daring even reckless strategist who was as aggressive 658 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 as mcclellan was timid.
he is silent inscrutable strong like a god said a confederate officer.
on july 9 when lincoln visited mcclellans headquarters on the coast of virginia the general complained that the administration had failed to support him and lectured the president at length on military strategy.
such insubordination was ample reason to relieve mcclellan of his overall command.
after returning to washington lincoln called henry halleck from the west to take charge.
second bull run lincoln and halleck ordered mcclellan to move his army of the potomac back robert e lee military adviser to president jefferson davis and later to washington d c and join with commander of the army of northern general john pope commander of virginia.
the union army of virginia in a new assault on richmond.
pope declared that his goal was attack and not defense in a letter to his wife a jealous mcclellan predicted accurately that pope will be thrashed and disposed of by lees army.
he also dismissed lincoln as an idiot lee moved northward to strike popes army before mcclellans troops could arrive.
lee knew that his only chance was to drive a wedge between the two larger union armies so that he could deal with them one at a time.
violating a basic rule of military strategy lee boldly divided his forces sending stonewall jacksons foot cavalry around popes flank to attack his supply lines in the rear.
at the second battle of bull run or manassas fought on almost the same site as the earlier battle a confused pope assumed that he faced only jackson but lees main army by that time had joined in.
on august 30 1862 a crushing confederate attack drove the larger union army from the field giving the confederates a sensational victory and leading one disheartened union officer to confess from his deathbed that general pope had been outwitted.
our generals have defeated us in contrast a rebel soldier wrote home that general lee stands now above all generals in modern history.
our men will follow him to the end emancipation 659 emancipation the confederate victories in 1862 devastated morale in the north and convinced lincoln that he had to take bolder steps to win the war.
now the north had to assault slavery itself.
when fighting began in 1861 the need to keep the border slave states delaware kentucky maryland and missouri in the union dictated caution on the volatile issue of emancipation.
beyond that lincoln had to contend with a deep seated racial prejudice among most northerners who were willing to allow slavery to continue in the south as long as it was not allowed to expand into the west.
lincoln himself harbored doubts about his constitutional authority to end slavery and he did not believe that blacks if freed could coexist with whites.
slaves in the war the expanding war forced the issue.
as federal forces pushed into the confederacy fugitive slaves began to turn up in union army camps and the commanders did not know whether to declare them free.
one general designated them as being contraband of war and thereafter the slaves who sought protection and freedom with union forces were known as contrabands.
some union officers put the refugee slaves to work digging trenches building fortifications and burying the dead others simply set them free.
lincoln meanwhile began to edge toward ending slavery.
on april 16 1862 he signed an act that abolished slavery in the district of columbia on june 19 he signed another bill that excluded slavery from the western territories.
still he insisted that the war was about restoring the union and ending secession not ending slavery.
but the course of the war changed lincolns outlook.
in the summer of 1862 he decided that emancipation of slaves in the confederate states was necessary to win the war.
many of the more than 3 million enslaved laborers in the confederacy were being forced to aid the rebel war e ffort digging trenches hauling supplies or cooking meals for the armies repairing railroads and working as servants for confederate officers.
in july 1862 lincoln confided to his cabinet that decisive and extreme measures to win the war must be adopted emancipation he said had become a military necessity absolutely necessary to the preservation of the union.
we must free the slaves or be ourselves subdued secretary of state william h seward agreed but advised lincoln to delay the announcement until after a union battlefield victory to avoid being viewed as desperate.
660 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 contrabands former slaves on a farm in cumberland landing virginia 1862 antietam a turning point robert e lee made his own momentous decision in the summer of 1862 he would invade maryland and thereby force the much weakened and demoralized army of the potomac and its timid commander mcclellan to leave northern virginia and relieve the pressure on richmond the confederate capital.
lee also hoped to influence the upcoming elections in the north he wanted to gain official british and french recognition of the confederacy which would bring his troops desperately needed military supplies.
in addition lee and jefferson davis planned to capture maryland with its many confederate supporters separate it from the union and gain control of its farms and foodstuffs needed for the war effort.
for those reasons and others in september 1862 lee and his 40 000 troops many of them ragged barefoot and underfed pushed north into western maryland.
on september 17 1862 the union and confederate armies clashed in the furious battle of antietam sharpsburg.
had not union soldiers discovered lees detailed battle plans wrapped around three cigars that a rebel soldier had carelessly dropped on the ground the confederates might have won.
mcclellan had he moved his 100 000 men more quickly could have destroyed lees army of northern virginia while it was scattered and on the move.
as always however mcclellan moved slowly enabling lee and his troops to regroup at sharpsburg between antietam creek and the potomac river.
there over the course of fourteen hours the poorly coordinated union army launched repeated attacks.
the fighting was savage a union officer counted hundreds of dead bodies lying in rows and in piles the scene after five hours of continuous slaughter was sickening harrowing horrible.
o what a terrible sight emancipation 661 lincolns search for a fighting general abraham lincoln and george c mcclellan confer at antietam in maryland october 4 1862.
the next day lee braced for another union attack but it never came.
that night cloaked by fog and drizzling rain the battered confederates slipped south back across the potomac river to the safety of virginia.
the barefoot boys have done some terrible fighting a georgian wrote his parents.
we are a dirty ragged set of soldiers mother but courage heroism find many a true disciple among us although the battle was technically a draw lees northern invasion had failed.
both sides displayed heroic courage and reckless bravery in what one rebel general called the hardest fought battle of the war mcclellan never known for his modesty claimed that he had fought the battle splendidly against great odds.
to him the battle of antietam was the most terrible battle of the age indeed it was the bloodiest single day in american military history.
some 6 400 soldiers on both sides were killed twice as many as at shiloh and another 17 000 were wounded or listed as missing.
the confederate people said a soldier wanted an active military campaign and general lee has certainly given it to us president lincoln was pleased that lees army had been forced to retreat but he was disgusted by mcclellans failure to attack the retreating confederates and win the war.
the president sent a sarcastic message to the general i have just read your dispatch about s ore tongued and fatigued horses.
will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done.
that fatigues anything failing to receive a satisfactory answer lincoln sacked mcclellan as commander of the army of the potomac and assigned him to recruiting duty in new jersey.
never again would mcclellan command troops but he would challenge lincoln for the presidency in 1864 as a democrat.
662 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 the battle of antietam had several important results.
it revived sagging northern morale dashed the confederacys hopes of forging alliances with great britain and france and convinced lincoln to transform the war from an effort to restore the union to a crusade to end slavery.
emancipation proclamation on september 22 1862 five days after the battle he issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation which warned the confederacy that if it did not stop fighting all slaves still under rebel control were to be made forever free in exactly 100 days on january 1 1863.
the emancipation proclamation was not based on ideas of racial equality or on abstract ideals of human dignity.
it was according to lincoln a military necessity the proclamation freed only those slaves in areas still controlled by the confederacy it had no bearing on slaves in the four border states because they remained in the union.
lincoln believed that the constitution allowed each state to decide the fate of slavery so his only legal avenue was to act as commander in chief of the armed forces rather than as president.
he would declare the end of slavery as a fit and necessary war measure to save the union.
union view of the emancipation proclamation a thoughtful lincoln composes the proclamation with the constitution and the bible in his lap.
the scales of justice hangs on the wall behind him.
emancipation 663 when lincoln officially signed the emancipation proclamation in january however he amended his original message adding that the proclamation was an act of justice as well as a military necessity.
lincolns constitutional concerns about abolishing slavery would lead him to promote the thirteenth amendment ending slavery across the nation.
as lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation he said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing the right thing than i do in signing this paper simply restoring the union was no longer the purpose of the war the transformation of the south and the slave system was now the goal.
reactions to emancipation lincolns threat to free slaves under confederate control triggered emotional reactions.
the illinois state register savaged the president for violating the constitution and causing the permanent disruption of the republic democrats exploded with rage calling the presidents decision dictatorial unconstitutional and catastrophic.
we wont fight to free the nigger proclaimed one popular banner.
many voters felt likewise.
lincoln forcefully responded to his critics.
you say you will not fight to free negroes he wrote.
some of them seem willing to fight for you but no confederate view of the emancipation proclamation surrounded by demonic faces hidden in his furnishings lincoln pens the proclamation with a foot trampling the constitution.
the devil holds the inkwell before him.
664 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 matter.
fight you then exclusively to save the union.
i issued the emancipation proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union in the november 1862 congressional elections republicans lost almost two dozen seats.
illinois indiana pennsylvania new york and ohio went democratic largely because of opposition to the emancipation proclamation.
even lincolns home district in illinois elected a democrat.
although lincolns proclamation technically would free only the slaves where confederates remained in control many slaves in the northern border states and the south claimed their freedom anyway.
as lincoln had hoped word spread rapidly among the slave community in the confederacy arousing hopes of freedom creating general confusion in the cities and encouraging hundreds of thousands to escape.
a union general said that emancipation was like an earthquake.
it shook and shattered the whole previously existing social system george washington albright an enslaved teen in mississippi recalled that white planters tried to prevent slaves from learning about the proclamation but word of it slipped through the grapevine his father was inspired to escape and join the union army and the younger albright served as a runner for the 4ls lincolns legal loyal league a secret group created to spread the news about the proclamation to slaves throughout the region.
confederate leaders were incensed by lincolns action predicting it would ignite a race war in the south.
by contrast frederick douglass the african american abolitionist leader was overjoyed at the righteous decree he knew that despite its limitations it would inspire abolitionists in the north and set in motion the eventual end of slavery.
as lincoln had hoped the emancipation proclamation did aid the union war effort by undermining support for the confederacy in europe.
the decision to end slavery in the confederacy gave the federal war effort greater moral legitimacy in the eyes of europeans and many americans.
as the war continued and union armies advanced into the southern states they became an army of liberation freeing slaves in their path and circulating thousands of copies of the emancipation proclamation as they went.
at camp saxton a former plantation on the coast of south carolina the first south carolina volunteers a new union regiment made up of former slaves gathered on january 1 1863 to celebrate lincolns official signing of the emancipation proclamation.
after the proclamation was read aloud it was cheered to the skies as colonel thomas w higginson the new units commander unfurled an american flag the black troops spontaneously began singing my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i sing higginson reported his emancipation 665 emotional reaction i never saw anything so electric it made all other words cheap it seemed the choked voice of a race at last unloosed fredericksburg in selecting a new commanding general lincoln made his poorest choice of all in the fall of 1862 when he turned to ambrose e burnside a tall imposing man whose massive facial hair gave rise to the term sideburns twice before burnside had turned down the job saying he was not worthy of such responsibility.
now he accepted although he still neither sought the command nor wanted it.
he was right to be hesitant.
burnside was an eager fighter but a poor strategist who according to fanny seward the secretary of states daughter had ten times as much heart as he has head the union army soon paid for his mistakes.
on december 13 1862 burnside foolishly sent the 122 000 men in the army of the potomac west across the icy rappahannock river to assault lees outnumbered forces who were well entrenched on a line of ridges and behind stone walls at the base of maryes heights west of fredericksburg virginia midway between richmond and washington d c confederate cannons and muskets chewed up the advancing federal soldiers as they crossed half a mile of open land.
a rebel artillery officer boasted that a chicken could not live on that field when we open fire on it one of the federal survivors said it felt like the ground were bursting underfoot and the very sky was crashing down upon us the bullets hissed like a seething sea still they charged over dead men and fragments of arms and legs only to be mown down in heaps the assault across the plain in front of the heights was a union general regretted a great slaughter pen more like murder than warfare.
wave after wave of b lue clad troops surged toward the w ell protected confederates.
none of the union soldiers made it to the rebel lines.
the awful scene of dead and dying federals some stacked three deep on the battlefield led lee to remark it is well that war is so terrible we should grow too fond of it after 12 600 federals were killed or wounded compared with fewer than 5 300 for the confederates a weeping burnside told his men to withdraw back across the river as darkness fell.
as burnside rode past his retreating men his aide called for three cheers for their commander.
all he got was sullen silence.
that night however there was no silence as thousands of wounded and dying soldiers left on the battlefield moaned and shrieked in agony amid the corpses of their friends.
a soldier said death was preferable to the experience of the fearfully and mortally wounded abraham lincoln was devastated by the news of the union catastrophe.
we are now on the brink of destruction he wrote.
it appears to me the almighty is against us and i can hardly see a ray of hope 666 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 the year 1862 ended with a stalemate in the east and the union thrust in the west mired down.
northern morale plummeted and northern democrats victories in the fall congressional elections sharply reduced the republican majorities in the house and the senate.
many democrats were calling for a negotiated peace and republicans even lincolns own cabinet m embers grew increasingly critical of the presidents leadership.
if there is a worse place than hell lincoln sighed i am in it newspapers circulated rumors that the president was going to resign.
general burnside too was under fire with some of his own officers eager to testify publicly to his shortcomings.
one of them claimed that the general was fast losing his mind new york city draft riots lincolns proclamation freeing slaves in the confederacy created anxiety and anger among many laborers in the north who feared that freed slaves would eventually migrate north and take their jobs.
in new york city such fears erupted into violence.
in july 1863 a group of 500 wage workers led by volunteer firemen assaulted the army draft office shattering its windows then burning it down.
when the city police superintendent arrived at the scene he was beaten unconscious and the outnumbered policemen were forced to retreat.
the rioters now swollen by thousands of w orking class whites mostly irish were angry over the unfair military draft ruthlessly taking out their frustrations on blacks.
mobs rampaged through the streets of manhattan randomly assaulting african americans beating them dragging them through the streets and lynching a disabled black man while chanting hurrah for jeff davis thugs also burned down more than fifty buildings including the mayors home police stations two protestant churches and the colored orphan asylum forcing 233 children to flee.
the raging violence went on for three days killing 105 people and injuring thousands.
only the arrival of federal soldiers put an end to the rioting.
thousands of terrified blacks thereafter moved out of the city for fear of continuing racial violence.
similar riots occurred in other northern cities including boston.
black soldiers and sailors in july 1862 in an effort to strengthen the union war effort the u s congress had passed the militia act which authorized the army to use freed slaves as laborers or soldiers they were already eligible to serve in the navy.
lincoln however did not encourage the use of freed slaves as soldiers because he feared the reaction in the border states where slavery remained in place.
it was only after the formal signing of the emancipation proclamation in january 1863 that the union army recruited blacks in large numbers.

more than 180 000 blacks enlisted.
some 80 percent of them were from southern states and 38 000 of them gave their lives.
in the navy african americans accounted for about a fourth of all enlistments of these more than 2 800 died.
initially blacks were not allowed in combat but the need to win the prolonged war changed that.
once in battle they fought tenaciously.
a white union army private reported in the late spring of 1863 that the black troops fight like the devil to be sure racism in the north influenced the status of african americans in the union military.
many people who opposed slavery did not support racial equality.
black soldiers and sailors were placed in all black units led by white officers.
they were also paid less than whites 7 per month versus 16 for white recruits and were ineligible for the enlistment bonus paid to whites.
still as frederick douglass declared this is no time for hesitation.
this is our chance and woe betide us if we fail to embrace it service in the union army or navy provided former slaves a unique opportunity to grow in confidence awareness and maturity.

women and the war while breaking the bonds of slavery the civil war also loosened traditional restraints on female activity.
no conflict in history a journalist wrote was such a womans war as the civil war women on both sides played prominent roles.
they worked in mills and factories sewed uniforms composed patriotic poems and songs and raised money and supplies.

other women black and white supported the freedmens aid movement to help impoverished freed slaves.
in the north alone some 20 000 women served as nurses and health related volunteers.
the most famous nurses were clara barton and dorothea lynde dix.
barton explained that her place was anywhere between the bullet and the battlefield dix declared that nurses should be plain looking women between the ages of thirty five and fifty who could bear the presence of suffering and exercise entire self control barton who later founded the american red cross claimed that the war advanced by fifty years the progress of women in gaining social and economic equality.

in 1864 president lincoln told a soldier that all the praise of women over the centuries did not do justice for their conduct during the war wartime government whi le freeing the slaves in the confederacy was a transformational development a political revolution began as a result of the shift in congressional power from the south to the north after secession.
in 1862 the r epublican dominated congress sought to promote the prosperity and happiness of the whole people by passing a more comprehensive tariff bill called the morrill tariff in honor of its sponsor vermont republican congressman justin smith morrill to raise government revenue and protect americas manufactures agriculture mining and fishing industries from foreign competition.
for the rest of the nineteenth century u s manufacturers were the most protected in the world in terms of high federal tariffs discouraging foreign imports.
the republicans in congress with lincolns support enacted legislation reflecting their belief and that of the old whig party that the federal government could benefit the nation by actively promoting economic development.
to that end congress approved susie king taylor born into slavery the pacific railway act 1862 which she served as a nurse in u nion provided federal funding and grants of occupied georgia and operated a land for construction of a 1 900 mile school for freed slaves.
long transcontinental railroad line the war behind the lines 671 from omaha nebraska to sacramento california.
in addition a homestead act 1862 granted 160 acres of public land to each settler who agreed to work the land for five years.
to help farmers become more productive congress created a new federal agency the department of agriculture.
two other key pieces of republican legislation were the morrill land grant act 1862 which provided states with 30 000 acres of federal land to establish public universities that would teach agriculture and mechanic arts and the national banking act 1863 which created national banks that could issue paper money that would be accepted across the country.
these wartime measures had long term significance for the growth of the national economy and the expansion of the federal government.
union finances in december 1860 as southern states announced their plans to secede the federal treasury was virtually empty.
to meet the wars huge expenses congress needed money f ast and lots of it.
it focused on three options raising taxes printing paper money and selling government bonds to investors.
the taxes came chiefly in the form of the morrill tariff on imports and a 3 percent tax on manufactures and most professions.
in 1862 congress created the internal revenue service within the trea sury department to collect the first income tax on citizens and corporations.
the tax rate was 3 percent on those with annual incomes more than 800.
the tax rate went up to 5 percent on incomes more than 10 000.
yet very few people paid the taxes.
only 250 000 people out of a population of 39 million had income high enough to pay taxes.
congressman justin s morrill who had authored the land grant act and the tariff act of 1862 endorsed the concept of progressive taxation in which tax rates rose with designated income levels.
taxation he argued must be distributed equally not upon each man an equal amount but a tax rate proportionate to his ability to pay the new federal tax revenues however fell short of what was needed in the end they would meet only 21 percent of wartime e xpenditures.
in 1862 congress approved the printing of paper money.
with the legal tender act of 1862 the treasury issued 450 million in new paper currency called greenbacks because of the color of the ink used to print the bills.
the federal government also relied upon the sale of bonds.
a philadelphia banker named jay cooke the financier of the civil war mobilized a nationwide campaign to sell 2 billion in government bonds to private investors.
confederate finances in comparison to the union the confederate efforts to finance the war were a disaster.
jefferson davis had to create 672 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 state currency banknotes were paper currency.
generally the better the art on the note the more it was trusted.
a treasury and a r evenue collecting system from scratch.
moreover the souths agrarian economy was l and rich but c ash poor.
while the confederacy owned 30 percent of americas assets businesses land slaves in 1861 its currency in circulation was only 12 percent of that in the north.
in its first year the confederacy created a property tax which should have yielded a hefty amount of revenue.
but collecting taxes was left to the states and the result was chaos.
in 1863 the desperate confederate congress began taxing nearly everything but enforcement was poor and evasion easy.
altogether taxes covered no more than 5 percent of confederate war costs and bond issues accounted for less than 33 percent.
during the course of the war the confederacy issued more than 1 billion in paper money which along with a shortage of consumer goods caused prices to soar.
by 1864 a turkey sold in the richmond market for 100 flour brought 425 a barrel and bacon was 10 a pound.
such rampant inflation price increases caused great distress and frustrations over the burdens of war increasingly erupted into rioting looting and mass protests.
by 1865 some 100 000 confederate soldiers had deserted the army for various reasons including the defense of slavery.
a poor farmer in alabama refused to serve in the confederate army because the war was being fought to preserve the infernal negroes owned by wealthy planters.
another confederate said he and his comrades were tired of fighting for this n egro owning aristockracy sic david harris a farmer deserted from the army because the cause was lost i am now going to work instead of to the war he wrote home.
union politics the north had its share of dissension and factionalism.
president lincoln was forced to use all of his substantial political genius the war behind the lines 673 to fend off uprisings against him in congress and conspiracies against him among cabinet members.
he loved the jockeying of backroom politics and he excelled at it.
throughout the war the president faced a radical wing of republicans composed mainly of militant abolitionists who criticized his leadership of the war effort.
led by thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner in the senate the so called radical republicans in congress wanted more than defeat of the confederacy they wanted to reconstruct it by allowing union armies to seize southern plantations and give the land to the former slaves.
the majority of republicans however continued to back lincolns more cautious approach.
the democratic party was devastated by the departure of its long dominant southern wing and the death of its nationalist spokesman stephen a douglas in june 1861.
what were called peace democrats favored restoring the union as it was before 1860 and the constitution as it is they reluctantly supported lincolns war policies but opposed republican economic l egislation.
so called war democrats such as tennessee senator andrew johnson and secretary of war edwin m stanton backed lincolns policies.
a few peace democrats verged on disloyalty to the union cause.
the copperhead democrats poisonous snakes were strongest in states such as ohio indiana and illinois that had substantial numbers of former southerners.
the copperheads openly sympathized with the confederacy savagely criticized lincoln and called for an end to the war.
civil liberties such support for the enemy led lincoln to crack down hard.
like all wartime leaders he faced the challenge of balancing the urgent needs of winning a war with the protection of civil liberties.
using his authority as commander in chief in wartime lincoln exercised emergency powers including suspending the writ of habeas corpus which guarantees arrested citizens a speedy hearing before a judge.
the constitution states that habeas corpus may be suspended only in cases of invasion but supreme court justice roger taney and several congressional leaders argued that congress alone had the authority to take such action.
by the habeas corpus act of 1863 congress allowed the president to order people arrested on the suspicion of treason.
thereafter union soldiers and local sheriffs arrested thousands of confederate sympathizers in the northern states without using a writ of habeas corpus.
union general henry halleck jailed one missourian for saying i wouldnt wipe my ass with the stars and stripes 674 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 confederate politics and states rights unlike lincoln jefferson davis never had to worry about reelection.
he and his vice president alexander stephens were elected in 1861 for s ix year terms.
but discontent with their leadership grew as the war dragged on.
poor white southerners expressed bitter resentment of the planter elite while food grew scarce and prices skyrocketed.
a food riot erupted in richmond on april 2 1863 when an angry mob mostly women armed with pistols or knives marched to the governors mansion to demand that bread in c onfederate warehouses be shared with civilians.
when the governor announced that nothing could be done the protesters shouted bread or blood they broke into stores stealing shoes and clothing as well as food.
the riot ended only when president davis arrived and threatened to shoot the protesters.
police then arrested forty four women and t wenty nine men.
daviss greatest challenge came from the southern politicians who criticized the tyrannical powers of the confederate government in richmond.
as a general reported the state of feeling between the president davis and congress is bad could not be worse critics asserted states rights against the authority of the confederate government just as they had against the union.
georgias governor joseph brown hated jefferson davis explaining that he joined the confederacy to sustain the rights of the states and prevent the consolidation of the government and i am still a rebel.
no matter who may be in power the confederacy also suffered from daviss difficult personality and constant political squabbling.
where lincoln was a pragmatist davis was a brittle ideologue with a stinging temper.
once he made a decision nothing could change his mind and he could never admit a mistake.
one southern politician said that davis was as stubborn as a mule such a dogmatic personality was jefferson davis president of the ill suited to the chief executive of an confederacy.
infant and fractious nation.
cabi the faltering confederacy 675 net members resigned almost as soon as they were appointed.
during the four years of the confederacy there were three secretaries of state and six secretaries of war and vice president stephens constantly warred against daviss military despotism stephenss brother described president davis as a little conceited hypocritical sniveling canting malicious ambitious dogged knave and fool the faltering confederacy the confederate strategy of fighting largely a defensive war worked well at first.
as the armies maneuvered for battle in the spring of 1863 however president lincoln found a commanding general in the west as capable as robert e lee was in the east.
humble unassuming plain spoken ulysses s grant five feet eight inches tall and weighing only 135 pounds calm and steady under fire was blessed with an uncommonly ruthless determination to win on the b attlefield at all cost.
chancellorsville after the union disaster at fredericksburg at the end of 1862 president lincoln turned to general joseph hooker a h ard fi ghting h ard drinking leader who had earned the nickname fighting joe to lead the army of the potomac.
with a force of 130 000 men the largest union army yet gathered an overconfident hooker failed his leadership test at chancellorsville in eastern virginia during the first week of may 1863.
my plans are perfect.
may god have mercy on general lee hooker boasted for i will have none hooker spoke too soon.
robert e lee with perhaps half as many troops split his army in thirds and gave hooker a lesson in the art of elusive mobility when stonewall jacksons 28 000 confederates surprised the union army by smashing into its exposed right flank.
the attack sparked thomas stonewall jackson the days of confusing and desperate fight celebrated confederate commander jackson would later die of friendly fire in ing ultimately forcing hookers army the battle of chancellorsville.
to retreat.
my god my god moaned 676 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 lincoln when he heard the news.
what will the country say chancellorsville was the peak of lees military career but it would also be his last significant victory.
vicksburg while lee frustrated the federals in the east general grant had been inching his army down the mississippi river toward the confederate stronghold of vicksburg mississippi a busy commercial town situated on high bluffs overlooking a sharp sweeping horseshoe bend in the river.
capturing the rebel stronghold grant stressed was of the first importance because vicksburg was the only rail and river junction between memphis tennessee the vicksburg campaign 1863 grant from memphis river l o u i s i a n a oo chickasaw bluffs z ya grant iver siege ac kr ss bl jackson bi g gra nt mi s s i m i s union advance battle site s i s s i p i area of map why was the capture of vicksburg a strategic victory.
why was vicksburg difficult to seize from the confederacy.
how did general lee hope to save vicksburg from the union siege.
wwn64 figure m15 6 1st proof p pearl river t an gr 10 kilometers r vicksburg ippi riv e vicksburg 10 miles the faltering confederacy 677 and new orleans.
president lincoln said that vicksburg held the key to a union victory in the war and jefferson davis agreed saying that holding the mississippi river open was vital to the confederacy.
vicksburg must not be lost if union forces could gain control of the river they could split the confederacy in two and prevent western food and livestock from reaching confederate armies.
while union warships sneaked past the confederate cannons overlooking the river grant moved his army eastward on a campaign across mississippi that lincoln later called one of the most brilliant in the world grant captured jackson mississippi before pinning the 31 000 confederates inside vicksburg so tightly that not a cat could have crept out.
without being discovered the union forces dug twelve miles of interconnected trenches encircling the besieged city.
in the battle of vicksburg grant decided to use constant bombardment and gradual starvation to wear down the confederates holed up in the town.
many people were forced to live in cellars or caves dug to protect them from the unending shelling.
the rebel soldiers and the citys residents were hopelessly trapped they could neither escape nor be reinforced nor resupplied with food and ammunition.
as the weeks passed desperate confederates and civilians ate their horses and mules then dogs and cats and finally rats which sold for a dollar each.
one starving girl ate her pet bird.
general john c pemberton the confederate commander at vicksburg wrote jefferson davis that the situation in the beleaguered city was hopeless a group of ragged soldiers pleaded with their commander if you cant feed us you had better surrender us horrible as that idea is gettysburg vicksburgs dilemma led jefferson davis to ask robert e lee to send troops to break the siege.
lee however thought he had a better plan.
he would make another daring strike into the north in hopes of forcing the union army surrounding vicksburg to retreat.
he also wagered that a bold northern offensive would persuade peace seeking northern copperhead democrats to end the war on terms favorable to the confederacy.
the stakes were high.
a confederate general said the invasion into maryland and pennsylvania would either destroy the yankees or bring them to terms or be a disaster for lee.
in june 1863 the fabled army of northern virginia which lee said was made up of invincible troops who would go anywhere and do anything if properly led again moved northward taking thousands of animals and wagons as well as throngs of slaves for support.
678 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 the confederates moved quickly.
as a rebel soldier said he had enjoyed breakfast in virginia whiskey in maryland and supper in pennsylvania a maryland woman reported that the confederate soldiers were the dirtiest i ever saw a most ragged lean and hungry set of wolves one reason lee moved into the north was the need for food.
his soldiers and slaves gathered thousands of horses cattle and hogs as well as tons of wheat and corn.
they also captured free blacks in maryland and pennsylvania and sent them back to slavery in virginia.
once the union commander general george meade realized the confederates were again moving north he gave chase knowing that the next battle would decide the fate of our country and our cause as he moved into pennsylvania lee lost track of the federals because of the unexplained absence of general j e b stuarts 5 000 horse soldiers who were lees eyes and ears stuart it turned out had decided to create a panic in the union capital by threatening an attack on washington d c on june 28 lee uttered in exasperation i cannot think what has become of stuart.
i ought to have heard from him long before now neither side expected gettysburg a hilly crossroads farming town of 2 400 people in southeastern pennsylvania to be the site of the largest battle ever fought in north america.
both armies were caught by surprise when confederate troops entered the town at dawn on june 30 and collided with union cavalry units that had been tracking their movements.
the main forces of both sides 65 000 confederates and 85 000 federals then raced to the scene and on july 1 the armies clashed in what came to be called the battle of gettysburg the most dramatic contest of the war.
while preparing to fight a union cavalryman who sensed the importance of the coming battle yelled at the soldiers from new york and pennsylvania you stand alone between the rebel army and your homes.
fight like hell initially the confederates forced the federals to retreat but the union troops regrouped to stronger positions on high ridges overlooking the town.
meade rushed reinforcements to his new lines along the heights.
that night he wrote his wife that both sides had been shattered by the first days combat.
on july 2 wave after wave of screaming confederates assaulted meades army pushing the federal lines back across blood soaked wheat fields and through peach orchards but never breaking through.
a wounded confederate officer scrawled a note before he died tell my father i died with my face to the enemy some 16 000 were killed or wounded on both sides during the inconclusive second day of fighting.
worse was to come.
the next day july 3 against the advice of his senior general georgian james longstreet robert e lee risked all on a climactic assault against the well defended union lines along cemetery ridge.
for two hours both sides the faltering confederacy 679 a harvest of death timothy h osullivans grim photograph of the dead at gettysburg.
bombarded the other leading a union soldier to write that it felt as if the heavens and earth were crashing together deafening sounds more terrible never greeted human ears then the cannons stopped firing.
at about two oclock on the broiling summer afternoon three confederate infantry divisions about 12 500 men in all emerged from the woods and prepared to attack in the 90 degree heat.
general george pickett commander of the lead division told them to charge the enemy and remember old virginia with drums pounding and bugles blaring a gray wave of sweating rebels began a desperate mile long dash up a grassy slope of newly mown hay crisscrossed with fences.
awaiting them behind a low stone wall at the top of the ridge were 120 union cannons and thousands of rifles.
it was as hopeless a situation as the union charge at fredericksburg.
a union soldier remembered that the attacking confederates displayed a desperate courage they came on in magnificent order with the step of men who believed themselves invincible when the federals opened fire the confederates were enveloped in a dense cloud of dust.
arms heads blankets guns and knapsacks were tossed into the clear air only a few rebels made it to the top of the ridge where they fought bravely in h and to hand combat.
a general leading the assault climbed atop the stone wall and shouted come on boys.
give them the cold steel.
680 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 who will follow me two minutes later he was d ead as was the confederate attack when union soldiers held in reserve rushed to close the gap in their lines.
with stunning suddenness the carnage was over.
the surviving confederates retreated in a jostling mob to where they had started.
the once roaring battlefield was now a deathly quiet field of horror punctuated by the moanings and groanings of thousands of wounded soldiers and horses.
what general lee had called the grand charge was in the end a grand failure.
as he watched the survivors straggling back across the bloody field he muttered all this has been my fault.
it is i who have lost this fight he then ordered general pickett to prepare his battered division for another attack campaigns in the east 1863 confederate advance confederate retreat union advance battle site p e n n s y l v a n i a chambersburg gettysburg hagerstown area of map le e m a r y l a n d meade frederick ve r e ri le oa h middletown nd washington ker na c h e sapea hoo s he v i r g i n i a n an po to m n ac ri er v ah r d jac rapp iv e 20 kilometers o ks kr 20 miles an oc le e er bay fredericksburg chancellorsville riv ke r ke rapid an ho o why was gettysburg a major turning point of the war.

some 42 000 on both sides were killed wounded or missing during three days at gettysburg and thousands of horses were also killed and left rotting in the summer heat.
a union soldier who witnessed the slaughter on the final day wrote home great god.
when will this horrid war stop others asked the same question.
john futch a confederate private from north carolina saw his brother charley shot in the head suffer and die at gettysburg on july 3.
he wrote his wife that the slaughter had left him half crazy a few weeks after the battle he deserted was captured tried and executed.
lees retreat again as after antietam lees mangled army was forced to retreat back to virginia this time in a driving rain and again the federals failed to give chase.
had general meade pursued lees army he might have ended the war.
president lincoln was outraged we had them within our grasp lee had escaped to fight a gain and the war would grind on for another twenty one months.
but lees desperate gamble had failed in every way not the least being its inability to save the besieged confederate army at vicksburg mississippi.
on july 4 as lees defeated army left pennsylvania the confederate commander at vicksburg surrendered his entire 30 000 man army ending the forty seven day siege.
union vessels now controlled the mississippi river and the confederacy was effectively split in two with louisiana texas and arkansas cut off from the other rebel states.
jefferson davis said in late july that it was the confederacys period of disaster after gettysburg a group of northern states funded a military cemetery in commemoration of the thousands of soldiers killed in the battle.
on november 19 1863 president lincoln spoke at the ceremony dedicating the new national cemetery.
in his brief remarks known now as the gettysburg address he expressed the pain and sorrow of the uncivil war.
the prolonged conflict was testing whether a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
can long endure in stirring words lincoln predicted that this nation under god shall have a new birth of f reedom and that government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth chattanooga the third union triumph of 1863 occurred in southern tennessee around chattanooga the river port that served as a gateway to northern georgia.
in the late summer a union army led by general william 682 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 rosecrans took chattanooga on september 9 and then chased general braxton braggs rebel forces into georgia where they clashed at chickamauga a cherokee word meaning river of death.
the confederates for once had a numerical advantage and the battered union forces fell back into chattanooga while the confederates surrounded the city.
rosecrans reported that we have met a serious disaster.
enemy overwhelmed us drove our right pierced our center and scattered troops there lincoln urged him to persevere if we can hold chattanooga and east tennessee i think the rebellion must dwindle and die the union command rushed in reinforcements and on november 24 and 25 the federal troops dislodged the confederates from lookout mountain and missionary ridge thereby gaining effective control of tennessee.
the south had lost the war in the west.
the confederacy at risk the dramatic union victories at vicksburg gettysburg and chattanooga turned the tide against the confederacy.
during the summer and fall of 1863 however lincolns generals in the east lost the momentum that gettysburg had provided thereby allowing the army of northern virginia to nurse its wounds and continue fighting.
by 1864 robert e lee was ready to renew the war.
his men were in fine spirits and anxious for a fight still the tone had changed.
earlier confederate leaders assumed they could actually win the war.
now they began to worry about defeat.
a confederate officer in richmond writing in his diary after the defeats at gettysburg and vicksburg noted that today absolute ruin seems to be our fortune.
the confederacy totters to its destruction mary chesnut confessed in her diary that the war was not going well for her beloved confederacy.
on january 1 1864 she wrote god help my country a wartime election war or no war 1864 was still a presidential election year and by autumn the contest would become a referendum on the war itself.
no president since andrew jackson had won reelection and lincoln became convinced that he would lose without a dramatic change in the course of the war.
radical republicans frustrated that the war had not been won tried to prevent lincolns nomination for a second term but he consistently outmaneuvered them.
once lincoln was assured of the nomination he selected andrew johnson a war democrat from tennessee as his running mate on the national union ticket.
the war democrats had indiscreetly asked general grant to be their candidate against lincoln.
he firmly declined explaining that i am not a poli tician never was and hope never to be becoming president is the last thing in the world i desire the faltering confederacy 683 spurned by grant the democrats at their national convention in chicago stressed that people were tired of the costly war and called for an immediate end to the fighting.
they nominated general george b mcclellan the former union commander who had clashed with lincoln his commander in chief.
mcclellan pledged that if elected he would stop the war and if the rebels refused to return to the union he would allow the confederacy to go in peace lincoln knew that the election would be decided on the battlefields.
to save the union before a new democratic administration could stop the war and recognize the independence of the confederacy the president had brought his best commander ulysses s grant to washington d c in march 1864 promoted him to lieutenant general the rank held by george washington and given him overall command of the war effort promising him all the troops and supplies he needed.
grant is my man lincoln exclaimed and i am his the rest of the war a new york newspaper reported that lincolns presidency was now in the hands of general grant and the failure of the general will be the overthrow of the president grants strategy the cigar chewing grant was a hard nosed warrior with unflagging energy and tenacity.
one soldier said that grant always looked like he was determined to drive his head through a brick wall and was about to do it the union commander had a simple concept of war find out where your enemy is get to him as soon as you can and strike him as hard as you can and keep moving on regardless of the number of dead and wounded.
grant dramatically changed the union military strategy.
he would focus on crippling rebel armies rather than attacking particular cities like richmond.
he planned for the three largest union armies one in virginia one in tennessee and one in louisiana to launch offensives in the spring of 1864.
no more short battles followed by long pauses.
the union armies would force the outnumbered confederates to keep fighting day after day week after week until they were worn out.
grant is like a bulldog lincoln said.
let him get ulysses s grant at his headquarters his teeth in and nothing can shake him in city point now hopewell virginia.
loose 684 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 grant assigned his trusted friend general william tecumseh sherman a rail thin red haired ohioan to lead the union army in tennessee southward and apply grants strategy of complete conquest to the heart of the confederacy.
sherman cool under pressure and obsessed with winning at all costs owed much of his success to grants support.
he stood by me when i was crazy and i stood by him when he was drunk sherman said.
grant and sherman would now wage total war confiscating or destroying civilian property that might be of use to the military.
it was a ruthless and costly plan but in the end it would prove effective.
the f ull bearded confederate general james longstreet an old friend of grant told lee that the union commander will fight us every day and every hour until the end of the war chasing lee in may 1864 general grants massive army of the potomac numbering about 115 000 to general lees 65 000 moved south across the rappahannock and rapidan rivers in eastern virginia.
in the nightmarish battle of the wilderness may 5 6 the armies clashed in an impenetrable tangle of dense forest and thickety undergrowth.
explosions set off brushfires in which many wounded soldiers were burned to death.
what a medley of sounds wrote a soldier the incessant roar of the rifle the screaming bullets the forest on fire men cheering groaning yelling swearing and praying at one point in the intense battle the union forces threatened to overrun general lees headquarters.
lee himself helped organize a counterattack lining up soldiers from texas to lead the effort.
spurred by a rush of adrenaline he stood high in his stirrups waved his hat and yelled texans always move them the rebel commander then turned his horse toward the enemy to lead the men in a charge.
the worried soldiers shouted go back general lee go back but he kept moving forward.
lee to the rear they chanted.
yet he still kept going.
finally an officer pulled ahead of lee grabbed the reins of his horse and prevented him from moving.
cant i too die for my country the general muttered.
his mood brightened as the confederates swept the federals from the field and broke the union advance.
grants men suffered more casualties than the confederates in the awful slugging match but the rebels struggled to find replacements.
always before when bloodied by lees troops union armies had quit fighting to rest and nurse their wounds but now grant refused to halt.
instead he continued to push southward forcing the rebels to keep fighting.
the union army engaged lees men again near spotsylvania court house eleven miles southwest of fredericksburg on the road to richmond.
for twelve days in may the two armies engaged in some of the fiercest combat of the war.
grants troops kept the pressure on pushing relentlessly toward richmond.
the faltering confederacy 685 in the first days of june just as republican party leaders were gathering to renominate lincoln as their presidential candidate grant foolishly ordered a poorly coordinated frontal attack on lees army.
the confederates were well entrenched at cold harbor near the chickahominy river just ten miles east of richmond.
in twenty minutes almost 4 000 federals caught in a blistering cross fire were killed or wounded.
it was according to a union general one of the most disastrous days the army of the potomac has ever seen a c onfederate commander from alabama reported that it was not war it was murder the frightful losses nearly unhinged grant who later admitted that the botched attack was his greatest mistake as a commander.
critics including lincolns wife mary called him the butcher after cold harbor.
in just two months grants massive offensive across virginia labeled the overland campaign had cost some 60 000 killed and wounded union soldiers and 33 000 rebel casualties.
criticism of the war in the north skyrocketed.
even horace greeley the powerful unionist publisher of the new york tribune urged lincoln to negotiate with confederate leaders to save the bleeding bankrupt almost dying country during the summer of 1864 the union war effort came close to ending.
yet grant for all of his mistakes knew that his army could more easily replace its dead and wounded than could the rebels.
while the confederates were winning battles they were losing the war.
in june 1864 grant brilliantly maneuvered his battered forces around lees army and headed for petersburg a major supply center and transportation hub twenty five miles south of richmond.
there the opposing armies dug in along long lines of trenches above and below petersburg.
grant would now lay siege to the confederate army tightening the noose around lee and the rebels as he had done at vicksburg.
for nine months the two sides held each other in check around petersburg.
grants troops twice as numerous as lees were generously supplied by union vessels moving up the james river while the confederates hungry and cold wasted away.
the number of deserters grew so large that lee asked permission to shoot them when caught.
petersburg had become lees prison while disasters piled up for the confederacy elsewhere.
lee admitted that it was a mere question of time before he would have to retreat or surrender.
on june 15 1864 a rebel soldier noted in his diary that our affairs do look gloomy grant he added later will no doubt capture the place sherman pushes south meanwhile general grant ordered william t sherman to drive through the heart of dixie and break it up inflicting all the damage you can as general sherman moved his large army south from chattanooga through the georgia mountains toward the crucial 686 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 grant in virginia 1864 1865 ma ry l a n d culpeper court house gra area of map nt the wilderness ni po om i ny sailors creek r ive le e b a y ch ick ah r rk yo lee surrenders to grant ri ve r ver ri appomattox court house er cold harbor richmond amelia court house iv an t ja m north anna r ve ri appomattox river s a p e a k e h e a r i ck n ap p r no i ac r iver tt a lynchburg es g om ma r ve na r ve ri i an ri r an ah so v ot spotsylvania court house c north an na ut h chancellorsville fredericksburg p le e gr petersburg siege five forks r ve ri confederate advance confederate retreat union advance battle site ja m es 30 miles 30 kilometers how were general grants tactics in the battle of the wilderness different from the unions previous encounters with general lees army.

jefferson davis was so concerned about the situation that he made the hugely controversial decision to replace the confederate commander general joseph johnston with general john bell hood who had been lees most aggressive general after the death of stonewall jackson.
hood a texan was a reckless fighter.
a confederate senators wife said that a braver man a purer patriot a more gallant soldier never breathed than the faltering confederacy 687 the tattered colors of the 56th and 36th massachusetts regiments union soldiers march through virginia in 1864.
general hood his arm had been shattered at gettysburg and he had lost a leg at chickamauga.
strapped to his saddle he refused simply to defend atlanta instead he attacked shermans army which is exactly what sherman the union commander wanted him to do.
three times in eight days the confederates lashed out at the union lines encircling the city.
each time they were turned back suffering seven times as many casualties as the federals.
the battle of atlanta left hoods army shattered surrounded and outnumbered.
finally on september 1 the confederates desperately low on food and supplies evacuated the city.
sherman then moved his troops into atlanta.
in richmond mary chesnut took the news hard.
we are going to be wiped off the earth she wrote.
since atlanta she added i have felt as if all were dead within me forever shermans soldiers stayed in atlanta until november resting and resupplying themselves in the heart of the confederacy.
the 20 000 residents were told to leave.
when city officials protested the union commander replied war is cruelty his men then set fire to the citys railroads iron foundries shops mills hotels and businesses.
lincoln reelected william tecumseh shermans conquest of atlanta turned the tide of the election of 1864.
as a republican senator said the union victory in georgia created the most extraordinary change in public opinion here in the north that ever was known the capture of mobile 688 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 labama by union naval forces in august and confederate defeats in virgina ias shenandoah valley in october also spurred the dramatic revival of abraham lincolns political support in the north.
the souths hope that northern discontent would lead to a negotiated peace vanished.
in the 1864 election the democratic candidate mcclellan carried only new jersey delaware and kentucky with just 21 electoral votes to lincolns 212 and won only 1 8 million popular votes 45 percent to lincolns 2 2 million 55 percent.
union soldiers and sailors voted in large numbers and their choice was lincoln.
the presidents victory sealed the fate of the confederacy for it ensured that the union armies would keep the pressure on the rebels.
shermans march to the sea in november 1864 general sherman led 60 000 soldiers out of burning atlanta on their famous march to the sea advancing rapidly through georgia toward the coast.

he pledged to whip the rebels to humble their pride to follow them into their inmost recesses and make them fear and dread us john bell hoods confederate army of tennessee meanwhile tried a desperate gamble by heading in the opposite direction from the union forces pushing northward into alabama and then tennessee.
hood hoped to trick sherman into chasing him.
sherman refused to take the bait however.
he was determined to keep his main army moving southward to the georgia coast and then into south carolina the seedbed of secession.
but he did send general george thomas william tecumseh sherman shermans and 30 000 soldiers north to shadow campaign through georgia developed into a war of maneuver as they raced to hoods confederates.
the two forces clashed in tennes the coast without the pitched battles of grants campaign in virginia.
hood was a ferocious fighter but a foolish commander.
in the battle of franklin november 30 1864 near nashville he sent his 18 000 soldiers in a hopeless frontal assault against dug in union troops backed by cannons.
in a few hours hood lost six generals and saw 6 252 of his men killed or wounded a casualty figure higher than picketts charge at gettysburg.
two weeks later in the battle of nashville the federals led by general thomas scattered what was left of hoods bloodied army.
a few days later a grieving hood was relieved of his command.
meanwhile shermans army pushed southward across georgia living off the land while destroying plantations barns crops warehouses bridges and rail lines.
we are not only fighting hostile armies sherman explained but a hostile people who must feel the hard hand of war an ohio sergeant confirmed their intent every house barn fence and cotton gin gets an application of the torch.
that prospect is revolting but war is an uncivil game and cant be civilized after the war a confederate officer acknowledged that shermans march through georgia was well conceived and well managed.
i dont think there 690 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 was ever an army in the world that would have behaved better in a similar expedition in an enemy country.
our army certainly wouldnt have on december 24 1864 sherman sent a whimsical telegram to president lincoln offering him the coastal city of savannah as a christmas present.
by the time shermans army arrived in savannah it had freed more than 40 000 slaves burned scores of plantations and destroyed all of the railroads.
god bless you yanks shouted a freed slave in georgia.
come at last.
god knows how long i been waitin.
south carolina on february 1 1865 shermans army headed north across the savannah river into south carolina the hell hole of secession in destroying southern railroads shermans troops cut a swath of destruction across georgia in his march to the sea here union troops rip up railroad tracks in atlanta.
the faltering confederacy 691 the eyes of union troops.
sherman reported that his whole army is burning with an insatiable desire to wreak vengeance upon south carolina.
i almost tremble at her fate but feel she deserves all that seems in store for her general joseph johnston who had been called out of retirement to take charge of the scattered remnants of the rebel forces knew that the war was all but over.
all he could hope to do he said was annoy the advancing federals.
south carolina paid a high price for having led the south out of the union.
shermans men burned more than a dozen towns including barnwell which they called burnwell on february 17 1865 shermans men captured the state capital of columbia.
soon thereafter charleston itself surrendered after confederate soldiers set fires to buildings containing material that would valuable to the yankees.
it was no accident that sherman ordered two all black regiments to lead the union advance into the city that launched secession and war.
on april 14 major robert anderson was given the honor of raising the union flag once again over fort sumter.
a losing cause during the late winter and early spring of 1865 the confederacy found itself besieged on all sides.
defeat was in the air.
some rebel leaders wanted to negotiate a peace settlement.
confederate secretary of war john c breckinridge the kentuckian who had served as vice president under james buchanan and had run for president in 1860 urged robert e lee to negotiate an honorable end to the war.
this has been a magnificent epic he said.
in gods name let it not terminate in a farce jefferson davis rejected any talk of surrender however.
if his armies should be defeated he wanted the soldiers to scatter and fight an unending guerrilla war.
the war came and now it must go on he stubbornly insisted till the last man of this generation falls in his tracks and his children seize his musket and fight our battle davis lee and others finally became so desperate that they did the unthinkable on march 13 1865 davis signed a virginia bill calling for the immediate recruitment of blacks into the army.
before they could be enlisted and trained however the war came to an end.
a second term while confederate forces made their last stands abraham lincoln prepared for his second term as president.
the weary commander in chief had weathered constant criticism during his first term but with the war nearing its end lincoln now garnered deserved praise.
the chicago tribune observed that the president has slowly and steadily risen in the respect confidence and admiration of the people on march 4 1865 amid rumors of a confederate attempt to abduct or assassinate the president the s ix foot four inch lincoln dressed in a black 692 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 shermans campaigns 1864 1865 nashville c kentucky um columbia florence sherman od confederate forces battle site virginia river ten s ne e se r iv er chattanooga dalton johnston kennesaw mountain atlanta he rm an s m ar macon ch north carolina south carolina raleigh goldsboro johnston bentonville fayetteville an erm h s columbia georgia charleston to the sea atlantic ocean savannah wilmington s alabama union forces r l a nd tennessee as to om ta th tlan ville a ash n franklin ho be 100 miles 100 kilometers what was general shermans goal as he marched across georgia.
how much damage did sherman do in georgia and south carolina.
how did it affect the confederate war effort.
wwn64 figure m15 9 1st proof suit and stovepipe hat his face weathered by prairie wind and political worry delivered his second inaugural address on the east portico of the capitol.
not a hundred feet away looking down on lincoln from the capitol porch was a twenty six year old actor named john wilkes booth who five weeks later would kill the president in a desperate attempt to do something heroic for his beloved south.
lincolns second inaugural address was more a sermon than a speech.
slavery he said had somehow caused the war and everyone bore some guilt for the national shame of racial injustice and the awful war to end it.
both sides had known before the fighting began that war was to be avoided at all costs but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish lincoln longed for peace and reunion.
fondly do we h ope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away he noted the faltering confederacy 693 the paradoxical irony of both sides in the civil war reading the same bible praying to the same god and appealing for divine support in its fight against the other.
now the president urged the union forces to finish the work we are in bolstered with firmness in the right insofar as god gives us to see the right as lincoln looked ahead to the end of the fighting and a just and lasting peace he stressed that vengeance must be avoided at all costs.
reconciliation must be pursued with malice toward none with charity for all those eight words captured lincolns hopes for a restored union.
redemption and reunion were his goals not vengeance.
with a loving tolerance of human complexity and sinfulness lincoln revealed how the rigors of war had helped him see the need for humility in victory.
the abolitionist leader frederick douglass proclaimed lincolns second inaugural address a sacred effort appomattox during the spring of 1865 general grants army kept pounding the rebels defending petersburg virginia.
lee was on the horns of a dilemma and he knew it.
he had no way to replace the men he was losing and his dwindling army couldnt kill enough yankees to make grant quit.
on april 2 1865 the badly outnumbered confederates tried to break out of petersburg but the union army was in hot pursuit.
five days later on april 7 grant sent a note urging lee to surrender.
with his army virtually surrounded lee told general james longstreet that there is nothing left for me to do but go and see general grant and i would rather die a thousand deaths on april 9 palm sunday four years to the day since the confederate attack on fort sumter the dignified lee stiff and formal in his dress uniform met the short mud spattered grant in the village of appomattox court exican american war lee house.
after discussing their service in the m asked what the terms of surrender would be.
in keeping with lincolns desire for a gracious peace grant let the confederates keep their pistols horses and mules and he ensured that none of them would be tried for treason.
lee then confessed that his men were starving and grant ordered that they be provided food.
after signing the surrender documents in the parlor of a farmhouse lee mounted his horse and returned to his army.
the next day as the gaunt confederates formed ranks for the last time joshua chamberlain the union general in charge of the surrender ceremony ordered his men to salute the rebel soldiers as they paraded past to give up their weapons.
his confederate counterpart signaled his men to do likewise.
chamberlain remembered that there was not a s ound no trumpets or drums no cheers or jeers simply an awed stillness.
as if it were the 694 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 passing of the dead the remaining confederate forces surrendered in may.
jefferson davis fled richmond ahead of the advancing federal troops only to be captured in georgia on may 10.
he was eventually imprisoned in virginia for two years.
the brutal war was at last over.
upon learning of the union victory john wilkes booth a popular young actor in washington d c who hated lincoln and the union wrote in his diary that something decisive and great must be done to avenge the confederate defeat.
he began plotting to kill president lincoln and members of his cabinet.
two days after lee surrendered president lincoln gave a speech on the white house lawn in which he looked forward to reconstructing the confederate states.
he also hoped that literate freed blacks and those who had served in the union military would be able to vote.
booth who was in the audience noted that lincolns pledge meant nigger citizenship.
now by god ill put him through kill him.
that is the last speech he will ever make a transforming war the civil war was the most traumatic event in american history.
we have shared the incommunicable experience of war reflected oliver wendell holmes jr the twice wounded union officer who would one day become the nations leading jurist.
we have felt we still feel the passion of life to its top.
in our youth our hearts were touched by fire in virginia elderly edmund ruffin the arch secessionist planter who had been given the honor of firing the first shots at fort sumter was so distraught by the confederate surrender that he put his rifle barrel in his mouth and blew off the top of his head.
the long war changed the nation in profound ways.
a new york times editorial said that the war left nothing as it found it.
it leaves us a different people in everything the war destroyed the souths economy many of its railroads and factories much of its livestock and several of its cities.
in 1860 the northern and southern economies were essentially equal in size.
by 1865 the southern economys productivity had been cut in half.
many southern economic and political leaders had been killed during the war or had seen their plantations and businesses destroyed.
the union preserved the war ended the confederacy and preserved the union shifted the political balance of power in congress the u s supreme court and the presidency from south to north and boosted a transforming war 695 the northern economys industrial development commercial agriculture and western settlement.
the homestead act 1862 made more than a billion acres in the west available to the landless.
the power and scope of the federal government were expanded at the expense of states rights.
in 1860 the annual federal budget was 63 million by 1865 it was more than 1 billion.
in winning the war the federal government had become the nations largest employer.
by the end of the war the union was spending 2 5 million per day on the military effort and whole new industries had been established to meet its needs for weapons uniforms food equipment and supplies.
the massive amounts of preserved food required by the union armies for example helped create the canning industry and transformed chicago into the meatpacking capital of the world.
federal contracts also provided the money needed to accelerate the growth of new industries such as the production of iron steel and petroleum thus laying the groundwork for a postwar economic boom.
ohio senator john sherman in a letter to his brother general william t sherman said the war had dramatically expanded the vision of leading capitalists who now talk of earning millions as confidently as formerly of thousands the first modern war in many respects the civil war was the first modern war.
its scope and scale were unprecedented as it was fought across the entire continent.
and armies for the first time used railroads and steamboats to move around.
one of every twelve men on both sides served in the war and few families were unaffected.
more than 750 000 soldiers and sailors 37 000 of whom were blacks fighting for the union died 50 percent more than the number who would die in the second world war.
the comparable number of deaths relative to todays population would be almost 7 5 million.
of the surviving combatants 50 000 returned home with one or more limbs amputated.
disease however was the greatest threat to soldiers killing twice as many as were lost in battle.
some 50 000 civilians were also killed during the war and virtually every community hosted uncounted widows and orphans.
unlike previous conflicts much of the fighting in the civil war was distant and impersonal in part because of improvements in the effectiveness of muskets rifles and cannons.
men were killed at long distance without knowing who had fired the shots that felled them.
the opposing forces used an array of new weapons and instruments of war such as cannons with rifled or grooved barrels for greater accuracy repeating rifles ironclad ships railroad artillery the first military telegraph observation balloons 696 chapter 15 the war of the union 1861 1865 and wire entanglements.
the war was also modern because civilians could follow its activities by reading the newspapers that sent reporters to the front lines or by visiting exhibitions of photographs taken at the battlefields and camps.
thirteenth amendment the most important result of the war was the liberation of almost 4 million slaves.
the emancipation proclamation had technically freed only those slaves in areas still controlled by the confederacy.
as the war entered its final months however freedom for all slaves emerged more fully as a legal reality as president lincoln moved from viewing emancipation as a military weapon to seeing it as the mainspring of the conflict itself.
three major steps occurred in january 1865 missouri and then tennessee abolished slavery and at lincolns insistence the u s house of represen tatives passed an amendment to the constitution that banned slavery everywhere.
upon ratification by three fourths of the reunited states the thirteenth amendment became law eight months after the war ended on december 18 1865.
it removed any lingering doubts about the legality of emancipation.
by then slavery remained only in the border states of kentucky and delaware.
the debate continues historians have provided conflicting assessments of the union victory.
some have focused on the inherent weaknesses of the confederacy its lack of industry and railroads the tensions between the states and the central government in richmond poor political leadership faulty coordination and communication the expense of preventing slave rebellions and runaways and the advantages in population and resources enjoyed by the north.
still others have highlighted the erosion of confederate morale in the face of terrible food shortages and unimaginable human losses.
the debate about why the north won and the south lost will probably never end but as in other modern wars disparities in resources were key factors.
robert e lees own explanation remains accurate after four years of arduous service marked by unsurpassed courage and fortitude the army of northern virginia has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources whatever the reasons the norths victory resolved a key issue no state could divorce itself from the union.
the union as lincoln had always maintained was indissoluble.
at the same time the war led to the constitution being permanently amended to eliminate slavery.
the terrible war thus served to clarify the meaning of the ideals all men are created equal on which the united states had been established.
the largest slaveholding nation in the world had at last chosen l iberty for all.
in his first message to congress a transforming war 697 in december 1861 lincoln recognized early on what was at stake amid the onrush of civil war the struggle of today is not altogether for today it is for a vast future also so it was.
the fiery ordeal of a war both fundamental and astounding produced as lincoln said not just a preserved union but a new birth of freedom chapter review summary civil war strategies when the war began the confederacy had a geographic advantage of fighting a defensive war on their own territory.
the union however held strong advantages in population and industrial development particularly in the production of weapons ships and railroad equipment.
after suffering a defeat at the first battle of bull run the union military leaders adopted the anaconda plan imposing a naval blockade on southern ports and slowly crushing resistance on all fronts.
the unions industrial might was a deciding factor in the long war of attrition.
emancipation proclamation initially president lincoln declared that the wars aim was to restore the union and that slavery would be maintained where it existed.
gradually lincoln came to see that winning the war required ending slavery.
he justified the emancipation proclamation 1862 as a military necessity because it would deprive the south of its captive labor force.
after the battle of antietam in september 1862 he announced plans to free the slaves.
he hoped that southern states would return to the union before his deadline of january 1 1863 when all slaves living in areas under confederate control were declared free.
wartime home fronts the federal government proved much more capable with finances than did the confederacy.
through a series of tariffs income taxes bond issues and banking reforms the union was better able to absorb the wars soaring costs.
in the absence of the southern delegation in congress the republican c ongress approved a higher tariff a transcontinental railroad and a homestead act all of which accelerated union settlement of the west and the growth of a national economy.
the morrill land grant act provided large land grants for the creation of state universities intended to promote economic development by turning out engineers and entrepreneurs.
both sides experienced pockets of opposition to the war efforts.
in the north copperhead democrats opposed the war and lincolns decision to end slavery.
the winning union strategy the union victories at the battles of vicksburg and gettysburg in july 1863 turned the war in the unions favor.
with the capture of vicksburg the last confederate controlled city along the mississippi river union forces cut the confederacy in two depriving armies in the east of supplies and manpower.
in 1864 lincoln placed general ulysses s grant in charge of the unions war efforts.
for the next year his forces constantly attacked robert e lees in v irginia while farther south general william t shermans march to the sea destroyed plantations railroads and morale in georgia and south carolina.
his successes helped propel lincoln to victory in the election of 1864.
after that southern resistance wilted.
lee surrendered his army to grant at appomattox court house in april 1865.
the significance of the civil war the civil war involved the largest number of casualties of any american war and the unions victory changed the course of the nations development.
most important the war ended slavery embodied in the adoption of the thirteenth amendment to the u s constitution in 1865.
not only did the power of the federal government increase but the center of politi cal and economic power shifted away from the south and the planter class.
the republican controlled congress enacted legislation during the war to raise tariffs fund the first transcontinental railroad and introduce many financial reforms that would drive the nations economic development for the rest of the century.

this was the most dramatic social change in the history of the nation.
but the end of slavery did not bring the end of racism.
the defeated confederates had seen their world turned upside down.

600 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 the wilmot proviso taylor would refuse to veto the proviso as president even though he was a slave owner.
this political cartoon old zack at home highlights his seeming hypocrisy.
f orbid that slavery would be allowed there.
he proposed a bill proviso doing just that.
in part his opposition to slavery in mexican territories reflected his desire to keep southern political power in congress from expanding.
the wilmot proviso reignited debate over the westward extension of slavery.
the missouri compromise 1820 had provided a temporary solution by protecting slavery in states where it already existed but not allowing it in newly acquired territories.
now with the possible addition of territories taken from mexico the stage was set for an even more explosive debate.
the house of representatives approved the wilmot proviso but the senate balked at the insistence of southerners.
when congress reconvened in december 1846 president polk dismissed the proviso as mischievous and foolish he convinced wilmot to withhold his amendment from any bill dealing with the annexation of mexican territory.
by then however others were ready to take up the cause.
in one form or another wilmots idea would continue to frame the debate in congress over the expansion of slavery for the next fifteen years.
during his one term as a congressman in 1847 1849 abraham lincoln voted for it as good as forty times slavery in the territories 601 popular sovereignty senator lewis cass of michigan a democrat tried to remove the explosive controversy over slavery from national politics by giving the voters in each territory the right to regulate their own internal concerns in their own way like the citizens of a state.
popular sovereignty as casss idea was called appealed to many because it seemed to be the most democratic solution to the question of allowing slavery or not.
the moral defects of popular sovereignty however were obvious it did not allow african americans to vote on their fate and it allowed a majority of whites to take away the most basic human right freedom.
when polk followed through on his promise to serve only one term and refused to run again in 1848 cass won the democrats presidential nomination.
but the party refused to endorse his popular sovereignty plan.
instead it simply denied the power of congress to interfere with slavery in the states and criticized all efforts by a nti slavery activists to bring the question of restricting or abolishing slavery before congress.
the whigs as in 1840 again passed over their leader henry clay a three time presidential loser.
this time they nominated general zachary taylor whose fame had grown during the mexican american war.
taylor born in virginia and raised in kentucky now owned a louisiana plantation with more than 100 slaves.
but he was also an ardent nationalist who vigorously opposed the extension of slavery into new western territories.
the free soil movement as it had done in 1840 the whig party offered no platform during the 1844 campaign in an effort to avoid the divisive issue of slavery.
the a nti slavery crusade was not easily silenced however.
americans who worried about the morality of slavery but could not endorse abolition could support banning slavery from the western territories.
as a result free soil in the new territories became the rallying cry for a new political organization the free soil party.
the free soil party attracted three groups northern democrats opposed to slavery a nti slavery northern whigs and members of the abolitionist liberty party.
in 1848 the free soil party nominated former president martin van buren as their candidate.
the partys platform stressed that slavery would not be allowed in the western territories.
as their campaign slogan shouted free soil free speech free labor and free men the new party infuriated john c calhoun and other southern democrats.
calhoun called van buren a bold unscrupulous and vindictive demagogue in the 1848 election punctuated by parades rallies barbecues banners and bands the free soilers were spoilers they split the democratic vote enough to throw new york to the whigs zachary taylor and they split the 602 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 whig vote enough to give ohio to the democrat lewis cass.
but nationwide van burens 291 000 votes lagged well behind the totals of 1 361 000 for taylor and 1 222 000 for cass.
taylor won with 163 to 127 electoral votes.
the california gold rush meanwhile a new issue had emerged to complicate the growing debate over territorial expansion and slavery.
on january 24 1848 gold nuggets were discovered in a stream on the property of john a sutter along the south fork of the american river in the mexican province of california which nine days later would be transferred to the united states through the treaty ending the mexican american war.
news of the gold strike spread like wildfire especially after president polk announced to congress that there was an extraordinary abundance of gold in california and other territories acquired from mexico.
suddenly a gold mania infected the nation.
we are on the brink of the age of gold gushed horace greeley editor of the new york tribune.
in 1849 nearly 100 000 americans mostly men set off for california eager to find riches.
sailors jumped ship soldiers deserted and husbands abandoned their families to join the california gold rush.
men are here nearly crazed with the riches forced suddenly into their pockets a tennessean wrote.
by 1854 the number of newcomers would top 300 000 and the surge of interest in californias golden news added to the urgency of bringing the profitable new western territory into the union.
among the forty niners also called argonauts who rushed to california were several family members of former president john tyler.
his wife julia wrote her mother that the president was not much taken with this california fever.
he thinks a good farm on the james river in virginia with plenty of slaves is gold mine enough others however raced to california as fast as they could get there.
the gold rush was the greatest mass migration in american history and one of the most significant events in the first half of the nineteenth century.
between 1851 and 1855 california produced almost half the worlds output of gold.
the infusion of california gold into the u s economy led to a prolonged national prosperity that eventually helped finance the union military effort in the civil war.
in addition it spurred the construction of railroads and telegraph lines hastened the demise of the indians and excited dreams of an american economic empire based in the pacific.
the gold rush also transformed san francisco into the nations largest city west of chicago.
in just two years it grew from a small coastal village of 800 to a bustling city of 20 000.
new business enterprises saloons taverns restaurants stores emerged to serve the burgeoning population of miners including one dedicated to the production of sturdy denim trousers made of sailcloth slavery in the territories 603 california news 1850 by william sidney mount during the california gold rush san francisco quickly became a bustling city as the population increased almost fiftyfold in a few months.
with their pockets reinforced by copper rivets.
the blue jeans known to this day as levis were developed by the german jewish immigrant levi strauss.
the forty niners included people from every social class and every state and territory as well as local indians and slaves brought by their owners.
never was there such a gold thirsty race of men brought together a californian said of the waves of prospectors flowing into the newest american territory.
on one december day in 1848 a new york city newspaper announced that sixty two different ships were leaving for california.
when one steamship arrived in san francisco harbor its entire crew deserted and headed for the gold diggings.
the influx of gold seekers quickly reduced the 14 000 mexican natives in california to a minority and sporadic conflicts with the indians of the sierra nevada foothills decimated californias native american population.
mining life the miners were mostly unmarried young men of varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
few were interested in staying in california they wanted to strike it rich and return home.
mining camps thus sprang up like mushrooms and disappeared almost as rapidly.
as soon as rumors of a new strike made the rounds miners converged on the area when no more gold could be found they picked up and moved on.
604 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 gold miners chinese immigrants and white settlers mine for gold in the auburn ravine of california in 1856.
the wild mining camps and shantytowns may have had colorful n ames hiskey flat lousy ravine petticoat slide piety hill but they were dirty laww less and dangerous places.
in calaveras county there were fourteen murders in a single week.
vigilante justice prevailed one newcomer reported that in the short space of t wenty four days we have had murders fearful a ccidents bloody deaths a mob whippings a hanging an attempt at suicide and a fatal duel within six months of arriving in california in 1849 one gold seeker in every five was dead.
the goldfields and mining towns were so dangerous that insurance companies refused to provide coverage.
suicides were common and disease was rampant.
women were as rare in the mining camps as liquor and guns were abundant.
in 1850 less than 8 percent of californias population was female.
the few women who dared to live in the camps could demand a premium for their work as cooks laundresses entertainers and prostitutes.
in the mining camps white miners often looked with disdain upon the hispanics and chinese who were most often employed as wage laborers to help in the panning process separating gold from sand and gravel.
but the whites focused their contempt on the indians it was not considered a crime to kill indians or work them to death.
the compromise of 1850 by late 1849 as confrontations over slavery mounted each national political party was dividing into factions along north south lines.
irate southern whigs abandoned their party and joined the pro slavery democrats.
some threatened that their states would leave the union if president taylor followed through on his proposal to bring california and new mexico directly into the union as free states skipping the territorial phase.
slavery in the territories 605 jefferson davis taylors s on in law dismissed the presidents plan as being anti southern.
taylor responded by criticizing intolerant and revolutionary southerners southerners ministers planters and politicians rushed to attack the president.
i avow before this house and country and in the presence of the living god shouted robert toombs a georgia congressman that if by your legislation you seek to drive us slaveholders from the territories of california and new mexico.
and to abolish slavery in this district of columbia.
i am for disunion as the controversy unfolded the spotlight fell on the senate where an all star cast of outsized personalities with swollen egos resolved to find a way to preserve the union.
the lions of the s enate henry clay john c calhoun and daniel webster all of whom would die within two years took center stage with william h seward stephen a douglas and jefferson davis in supporting roles.
together they staged one of the great dramas of american politics the compromise of 1850 a ten month long debate over a series of resolutions intended to reduce the crisis between north and south that had unhinged both political parties.
in search of compromise with southern extremists threatening secession congressional leaders again turned to an aging henry clay now seventy two years old and struggling with tuberculosis.
as abraham lincoln acknowledged clay was regarded by all as the man for the crisis no man had amassed a more distinguished political career.
clay had gained every position he had sought except the presidency senator congressman speaker of the house secretary of state.
now as his career was winding down clay hoped to save the union by presenting his own plan to end another sectional crisis.
on december 3 1849 as the thirty first congress assembled for what would become the longest session in its history clay strode into the senate to waves of applause.
he asked to be relieved of all committee responsibilities so that he could focus on the national crisis.
unless some compromise could be found the slaveholding clay warned a furious civil war would fracture the union.
the next day in his annual message to congress president taylor urged immediate statehood for california and the same as soon as possible for new mexico.
he then pleaded with congress to avoid injecting slavery into the issue.
it was too late however.
admitting california as a free state would tip the political balance against slavery with sixteen free states to fifteen slave states.
the slaveholding states would become a permanent minority.
as jefferson davis argued the south could not allow that to happen.
taylor hoped that his proposals would create confidence and kind feeling among the contending sections.
but his speech only aggravated the seething 606 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 tensions.
it took weeks of combative debate before a speaker of the house georgia slaveholder howell cobb could be elected on the s ixty third ballot.
madness rules the hour wrote philip hone a new york whig in his diary.
for the first time in history he noted members of congress were openly threatening to dissolve the union.
clay then stepped into the breach.
on january 29 1850 having gained the wholehearted support of daniel webster the senior senator from massachusetts whom he had known for thirty six years clay presented to congress his amicable plan for compromise and harmony eager to see the great compromiser people filled the senate.
using all of his charm and passion clay pleaded with the senate to pass eight resolutions six of which were paired as compromises between north and south and all of which were designed to settle the controversy between the free and slave states growing out of the subject of slavery he proposed 1 to admit california as a free state 2 to organize the territories of new mexico and utah without restrictions on slavery allowing the residents to decide the issue for themselves 3 to deny texas its extreme claim to much of new mexico 4 to compensate texas by having the federal government pay the p re annexation texas debts 5 to retain slavery in the district of columbia but 6 to abolish the sale of slaves in the nations capital 7 to adopt a more effective federal fugitive slave law the recapture of fugitives was not just a legal duty but a moral one and 8 to deny congressional authority to interfere with the interstate slave trade.
clays cluster of proposals became in substance the compromise of 1850 but only after seven months of negotiations punctuated by the greatest debates in congressional history.
clays eloquence had won over the moderates but not those at the extremes northern abolitionists or southern secessionists.
the great debate on march 4 a feeble john c calhoun desperately ill with tuberculosis arrived in the senate chamber.
the uncompromising defender of slavery was so sick and shriveled that a colleague had to read his defiant speech.
calhoun urged that clays compromise be rejected.
the great questions dividing the nation must be settled on southern terms.
the south he explained needed congress to protect the rights of slave owners to take their property into the new territories.
otherwise calhoun warned the cords which bind the union would be severed.
if california were admitted as a free state the south could no longer remain honorably and safely in the union the southern states would leave the union secede and form their own national government.
three days later calhoun who would die in three weeks hobbled into the senate to hear daniel webster speak.
webster was so famous for his theatrical slavery in the territories 607 clays compromise 1850 warning against an impending sectional conflict henry clay outlines his plan for compromise and harmony on the senate floor.
speeches that they were major public events.
the visitors galleries were packed as he rose to address the senate.
i wish to speak today webster began not as a massachusetts man not as a northern man but as an american.
i speak today for the preservation of the union he blamed both northerners and southerners for the crisis but acknowledged that both regions had legitimate grievances the south understandably objected to the excesses of infernal fanatics and abolitionists in the north and the north resented aggressive southern efforts to expand slavery into the new western territories.
with respect to escaped slaves webster shocked his fellow new englanders by declaring that the south in my judgment is right and the north is wrong fugitive slaves must be returned to their owners.
webster had no patience however with the notion of secession.
leaving the union would bring civil war.
peaceable secession.
sir your eyes and mine are never destined to see that miracle instead of looking into such caverns of darkness let men enjoy the fresh air of liberty and union.
608 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 let them look to a more hopeful future for almost four hours he pleaded with his colleagues not to be uncompromising pigmies but compromising statesmen.
websters evenhanded speech angered both sides.
no sooner had he finished than calhoun stood to assert that the union could indeed be broken.
great moral causes will break it at the same time northern abolitionists savaged webster for calling them fanatics.
on march 11 william seward a first year whig senator from new york gave an intentionally provocative speech in which he opposed clays compromise declaring that any compromise with slavery was radically wrong and essentially vicious there was he said a higher law than the constitution and it demanded the abolition of slavery through acts of civil disobedience.
he encouraged his fellow new yorkers to defy the federal fugitive slave law by extending a cordial welcome to escaped slaves and defending them from all efforts to return them south.
the southern supporters of slavery he concluded must give way to the inevitable progress of emancipation sewards inflammatory speech outraged southerners who repudiated his fanatical and wild notion of there being a higher law than the constitution and the implication that the godly abolitionists were somehow above the law.
clay felt compelled to dismiss sewards wild reckless and abominable theories seward however was unapologetic.
he had sought to speak for the enslaved as well as all of humankind.
compromise efforts for his part henry clay was angry at everybody the extremists had taken control of the debate and were postponing a vote on his compromise proposal.
he got little help from president taylor who continued to focus solely on the admission of california as a new state.
in a letter to his son clay reported that the administration the abolitionists the ultra southern men and the timid whigs of the north are all combined against his compromise plan.
on july 4 1850 congress took a break and celebrated independence day by gathering beneath a broiling summer sun at the base of the unfinished washington monument.
president taylor suffered a mild heatstroke while listening to three hours of patriotic speeches.
he tried to recover by gorging himself on iced milk cherries and raw vegetables.
that night he suddenly developed a violent stomach disorder.
he died five days later the second president to die in office.
taylors shocking death actually bolstered the chances of a compromise in congress for his successor vice president millard fillmore supported clays proposals.
it was a striking reversal taylor the louisiana slaveholder had slavery in the territories 609 been ready to make war on his native south to save the union fillmore whom southerners thought opposed slavery was ready to make peace.
the new president asserted his control by asking his entire cabinet to resign.
he then appointed webster as secretary of state signaling that he also joined webster in supporting compromise.
fillmore was aided by illinois senator stephen a douglas a rising young star in the democratic party who was friendly to the south.
douglas dramatically stepped up to rescue clays struggling plan.
brash and brilliant short and stocky he stood just five feet four douglas the little giant who millard fillmore fillmores support of modeled himself after andrew jack the compromise of 1850 helped sustain son cleverly suggested that the best the union through the crisis.
way to salvage clays comprehensive scheme was to break it up into separate proposals and vote on them one at a time.
fillmore endorsed the idea.
the plan worked in part because john c calhoun had died and was no longer in the senate to obstruct efforts at conciliation.
each component of clays compromise plan passed in the senate and the house several of them by the narrowest of margins.
only five senators voted for all of the items making up the compromise.
in its final version the compromise of 1850 included the following elements 1 california entered the union as a free state ending forever the old balance of free and slave states 2 the t exas new mexico act made new mexico a territory and set the texas boundary at its present location.
in return for giving up its claims texas was paid 10 million which secured payment of the states debt 3 the utah act set up the utah territory and gave the territorial legislature authority over all rightful subjects of legislation slavery 4 a fugitive slave act required the federal government and northern states to help capture and return runaway slaves and 5 as a gesture to anti slavery groups the public sale of slaves but not slavery itself was abolished in the district of columbia.
by september 20 president fillmore had signed the last of the measures into law claiming that they represented a final settlement to the sectional 610 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 the compromise of 1850 canada me oregon territory vt minnesota territory wi unorganized territory ny mi pa ia utah territory california admitted as free state 1850 il free states and territories slave states open to slavery by popular sovereignty compromise of 1850 ri md nc tn sc ar ms tx ct nj de ky missouri compromise line 3630n pacific ocean va mo new mexico territory oh in n dixo mason line nh ma al ga atlantic ocean la fl gulf of mexico mexico 300 miles 150 300 kilometers what events forced the compromise of 1850.

the nation celebrated the compromise.
harmony is secured.
patriots rejoice blared one newspaper.
henry clay predicted that his solution would pacify tranquilize and harmonize the country at the least daniel webster sighed he could now sleep nights the so called compromise of 1850 defused an explosive situation and settled each of the major points at issue but it was not so much an example of warring people making concessions as it was a temporary and imperfect truce.
as salmon p chase an ohio f ree soiler stressed the question of slavery in the territories has been avoided.
it has not been settled the compromise of 1850 only postponed secession and civil war for ten years.
it was a brilliant form of evading the fundamental issue dividing the nation.
soon aspects of the compromise would reignite sectional tensions.
the fugitive slave act people were naive to think that the compromise of 1850 would eliminate discussions about the legitimacy of slavery in the territories 611 s lavery.
within two months of the bills passage the squabbling between north and south resumed.
the fugitive slave act was the most controversial element of the compromise of 1850.
it did more than strengthen the hand of slave catchers it sought to recover slaves who had already escaped.
the law also unwittingly enabled slave traders to kidnap free blacks in northern free states claiming that they were runaway slaves.
the law denied fugitives a jury trial.
in addition citizens under the new law were forced to help locate and capture runaways.
abolitionists fumed.
this filthy enactment was made in the nineteenth century by people who could read and write ralph waldo emerson marveled in his diary.
he urged people to break the new law on the earliest occasion in late october 1850 two slave catchers from georgia arrived in boston determined to use the new federal fugitive slave act to recapture william and ellen craft h usband and wife cabinet makers.
abolitionists m obilized to prevent the crafts from being seized by the man stealers after five days the slave catchers gave up and returned to georgia.
upon learning of the incident president fillmore assured the south that he would use federal troops if necessary to return the crafts to georgia.
but he was too late.
abolitionists had spirited the crafts to safety in great britain.
theodore parker a prominent white boston minister who was a leading abolitionist wrote a letter to president fillmore explaining the willingness of his congregation to engage in civil disobedience in order to protect the crafts who were church members you cannot think that i am to stand by and see my own church carried off to slavery and do nothing to hinder such threats to free blacks this 1851 notice a wrong the occasion soon arose in detroit warned free blacks about police and michigan where only military force others who could easily kidnap and sell them back into slavery under the new stopped the rescue of a fugitive slave fugitive slave act.
by an outraged mob in october 1850.
612 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 there were relatively few such incidents however.
the efforts to protect the crafts was one of several similar episodes of public resistance to slave catchers in the north.
in the eleven years of the fugitive slave act barely more than 300 escaped slaves were returned to bondage.
the mere existence of the fugitive slave act however was intolerable to many northern abolitionists several of them advocated violence.
the only way to make the fugitive slave law a dead letter frederick douglass threatened is to make h alf a dozen or more dead kidnappers in springfield massachusetts a fiery abolitionist named john brown formed an armed band of african americans called the league of gileadites to attack slave catchers.
such efforts led horace greeley the prominent new york newspaper editor to write that the fugitive slave act was proving to be a very bad investment for slaveholders because it was creating such a backlash against slavery itself throughout the northern states.
uncle toms cabin during the 1850s anti slavery advocates gained a powerful new weapon in the form of harriet beecher stowes b est selling novel uncle toms cabin or life among the lowly 1852.
the pious stowe epitomized the powerful religious underpinnings of the abolitionist movement.
while raising six children in cincinnati ohio during the 1830s and 1840s she helped runaway slaves who had crossed the ohio river from kentucky.
like many anti slavery activists stowe was disgusted by the fugitive slave act.
in the spring of 1850 having moved to maine she began writing uncle toms cabin.
the time has come she wrote when even a woman or a child who can speak a word for freedom and humanity is bound to speak uncle toms cabin was a smashing success.
within two days the first printing had sold out and by the end of its first year it had sold 300 000 copies in the united states and more than a million in great britain.
soon there was a childrens version and a traveling theater production.
by 1855 it was called the most popular novel of our day uncle toms cabin depicted a combination of improbable saints and sinners crude stereotypes impossibly virtuous black victims and melodramatic escapades involving fugitive slaves.
the persecuted uncle tom whose gentleness and generosity grow even as he is sold as a slave and taken south the villainous white planter simon legree who torments and tortures tom before ordering his death the angelic little eva a white girl who dies after befriending tom the beautiful but desperate eliza who escapes from slave catchers by carrying her child to freedom across the icy ohio river all became stock characters in american folklore.
the novel revealed how the brutal realities of slavery harmed everyone associated with it.
abolitionist leader frederick douglass a former slave slavery in the territories 613 imself said that uncle toms cabin h was like a flash that lit a million camp fires in front of the embattled host of slavery slaveholders were incensed by the book calling stowe that wretch in petticoats one of them mailed her a parcel containing the severed ear of a disobedient slave.
the election of 1852 in 1852 it took the democrats forty nine ballots before they chose franklin pierce of new hampshire as their presidential candidate.
when pierce heard the results he was stunned you are looking at the most surprised man who ever lived when his wife jane learned of the nomination she fainted.
their the greatest book of the age concerns were well founded.
uncle toms cabin as this advertisement the democrats platform endorsed indicated was an influential best seller.
the compromise of 1850 including enforcement of the fugitive slave act.
for their part the whigs repudiated the lackluster millard fillmore who had faithfully supported the compromise of 1850 and chose general winfield scott a hero of the m exican american war.
scott however proved to be an inept campaigner.
he carried only tennessee kentucky massachusetts and vermont.
the whigs now without their greatest leaders henry clay and daniel webster had lost virtually all of their support in the lower south.
pierce overwhelmed scott in the electoral college 254 to 42 although the popular vote was close 1 6 million to 1 4 million.
the t hird party f ree soilers mustered only 156 000 votes.
the forty eight year old pierce an undistinguished congressman and senator who had fought in the m exican american war was like james k polk touted as another andrew jackson.
pierce eagerly promoted western expansion and the conversion of more territories into states even if it meant adding more slave states to the union but he also acknowledged that the compromise of 1850 had defused a perilous crisis he urged both north and south to avoid aggravating the other.
as a georgia editor noted however the feud between the two regions might be smothered but never overcome pierce was burdened by the death of his e leven year old son benjamin killed in a train accident just days before his father was sworn in as president.
benjamin was the third son that the pierces had lost.
still in mourning jane 614 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 pierce refused to attend her husbands inauguration and thereafter lived in seclusion writing letters to her dead children cursing politics and blaming franklin for her troubles.
writer nathaniel hawthorne pierces close friend confided in a letter that he wished the new president had a better wife or none at all president pierce an intelligent man capable of eloquent speechmaking had tragic flaws and private demons blinded by a desire to be liked and cursed with raging ambition he was a timid indecisive leader who was often drunk.
he would die in 1869 of alcoholism.
commissioned as a general in the mexican american war he had fainted during his first battle.
as president pierce proved unable to unite the warring factions of his own party.
by the end of his first year in office democratic leaders had decided that he was a failure.
james w forney a political friend confessed that the presidency overshadows him.
he is crushed by its great duties and seeks refuge in alcohol by trying to be all things to all people pierce was labeled a doughface a northern man with southern principles his closest friend in the cabinet was secretary of war jefferson davis the future president of the confederacy.
such friendships led harriet beecher stowe to call pierce an arch traitor the k ansas nebraska crisis during the mid nineteenth century americans discovered the vast markets of asia.
as trade with china and japan grew merchants and manufacturers called for a transcontinental railroad connecting the eastern seaboard with the pacific coast to facilitate both the flow of commerce with asia and the settlement of the western territories.
those promoting the railroad did not realize that the issue would renew sectional rivalries and reignite the debate over the westward extension of slavery.
in 1852 and 1853 congress considered several proposals for a transcontinental rail line.
secretary of war jefferson davis of mississippi favored a southern route across the territories acquired from mexico.
senator stephen a douglas of illinois insisted that chicago be the midwest hub for the new rail line and urged congress to pass the kansas nebraska act so that the vast territory west of missouri and iowa could be settled.
to win the support of southern legislators douglas championed popular sovereignty whereby voters in each new territory would decide whether to allow slavery.
it was a clever way to get around the 1820 missouri compromise which excluded slaves north of the 36th parallel where kansas and nebraska were located.
southerners demanded more however and douglas reluctantly complied.
although he knew it would raise a hell of a storm in the north douglas the emergence of the republican party 615 supported the south in recommending the formal repeal of the missouri compromise and the creation of two new territorial governments rather than one kansas west of missouri and nebraska west of iowa and minnesota.
this meant that millions of fertile acres would be opened to slaveholders.
what came to be called the kansas nebraska act took us by s urprise astounded us recalled abraham lincoln.
in may 1854 douglas masterfully assembled the votes for his k ansas nebraska act recruiting both democrats and southern whigs.
the measure passed by a vote of 37 to 14 in the senate and 113 to 100 in the house.
the a nti slavery faction in congress mostly whigs had been crushed and the national whig party essentially died with them.
out of its ashes would arise a new party the republicans.
stephen a douglas ca.
1852 the illinois democratic senator authored the kansas nebraska act.
the emergence of the republican p arty the dispute over the kansas nebraska act led northern anti slavery whigs and some northern anti slavery democrats to gravitate toward two new parties.
one was the american know nothing party which had emerged in response to the surge of mostly catholic immigrants from ireland and germany nearly 3 million of whom arrived in the united states between 1845 and 1854.
many of the immigrants were poor and catholic which made them especially unwanted.
the know nothings embraced nativism opposition to foreign immigrants by denying citizenship to newcomers.
many also were opposed to the territorial expansion of slavery and the fanaticism of abolitionists.
the other new party the republicans attracted even more northern whigs.
it was formed in february 1854 in ripon wisconsin when the so called conscience whigs those opposed to slavery split from the southern pro slavery cotton whigs the conscience whigs joined with anti slavery 616 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 democrats and free soilers to form a new party dedicated to the exclusion of slavery from the western territories.
bleeding kansas the passage of the kansas nebraska act soon placed kansas at the center of the increasingly violent debate over slavery.
while nebraska would become a free state kansas was up for grabs.
according to the kansas nebraska act the residents of the kansas territory were perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions slavery in their own way the law however said nothing about when kansans could decide about slavery so each side tried to gain political control of the vast territory.
come on then gentlemen of the slave states new york senator william seward taunted.
we will engage in competition for the virgin soil of kansas and god give the victory to the side which is stronger in numbers as it is in the right groups for and against slavery recruited armed emigrants to move to kansas.
every slaveholding state said an observer is furnishing men and money to fasten slavery upon this glorious land by means no matter how foul when kansass first federal governor arrived in 1854 he sent an urgent message to president pierce reporting that southerners were arriving with a dogged determination to force slavery into this territory in advance of an election of a territorial legislature in march 1855.
on election day thousands of heavily armed border ruffians from missouri traveled to kansas illegally elected pro slavery legislators and vowed to kill every god damned abolitionist in the territory as soon as it convened the territorial legislature expelled its few a nti slavery members and declared that the territory would be open to slavery.
the governor then rushed to washington d c to plead with pierce to intervene with federal troops.
pierce acknowledged that he was concerned about the situation but his spineless solution was to replace the territorial governor with a man who would support the pro slavery faction.
outraged free state advocates in kansas now a majority spurned this bogus government and elected their own delegates to a constitutional convention which met in topeka in 1855.
they drafted a state constitution excluding slavery and applied for statehood.
by 1856 a f ree state governor and legislature were operating in topeka.
there were now two illegal governments claiming to rule the kansas territory.
and soon there was a territorial civil war which journalists called bleeding kansas in may 1856 a pro slavery force of more than 500 missourians alabamans and south carolinians invaded the free state town of lawrence kansas just twenty five miles from the missouri border.

the sack of lawrence ignited the passions of abolitionist john brown.
the son of fervent ohio calvinists who taught their children that life was a crusade against sin the grim humorless brown believed that christians must break the jaws of the wicked and that the wickedest americans were those 618 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 who owned and traded slaves.
upon meeting brown many declared him crazy those who supported his efforts thought he was a saint.
he was a little of both.
by the mid 1850s the fifty five year old brown the father of twenty children had left his home in springfield massachusetts to become a holy warrior against slavery.
in his view blacks in the united states deserved both liberty and full social equality.
a newspaper reporter said that brown was a strange and iron willed old man with a fiery nature and a cold temper and a cool head a volcano beneath a covering of snow two days after the attack on lawrence brown led four of his sons and a son in law to pottawatomie kansas a pro slavery settlement near the missouri border.
on the night of may 24 kansas a free state this broadside brown and his group dragged five men advertises a series of mass meetings in kansas in support of the f ree from their houses and hacked them to state cause based on the principle death with swords.
god is my judge of squatter or popular sovereignty brown told one of his sons.
we were letting the residents decide the issue of justified under the circumstances slavery.
without the shedding of blood he added there is no remission of sins the pottawatomie massacre started a brutal guerrilla war in the kansas territory.
on august 30 pro slavery missouri ruffians raided a free state settlement at osawatomie.
they looted and burned houses and shot frederick brown johns son through the heart.
by the end of 1856 about 200 settlers had been killed in bleeding kansas senate bloodshed on may 22 1856 two days before the pottawatomie massacre an ugly incident in the u s senate astounded the nation.
two days before republican senator charles sumner of massachusetts a passionate abolitionist had delivered a fiery speech the crime against kansas in which he showered slave owners with insults and charged them with the emergence of the republican party 619 unleashing thugs and assassins in kansas.
his most savage attack was directed at andrew pickens butler an elderly senator from south carolina a state that sumner said displayed a shameful imbecility resulting from its passion for slavery.
butler sumner charged was a fumbling old man who had chosen a mistress.
though polluted in the sight of the world is chaste pure in his sight i mean the harlot prostitute slavery sumners speech enraged butlers cousin preston s brooks a south carolina congressman with a h air trigger temper.
on may 22 brooks confronted sumner as he sat at his senate desk.
brooks shouted that sumner had slandered butler and the state of south carolina then began beating him about the head with a g old knobbed walking stick until the cane splintered.
sumner his head gushing blood nearly died he would not return to the senate for almost four years.
in the south butler was celebrated as a hero.
the richmond enquirer described his attack as good in conception better in execution and best of all in consequences dozens of southerners sent butler new canes.
in satisfying his rage though brooks had created a m artyr bloodied sumner for the anti slavery cause.
sumners empty senate seat would serve as a solemn reminder of the violence done to him.
his brutal beating also had an unintended political effect it drove more northerners into the new republican party.
bully brooks attacks charles sumner this violent incident in congress worsened the strains on the union.
620 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 sectional squabbles the violence of bleeding kansas and bloodied sumner spilled over into the tone of the 1856 presidential election one in which the major parties could no longer evade the slavery issue.
at its first national convention the republicans fastened on the eccentric john c frmont the pathfinder who had led the conquest of mexican california.
the republican platform borrowed heavily from the former whigs.
it endorsed federal funding for a transcontinental railroad and other transportation improvements.
it denounced the repeal of the missouri compromise the democratic partys policy of territorial expansion and the barbarism of slavery.
for the first time a m ajor party platform had taken a stand against slavery.
the southern dominated democrats dumped president franklin pierce who remains the only elected president to be denied renomination by his party.
instead they chose s ixty five year old james buchanan of pennsylvania a former senator and secretary of state who had long sought the nomination.
the democratic platform endorsed the k ansas nebraska act called for vigorous enforcement of the fugitive slave act and stressed that congress should not interfere with slavery in states or territories.
in the campaign of 1856 the republicans had very few southern supporters and only a handful in the border slave states of delaware maryland kentucky and missouri.
frmont swept the northernmost states with 114 electoral votes but buchanan added five free states pennsylvania new jersey illinois indiana and california to his southern majority for a total of 174.
the democrats now would control the white house the congress and the supreme court.
president buchanan as franklin pierce prepared to leave the white house in march 1857 a friend asked what he was going to do.
pierce replied theres nothing left to do but get drunk james buchanan also loved to drink but he had different priorities.
the president elect had built his political career on his commitment to states rights and his aggressive promotion of territorial expansion.
saving the union he believed depended upon making concessions to the south.
republicans charged that he lacked the backbone to stand up to the southern slaveholders who dominated the democratic majorities in congress.
his choice of four slave state men and only three f ree state men for his cabinet seemed another bad sign.
although buchanan had vast experience he had limited ability and bad luck.
during his first six months in office two major events caused his undoing 1 the supreme court decision in the dred scott case and 2 new troubles in s trife torn kansas.

wwn64 figure m14 3 1st proof the financial panic of 1857 only made a bad situation worse for the new president and for the nation.
by the summer of 1857 the economy was growing too fast.
too many railroads and factories were being built and european demand for american corn and wheat was declining.
the result was a financial panic triggered by the failure of the ohio life insurance and trust company on august 24 1857.
upon hearing the news worried customers began withdrawing their money from banks which forced the banks to call in loans causing many businesses 622 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 to go bankrupt.
by the fall newspapers across the north highlighted the hard times that had befallen the nation.
jobless men roamed city streets demanding work or food or money.
federal troops had to be sent to disperse angry mobs in new york city.
planters in the south whose agricultural economy suffered the least during the panic took great delight in the problems plaguing the northern economy.
senator james henry hammond of south carolina gave a speech in early 1858 in which he told northern businessmen your slaves are white of your own race you are brothers of one blood.
they are your equals in natural endowment of intellect and they feel galled by your degradation.
our slaves do not vote.
we give them no political power.
yours do vote and being the majority they are the depositories of all your political power.
hammond suggested that the north adopt race based slavery to prevent working class whites from taking control of the social and political order.
cotton is king he triumphantly roared and race based slavery made it so.
the dred scott case dred scott the supreme courts refusal to give scott and his family their freedom fanned the flames of the intense debate over slavery.
on march 6 1857 two days after buchanans inauguration the supreme court delivered a decision in the l ong pending case of dred scott v sandford.
scott born a slave in virginia had been taken to st louis in 1830 and sold to an army surgeon who took him to illinois then to the wisconsin territory later minnesota and finally back to st louis in 1842.
while in the wisconsin territory scott had married harriet robinson and they eventually had two daughters.
in 1846 scott filed suit in missouri claiming that his residence in illinois and the wisconsin territory had made him free because slavery was outlawed in those areas.
a jury decided in his favor but the state supreme court ruled against him.
when the case was appealed to the u s supreme court the emergence of the republican party 623 the nation anxiously awaited its opinion on whether freedom once granted could be lost by returning to a slave state.
seven of the nine justices were democrats and five were southerners.
the vote was 7 to 2 against scott.
seventy nine year old chief justice roger b taney of maryland a supporter of the south and of slavery wrote the majority opinion.
the chief justice ruled that scott lacked legal standing because like all former slaves he was not a u s citizen.
at the time the constitution was adopted taney claimed blacks had for more than a century been regarded as.
so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect on the issue of scotts residency taney argued that the n ow defunct missouri compromise of 1820 had deprived citizens of property by prohibiting slavery in selected states an action not warranted by the constitution in the dred scott decision the supreme court had declared an act of congress the missouri compromise unconstitutional for the first time since marbury v madison 1803.
even more important the decision now challenged the concept of popular sovereignty.
if congress itself could not exclude slavery from a territory as taney argued then neither could a territorial government created by an act of congress.
yet instead of settling the issue of slavery in the territories taneys ruling fanned the flames.
pro slavery advocates loved the courts decision.
even president buchanan approved.
republicans on the other hand protested the dred scott decision because it nullified their anti slavery program.
the lecompton constitution meanwhile in the kansas territory the furious fight over slavery continued with both sides resorting to voting trickery and violence.
just before james buchanans inauguration in early 1857 the pro slavery territorial legislature scheduled a constitutional convention.
the governor vetoed the measure but the legislature overrode his veto.
the governor resigned in protest and buchanan replaced him with robert j walker.
with buchanans approval governor walker pledged to free state kansans who made up an overwhelming majority of the residents that the new constitution would be submitted to a fair vote.
but when the pro slavery constitutional convention meeting at lecompton drafted a constitution under which kansas would become a slave state opponents of slavery boycotted the vote on the new constitution.
at that point buchanan took a critical step.
influenced by southern advisers and politically dependent upon southern congressmen he endorsed the pro slavery lecompton convention.
a new wave of outrage swept across 624 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 the northern states.
stephen a douglas the most prominent midwestern democrat sided with anti slavery republicans because the majority of kansas voters had been denied the right to decide the issue.
douglas told a newspaper reporter that i made mr james buchanan and by god sir i will unmake him the rigged election in kansas went as predicted 6 226 for the constitution with slavery 569 for the constitution without slavery.
meanwhile a new acting governor had organized the anti slavery legislature which scheduled another election to decide the fate of the lecompton constitution.
most of the pro slavery settlers boycotted this election.
the result on january 4 1858 was decisive 10 226 voted against the lecompton constitution while only 138 voted for it.
in april 1858 congress ordered that kansans vote again.
on august 2 1858 they rejected the constitution 11 300 to 1 788.
with that vote kansas cleared the way for its eventual admission as a free state.
douglas versus lincoln the controversy over slavery in kansas fractured the democratic party.
stephen a douglas one of the few remaining democrats with support in both the north and the south struggled to keep the party together.
but first he had to secure his home base in illinois where in 1858 he faced reelection to the senate.
to challenge douglas illinois republicans selected a respected lawyer from springfield abraham lincoln.
lincoln had served in the illinois legislature and in 1846 had won a seat in the u s congress.
after a single unremarkable term he returned to springfield.
in 1854 however the kansas nebraska act drew lincoln back into the political arena.
lincoln hated slavery but was no abolitionist.
he did not believe that the nation should force the south to end the monstrous injustice but did insist that slavery not be expanded into new western territories.
in 1856 lincoln joined the republican party and two years later he emerged as the obvious choice to oppose douglas.
lincoln sought to raise his profile by challenging douglas to a series of debates across the state.
the seven lincoln douglas debates took place from august 21 to october 15 1858.
they attracted tens of thousands of spectators and transformed the illinois senate race into a battle for the very future of the republic.
the two men differed as much physically as they did politically.
lincoln was six feet four sinewy and craggy featured with a long neck big ears and deep set brooding gray eyes.
unassuming in manner and attire he lightened his demeanor with a refreshing sense of humor.
to sympathetic observers he conveyed an air of simplicity sincerity and common sense.
the emergence of the republican party 625 abraham lincoln and stephen a douglas debate at charleston illinois september 18 1858 this mural by midwestern impressionist robert marshall root painted to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the debates can still be seen hanging in the governors office in springfield illinois.
the short stocky douglas on the other hand was quite the dandy and wore only the finest custom tailored suits.
a man of considerable abilities and even greater ambition he strutted with the pugnacious air of a predestined champion.
douglas traveled to the debate sites in a private railroad car lincoln rode alone on his horse.
the basic dispute between the two candidates lincoln insisted lay in douglass indifference to the immorality of slavery.
douglas he said was preoccupied only with process popular sovereignty in contrast lincoln claimed to be focused on principle.
i have always hated slavery as much as any abolitionist he stressed.
the american government he predicted could not endure permanently half slave and half free.
it will become all one thing or all the other douglas disagreed asking what was to keep the united states from tolerating both slavery for blacks and freedom for whites.
douglas won the close election but lincolns energetic underdog campaign made him a national figure.
and across the northern states the republicans won so many congressional seats in 1858 that they seized control of the house of representatives.
an outnumbered south by the late 1850s national politics was undergoing profound changes.
in may 1858 the free state of minnesota entered the union in february 1859 another non slave territory oregon gained statehood.
the slave states of the south were quickly becoming a besieged minority and their insecurity even paranoia deepened.
626 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 at the same time political tensions over slavery were becoming more violent.
in 1858 members of congress engaged in the largest brawl ever staged on the floor of the house of representatives.
harsh words about slavery incited the free for all which involved more than fifty legislators shoving punching and wrestling one another.
the fracas ended when john bowie knife potter of wisconsin yanked off the wig of a mississippi congressman and claimed ive scalped him like the scuffling congressmen more and more americans began to feel that compromise was impossible slavery could be ended or defended only with violence.
the editor of a pro slavery kansas newspaper wanted to kill abolitionists if i cant kill a man ill kill a woman and if i cant kill a woman ill kill a child some southerners were already talking of secession again.
in 1858 former alabama congressman william l yancey the leader of a group of hot tempered southern secessionists called fire eaters said that it would be easy to precipitate the cotton states into a revolution john browns raid the gradual return of prosperity in 1859 offered hope that the sectional storms of the 1850s might pass but the slavery issue continued to simmer.
in october 1859 the militant abolitionist john brown surfaced again this time in the east.
since the pottawatomie massacre in kansas in 1856 he had kept a low profile while acquiring money and weapons from new england sympathizers.
his heartfelt commitment to abolishing slavery and promoting racial equality had intensified because he saw slavery becoming more deeply entrenched cemented by law economics and religious sanction.
brown was convinced that he was carrying out a divine mission on behalf of a vengeful god.
he struck fear into supporters and opponents alike for he was a moral absolutist who disdained compromise.
as one of the few whites willing to live among black people and die for them he was a brilliant propagandist for the abolitionist cause.
in 1859 brown hatched a plan to steal federal weapons and give them to rebellious slaves in western virginia and maryland in the hope of triggering mass uprisings across the south.
i want to free all the negroes in this state brown said.
if the citizens interfere with me i must burn the town and have blood when brown asked frederick douglass to join the effort the nations leading black abolitionist declined saying the suicidal plan would array the whole country against us he warned brown that he was going into a perfect steel trap and would never get out alive.
brown the fiery crusader replied that something startling must be done to awaken the nation to the evil of slavery.
he decided to proceed without douglass.
the emergence of the republican party 627 on the cool rainy night of october 16 1859 brown left a maryland farm and crossed the potomac river with about twenty men including three of his sons and five african americans.
under cover of darkness they walked five miles to the federal rifle arsenal in harpers ferry virginia now west virginia.
brown and his righteous soldiers took the sleeping town by surprise cut the telegraph lines and occupied the arsenal with its 100 000 rifles.
he then dispatched several men to kidnap prominent slave owners and sound the alarm for local slaves to rise up and join the rebellion.
only a few slaves heeded the call however and by dawn armed townsmen had surrounded the raiders.
brown and a dozen of his men along with eleven white hostages including george washingtons g reat grandnephew and two of their slaves holed up for thirty two hours in a firehouse.
meanwhile hundreds of armed whites poured into harpers ferry.
lieutenant colonel robert e lee also arrived with a force of u s marines.
on the morning of october 18 a marine officer ordered the abolitionists to surrender.
brown replied that he preferred to die fighting warning that he would sell his life as dearly as possible twelve marines then broke open the barricaded doors and rushed in.
lieutenant israel green reported that he found himself face to face with an old man kneeling with a carbine in his hand with a long gray beard falling away from his face green would have killed brown had his sword not bent back double when he plunged it into the abolitionists chest.
he then beat brown until he passed out.
browns men had killed four townspeople and one marine while wounding another dozen.
of their own force ten were killed including two of browns sons and five were captured another five escaped.
a week later brown and his accomplices were tried and convicted of treason murder and conspiring with negroes to produce insurrection at his sentencing brown delivered an eloquent speech in which he expressed john brown on his way to the gallows brown predicted that slavery would end pride in his effort to mingle my blood only after much bloodshed further with the blood of my children 628 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked cruel and unjust enactments for four weeks as brown waited to be hanged he met with newspaper reporters and wrote a host of letters many of which were printed in anti slavery newspapers.
henry wise governor of virginia visited brown in jail and reported that he was a man of courage fortitude and simple ingeniousness.
he is cool collected and indomitable on december 2 1859 some 1 500 virginia militiamen including a young actor named john wilkes booth who would later assassinate abraham lincoln assembled for browns execution.
just before being placed atop his coffin in a wagon to take him to the scaffold brown wrote a final message predicting that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood although john browns raid on harpers ferry failed to ignite a massive slave rebellion it achieved two things he became a martyr for the abolitionist cause and he set off a hysterical panic throughout the slaveholding south.
the pacifist abolitionist william lloyd garrison called brown the man with the burning eyes misguided wild and apparently insane others were not so sure.
john brown may be a lunatic said a boston newspaper but if so one fourth of the people of massachusetts are madmen the transcendentalist leader ralph waldo emerson called brown a saint who had made the gallows glorious like a cross frederick douglass proclaimed brown our noblest american hero whose commitment to ending slavery was far greater than mine caught up in a frenzy of fear southerners circulated wild rumors about slave rebellions.
they have declared war on us warned a mississippi legislator.
southern congressmen brought weapons to the capitol.
one of them reported that the only ones who do not have a revolver and a knife are those who have two revolvers john browns raid convinced southern states to strengthen their militia units and pass new restrictions on the movements of slaves.
we regard every man in our midst an enemy to the institutions of the south said the atlanta confederacy who does not boldly declare that he believes african slavery to be a social moral and political blessing other newspapers claimed that browns raid had dramatically increased support for secession in the south.
the richmond whig reported that thousands of virginians had decided that the unions days are numbered its glory perished as a result of john browns actions.
the democrats divide president buchanan had chosen not to seek a second term leaving stephen a douglas as the frontrunner for the nomination.
his northern supporters tried to straddle the slavery issue by the emergence of the republican party 629 promising to defend the institution in the south while assuring northerners that slavery would not spread to new states.
southern firebrands however demanded federal protection for slavery in the territories as well as the states.
when the p ro slavery advocates lost delegates from eight southern states walked out of the convention in charleston south carolina.
the delegates then decided to leave charleston.
douglass supporters reassembled in baltimore on june 18 and nominated him for president.
southern democrats met first in richmond and then in baltimore where they adopted the pro slavery platform defeated in charleston and named john c breckinridge vice president under buchanan as abraham lincoln a lanky and their candidate because he promised to rawboned small town lawyer lincoln ensure that congress would protect the won the presidential election in 1860 right of emigrants to take their slaves to the western territories.
thus another cord of union had snapped the last remaining national party had split into northern and southern factions.
the fracturing of the democratic party made a republican victory in 1860 almost certain.
lincolns election the republican convention was held in may in the fast growing city of chicago where everything came together for abraham lincoln.
the uncommon common man won the nomination over new york senator william h seward and the resulting cheer wrote one journalist was like the rush of a great wind the convention reaffirmed the partys opposition to the extension of slavery and to gain broader support endorsed a series of traditional whig policies promoting national economic expansion a higher protective tariff free farms on federal lands out west and federally financed internal improvements including a transcontinental railroad.
the presidential nominating conventions revealed that opinions tended to be more radical in the northeast and the lower south.
attitude followed latitude.
in the border states of maryland delaware kentucky and missouri a sense of moderation aroused former whigs to make one more try at reconciliation.

their platform centered on a vague statement promoting the constitution of the country the union of the states and the enforcement of the laws the bitterly contested campaign became a choice between lincoln and douglas in the north lincoln was not even on the ballot in the south and breckinridge and bell in the south.
douglas the only candidate to mount a nationwide campaign promised that he would make war boldly against northern abolitionists and southern disunionists but his heroic effort did no good.
by midnight on november 6 lincolns victory was announced.
he had won 39 percent of the popular vote the smallest plurality ever but garnered a the response in the south 631 clear majority 180 votes in the electoral college.
he carried all eighteen free states but none of the slave states.
lincoln a man of remarkable humility and empathy agreed with the many journalists and politicians who said his election was a fluke.
his political experience was meager his learning limited and his popular support shallow.
never did a president enter upon office with less means at his command the poet and harvard professor james russell lowell remarked.
yet the unassuming prairie lawyer from springfield illinois would emerge the acknowledged leader of his distinguished cabinet earning the respect of colleagues and opponents who had originally scorned him and becoming in the process as the poet walt whitman wrote the grandest figure yet on all the crowded canvas of the nineteenth century the response in the south between november 8 1860 when lincoln was officially named president elect and march 4 1861 when he was inaugurated the united states of america disintegrated.
the election of lincoln an anti slavery midwesterner panicked southerners who believed that the republican party as a richmond virginia newspaper asserted was founded for one reason hatred of african slavery former president john tyler wrote that with lincolns election the nation had fallen on evil times and that the day of doom for the great model republic is at hand false rumors that lincoln planned to free the slaves raced across the south.
one newspaper editorial called the president elect a bigoted unscrupulous and cold blooded enemy of peace and equality of the slaveholding states lincoln responded that southern fears were misguided.
he stressed in a letter to a georgia congressman that he was not a radical abolitionist and his administration would not interfere with slavery either directly or indirectly lincoln however refused to provide such assurances in public in part because he misread the depth of southern anger and concern over his election.
south carolina secedes p ro slavery fire eaters in south carolina viewed lincolns election as the final signal to abandon the union.
after lincolns victory the states entire congressional delegation resigned and left washington d c.
the state legislature then appointed a convention to decide whether it should remain in the union.
south carolina had a higher percentage of slaves in its population 60 percent than any other state and its political leadership was dominated by slave owning hotheads.
it had been a o ne party state democratic for decades 632 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 and it was the only state that did not allow its citizens to vote in presidential elections the legislature controlled by white planters did the balloting.
meeting in charleston on december 20 1860 the special convention unanimously voted to secede from the union.
david jamison rutledge who presided over the convention announced that the ordinance of secession has been signed and ratified and i proclaim the state of south carolina an independent commonwealth rutledge would have four sons killed in the civil war and see his house burned to the ground.
james l petigru one of the few unionists in charles ton quipped that his newly independent state was too small to be a republic and too large to be an insane asylum as the news of south carolinas secession spread through charleston church bells rang and shops closed.
cadets at the citadel the state military college fired artillery salutes new flags were unfurled and volunteers donned militia uniforms.
the union is dis the union is dissolved an 1860 newspaper headline announcing south solved screamed the charleston carolinas secession from the union.
one unionist in charleston kept a copy of the newspaper scribbling on the bottom of it youll regret the day you ever done this.
i preserve this to see how it ends president buchanan balks the nation needed a decisive president but james buchanan was not up to the task.
the president blamed the crisis on fanatical northern abolitionists then declared that secession was illegal only to claim that he lacked the constitutional authority to force a state to rejoin the union.
in the face of buchanans inaction all the southerners in his cabinet resigned and secessionists seized federal property arsenals and forts in the southern states.
the response in the south 633 among those federal facilities was fort sumter nestled on a tiny island at the mouth of charleston harbor.
when south carolina secessionists demanded that major robert anderson a kentucky unionist surrender the undermanned fort he refused vowing to hold on at all costs.
on january 5 1861 buchanan sent an unarmed ship the star of the west to resupply fort sumter.
as the ship approached charleston harbor on january 9 confederate cannons opened fire and drove it away.
it was an act of war but buchanan chose to ignore the challenge and try to ride out the remaining weeks of his term hoping against hope that a compromise would be reached to avoid war.
many southerners however were not in a compromising mood.
the crisis said a southern senator could only be defused when northern people agreed to review and reverse their whole policy upon the subject of slavery secession of the lower south by february 1 1861 the states of the lower s outh south carolina mississippi florida alabama georgia louisiana and texas had seceded.
although the states secession ordinances mentioned various grievances against the federal government including tariffs on imports they made clear that the primary reason for leaving the union was the preservation of slavery.
texass ordinance stoutly opposed by governor sam houston explained that the purpose of secession and the formation of the confederacy was to secure the rights of the slave holding states in their domestic institutions the texas convention displayed the paternalistic racism at work in secession calling africans an inferior and dependent race for whom slavery was actually beneficial an alabama secessionist explained that the people in his state are calmly and fully determined never to submit to lincolns administration or to any compromise with the northern states on february 4 1861 fifty representatives of the seceding states all but one of whom were slave owners t wenty one of them wealthy planters met in montgomery alabama where they adopted a constitution for the confederate states of america.
the confederate constitution mandated that the institution of negro slavery as it now exists in the confederate states shall be recognized and protected mississippis jefferson davis a kentucky born west point graduate who had served in the house of representatives and the senate was elected president with alexander h stephens of georgia as vice president.
the tiny sickly stephens weighing no more than ninety pounds left no doubt about why the confederacy was formed.
our new government he declared is founded upon.
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery subordination to the superior white race is his natural and normal condition 634 chapter 14 the gathering storm 1848 1860 in mid february davis traveled from mississippi to montgomery alabama the confederate capital for his installation.
on february 18 william yancey an alabama fi re eater introduced davis to the crowd by announcing that the man and the hour have met in his remarks davis ominously claimed that the time for compromise is now passed final efforts at compromise members of congress however desperately sought a compromise to avoid a civil war.
on december 18 1860 john j crittenden of kentucky offered a series of resolutions that would allow the extension of slavery into the new western territories south of the missouri compromise line 3630 parallel and guaranteed the preservation of slavery where it already existed.
lincoln however opposed any plan that would expand slavery westward and the senate defeated the crittenden compromise 25 to 23.
several weeks later in february 1861 t wenty one states sent delegates to a peace conference in washington d c former president john tyler presided but the peace conventions proposal substantially the same as the crittenden compromise had little support in either house of congress.
tyler himself voted against it and urged virginia to secede at once.
the only proposal that generated much interest was a constitutional amendment guaranteeing slavery where it existed.
many republicans including lincoln were prepared to go that far to save the union but no further.
as it happened after passing the house the slavery amendment passed the senate 24 to 12 on the morning of march 4 1861 lincolns inauguration day.
it would have become the thirteenth amendment and would have been the first time the word slavery had appeared in the constitution but the states never ratified it.
when a thirteenth amendment was eventually ratified in 1865 it did not protect slavery it ended it.
lincolns inauguration in mid february 1861 abraham lincoln boarded a train in springfield illinois headed to washington d c for his inauguration.
along the way he told the new jersey legislature that he was devoted to peace but warned that it may be necessary to put the foot down in his inaugural address on march 4 the fifty two year old lincoln repeated his pledge not to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists but the immediate question facing the nation had shifted from slavery to secession.
lincoln insisted that the union of these states is perpetual no state he stressed can lawfully get out of the union he pledged the response in the south 635 to defend federal forts in the south but beyond that there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere in closing he appealed for the union we are not enemies but friends.
we must not be enemies.
though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.
the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature.
southerners were not impressed.
a north carolina newspaper warned that lincolns speech made civil war inevitable on both sides however people assumed that any warfare would be over quickly and that their lives would then go on as usual.
the end of the waiting game on march 5 1861 his first day in office president lincoln found on his desk a letter from major anderson at fort sumter.
time was running out for the union soldiers.
anderson reported that his men had enough food for only a few weeks and that the confederates were encircling the fort with a ring of fire it would take thousands of federal soldiers to rescue them.
on april 4 1861 lincoln ordered that unarmed ships take food and supplies to the sixty nine soldiers at fort sumter.
jefferson davis was equally determined to stop any effort to supply the fort even if it meant using military force.
the secretary of state for the new confederacy richard lathers warned davis that if the south fired first it would unify northern opinion against the secessionists there will be no compromise with secession if war is forced upon the north davis ignored the warning.
on april 11 confederate general pierre g t beauregard who had studied under robert anderson at west point urged his former professor to surrender fort sumter and sent him cases of whiskey and boxes of cigars to help convince him.
anderson refused the gifts and the request.
at 4 30 a m on april 12 confederate cannons began firing on fort sumter.
the bright flashes and thundering boom of guns awakened the entire city thousands rushed to the battery to watch the incessant shelling.
finally the outgunned major anderson his ammunition and food gone lowered the stars and stripes a civil war of unimagined horrors had begun.
chapter review summary slavery in the territories representative david wilmots proviso although it never became law declared that since mexican territories acquired by the united states had been free they should remain so.
like the wilmot proviso the new free soil party demanded that slavery not be expanded in the territories.
but it was the discovery of gold in california and the ensuing california gold rush of 1849 that escalated tensions.
californians wanted to enter the union as a free state.
southerners feared that they would lose federal protection of their peculiar institution if there were more free states than slave states.
it had been agreed that popular sovereignty would settle the status of the territories but when the territories applied for statehood the debate over slavery was renewed.
through the wildly celebrated compromise of 1850 california entered the union as a free state the territories of texas new mexico and utah were established without direct reference to slavery the slave trade but not slavery was banned in washington d c and a new fugitive slave act was passed.
tensions turned violent with the passage of the kansas nebraska act which overturned the missouri compromise by allowing slavery in the territories where the institution had been banned by congress in 1821.
the republican partys appeal the efforts of pro slavery advocates in kansas to force slavery on the territory enraged northern opinion even though a nti slavery settlers such as john brown were equally violent in the events known as bleeding kansas.
the supreme courts dred scott v sandford decision which ruled that congress could not interfere with slavery in the territories further fueled sectional conflict.
northern voters gravitated toward the republican party as events unfolded.
republicans also advocated raising protective tariffs and funding the development of the nations infrastructure which appealed to northern manufacturers and commercial farmers.
abraham lincolns narrow failure to unseat democrat stephen a douglas in the 1858 illinois senate election which included the famous lincoln douglas debates revealed the republican partys growing appeal.
in 1860 lincoln carried every free state and won a clear electoral college victory.
the secession of the lower south and civil war following lincolns election south carolina seceded.
six other lower south states quickly followed.
together they formed the confederate states of america citing their belief that secession was necessary for the preservation of slavery.
in his inaugural address lincoln made it clear that secession was unconstitutional but that the north would not invade the south.
however the confederate states stood by their declarations of secession and war came when south carolinians fired on the stars and stripes at fort sumter.

the war of the union 1861 1865 lincolns drive through richmond 1866 shortly after the confederate capital of richmond virginia fell to union forces in april 1865 president abraham lincoln visited the war torn city.
his carriage was swarmed by enslaved blacks who were freed by the war as well as whites whose loyalties were with the union.
t he fall of fort sumter started the war of the union and triggered a wave of patriotic bluster on both sides.
a southern woman prayed that god would give us strength to conquer them to exterminate them to lay waste every northern city town and village to destroy them utterly by contrast the writer nathaniel hawthorne reported from massachusetts that his transcendentalist friend ralph waldo emerson was breathing slaughter as the union army prepared for its first battle.
the pacifist emerson now said that sometimes gunpowder smells good many southerners then and since argued that the civil war was not about slavery but about the souths effort to defend states rights.
confederate president jefferson davis for example owner of a huge mississippi plantation with 113 slaves claimed that the war was fought on behalf of the souths right to secede from the union and its need to defend itself against a tyrannical majority meaning those who had elected president abraham lincoln the a nti slavery republican.
for his part lincoln stressed repeatedly that the paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.
if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that if the southern states returned to the union he promised they could retain their slaves.
none of the confederate states accepted lincolns offer in large part because most white southerners were convinced that the new president was lying.
the black republican as they called the president was determined to end slavery no matter what he said.

more and more people began to question the literal truth of the bible.
political culture political life during the gilded age was shaped by three main factors the balance of power between democrats and republicans the high level of public participation in everyday politics and the often corrupt alliance between business and political leaders at all levels of government.
in 1873 job stevenson an ohio congressman claimed that members of the house of representatives were so often selling their votes to big business lobbyists that it should have been renamed an auction room the most important political issue of the gilded age however was the growing conflicts between city and country industry and agriculture.
millions of financially distressed farmers felt ignored or betrayed by the political process.
while industrialists and large commercial farmers prospered small farmers struggled with falling crop prices growing indebtedness to banks and railroads and what they considered big city greed and exploitation.
by the 1890s discontented farmers would channel their frustrations into political action and enliven a growing movement to expand inflate the nations money supply as a way to relieve economic distress.
the election of 1896 symbolized the central conflict of the gilded age the clashing cultural and economic values of two americas one older small scale and rural the other newer large scale and urban.
americas move to town americans moved to towns and cities after the civil war many of which evolved into major metropolitan areas.
people from rural areas were attracted by the jobs and excitements of city life.
many had been pushed off the land by new agricultural machinery that sharply reduced the need for farmworkers.
four farmworkers or ranchers could now urban america 849 perform the labor that earlier had required fourteen.
immigrants especially congregated in the cities along the atlantic and pacific coast where they arrived on ships from europe or asia.
the greater part of our population must live in cities announced josiah strong a prominent congregationalist minister in 1898.
there was no resisting the trend while the far west had the greatest proportion of urban dwellers concentrated in cities such as san francisco and denver the northeast and midwest held far more people in huge c ities new york boston philadelphia pittsburgh chicago cincinnati st louis and others.
more and more of these city dwellers had little or no money and nothing but their labor to sell.
by 1900 more than 90 percent of the people in new york citys most densely populated borough manhattan lived in rented houses or in congested low cost buildings called tenements where residents many of them immigrants were packed like sardines in poorly ventilated and poorly lit apartments.
growth in all directions several advances in technology helped city buildings handle the surging populations.
in the 1870s heating innovations such as steam radiators enabled the construction of much larger apartment buildings since c oal burning fireplaces and chimneys expensive to build were no longer needed in each apartment.
in 1889 the otis elevator company installed the first electric elevator which made it possible to construct much taller buildings before the 1860s few structures had been more than five or six stories.
during the 1880s engineers also developed cast iron and s teel frame construction techniques that allowed for taller s tructures skyscrapers cities grew out as well as up as horse drawn streetcars and commuter railways let people live farther away from their downtown workplaces.
in 1873 san francisco became the first city to use cable cars that clamped onto a moving underground cable driven by a central power source.
some cities ran steam powered trains on elevated tracks but by the 1890s electric trolleys were preferred.
mass transit received an added boost from underground subway trains built in boston new york city and philadelphia.
the commuter trains and trolleys allowed a growing middle class of business executives and professionals accountants doctors engineers sales clerks teachers store managers and attorneys to retreat from crowded downtowns to quieter t ree lined streetcar suburbs but the working poor many of them immigrants or african americans could rarely afford to leave the inner cities.

in new york city in 1900 some 2 3 million p eople two thirds of the citys population were living in overcrowded often filthy tenement housing.
such urban growth frequently occurred with little planning or regulations.
rapidly expanding cities often suffered from poor housing unhealthy living conditions and frequent infectious diseases and fires.

usually with lots of children who had few places to play except in the streets.
on average there was only one toilet called a privy for every twenty people.
late nineteenth century cities were dirty smelly and disease ridden.
the child mortality rate in many tenements was as high as 40 percent.
streets were filled with contaminated water horse urine and manure and roaming pigs.
garbage and raw sewage were carelessly dumped into streets and waterways causing epidemics of infectious diseases such as cholera typhoid fever and yellow fever.
in one poor chicago district at the end of the century three of every five babies died before their first birthday.
s o called sanitary r eformers public health officials and engineers eventually created regulations requiring more space per resident as well as more windows and plumbing facilities.
reformers also pushed successfully for new water and sewage systems and for regular trash collection.
they lobbied to ban slaughterhouses and the raising of hogs and cattle within city limits and to replace horse drawn trolleys with electric powered streetcars or trolleys.

the new immigration americas roaring prosperity and promise of political and religious freedom attracted waves of immigrants from every part of the globe after the civil war.
by 1900 nearly 30 percent of the residents of major cities were foreign born.
these newcomers provided much needed labor for the growing economy but their arrival also sparked racial and ethnic tensions.
a surge of newcomers from europe immigration has always been one of the most powerful forces shaping american history.
this was especially true between 1860 and 1900 as more and more immigrants most of them poor arrived from eastern and southern europe.
the number of immigrants rose from just under 3 million annually in the 1870s to more than 5 million per year in the 1880s and reached nearly 9 million annually in the first decade of the twentieth century.
in 1890 four out of five new yorkers were foreign born a higher proportion than in any other city in the world.
chicago was not far behind.
rapidly growing industries seeking low wage workers including mines railroads mills and f actories sent recruiting agents abroad to stir up interest the new immigration 853 ellis island to accommodate the soaring numbers of immigrants passing through new york city congress built a reception center on ellis island near the statue of liberty.
pictured here is its registry room where immigrants awaited close questioning by officials.
in migration to the united states.
under the contract labor act of 1864 the federal government helped pay for immigrants travel expenses to america.
the law was repealed in 1868 but not until 1885 did the government stop companies from importing foreign laborers a practice that put immigrant workers under the control of their employers.
the so called old immigrants who came before 1880 were mainly protestants and roman catholics from northern and western europe.
this pattern began to change however as the proportion of immigrants from southern and eastern europe especially russia poland greece and italy rose sharply.
after 1890 these new immigrants made up a majority of the newcomers and by the first decade of the new century they formed 70 percent.
their languages and cultural backgrounds were markedly different from those of most old immigrants or of most native born americans.
the dominant religions of the new immigrants for example were judaism eastern orthodox and roman catholicism whereas protestants still formed a large majority of the total u s population.
854 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 in 1907 congress appointed the bipartisan dillingham commission to examine the changes in immigration patterns.
in its f orty one volume report released in 1911 the commission concluded that the new immigrants were far less intelligent than the old approximately one third of all those over 14 years of age when admitted being illiterate.
racially they are for the most part essentially unlike the british german and other peoples who came during the prior period to 1880 and generally speaking they are actuated in coming by different ideals for the old immigration came to be a part of the country while the new in a large measure comes with the intention of profiting in a pecuniary way by the superior advantages of the new world and then returning to the old country.
immigrants were usually desperately poor and needed to find jobs quickly.
many were greeted at the docks by family and friends others were met by representatives of immigrant aid societies or by company agents offering low paying and often dangerous jobs in mines mills sweatshops and on railroads.
since most immigrants knew little if any english and nothing about american employment practices they were easy targets for exploitation.
many unwittingly lost a healthy percentage of their wages to unscrupulous hiring agents in exchange for a bit of whiskey and a job.
companies eager for workers gave immigrants train tickets to inland cities such as buffalo pittsburgh cleveland chicago milwaukee cincinnati and st louis.
as strangers in america most immigrants naturally wanted to live in neighborhoods populated by people from their homeland.
the largest cities had vibrant immigrant districts with names such as little italy little hungary and chinatown where immigrants practiced their native religions and customs and spoke and read newspapers in their native languages.
but they paid a price for such community solidarity.
when new immigrants moved into an area the previous residents often moved out taking with them whatever social prestige and political influence they had achieved.
living conditions often quickly deteriorated as housing and sanitation codes went unenforced.
the nativist response then as now many native born americans saw the newest immigrants as a threat to their jobs and way of life.
many nativists were racists who believed that anglo saxon americans people of british or germanic background were superior to the slavic italian greek and jewish newcomers.
a stanford university professor called immigrants from southern and eastern europe illiterate docile lacking in s elf reliance and initiative and not possessing the anglo teutonic conceptions of the new immigration 855 mulberry street 1900 this photograph captures the many italian immigrants who made mulberry street in downtown new york city their home at the turn of the century.
horse drawn carts weave through people shopping socializing and people gazing.
law order and government many were illiterate but others only appeared so because they could not speak or read english.
some resorted to crime to survive fueling suspicions that european nations were sending their criminals to america.
throughout american history congress has passed laws regulating immigration largely these statutes have been inconsistent in their goals and frequently motivated by racial and ethnic prejudice.
during the late nineteenth century such prejudice took an especially ugly turn against the chinese.
by 1880 some 75 000 chinese formed about a ninth of the population of california.
they were the first non european and non african group to migrate in large numbers to america.
chinese immigrants were easy targets for discrimination they were not white they were not christian and many could not read or write.
whites resented them for supposedly taking their jobs although in many instances the chinese were willing to do menial work that whites refused to do.
john jeong a young chinese immigrant arrived in san francisco and quickly encountered ethnic persecution.
as he and others made their way to the chinatown neighborhood in an open carriage some white boys came up and started throwing rocks at us another chinese newcomer experienced 856 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 similar treatment.
whenever he and his friends strayed outside their own neighborhood the whites would attack you with stones in 1882 anti chinese sentiment in congress prompted passage of the chinese exclusion act the first federal law to restrict the immigration of free people on the basis of race and class.
the act which barred unskilled chinese laborers from entering the country for ten years was periodically renewed before being extended indefinitely in 1902.
with the chinese exclusion act the golden door welcoming chinese exclusion act the chinese foreigners to the united states began to caricature john chinaman is escorted close.

group targeted.
in 1887 protestant activists in iowa formed the american protective association apa a secret organization whose members pledged never to employ or vote for a roman catholic.
working often within local republican party organizations the apa quickly enlisted 2 5 million members and helped shape the 1894 election results in ohio wisconsin indiana missouri and colorado.
in 1891 nativists in new england formed the immigration restriction league to save the anglo saxon race from being contaminated by alien immigrants especially roman catholics and jews.
the league sought to convince congress to ban immigrants who were illiterate.
three presidents vetoed bills banning illiterate immigrants grover cleveland in 1897 william h taft in 1913 and woodrow wilson in 1915 and 1917.
the last time however congress overrode the veto and the restriction of illiterate immigrants became law.
cultural life the flood of people into cities brought changes in recreation and leisure.
middle and upper class families especially those in streetcar suburbs often spent free time together at home singing around a piano reading novels or cultural life 857 playing games.
in congested urban areas politics as a form of public entertainment attracted large crowds and saloons became even more popular social centers for working class men.
new forms of mass entertainment movie theaters music halls vaudeville shows featuring singers dancers and comedians art museums symphony orchestras sporting events and circuses drew a broad c ross section of residents.
in large cities new streetcar transit systems allowed people to travel easily to sporting events and rooting for the home team helped unify a citys ethnic and racial groups and social classes.
by the end of the century sports of all kinds had become a major part of popular culture.
urbanization and technological progress also contributed to the prestige of modern science.
by encouraging what one writer called a mania for facts scientists generated changes throughout social intellectual and cultural life.
scientific research led to transformational technologies such as electric power and lights telephones phonographs motion pictures bicycles and automobiles.
although only men could vote in most states both men and women flocked to hear candidates speak at political meetings.
in the largest cities membership in a political party offered many social benefits.
as labor unions became increasingly common they too took on social roles for working class men.
vaudeville for as little as 1 for admission vaudeville shows aimed to please the tastes of their wildly diverse audience with a great range of entertainment.
858 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 saloons still the most popular leisure destinations for the urban working class were saloons beer gardens and dance halls.
by 1900 the united states had more saloons over 325 000 than grocery stores and meat markets.
new york city alone had 10 000 saloons 1 for every 500 residents.
saloons were the workingmans social club and were especially popular among male immigrants seeking companionship in a strange land.
in cities such as new york boston philadelphia and chicago the customers were disproportionately irish german and italian catholics.
politics was often the topic of intense discussions in saloons in fact in new york city in the 1880s saloons doubled as polling places where patrons could cast their votes in elections.
one journalist called the saloon the social and intellectual center of the neighborhood men also went to saloons to check job postings engage in labor union activities cash paychecks mail letters read newspapers and gossip.
because saloons were heated and offered public restrooms they served as refuges for the homeless especially in the winter.
patrons could play chess billiards darts cards dice or even handball since many saloons included gymnasiums.
although the main barroom was for men only women and children were allowed to enter a side door to buy a pail of beer to carry home a task called rushing the growler.
some saloons also provided snugs separate rooms for women customers.
stall saloons included wine rooms where prostitutes worked.
leisure for women married working class women had even less leisure time than w orking class men.
many were working for pay themselves and even those who were not were frequently overwhelmed by housework and child rearing responsibilities.
as a social worker noted the men have the saloons political clubs t rade unions or fraternal lodges for their recreation.
while the mothers have almost no recreation only a dreary round of work day after day with occasionally doorstep gossip to vary the monotony of their lives married w orking class women often used the streets as their public space.
washing clothes supervising children at play or shopping at the local market provided opportunities for socializing.
single women many of whom worked as domestic servants maids and had more leisure time than working mothers flocked to dance halls theaters amusement parks and picnic grounds.
with the advent of movie theaters the cinema became the most popular form of entertainment for working women.
as an advertisement promised if you are tired of life go to the movies.

the impact of darwinism virtually every field of thought felt the impact of natural scientist charles darwins controversial on the origin of species 1859 one of the most influential books ever written.
basing his conclusions on extensive yet imperfect field research darwin showed how the chance processes of evolution give energy and unity to life.
at the center of his concept was what darwin called natural selection he demonstrated that most organisms produce many more offspring than can survive.
those offspring with certain favorable characteristics adapt and live while others die from starvation disease or predators.
this struggle for existence in a crowded world drove the process of natural selection darwin said.
over many millions of years modern species evolved from less complex forms of life individuals and species that had characteristics advantageous for survival reproduced while others fell by the wayside.
as darwin wrote the vigorous the healthy and the happy survive and multiply darwins theory of biological evolution was shocking because most people still embraced a literal interpretation of the biblical creation story which claimed that all species were created at the same moment by god and remained the same thereafter.
although darwin had trained for the ministry and was 860 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 reluctant to be drawn into religious controversy his biological findings suggested to many then and since that there was no providential god controlling the universe.
people were no different from plants and animals they too evolved by trial and error rather than by gods purposeful hand.
what came to be called darwinism spelled the end of a god given world.
many christians charged that darwins ideas led to atheism a denial of the existence of god while others found their faith severely shaken not only by evolutionary theory but also charles darwin darwins scientific by new scientific standards of scholarly theories influenced more than a century analysis that were being applied to the of political and social debate.
most of the faithful however came to reconcile science and religion.
they decided that the process of evolutionary change in nature must be gods doing.
social darwinism although darwins theory of evolution applied only to biological phenomena many applied it to human society.
englishman herbert spencer a leading social philosopher was the first major prophet of what came to be called social darwinism.
spencer argued that human society and its institutions like the organisms studied by darwin evolved through the same process of natural selection.
the survival of the fittest in spencers chilling phrase was the engine of social progress.
by encouraging people ideas and nations to compete with one another for dominance society would generate the greatest perfection and the most complete happiness darwin dismissed spencers social theories as unconvincing he did not believe that the evolutionary process in the natural world had any relevance to human social institutions.
others however eagerly endorsed social darwinism.
e l youmans founding editor of popular science monthly became the foremost champion of spencers ideas in america.
he claimed that in the united states darwinism really meant spencerism the anti philanthropic anti meddling side of spencers philosophy.
if as spencer believed society naturally evolved for the better through survival of the fittest then interference cultural life 861 with human competition in the marketplace was a serious mistake because it would help unfit people survive and thereby hinder progress.
social darwinism implied the need for hands off laissez faire government policies it argued against the regulation of business or of required minimum standards for sanitation and housing.
to spencer the only acceptable charity was voluntary and even that was of dubious value.
spencer warned that fostering the g ood for nothing people at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty to the health of civilization.
for spencer and his many american supporters successful businessmen and corporations provided proof of the concept of survival of the fittest if the unregulated process of capitalist development led to small businesses being destroyed or acquired by huge corporate monopolies it was simply a necessary phase of the evolutionary process.
oil tycoon john d rockefeller revealed his own embrace of social darwinism when he told his baptist s unday school class that the growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest.
this is not an evil tendency in business.
it is merely the working out of a law of nature and a law of god popular science monthly founded in 1872 became the chief magazine for promoting social darwinism in the united states.
that year spencers chief academic disciple william graham sumner began teaching at yale university where he preached the gospel of natural selection.
sumners most lasting contribution made in his book folkways 1907 was to argue that it would be a mistake for government to try to promote equality since doing so would interfere with the survival of the fittest reform darwinism sumners efforts to use darwinism to promote rugged individualism and oppose government regulation of business prompted an alternative use of darwinism in the context of human society.
what came to be called reform darwinism found its major advocate in lester frank ward a government employee who fought his way up from poverty and never lost his empathy for the underdog.
wards dynamic sociology 1883 singled out one aspect of evolution that both darwin and spencer had neglected the human brain.
true as sumner claimed people like animals compete.
but as ward explained people also collaborate.
unlike animals people can plan for a distant future they have minds capable of shaping and directing social change.
far from being the helpless object of irresistible evolutionary forces ward argued humanity could actively control social evolution through long range planning.
wards reform darwinism held that cooperation not competition would better promote social progress.
government in wards view should pursue two main goals alleviating poverty which impeded the development of the 862 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 mind and promoting the education of the masses.
intellect informed by science could foster social improvement.
reform darwinism would prove to be one of the pillars of the progressive movement during the late nineteenth century and after.
realism in literature and art before the civil war romanticism had dominated american literature and painting.
romantics such as the transcendentalists in new england believed that fundamental truths rested in the unseen world of ideas and spirit.
the most prominent writers and artists were more concerned with romantic or biblical themes than with depicting everyday life.
during the second half of the nineteenth century however a new generation calling themselves realists began to challenge the romantic tradition.
a writer in putnams monthly noted in 1854 a growing emphasis on the real and the practical this emphasis on realism matured into a f ull fledged cultural force as more and more writers and artists focused on depicting the actual aspects of u rban industrial america scientific research and technology factories and railroads cities and immigrants labor unions and social tensions.
for many americans the horrors of the civil war had led to a less romanticized and more realistic view of life.
an editor attending an art exhibition in 1865 sensed the greater reality of feeling developed by the war.
we have grown more sober perhaps and less patient of romantic idealism another factor contributing to the rise of realism was the impact of modern science.
this is a world of reality admitted a romantic writer and romance breaks against the many hard facts the stupendous power of science announced one editor will rid american thought of every old time idea every trace of old romance and art poetry and romantic or sentimental feeling and wash away the ideal.
and visionary realism as writer fanny bates stressed appealed especially to people living in busy swarming cities people whose lives are crowded with a variety of interests the worship of money was the most common theme in realistic novels and short stories during the gilded age.
in william dean howellss the rise of silas lapham 1885 bromfield corey announces that money is the romance the poetry of our age lily bart the heroine of edith whartons the house of mirth 1905 declares that she must have a great deal of money to be happy.
city streets sidewalks and parks provided countless scenes of real life to depict on canvas and in words.
novelist henry james said that the daily urban scene unleashed a flood of the real to study and portray.
john sloan a cultural life 863 stag at sharkeys 1909 new york painter george bellows witnessed such fierce boxing matches across the street from his studio at the saloon of retired heavyweight boxer sailor sharkey.
bellows is one of the most famous artists from the ashcan school which was committed to capturing the gritty reality of the urban scene.
new york city painter chose his subjects by spying on people from his manhattan studio.
he confided in his diary that he was addicted to watching every bit of human life through his windows and along the sidewalks.
others shared sloans spectatorial sensibility.
my favorite pastime writer theodore dreiser remembered was to walk the city streets and view the lives and activities of others in his influential novel sister carrie 1900 carrie meeber uses her gift of observation to view strangers through the open windows of shops offices and factories imagining what they deal with how they labored to what end it all came the realists emphasis on closely observing everyday life grew out of the scientific spirit.
just as scientists observed visible and verifiable facts and transformed them into knowledge cultural realists studied the world around them and expressed it in art and literature.
like a gust of fresh air they made americans aware of the significance of their everyday surroundings in all their beauty and ugliness.
864 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 gilded age politics the gilded age was an era of more political corruption than political innovation.
in 1879 woodrow wilson then a young college graduate described the political system as having no leaders no principles the real movers and shakers of the gilded age were not the men in the white house or congress but the owners of giant corporations.
these captains of industry regularly used their wealth to buy elections and favors at all levels of government.
jay gould one of the most aggressive railroad tycoons admitted that he elected the new york legislature with my own money special interests businesses that bought favors from government officials dominated gilded age politics.
by the end of the nineteenth century however new movements and parties were pushing to reform the excesses and injustices created by a political system that had grown corrupt in its efforts to support the special interests promoted by big business.
local politics and party loyalties perhaps the most important feature of gilded age politics was its local focus.
most political activity occurred at the state and local levels.
unlike today the federal government was an insignificant force in the daily lives of most citizens in part because it was so small.
in 1871 the entire federal civilian workforce totaled 51 000 most of them postal workers of whom only 6 000 actually worked in washington d c not until the twentieth century did the importance of the federal government begin to surpass that of local and state governments.
americans during the gilded age were intensely loyal to their political party which they joined as much for the fellowship and networking connections as for its positions on issues.
unlike today party members paid dues to join and party leaders regularly demanded large campaign contributions from the captains of industry and finance.
collis huntington a california railroad tycoon admitted that bribery in the form of campaign contributions was expected if you have to pay money to have the right thing done then it is only just and fair to do it roscoe conkling a powerful republican senator from new york was equally candid of course we do rotten things in new york.
politics is a rotten business democrat horatio seymour a presidential candidate in 1868 explained that our people want men in office who will not steal but who will not interfere with those who do in cities crowded with new immigrant voters politics was usually controlled by rings small groups who shaped policy and managed the nomination and election of candidates.
each ring typically had a powerful boss who used his machine a network of neighborhood activists and officials to govern.
gilded age politics 865 colorful larger than life figures such as new york citys william boss tweed shamelessly ruled plundered and occasionally improved municipal government often through dishonest means and frequent bribes.
until his arrest in 1871 and his conviction in 1873 tweed used the tammany hall ring to dominate the nations largest city.
the tammany hall machine doled out contracts to business allies and jobs to political supporters.
in the late 1870s one of every twelve new york men worked for the city government.
the various city rings and bosses were william boss tweed a larger than often corrupt but they did bring struc life political boss was new york citys ture stability and services to rapidly william boss tweed whose powerful connections made no prison big growing i nner city communities many enough to hold the boss of them composed of immigrants newly arrived from ireland germany and increasingly from southern and eastern europe.
the party in power expected the government employees it appointed to become campaign workers and to do the bidding of party bosses.
those bosses in smoke filled back rooms often decided who the candidates would be and commanded loyalty and obedience by rewarding and punishing their party members.
they helped settle local disputes provided aid for the poor and distributed government jobs and contracts to loyal followers and corporate donors through the patronage system.
president ulysses s grants secretary told a republican party boss that he hoped you will distribute the patronage in such a manner as will help the administration throughout the gilded age almost every government job local state and federal was subject to the latest election results.
as a democratic party official in new york city admitted you cant keep a political organization together without patronage.
men aint in politics for nothin.
they want to get somethin out of it the jobs given to party loyalists covered a wide range from cabinet posts to courthouse clerk positions.
the largest single source of political jobs was the postal service which accounted for half of all federal civilian employees.
those who were awarded government jobs were expected to contribute a percentage of their salary to the political party.
866 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 the corruption associated with the patronage system eventually drew criticism from civil service reformers who pushed through legislation designed to limit such patronage and introduced a merit system for government employment based on ability and experience.
national politics several factors gave national politics during the gilded age its distinctive texture.
first in importance was the close division between republicans and democrats in congress.
because neither party was dominant after the revival of the national democratic party in 1876 they both avoided controversial issues or bold initiatives for fear of losing a close election.
yet paradoxically voter intensity at all levels peaked during the gilded age at the same time that many divisive issues were suppressed or ignored.
voter turnout was commonly about 70 to 80 percent.
by contrast the turnout for the 2012 u s presidential election was 58 percent.
during the gilded age most voters cast their ballots for the same party year after year.
party loyalty was often an emotional choice.
in the 1870s and 1880s for example people continued to fight the civil war during political campaigns.
republican candidates regularly waved the bloody shirt accusing democrats of having caused secession and civil war while republicans took credit for abolishing slavery and saving the union.
democrats especially in the south where they monopolized political power after 1877 responded by reminding voters that they stood for limited government states rights and white supremacy.
republicans tended to favor high tariffs on imports but many democrats also supported tariffs if they benefited the dominant businesses in their districts or states.
third parties such as the greenbackers populists and prohibitionists appealed to specific interests and issues such as currency inflation railroad regulations or legislation to restrict alcohol consumption.
party loyalties reflected religious ethnic and geographic divisions.
after the civil war the republican party remained strongest in new england upstate new york pennsylvania ohio and the midwest.
republicans tended to be protestants of english or scandinavian descent.
as the party of abraham lincoln the great emancipator and ulysses s grant republicans could also rely upon the votes of african americans in the south until their right to vote was taken away and the support of a large bloc of union veterans of the civil war who were organized into a powerful national interest group called the grand army of the republic.
the democrats were a more diverse coalition of conservative southern whites northern catholics of german or irish catholic backgrounds and others repelled by the republicans claim to be the party of morality as one gilded age politics 867 chicago democrat explained a republican is a man who wants you t go t church every sunday.
a democrat says if a man wants to have a glass of beer on sunday he can have it during the 1880s protestant republicans infuriated many immigrants and catholics of irish italian or german background by promoting efforts to limit or prohibit the consumption of alcoholic beverages.
they also pushed for nativist policies designed to restrict immigration and the employment of foreigners.
among the immigrants crowded into the growing cities were many irish germans and italians all of whom had brought their robust drinking traditions with them into their new country.
the mostly rural protestant republicans considered saloons the central social evil around which all others revolved and they associated these evils with the ethnic groups that frequented saloons.
carrie nation the most colorful member of the womens christian temperance union wctu became nationally known for attacking saloons with a hatchet.
saloons she argued stripped a married woman of everything by coming out for harrison this 1888 cartoon depicts efforts by employers to force the working class to vote for the republican party ticket including presidential nominee benjamin harrison.

otherwise national politics was remarkably balanced.
between 1872 and 1896 no president won a majority of the popular vote.
in each of those presidential elections sixteen states invariably voted republican and fourteen including every southern state voted democratic leaving six swing states to determine the outcome.
two of those states new york and ohio decided the election of eight presidents from 1872 to 1908.
presidents during the gilded age both republican and democrat deferred to their party leaders in the senate and house of representatives.
they believed that congress not the white house should formulate major policies that the president would implement.
as senator john sherman of ohio stressed the president should merely obey and enforce the law as laid out by congress.
hayes to harrison both republicans and democrats had their share of officials willing to buy and sell government jobs or legislative votes.
yet as early as the 1870s in response to the corruption uncovered in the grant administration each party developed factions promoting honesty in government.
the struggle for clean government became one of the foremost issues of the gilded age.
hayes and civil service reform president rutherford b hayes brought to the white house in 1877 both a lingering controversy over the disputed election results critics called him his fraudulency or his accidency and an uprightness that was in sharp contrast to the barely concealed graft of the grant era.
hayes appointed a democrat as postmaster general in an effort to clean up an office infamous for trading jobs for political favors.
the son of an ohio farmer hayes was wounded four times in the civil war.
he went on to serve in congress and as governor of ohio.
honest and conservative he was said a republican journalist a third rate nonentity whose only virtue was that he was obnoxious to no one hayes had been the compromise presidential nominee of two factions fighting for control of the republican party the s o called stalwarts and hayes to harrison 869 the bosses of the senate this 1889 cartoon bitingly portrays the periods corrupt alliance between big business and legislators.
alf breeds led respectively by senators roscoe conkling of new york and h james g blaine of maine.
the stalwarts had been stalwart in their support of president grant during the furor over the misdeeds of his cabinet members.
further they had mastered the patronage system spoils system of distributing political jobs to party loyalists.
the half breeds supposedly were only half loyal to grant and half committed to reform of the spoils system.
but in the end the two factions existed primarily to advance the careers of conkling and blaine who detested each other.
to his credit president hayes tried to stay above the petty bickering.
he joined the growing public outrage over corruption admitting that his party must mend its ways by focusing on republican principles rather than fighting over the spoils of office.
he serves his party best who serves his country best hayes declared.
it was time for civil service government jobs reform he appointed a committee to consider a merit system for hiring government employees as used in some european countries.
in a dramatic gesture hayes also fired chester a arthur a stalwart republican who ran the new york customs house because arthur had abused the patronage system in ways according to hayes that promoted ignorance inefficiency and corruption hayess commitment to cleaning up politics enraged republican leaders.
in 1879 ohio congressman james garfield warned hayes that if he wishes to hold any influence with fellow republicans he must abandon some of 870 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 his notions of civil service reform for his part hayes confessed that he had little hope of success because he was opposed by.
the most powerful men in my party on economic issues hayes held to a conservative line that would guide his successors from both p arties for the rest of the century.
his answer to demands for expansion of the nations money supply which would become one of the leading issues of the late nineteenth century was a resounding no he vetoed the b land allison act 1878 a bipartisan effort to increase the supply of silver coins.
more money in circulation was generally believed to raise farm prices and help those trying to pay off debts.
hayes believed only in hard money gold coins.
when the democrat controlled congress convinced many republicans to help overturn hayess veto the president confided in his diary that he had become a president without a party.
in 1879 with a year still left in his term hayes was ready to leave the white house.
i am now in my last year of the presidency he wrote a friend and look forward to its close as a schoolboy longs for the coming vacation garfield arthur and the pendleton act with hayes choosing not to pursue a second term the republican presidential nomination in 1880 was up for grabs.
former president grant wanted the nomination but was unwilling to campaign for it.
in the end the stalwarts and half breeds were forced to select a compromise candidate congressman james a garfield.
garfield had been a minister a lawyer and a college president before serving in the civil war as a union army general.
in an effort to please the stalwarts and also win the crucial swing state of new york the republicans named chester a arthur whom hayes had fired as head of the new york customs house as their candidate for vice president.
the democrats even more divided than the republicans selected winfield scott hancock a retired union general who had distinguished himself at the battle of gettysburg but had done little since.
in large part hancock was chosen to help deflect the republicans bloody shirt attacks on democrats as the party of the confederacy.
yet hancock undermined that effort by supporting southern efforts to strip blacks of voting rights.
in an election marked by widespread bribery garfield eked out a p opular vote plurality of only 39 000 or 48 5 percent.
he won a more comfortable margin of 214 to 155 in the electoral college.
republicans took control of congress as well.
embedded in the voting however was a worrisome pattern the democrats won all the southern states and the republicans won all the northern hayes to harrison 871 states.
politically the civil war was not over.
moreover in future presidential elections if the republicans lost new york state they would lose the white house.
securing the nations m ost populous state thus became central to republican strategy.
a presidency cut short in his inaugural address president garfield gave an impassioned defense of civil rights arguing that the elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the constitution of 1787 the end of slavery he said has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people.
it has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both but he also confirmed that the republicans had ended efforts to reconstruct the former confederacy.
southern blacks were on their own now they had been surrendered to their own guardianship in the continuing feud between the half breed and stalwart factions of the republican party garfield chose the half breeds.
he appointed james g blaine as secretary of state over the objection of ulysses s grant leading the former president to tell reporters that garfield is a man without backbone.
a man of fine ability but lacking stamina.
he wants to please everybody garfield would have no time to prove himself as president however.
on july 2 1881 after only four months in office he was walking through the washington d c railroad station headed to a vacation in vermont when he was shot in the arm and back by charles guiteau a former republican who had been turned down for a federal job.
as a policeman wrestled the assassin to the ground guiteau shouted yes.
i have killed garfield.
chester arthur is president of the united states.
i am a stalwart a declaration that would eventually destroy the stalwart wing of the republican party.
on september 19 after seventy nine days garfield died of complications resulting from inept medical care.
during a sensational t en week trial guiteau said that god had ordered him to kill the president.
the jury refused to believe that he was insane and pronounced him guilty of murder.
on june 30 1882 guiteau was hanged an autopsy revealed that his brain was diseased.
the civil service commission in their grief over garfields death americans blamed roscoe conkling and the stalwart republicans for inciting guiteau.
one new york newspaper headline read murdered by the spoils system people saw little potential in the new president chester a arthur who had been roscoe conklings trusted lieutenant.
grant wrote an a ssociate that 872 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 he did not expect much from this administration yet arthur surprised most political observers by distancing himself from conkling and the stalwarts and becoming a civil service reformer.
throughout his presidency he kept a promise not to remove any federal office holder purely for political reasons.
he also made cabinet appointments based on merit rather than partisanship.
one of arthurs former new york associates a stalwart grumbled that he has done less for us than garfield or even hayes very little is known about president arthur.
just before he died he had all of his official papers and correspondence burned.
why he did so remains a mystery.
unlike most presidents there is no library or museum dedicated to arthurs career.
he wanted obscurity and he got it.
in 1883 momentum against the spoils system generated by garfields assassination enabled george h pendleton a democratic senator from ohio to convince congress to establish a civil service commission the first federal regulatory agency.
because of the pendleton civil service reform act at least 15 percent of federal jobs would now be filled on the basis of competitive tests the merit system rather than political favoritism.
in addition federal employees running for office were prohibited from receiving political contributions from other government workers.
the pendleton act was a limited first step in cleaning up the patronage process.
it was sorely needed in part because the federal government was expanding rapidly.
by 1901 there would be 256 000 federal employees five times the number in 1871.
a growing number of these federal workers were women who by 1890 held a third of the governments clerical jobs.
the campaign of 1884 chester arthurs efforts to clean up the spoils system might have attracted voters but they did not please republican leaders.
so in 1884 the republicans dumped the ailing arthur he had contracted a kidney disease and chose as their nominee james gillespie blaine of maine the handsome colorful secretary of state former senator and longtime leader of the half breeds.
blaine inspired the party faithful with his electrifying speeches and he knew how to wheel and deal in the backrooms.
one critic charged that blaine wallowed in spoils like a rhinoceros in an african pool newspapers soon uncovered evidence of his corruption in the so called mulligan letters which revealed that as speaker of the house blaine had secretly sold his votes on measures favorable to a railroad corporation.
nobody proved that he had committed any crimes but the circumstantial evidence was powerful his senatorial hayes to harrison 873 salary alone could not have built either his mansion in washington d c nor his palatial home in augusta maine.
during the presidential campaign more embarrassing letters surfaced linking blaine to shady deal making.
in one of them blaine told the recipient burn this letter for the reform element of the republican party this was too much and many independent minded republicans refused to endorse blaines candidacy.
we are republicans but we are not slaves said one of the independents.
he insisted that the party of lincoln must recommit itself to retrenchment purity senator james gillespie blaine of and reform party regulars scorned maine the republican presidential such critics as goo goos the good candidate in 1884.
government crowd who were outraged by the corrupting influence of money in politics.
the editor of a new york newspaper jokingly called the anti blaine republicans mugwumps after an algonquian indian word meaning big chief the mugwumps a s elf appointed group of reformers dedicated to promoting honest government saw the election as a moral rather than political contest.
centered in the large cities and major universities of the northeast the mugwumps were mostly professors editors and writers who included in their number the most famous american of the time writer and humorist mark twain.
like the liberal republicans before them the mugwumps sought to reform the patronage system by declaring that all federal jobs would be filled solely on the basis of merit.
their break with the republican party over patronage testified to the depth of their convictions.
the rise of the mugwumps as well as growing national concerns about political corruption prompted the democrats to nominate new yorker grover cleveland.
cleveland had first attracted national attention in 1881 when he was elected mayor of buffalo on an anti corruption platform.
he was elected governor of new york in 1882 and he continued to build a reform record by fighting new york citys corrupt tammany hall ring.
as mayor and as governor he repeatedly vetoed bills that he felt served private interests at the expense of the public good.
he supported civil service reform opposed expanding the money supply and preferred free trade to high tariffs.
874 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 although cleveland was known for his honesty and integrity he was hurt by two personal issues the discovery that he had paid for a substitute to take his place in the union army during the civil war and a juicy sex scandal that erupted when a buffalo newspaper revealed that cleveland a bachelor had befriended an attractive widow named maria halpin who named him the father of her baby born in 1874.
cleveland had discreetly provided financial support for the child.
the escapades of blaine and cleveland inspired some of the most colorful battle cries in political history blaine blaine james g blaine the continental liar from the state of maine democrats chanted.
republicans countered with ma ma wheres my pa democrats also paraded through the streets chanting burn this letter near the end of the nasty campaign blaine and his supporters committed two fateful blunders in the crucial state of new york.
the first occurred at new york citys fashionable delmonicos restaurant where blaine went to a private dinner with 200 of the nations wealthiest business leaders to ask them to help finance his campaign.
accounts of the unseemly event appeared in the newspapers for days afterward.
one headline blared blaine hobnobbing with the mighty money kings the article explained that the banquet was intended to collect contributions for a republican corruption fund blaines second blunder occurred when a protestant minister visiting republican headquarters in new york referred to the democrats as the party of rum romanism and rebellion the confederacy blaine who was present let pass the implied insult to catholics a fatal oversight since he had cultivated irish american support with his a nti english talk and repeated references to his mother being a catholic.
democrats claimed that blaine was at heart a nti irish and anti catholic.
the two incidents may have tipped the 1884 presidential election.
the elect oral vote was 219 to 182 in clevelands favor but the popular vote ran far closer clevelands plurality was fewer than 30 000 votes out of 10 million cast.
grover cleveland as president cleveland won new york by only 1 149 cleveland made the issue of tariff reform votes out of 1 167 169 cast.
at long last a central to the politics of the late 1880s.
democrat was back in the white house.
hayes to harrison 875 clevelands reform efforts during his first few months in office president cleveland struggled to keep democratic leaders from reviving the self serving patronage system.
in a letter to a friend the new president reported that he was living in a nightmare that dreadful damnable office seeking hangs over me and surrounds me and that it made him feel like resigning democratic newspapers heaped scorn on him for refusing to award federal jobs to his supporters.
one accused cleveland of ingratitude toward those who had delivered the vote despite the presidents best efforts about t wo thirds of the 120 000 federal jobs went to democrats as patronage during his administration.
cleveland was an o ld style democrat who believed in minimal government activity.
during his first term he vetoed over 400 acts of congress more than twice as many as all previous presidents combined.
in 1887 he illustrated his do as little as possible philosophy by vetoing a congressional effort to provide desperate texas farmers with seeds in the aftermath of a terrible drought.
though the people support the government the government should not support the people cleveland asserted.
railroad regulation for all of his commitment to limited government intervention president cleveland urged congress to adopt an important new policy federal regulation of the rates charged by interstate railroads those whose tracks crossed state lines to ship goods crops or livestock.
he believed that railroads were charging unfairly high freight rates.
states had adopted laws regulating railroads since the late 1860s but in 1886 the supreme court declared in wabash st louis and pacific railroad company v illinois that no state could regulate the rates charged by railroads engaged in interstate traffic.
because most railroads crossed state lines cleveland urged congress to close the loophole.
congress followed through and in 1887 cleveland signed an act creating the interstate commerce commission icc the first federal regulatory agency.
the law empowered the iccs five members to ensure that railroad freight rates were reasonable and just but one senator called the new agency a delusion and a sham because its members tended to be former railroad executives.
moreover the commissions actual powers proved to be weak when challenged in the courts by railroads.
over time the icc came to be ignored and the railroads continued to charge high rates while making secret pricing deals with large shippers.
tariff reform and the election of 1888 president clevelands most dramatic challenge to big business focused on tariff reform.
876 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 during the late nineteenth century the governments high tariff policies shaped largely by the republican party had favored american manufacturers by effectively shutting out foreign imports thereby enabling u s corporations to dominate the marketplace and charge higher prices for their products.
tariffs on some 4 000 imported items had also brought in more revenue from foreign manufacturers than the federal government spent.
as a result the tariff revenues were producing an annual government surplus which proved to cleveland and the democrats that the rates were too high.
in 1887 cleveland argued that congress should reduce both the tariff rates the vicious inequitable and illogical source of unnecessary taxation.
and a burden upon the poor and the number of imported goods subject to tariffs to enable european companies to compete in the american marketplace.
his outspoken stance set the stage for his reelection campaign in 1888.
to oppose cleveland the republicans now calling themselves the gop grand old party to emphasize their longevity turned to the obscure benjamin harrison a civil war veteran whose greatest attributes were his availability and the fact that he was from indiana a pivotal state in presidential elections.
the grandson of president william henry harrison he had a modest political record he had lost a race for governor and had served one term in the u s senate 1881 1887.
in the eyes of the party leadership however harrison had the most important attribute he would do as he was told.
the republicans accepted clevelands challenge to make tariffs the chief issue in the campaign.
they enjoyed a huge advantage in campaign funding as business executives contributed generously to their campaign.
still the outcome was incredibly close.
cleveland won the popular vote by the thinnest of margins 5 540 329 to 5 439 853 but harrison carried crucial new york state and the electoral college by 233 to 168.
providence said the new president has given us the victory matthew quay the powerful republican boss of pennsylvania who managed harrisons campaign knew better.
harrison he muttered ought to know that providence hadnt a damned thing to do with it.
a number of men were compelled to approach the penitentiary to make him president quays decision to distribute campaign money in key states and to promise federal jobs to loyalists also helped republicans gain control of the house and the senate.
as the republicans prepared for the inauguration frank leslies illustrated newspaper co edited by harrisons son russell made clear the new presidents priorities this is to be a businessmans administration and businessmen will be thoroughly well content with it hayes to harrison 877 republican activism under harrison harrison owed a heavy debt to civil war veterans whose votes had been critical to his e lection and he paid it by signing the dependent pension act.
as a result the number of union war veterans and their family members receiving federal pensions almost doubled between 1889 and 1893.
the republicans also took advantage of their control of congress to pass a cluster of significant legislation in 1890 the sherman a nti trust act the sherman silver purchase act the mckinley tariff act and the admission of idaho and wyoming as new states which followed the admission of north and south dakota montana and washington in 1889.
the sherman anti trust act named for ohio senator john sherman prohibited powerful corporations from conspiring to establish monopolies or restrain trade in their industries.
it made the united states the first nation in the world to outlaw monopolistic business practices.
though badly needed the sherman a nti trust act was a toothless hoax intended to make it appear that congress was clamping down on the gigantic corporations dominating more and more industries.
that it passed without any opposition suggested that the bill was mostly for show.
critics called it the swiss cheese act because it had so many holes in its language.
as the new york times recognized in 1890 the so called anti trust law was passed to deceive the people and prepare the way for a much higher tariff bill.
senator sherman the article added supported this humbug of a law so that party spokesmen might say behold.
we have attacked the trusts.
the republican party is the enemy of all such rings the sherman anti trust act was rarely enforced in large part because of its vague definitions of trusts and monopolies from 1890 to 1901 only eighteen lawsuits were instituted four of which were filed against labor unions a billion dollar hole in an attack on rather than corporations claiming that benjamin harrisons spending policies striking workers were conspiring to harrison is shown pouring clevelands huge surplus down a hole.
restrain trade 878 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 the sherman silver purchase act 1890 which required the treasury to purchase 4 5 million ounces of silver each month to convert into dollar coins was an effort by the republicans to please the new western states with numerous silver mines.
the bills sponsor senator john sherman admitted that he proposed the bill only to defuse cries for the unlimited coinage of silver.
i voted for it he confessed but the day it became law i was ready to repeal it the sherman act helped set the stage for the currency issue to eclipse all others during the financial panic that would sweep the country in 1893.
as for tariff policy republicans viewed their victory as a mandate to reward the support of large corporations by raising tariff rates even higher.
king of the world reformers piloted through congress by ohio targeted the growing power of representative william mckinley the monopolies such as that of john d rockefellers standard oil.
mckinley tariff act of 1890 raised duties taxes on imported manufactured goods to their highest level ever and added many agricultural products to the tariff list to appease farmers.
its passage encouraged many businesses to raise prices because their european competitors were now effectively shut out of the u s market.
the new york times expressed the indignation of many voters when it charged in a huge headline mckinleys pickpockets were paying a party debt to large corporate donors by passing the new tariff bill.
the republican efforts to reward big business backfired however.
in the november 1890 congressional elections democrats won big regaining control of the house by a three to one margin.
william mckinley who had sponsored the tariff bill lost his seat although the following year he would be elected ohios governor.
in the senate the republican majority was reduced to four.
republicans were astounded and dazed by the shellacking in the election.
even more worrisome was the emergence of the populists a new political party representing disgruntled farmers and wage laborers.
revolution was in the air.
farmers and the money problem 879 farmers and the money problem more than tariffs trusts and efforts to clean up political corruption national politics during the gilded age was preoccupied with monetary issues.
the nations money supply had not grown along with the expanding economy.
from 1865 to 1890 the amount of money in circulation both coins and paper currency actually decreased about 10 percent.
such currency deflation raised the cost of borrowing money as the shrinking money supply enabled lenders to hike interest rates on loans.
creditors bankers and others who loaned m oney supported a sound money policy limiting the currency supply as a means of increasing their profits.
by contrast farmers ranchers miners and others who had to borrow money to make ends meet claimed that the sound money policy lowered prices for their crops and herds and drove them deeper into debt.
farmers in the midwest great plains and south and miners in the west demanded more paper money and the increased coinage of silver which would inflate the currency supply raise commodity prices and provide them with more income.
in 1876 several farm organizations across the nation had organized the independent greenback party to promote the benefits of paper money over gold and silver coins greenbackers won fifteen seats in congress in 1878 illustrating the significance of currency issues to voters.
although the greenback party died out the demands for increasing the money supply survived.
all six western states admitted to the union in 1889 and 1890 had substantial silver mines and their new congressional delegations largely republican wanted the federal government to buy more silver for minting as coins.
agricultural unrest the 1890 congressional elections revealed a deep seated unrest in the farming communities of the south on the plains of kansas and nebraska and in the mining towns of the rocky mountain region.
over the previous twenty years corn prices had fallen by a third wheat by more than half cotton by t wo thirds.
the drastic decline in prices was caused by overproduction and growing international competition in world food markets.
the vast new lands brought under cultivation in the plains as a result of the extension of rail lines and the use of new farm machinery poured an e ver increasing supply of grains into world markets driving prices down.
meanwhile farmers in the south and west had become increasingly indebted to local banks or merchants who loaned them money at high interest rates to buy seed fertilizer tools and other supplies.
as prices for their crops dropped however so did the income the farmers received thus preventing them from paying their debts on time.
880 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 in response most farmers had no choice but to grow even more wheat cotton or corn but the increased supply pushed down prices and incomes even further.
high tariffs on imported goods also hurt farmers because they allowed u s companies to raise the prices of manufactured goods needed by farm families.
besides bankers merchants and high tariffs struggling farmers blamed the railroads warehouse owners and food processors the so called m iddlemen who helped get crops and livestock to market.
farmers especially resented that railroads most of which had a monopoly over the shipping of grains and animals charged such high rates to ship agricultural products.
at the same time that farm income was dropping successive years of parched summers and bitterly cold winters had destroyed harvests in many states.
this season is without parallel in this part of the country reported the editor of a nebraska agricultural journal in 1891.
the hot winds burned up the entire crop leaving thousands of families wholly destitute and vulnerable to the money loaners and sharks charging criminal rates of interest.
in a slap at the cutthroat capitalism justified by the heartless logic of social darwinism the editor dismissed the popular slogan survival of the fittest as a satanic creed that means slavery to millions in drought devastated kansas in 1890 populists won five congressional seats from republicans.
in early 1891 the newly elected populists and democrats took control of congress just as an acute economic crisis appeared on the horizon farmers debts were mounting as crop prices continued to fall.
the granger movement when the department of agriculture sent oliver h kelley on a tour of the south in 1866 he was struck by the social isolation of people living on small farms.
to address the problem kelley helped found the national grange of the patrons of husbandry better known as the grange an old word for places where crops were stored.
the grange grew quickly reaching a membership of 858 000 men and women by 1875.
it started out offering social events and educational programs for farmers and their families but as it grew it began to promote cooperatives where farmers could join together to store and sell their crops to avoid the high fees charged by brokers and other middlemen.
in five midwest states grange chapters persuaded legislatures to pass granger laws to regulate the prices charged by railroads and grain warehouses called elevators.
railroad and warehouse owners challenged the laws but in munn v illinois 1877 the supreme court ruled that states had the right to regulate property that operated in the public interest.
nine years later however the court threw out the munn ruling finding in farmers and the money problem 881 i feed you all 1875 the farmer is the cornerstone of american society according to this granger inspired poster.
without the food he produces no man in any occupation can do his job including the railroad magnate left and warehouse owners who try to exploit him.
wabash v illinois that only congress could regulate industries involved in interstate commerce.
farmers alliances the granger movement failed to address the foremost concerns of struggling farmers declining crop prices and the inadequate amount of money in circulation.
as a result people shifted their allegiance to a new organization called the farmers alliance.
like the grange the farmers alliances organized social and recreational activities for small farmers and their families while also emphasizing political action and economic cooperation to address the hardships caused by chronic indebtedness declining crop prices and droughts.
emerging first in texas the alliance movement swept across the south kansas nebraska and the dakotas.
in 1886 a white minister in texas responded to the appeals of african american farmers by organizing the colored farmers national alliance.
by 1890 the white alliance movement 882 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 had about 1 5 million members and the colored farmers national alliance claimed more than 1 million members.
most white alliance members refused to integrate their efforts with blacks not only because of racism but also because most black farmers were tenants and sharecroppers rather than landowners.
although many landless farmers supported the alliances the majority of members were landowners who sold their crops in the marketplace.
in the states west of the mississippi river political activism intensified after record blizzards in 1887 which killed most of the cattle and hogs across the northern plains and a prolonged drought two years later that destroyed millions of acres of corn wheat and oats.
distressed farmers lashed out against what they considered to be a powerful conspiracy of eastern financial and industrial interests which they variously called monopolies the money power or wall street as william jennings bryan a democratic congressman from nebraska explained we simply say to the east take your hands out of our pockets and keep them out the alliances called for the federal government to take ownership of the railroads and create an income tax on wealthy americans.
they also organized economic cooperatives to bind together their collective strength.
in 1887 charles w macune the southern alliance president explained that the alliance is the people and the people are together he exhorted texas farmers to create their own alliance exchange to free themselves from dependence on commercial warehouses grain elevators food processors and banks.
members of the alliance exchange would act collectively pooling their resources to borrow money from banks and purchase their goods and supplies from a new corporation created by the alliance in dallas.
the exchange would also build warehouses to store and market members crops.
with these crops as collateral members would receive cash loans to buy household goods and agricultural supplies.
once the farmers sold their crops they would pay back the loans provided by the alliance warehouse.
this cooperative scheme collapsed when texas banks refused to accept paper money.
undaunted alliance members then focused on what macune called a subtreasury plan whereby farmers would store their crops in government run warehouses and obtain cash loans for up to 80 percent of the crops value.
this would free them from their traditional dependence on banks that charged high interest rates.
besides providing immediate credit the subtreasury plan would allow farmers the option of storing a crop in hopes of getting a better price later.
the plan would also promote inflation of the money supply because the loans to farmers would be made in new paper money.
monetary inflation was popular with farmers because it allowed them to repay their debts with cheaper money.
farmers and the money problem 883 despite the strong support from farmers however congress nixed the subtreasury plan in 1890.
its defeat as well as setbacks to other alliance proposals convinced many farm leaders that they needed more political power to secure the reforms necessary to save the agricultural sector railroad regulation currency inflation state departments of agriculture anti trust laws and more accessible farm based credit loans.
about o ne fourth of alliance members were women.
the alliance welcomed rural women and men over sixteen years of age who displayed a good moral character believed in god and demonstrated industrious habits the slogan of the southern alliance was equal rights to all special privileges to none a north carolina woman relished the grand opportunities the alliance provided women allowing them to emerge from household drudgeries.
drudgery fashion and gossip she declared are no longer the bounds of womans sphere one alliance publication made the point explicitly the alliance has come to redeem woman from her enslaved condition and place her in her proper sphere the number of women in the movement grew rapidly and many assumed key leadership roles in the grand army of reform new third parties the alliances called for third party political action to address their concerns.
in 1890 farm activists in colorado joined with miners and railroad workers to form the independent party and nebraska farmers formed the peoples independent party.
leonidas polk a former confederate general who was the head of the north carolina alliance traveled to kansas and was so impressed by the size of the open air farm rallies that he declared that farmers across the nation have risen up and inaugurated a movement such as the world has never seen in the south the alliance movement forced democrats to nominate candidates who supported its farm program and succeeded in electing four of them as governors forty four as congressmen and several as u s senators as well as seven p ro alliance state legislatures.
among the most respected of the southern alliance leaders was thomas e watson a lawyer from georgia.
the son of prosperous slaveholders who had lost everything after the civil war watson took the lead in urging black and white tenant farmers to join forces.
you are racially kept apart he told blacks and whites that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings he insisted on cooperation by black and white farmers to resist the power of the wealthy political elite in the south.

the election of 1892 in 1892 alliance leaders organized a convention in omaha nebraska at which they formed the peoples party populists.
the delegates approved a platform that called for unlimited coinage of silver a progressive income tax whose rates would rise with income levels and federal ownership of the railroads.
the populists also endorsed the e ight hour workday and new laws restricting immigration for fear that foreigners were taking americans jobs.
we meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral political and material ruin the populists announced.
the fruits of toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few.
the populist partys platform turned out to be more exciting than its presidential candidate iowas james b weaver a former union army officer who had headed the greenback party ticket twelve years earlier.
the major parties renominated the same candidates who had run in 1888 democrat grover cleveland and republican president benjamin harrison.
each major candidate received more than 5 million votes but cleveland won a majority farmers and the money problem 885 the populist party a populist gathering in callaway nebraska 1892 of the electoral college.

alabama was the banner populist state of the south with 37 percent of its vote going to weaver.
the depression of 1893 and the free silver crusade while farmers were funneling their discontent into politics a fundamental weakness in the economy was about to cause a major collapse and a social rebellion.
just ten days before grover cleveland was inaugurated in the winter of 1893 the philadelphia and reading railroad declared bankruptcy setting off a national financial crisis now called the panic of 1893.
it grew into the worst depression the nation had ever experienced.
other overextended railroads collapsed taking many banks with them.
european investors withdrew their funds from america.
a quarter of unskilled urban workers lost their jobs many others had their wages cut and by the fall of 1893 more than 600 banks had closed and 15 000 businesses had failed.
farm foreclosures soared in the south and west and by 1900 a third of all american farmers rented their land rather than owned it.
by 1894 the nations economy had reached bottom.
but the depression lasted another four years with unemployment hovering at 20 percent.
in new york city the rate was close to 35 percent.
886 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 president clevelands response was recklessly conservative he convinced congress to return the nations money supply to a gold standard by repealing the sherman silver purchase act of 1890 a move that made the depression worse.
the weak economy needed more money in circulation not less.
investors rushed to exchange their silver dollars for gold further constricting the money supply.
hard times triggered a wave of labor unrest.
in 1894 some 750 000 workers went on strike.
railroad construction workers laid off in the west began tramping east and talked of marching on washington d c one protest group called coxeys army was led by general jacob s coxey a wealthy ohio quarry owner turned populist who demanded that the federal government provide the national panic the new york stock exchange on the morning of friday unemployed with meaningful work.
may 5 1893.
coxey his wife and their son legal tender coxey rode in a carriage ahead of some 400 protesters who marched hundreds of miles to washington d c where police arrested coxey for walking on the grass.
although his ragtag army dispersed peacefully the march as well as the growing strength of populism struck fear into the hearts of many conservatives.
republicans portrayed populists as tramps and hayseed socialists whose election would endanger the capitalist system.
the populists responded by charging that americans were divided into tramps and millionaires in this climate of class warfare and social anxiety the 1894 congressional elections devastated president cleveland and the democrats who were blamed for the economic crisis.
the republicans gained 118 seats in the house the largest increase ever.
only in the solid democratic south did the party retain its advantage.
the populists emerged with six senators and seven representatives and they expected the festering discontent in rural areas to carry them to national power in 1896.
their hopes would be dashed however.
farmers and the money problem 887 silverites versus goldbugs clevelands decision to repeal the sherman silver purchase act created an irreparable division in his party.
one pro silver democrat labeled the president a traitor.
politicians from western states with large silver mines increased their demands for the unlimited coinage of silver presenting a strategic dilemma for populists should the party promote the long list of reforms it had originally advocated or should it try to ride the silver issue into power.
although flooding the economy with silver currency would probably not have provided the benefits its advocates claimed the free silver crusade had taken on powerful symbolic overtones.
over the protests of more radical members populist leaders decided to hold their 1896 nominating convention after the two major party conventions confident that the republicans and democrats would at best straddle the silver issue and enable the populists to lure away pro silver advocates from both.
the major parties however took opposite positions on the currency issue.
the republicans as expected nominated william mckinley a former congressman and governor of ohio on a platform committed to gold coins as the only form of currency.
a small but vocal group of silver republicans from western states led by senator henry teller of colorado were so upset that they stormed out of the convention.
after the convention a friend told mckinley that the money question would determine the election.
he was right.
the democratic convention held in chicago was one of the great turning points in political history.
the p ro silver largely rural delegates surprised the party leadership and the gold democrats or goldbugs by capturing control of the convention.
william jennings bryan thirty six year old william jennings bryan of nebraska gave the final speech before the balloting began.
a fiery evangelical moralist bryan was a two term congressman who had lost a race for the senate in 1894 when democrats by the dozens were swept out of office.
in the months before the convention he had traveled throughout the south and west speaking passionately for the unlimited coinage of silver attacking clevelands do nothing response to the depression and endorsing both democrats and populists who embraced the cause of free silver bryan was a compelling speaker a crusading preacher in the role of a populist politician.
in his carefully crafted and well rehearsed speech he claimed that two ideas about the role of government were competing for the american voter.
the republicans he said believed that if you just legislate to make the well to do prosperous that their prosperity will leak through on those below 888 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 the democrats by contrast believed that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it for his part bryan spoke for the producing masses of this nation against the eastern financial magnates who had enslaved them by manipulating the money supply to ensure high interest rates.
as bryan brought his electrifying t wenty minute speech to a climax he fused christian imagery with populist anger i come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty the cause of humanity.
we have petitioned and our petitions have been scorned.
we have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.
we beg no longer we entreat no more we petition no more.
we defy them.
bryan then identified himself with jesus christ.
sweeping his fingers across his forehead he shouted you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.
you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold at which point he extended his arms straight out from his sides as if he were being crucified.
his riveting performance worked better than even he could have imagined.
as he strode triumphantly off the stage the delegates erupted in wild applause.
everybody seemed to go mad at once reported the new york world.
for their part the republicans were not all amused by bryans antics.
a republican newspaper observed that no political movement had ever before spawned such hideous and repulsive vipers theodore roosevelt claimed that bryan was a demagogue with an unsound mind who was promoting mob rule by the shiftless and the disorderly and the criminal and the william jennings bryan his cross of gold speech at the 1896 democratic s emi criminal elements of society.
convention roused the delegates and the next day bryan won the pressecured him the partys presidential idential nomination on the fifth balnomination.
lot but in the process the democratic farmers and the money problem 889 party was fractured.
disappointed democrats who had supported grover cleveland dismissed bryan as a fanatic and a socialist.
they were so alienated by his positions and his rhetoric that they walked out of the convention and nominated their own candidate senator john m palmer of illinois.
fellow democrats palmer announced i will not consider it any great fault if you decide to cast your vote for william mckinley when the populists gathered in st louis for their nominating convention two weeks later they faced an impossible choice.
they could name their own candidate and divide the p ro silver vote with the democrats or they could endorse bryan and probably lose their identity.
in the end they backed bryan but chose their own v ice presidential candidate thomas e watson and invited the democrats to drop their vice presidential nominee.
bryan refused the offer.
the election of 1896 the election of 1896 was one of the most dramatic in history in part because of the striking contrast between the candidates and in part because the terrible depression made the stakes so high.
one observer said that the campaign took the form of religious frenzy indeed bryan campaigned like the evangelist he was.
he was the first major candidate since andrew jackson to champion the poor the discontented and the oppressed.
he excited struggling farmers miners and union members.
and he was the first leader of a major party to call for the expansion of the federal government to help the working class.
no one loved campaigning more than bryan.
he traveled some 18 000 miles by train visiting 26 states and 250 cities and towns delivering impassioned speeches.
his populist crusade was for whites only however.
like so many otherwise progressive democratic leaders bryan never challenged presidential campaign badges on the left wings of the goldbug and silverite badges are mckinley top and bryan bottom with their running mates on the right.
890 chapter 19 political s talemate and rural revolt 1865 1900 the practices of racial segregation and violence against blacks in the solidly democratic south.
and he alienated many w orking class catholics in northern states by supporting prohibition of alcoholic beverages.
mckinley meanwhile stayed at home and kept his mouth shut letting other republicans speak for him.
he knew he could not compete with bryan as a speaker so he conducted a front porch campaign welcoming supporters at his home in canton ohio and giving only prepared statements to the press which warned m iddle class voters of the dangers of bryans ideas.
mckinleys brilliant campaign manager marcus mark hanna shrewdly portrayed bryan as a popocrat a radical whose communistic spirit would ruin the capitalist system and stir up a class war.
hanna convinced the republican party to declare that it was unreservedly for sound money meaning gold coins.
by appealing to such fears the republicans raised vast sums of money from corporations and wealthy donors to finance an army of 1 400 speakers who the election of 1896 wa or ca 1 dem.

wwn64 how did mckinleys campaign strategy differ from bryans.
figure m19 3 first proof why was bryan able to carry the west and the south but unable to win in cities and the northeast.
farmers and the money problem 891 traveled the country promoting mckinley.
it was the most sophisticated and expensive presidential campaign in history to that point.
in the end bryan won the most votes of any candidate in history 6 5 million but mckinley won even more 7 1 million.
the better organized and better financed republicans won the electoral college vote by 271 to 176.
bryan carried most of the west and all of the south but found little support in the north and east.
in the critical midwest from minnesota and iowa eastward to ohio he did not win a state.
his evangelical protestantism repelled many roman catholic voters who were normally drawn to the democrats.
farmers in the northeast moreover were less attracted to radical reform than were farmers in the west and south.
workers in the cities found it easier to identify with mckinleys focus on reviving the industrial economy than with bryans farm based free silver evangelism.
of the nations twenty largest cities bryan carried only new orleans.
although bryan lost he launched the democratic partys shift from pro business conservatism to its eventual twentieth century role as a party of liberal reform.
the populist party however virtually disintegrated.
having won a million votes in 1896 it collected only 50 000 in 1900.
conversely mckinleys victory climaxed a g eneration long struggle for political control of an industrialized urban america.
the republicans would be dominant for sixteen years.
by 1897 when mckinley was inaugurated economic prosperity was returning.
part of the reason was inflation of the currency which bore out the arguments of the greenbackers and silverites that the nations money supply had been inadequate during the gilded age.
but inflation came in one of historys many ironies not from more greenbacks or silver dollars but from a flood of gold discovered in south africa northwest canada and alaska.
in 1900 congress passed and mckinley signed a bill affirming that the nations money supply would be based only on gold.
even though the populist movement faded after william jennings bryans defeat most of the ideas promoted by bryan democrats and populists dismissed as too radical in 1896 would be implemented over the next two decades by a more diverse coalition of democrats and republicans who would call themselves progressives chapter review summary americas move to town americas cities grew in all directions during the gilded age.
electric elevators and steel frame construction allowed architects to extend buildings upward and mass transit enabled the middle class to retreat to suburbs.
crowded tenements bred disease and crime and created an opportunity for urban party bosses to accrue power in part by distributing to the poor various forms of assistance.
the new immigration by 1900 an estimated 30 percent of americans living in major cities were f oreign born with the majority of new immigrants coming from eastern and southern europe rather than western and northern europe like most immigrants of generations past.
their languages culture and religion were quite different from those of native born americans.
beginning in the 1880s nativists advocated restrictive immigration laws and won passage of the chinese exclusion act.
changes in culture and thought many areas of american life underwent profound changes during the gilded age.
the growth of large cities led to the popularity of vaudeville and wild west shows and to the emergence of spectator sports.
saloons served as local social and political clubs for men despite the disapproval of anti liquor groups.
charles darwins on the origin of species shocked people who believed in a literal interpretation of the bibles account of creation.
proponents of social darwinism applied darwins theory of evolution to human society by equating economic and social success with survival of the fittest and arguing that government should not try to promote equality or protect the less successful.
reform darwinism held that collective efforts and social reform could guide human progress.
gilded age politics huge corporations corrupted politics and used their money to buy political influence.
political activity was still concentrated at the state and local levels.
americans were intensely loyal to the two major parties whose local bosses and machines won votes by distributing patronage jobs and contracts to members as well as charitable relief.
party loyalties reflected regional ethnic and religious differences.
although republicans almost always held the presidency the overall strength of the major parties was so balanced that neither wanted to risk alienating voters by taking bold stands.
corruption and reform national politics during the gilded age focused on tariffs the regulation of corporations and civil service reform.
the passage of the pendleton civil service reform act in 1883 began the professionalization of federal workers.
in the 1884 presidential election republicans favoring reform the mugwumps helped elect democrat grover cleveland.
cleveland signed the 1887 act creating the interstate commerce commission icc to regulate railroads.
in 1890 under president benjamin harrison republicans passed the sherman anti trust act the sherman silver purchase act and the mckinley tariff act.
the first proved ineffective the third which raised tariff rates proved unpopular and led to clevelands return to the white house in the 1892 election.
inadequate currency supply and unhappy farmers over the course of the late nineteenth century the money question had become a central political issue.
the supply of money had not increased as the economy had grown.
many farmers believed that the coinage of silver rather than a gold standard system would result in inflation which in turn would increase the value of their crops and reduce their debts.
farmers and others unsatisfied with the republican and democratic parties formed a series of political parties and alliances one of which the peoples party briefly operated as a national third party.
in the election of 1896 the democratic party nominated william jennings bryan who adopted the coinage of silver as his crusade.
he was opposed by republican william mckinley who supported the gold standard.
mckinley better organized and better financed won the election in part by appealing to the growing number of city dwellers and industrial workers.

pa r t s i x modern america the united states entered the twentieth century on a wave of unrelenting change not all of it beneficial.
the nation was on the threshold of modernity which both excited and scared americans.
old truths and beliefs clashed with unsettling scientific discoveries and social practices.
people debated the legitimacy of darwinism the existence of god the dangers of jazz and the federal effort to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages.
the advent of automobiles and airplanes helped shrink distance and such communications innovations as radio and film helped strengthen the sense that america now had a national culture.
spurred by its growing industrial power the united states began to emerge from its isolationist shell.
previously presidents and statesmen had sought to isolate america from the intrigues and conflicts of european powers.
as early as 1780 john adams had warned against u s involvement in europes affairs.
our business with them and theirs with us he wrote is commerce not politics much less war with only a few exceptions statesmen during the nineteenth century followed such advice.
noninvolvement in foreign wars and nonintervention in the internal affairs of foreign governments formed the pillars of u s foreign policy.
during the 1890s however expanding commercial interests led americans to broaden their concerns.
imperialism was the focus of the major european powers and a growing number of expansionists demanded that the united states join in the hunt for new territories and markets.
others believed the united states should support democratic ideals abroad.
such mixed motives helped spark the spanish american war the war of 1898 and helped justify the resulting acquisition of colonies outside the continental united states.
entangling alliances with european powers soon followed.
the outbreak of the great war in europe in 1914 posed an even greater challenge to americas tradition of nonintervention.
the prospect of a german victory over the french and british threatened the european balance of power which had long ensured the security of the united states.
by 1917 it appeared that germany might emerge triumphant and begin to menace the western hemisphere.
as german submarines began sinking american merchant ships president woodrow wilsons patience finally ran out and in april 1917 the united states entered the war.
wilsons crusade to transform international affairs in accordance with his idealistic principles dislodged american foreign policy from its isolationist moorings.
it also spawned a prolonged debate about the nations role in world affairs a debate that world war ii would resolve for a time on the side of internationalism.
while the united states was becoming a formidable military power it was also settling in as a great industrial nation.
cities and factories sprouted across the landscape and an abundance of new jobs and affordable farmland attracted millions of foreign immigrants.
they were not always welcomed nor were they readily assimilated.
ethnic and racial strife grew as did labor agitation.
in the midst of such social turmoil and unparalleled economic d evelopment reformers made their first sustained attempt to adapt political and social 897 i nstitutions to the realities of the industrial age.
the worst excesses and injustices of urban industrial development corporate monopolies child labor political corruption hazardous working conditions urban ghettos were finally addressed in a comprehensive way.
during the progressive era 1890 1917 local state and federal governments sought to rein in the excesses of industrial capitalism and develop a more rational and efficient public policy.
a conservative republican resurgence challenged the notion of the new regulatory state during the 1920s and free enterprise and corporate capitalism witnessed a dramatic revival.
but the stock market crash of 1929 helped propel the united states and the world into the worst economic downturn in history.
the unprecedented severity of the great depression renewed demands for federal programs to protect the general welfare.
the many new deal initiatives and agencies instituted by president franklin delano roosevelt and his democratic administration created the framework for a welfare state that has since served as the basis for public policy.
the new deal revived public confidence and put people back to work but it took a second world war to end the great depression and restore full employment.
the necessity of mobilizing the nation to support the second world war also accelerated the growth of the federal government and the unparalleled scope of the war helped catapult the united states into a leadership role in world politics.
the use of atomic bombs ushered in a new era of nuclear diplomacy that held the fate of the world in the balance.
for all the new creature comforts associated with modern life americans in 1945 found themselves living amid an array of new anxieties.
seizing an american empire 1865 1913 the charge of the rough riders of san juan hill 1898 before frederic remington pursued art professionally he had unsuccessful forays into hunting ranching and even the saloon business in the west.
his intimacy with the western way of life along with his technical skill and keen sense of observation were not lost on theodore roosevelt who invited remington to travel with the rough riders during the spanish american war.
a fter the civil war a mood of isolationism a desire to stay out of conflicts elsewhere in the world dominated american public opinion.
the nations geographic advantages encouraged this isolationist attitude oceans to the east and west and militarily weak neighbors in the western hemisphere.
that the powerful british navy protected the shipping lanes between the united states and the british isles gave americans a heightened sense of security.
by the end of the nineteenth century however a dramatic transformation occurred in americas outlook.
people grew increasingly aware that the country was a world power with global responsibilities and imperial ambitions.
as a kentucky newspaper editor proclaimed in 1893 the united states was the most advanced and powerful nation in the world an imperial republic destined to shape the future of the world the washington post agreed revealing that the taste of empire is in the mouth of the people while still wanting to stay out of european conflicts a growing number of americans urged officials to acquire additional territory outside north america.
the old idea of manifest destiny that the united states had been blessed by god destined to expand its territory westward across the c ontinent was enlarged to include extending american control into other regions of the western hemisphere and even to the pacific and asia.
americans embraced a new form of expansionism that sought distant territories as colonies with no intention of admitting them to the nation as equal states.
the new manifest destiny in other words became a justification for imperialism.

800 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 full of the zest of darers by 1900 a new west and a new south had emerged and eleven new states had been created out of the western territories.
the myth of the new south after the war between the states the south fought an inner civil war over the regions future.
many white southerners embraced the lost cause a romanticized interpretation of the war that painted the confederates as noble defenders of their distinctive way of life against a tyrannical federal government headed by abraham lincoln.
southerners were haunted by a lingering nostalgia for the mythic old south of white columned plantations white supremacy and cotton generated wealth produced by armies of enslaved blacks.
as one southerner said his native region remained old fashioned medieval and provincial worshipping the dead at the same time no region has inspired a more tenacious pride of place a localism anchored in family life enlivened by visions of a mythic past.
mississippi writer eudora welty once explained that in the south feelings are bound up with place home and history are two of the most revered words in southern life.
n ineteenth century southerners did not simply live in the present and dream of the future.
they were forever glancing backward in the process of moving forward.
as william faulkner recognized in his novel intruder in the dust the past isnt dead.
its not even past other prominent southerners however looked more to the future.
they called for a new south where the regions predominantly agricultural economy would be diversified by an expanded industrial sector.
the tireless champion of the new south ideal was henry woodfin grady 1850 1889 the powerful managing editor of the atlanta constitution.
in 1886 grady told a new york city audience that there had been an old south of slavery and secession that south is dead.
there is now a new south of union and freedom that south thank god is living breathing and growing every hour the old south he added rested everything on slavery and agriculture unconscious that these could neither give nor maintain healthy growth grady saw the new south becoming a perfect democracy of small farms complemented by mills mines factories and cities.
the postwar south grady claimed would become a real democracy no longer run by the planter aristocracy or dependent upon slave labor.
many southerners shared gradys vision.
the confederacy they concluded had lost the war because it had relied too much upon king c otton the myth of the new south 801 a nd slavery.
in the future the new south must follow the norths example out yankee the yankees and develop a strong industrial sector to go with its agricultural foundation.
new south advocates also stressed that m ore efficient farming using the latest machinery and technical expertise was essential that widespread vocational training was urgently needed and that racial harmony built upon the acceptance by blacks of white supremacy a peculiar form of a perfect democracy would provide a stable social environment for economic growth.
textile mills the chief accomplishment of the new souths effort to industrialize was a dramatic expansion of the regions textile industry which produced thread and cotton bedding and clothing.
from 1880 to 1900 the number of cotton mills in the south grew from 161 to 400 the number of mill workers most of whom were white with women and children outnumbering men increased fivefold and the demand for cotton products went up eightfold.
thousands of dirt poor farm folk many of them children rushed to take jobs in the mill villages that arose after the war.
seventy percent of mill workers were under the age of t wenty one and many were under the age of fourteen.
a d awn to dusk job in a mill paying fifty cents a day was much more interesting than o ne horse farming noted one worker because you can meet your bills those bills were usually paid to the mill owner who provided housing and supplies to the workers in his v illage for a fee.
by 1900 the south had surpassed new england as the largest producer of cotton fabric in the nation.
the tobacco industry tobacco growing and cigarette production also soared in the new south.
essential to the rise of the tobacco industry was the duke family of durham north carolina.
at the end of the civil war washington duke took his barn load of tobacco dried it and with the help of his two sons hitched two mules to his wagon and traveled across the state selling tobacco in small pouches as he went.
by 1872 the dukes had a cigarette factory producing 125 000 pounds of tobacco annually.
washingtons son james buchanan duke wanted even greater success however.
he spent millions on advertising schemes and perfected the mechanized mass production of cigarettes.
duke also undersold competitors and cornered the supply of ingredients needed to make cigarettes.
eventually his primary competitors agreed to join forces with him and in 1890 duke brought most of them into the american tobacco company which controlled 90 percent of the nations cigarette production.
a ferociously hard worker duke was 802 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 well on his way to becoming one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the nation.
i needed no vacation or time off duke explained.
there aint a thrill in the world to compare with building a business and watching it grow before your eyes other new south industries effective use of other nat ural resources helped revitalize the south along the appalachian chain from west virginia to alabama.
coal production in the south grew from 5 million tons in 1875 to 49 million tons by 1900.
at the southern end of the mountains birmingham alabama sprang up during the 1870s in large part because of the massive deposits of iron ore in the surrounding ridges leading boosters to label the steelmaking city the pittsburgh of the south urban and industrial expansion as well as rapid population growth created a need for housing and after 1870 southern smokes allen ginter was lumbering became the fastest growing a major tobacco manufacturer that was industry in the south.
northern invesacquired by the american tobacco tors bought up vast forests of yellow company.
this advertisement featuring black laborers in the tobacco fields pine and set about clear cutting them plays to the southern nostalgia for the and hauling the logs to new sawmills old dominion before the civil war.
where they were milled into lumber for the construction of homes and businesses.
by 1900 lumber had surpassed textiles in annual economic value.
still for all of its advances the south continued to lag behind the rest of the nation in industrial development.
the redeemers henry gradys vision of a new south celebrated the redeemers the conservative pro business white politicians in the democratic party who had embraced the idea of industrial progress grounded in white supremacy.
their supporters referred to them as redeemers because the failings of the new south 803 they supposedly saved redeemed the south from yankee domination and black rule during reconstruction.
the redeemers included a rising class of lawyers merchants railroad executives and entrepreneurs who wanted a more diversified economy.
they also sought cuts in state taxes and expenditures including those for the p ublic school systems started after the war.
schools are not a necessity claimed a virginia governor.
louisiana cut school funding so much that the percentage of its residents unable to read and write actually increased between 1880 and 1900.
black children in particular suffered from such cutbacks.
but the redeemers did not want educated african americans.
what i want here is negroes who can make cotton explained a white planter and they dont need education to help them make cotton the failings of the new south despite the development of mills and factories the south in 1900 remained the least industrial least urban least educated and least prosperous region in the nation.
per capita income in the south in 1900 was only 60 percent of the national average.
the typical southerner was less likely to be tending a textile loom or a steel furnace than as the saying went facing the eastern end of a westbound mule.
the south was still dependent on the north for investment capital and manufactured goods.
cotton remained king after the civil war although it never regained the huge profitability it had generated in the 1850s.
by the 1880s southern farmers were producing as much cotton as they had before the war but were earning far less money because the world price for cotton had declined.
southern poverty henry grady also hoped that growing numbers of southern farmers would own their own land by the end of the nineteenth century.
but the opposite occurred.
many southern farmers actually lost ownership of the land that they worked each year.
a prolonged decline in crop prices during the last third of the nineteenth century made it more difficult than ever to buy and own land.
by 1900 an estimated 70 percent of farmers did not own the land they worked and in no southern state were more than half of farmers landowners.
the crop lien system because most southern communities had no banks after the civil war people had to find ways to operate with little or no cash.
many rural areas adopted a barter economy in which a crossroads 804 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 free slaves sharecroppers painstakingly pick cotton while their white overseer watches them from atop his horse.
or furnishing merchant would provide food clothing seed fertilizer and other items to poor farmers on credit in exchange for a share or lien of their crops when harvested.
southern farmers white and black who participated in the crop lien system fell into three distinct categories small farm owners sharecroppers and tenants.
the farms owned by most southerners were small and did not generate much cash income.
as a result even those who owned their own farms had to pledge a portion of their future crop to the local merchant in return for supplies purchased on credit sharecroppers mostly blacks who had nothing to offer but their labor worked an owners land in return for shelter seed fertilizer mules supplies food and a share of the crop generally about half.
share tenants mostly white farmers who were barely better off might have their own mule or horse a plow and tools and a line of credit with the country store but they still needed to rent land to farm.
a few paid their rent in cash but most like sharecroppers pledged a share of the harvested crops to the landowner.
usually the tenant farmers were able to keep a larger share of the crop about 60 percent than allowed to the sharecroppers which meant that landowners often preferred to rent to croppers rather than tenants.
and many african american sharecroppers worked for the same planter who had owned them as slaves.
the colored folks said a black alabama sharecropper stayed the failings of the new south 805 with the old boss man and farmed and worked on the plantations.
they were still slaves but they were free slaves eighty percent of southern blacks lived on farms in the late nineteenth century.
the crop lien system was self destructive.
the overwhelming focus on planting cotton or tobacco year after year stripped the soil of its fertility and stability.
this led to disastrous erosion of farmland during rainstorms as soil washed into nearby creeks collapsing riverbanks and creating e ver deepening gullies.
in addition landowners required croppers and tenants to grow only a cash crop usually cotton or tobacco.
this meant that the landless farmers could not grow their own vegetable gardens they had to get their food from the local merchant in exchange for promised cotton.
because most farmers did not own the land they worked the cabins they lived in or the tools they used they had little incentive to enrich the soil or maintain buildings and equipment.
the tenant explained a study of southern agriculture in 1897 written by matthew b hammond a south c arolina born economist is interested only in the crop he is raising and makes no effort to keep up the fertility of the land the tenant system of farming hammond concluded had been more wasteful and destructive than slavery was anywhere the crop lien system was a post civil war version of economic slavery for poor whites as well as for blacks.
the landowner or merchant often the same person decided what crop would be planted and how it would be cultivated harvested and sold.
in good times croppers and tenants barely broke even in bad times they struggled to survive.
sharecroppers and share tenants were among the poorest people in the nation.
most of them had little or no education rarely enough healthy food and little hope for a better future.
those who worked the farms developed an intense suspicion of their landlords who often swindled workers by not giving them their fair share of the crops.
landlords kept the books handled the sale of the crops and gave the cropper or tenant his share of the proceeds after deducting for all the items supplied during the year plus interest that ranged according to one newspaper from 24 percent to grand larceny often the cropper or tenant received nothing at the end of a harvest but a larger debt to be rolled over to the next years crop.
over time the high interest charged on the credit offered by the local store or landowner coupled with sagging prices for cotton and other crops created a hopeless cycle of debt among small farmers sharecroppers and share tenants.

first proof texas cultivation the price paid for raw cotton fell steadily.
have you all felt the effects of the low price of cotton mary parham of amite louisiana wrote to her father in 1892.
it nearly ruined us.
i did not get my house built.
the farmers are very blue here.
but they are getting ready to plant cotton again as the price paid for cotton dropped desperate farmers planted even more cotton which only accelerated the decline in price.
in the 1870s annual production of cotton was about 2 6 billion pounds which brought an average price of 11 77 cents per pound.
in the 1880s the average annual production was 3 billion pounds at 10 44 cents per pound.
by 1896 the average price of cotton was down to 7 72 cents.
the average annual income of white southerners in 1900 was about half that of americans outside the south.
eleven percent of whites in the south were illiterate twice the national average.
the regions poorest people were the 9 million former slaves and their children.
per capita black income in 1900 was a third of that of southern whites and the black illiteracy rate in the south was nearly 50 percent almost five times higher than that of whites.
race relations during the 1890s 807 race relations during the 1890s the desperate plight of southern farmers in the 1880s and 1890s affected race relations for the worse.
during the 1890s white farmers and politicians demanded that blacks be stripped of their voting rights and other civil rights.
a violent negrophobia swept across the south and much of the nation.
in part the new wave of racism was spurred by the revival of the old idea that the a nglo saxon race was intellectually and genetically superior to blacks.
another reason was that many whites had come to resent any signs of african american financial success and political influence.
an alabama newspaper editor declared that our blood boils when the educated negro asserts himself politically disfranchising african americans by the 1890s a new generation of african americans born and educated since the end of the civil war was determined to gain true equality.
they were more assertive and less patient than their parents.
we are not the negro from whom the chains of slavery fell a quarter century ago most assuredly not a black editor announced.
a growing number of young white adults however were equally determined to keep negroes in their place mississippi took the lead in stripping blacks of their voting rights.
the so called mississippi plan a series of state constitutional amendments in 1890 set the pattern of disfranchisement that nine more states would follow.
the disfranchisement plan first instituted a residence requirement for voting two years in the state one year in a local election district.
this was aimed at african american tenant farmers who were in the habit of moving yearly in search of better economic opportunities.
second mississippi disqualified blacks from voting if they had committed certain crimes.
third in order to vote people had to have paid all of their taxes on time including a so called poll tax specifically for voting a restriction that hurt both poor blacks and poor whites.
finally all voters had to be able to read or at least understand the u s constitution.
white registrars decided who satisfied this requirement and they usually discriminated against blacks.
other states added variations on the mississippi plan.
in 1898 louisiana inserted into its state constitution the grandfather clause which allowed illiterate whites to vote if their fathers or grandfathers had been eligible to vote on january 1 1867 when african americans were still disfranchised.
by 1910 georgia north carolina virginia alabama and oklahoma had incorporated the grandfather clause.
also in the democratic solid south every southern state created a democratic primary process to select candidates and most of these primaries excluded african american voters.
808 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 when such legal means were not enough to ensure their political dominance white candidates used fraud and violence.
benjamin tillman the white supremacist who served as south carolinas governor from 1890 to 1894 maintained that his states problems were caused by white farmers renting their land to ignorant lazy negroes his effective use of such racist e xplanations gained him the support of poor whites in his crusade to oust the ruling redeemers.
tillman claimed that i organized the majority of voters and put the old families out of business and we became and are the rulers of the state to ensure his election tillman and his followers effectively eliminated the black vote.
he admitted that we have done our level best to prevent blacks from voting.
we stuffed ballot boxes.
we shot them.
we are not ashamed of it the whites had regained control of the state government he concluded and they were determined to maintain their supremacy.
by the end of the nineteenth century widespread racial discrimination segregation of public facilities political disfranchisement and vigilante justice had elevated government sanctioned bigotry to an official way of life in the south.
tillman bluntly declared in 1892 that blacks must remain subordinate or be exterminated the efforts to suppress the black vote succeeded throughout the south.
in 1896 louisiana had 130 000 registered black voters by 1900 it had only 5 320.
in alabama in 1900 the census reported that 121 159 black men were literate only 3 742 however were registered to vote.
by that year black voting across the south had declined by 62 percent the white vote by 26 percent.
the spread of segregation at the same time that southern blacks were being shoved out of the political arena they were also being segregated socially.
the symbolic first target was the railroad passenger car.
in 1885 novelist george washington cable noted that in south carolina blacks ride in first class rail cars as a right and their presence excites no comment from 1875 to 1883 in fact any local or state law requiring racial segregation violated the federal civil rights act 1875.
by 1883 however many northern whites endorsed the resegregation of southern life.
in that year the u s supreme court ruled that the civil rights act of 1875 was unconstitutional.
the judges explained that private individuals and organizations could engage in acts of racial discrimination because the fourteenth amendment specified only that no state could deny citizens equal protection of the law.
the courts interpretation in what came to be called the civil rights cases 1883 left as an open question the validity of state laws requiring racially segregated public facilities under the principle of separate but equal a slogan race relations during the 1890s 809 popular in the south in the late nineteenth century.
in the 1880s tennessee and mississippi required railroad passengers to ride in segregated cars.
when louisiana followed suit in 1890 with a similar law blacks challenged it in the case of plessy v ferguson 1896.
the case originated in new orleans when homer plessy an octoroon a person having one eighth african ancestry refused to leave a w hites only railroad car and was convicted of violating the law.
in 1896 the supreme court ruled that states had a right to create laws segregating public places such as schools hotels and restaurants.
justice john marshall harlan a kentuckian who had once owned slaves was the only member of the court to dissent.
he stressed that the constitution is color blind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.
in respect of civil rights all citizens are equal before the law he feared that the courts ruling would plant the seeds of race hate under the sanction of law that is precisely what happened.
the courts ruling in the plessy case legitimized the widespread practice of racially separate but equal facilities in virtually every area of southern life.
in 1900 the editor of the richmond times insisted that racial segregation be applied in every relation of southern life.
god almighty drew the color line and it cannot be obliterated.
the negro must stay on his side of the line and the white man must stay on his side and the sooner both races recognize this fact and accept it the better it will be for both the new regulations came to be called jim crow laws.
the name derived from jump jim crow an old s ong and dance caricature of african a mericans.
during the 1890s the term jim crow became a derisive e xpression meaning negro signs reading white only or colored only above restrooms and water fountains emerged as hallmarks of the jim crow system.
old racist customs dating back before the civil war were revived.
if whites walked along a sidewalk blacks were expected to step aside and let them pass.
there were even racially separate funeral homes cemeteries and churches.
when a white deacon in a mississippi baptist church saw a black man in the sanctuary he asked boy what you doin in there.
dont you know this is a white church the black man replied boss im here to mop the floor the white man paused and said well thats all right then but dont let me catch you prayin.
widespread racist violence accompanied the jim crow laws.
from 1890 to 1899 the united states averaged 188 racial lynchings per year 82 percent of which occurred in the south.
lynchings usually involved a black man or men accused of a crime often rape.
white mobs would seize torture and kill the accused always in ghastly ways.
participating whites viewed lynchings as forms of outdoor recreation.
large crowds including women and children would watch amid a carnival like atmosphere.
the governor of mississippi 810 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 the lynching of henry smith despite lack of evidence smith was convicted of murdering a white girl in paris texas.
a large crowd assembled to watch her family torture smith on a platform labeled justice after smith was burned alive the townspeople kept his charred teeth and bones as souvenirs.
declared that if it is necessary that every negro in the state will be lynched it will be done to maintain white supremacy mob rule in north carolina white supremacy was violently imposed in the thriving coastal port of wilmington north carolina then the largest city in the state with about 20 000 residents.
in 1894 and 1896 black voters by then a majority in the city elected african americans to various municipal offices infuriating the white elite.
we will never surrender to a ragged raffle of negroes warned alfred waddell a former congressman and confederate colonel even if we have to choke the cape fear river with black carcasses it was not an idle threat.
on the morning of november 10 1898 some 2 000 white men and teens rampaged through the streets of wilmington.
they first destroyed the offices of the daily record the black owned newspaper then moved into black neighborhoods shooting african americans and destroying homes and businesses.
almost 100 blacks were killed.
the mob then stormed the city hall declared that colonel waddell was the new mayor and forced the african american business leaders and elected race relations during the 1890s 811 officials to board northbound trains.
the new s elf appointed city government issued a declaration of white independence that stripped blacks of their jobs and voting rights.
desperate black residents appealed for help to the governor as well as president william mckinley but received none.
the wilmington insurrection marked the first time that a lawfully elected municipal government had been overthrown in the united states.
two years later in the 1900 statewide elections white supremacist democrats vowed to cement their control of the political process.
the night before the election colonel waddell urged supporters to use any means necessary to suppress black voting you are a nglo saxons.
you are armed and prepared and you will do your duty.
go to the polls tomorrow and if you find the negro out voting tell him to leave the polls and if he refuses kill him shoot him down in his tracks.
we shall win tomorrow if we have to do it with guns the democratic party won by a landslide.
the black response by the end of the nineteenth century white supremacy had triumphed across the south.
some african americans chose to leave in search of equality and opportunity.
those who stayed and resisted white supremacy even in self defense were ruthlessly suppressed.
when a white woman mrs pines struck her black maid sarah barnett with a stick barnett retaliated hitting the woman.
infuriated that a black woman would hit his wife piness husband richard grabbed his pistol and shot barnett through the shoulder.
she survived only to be convicted of assault and jailed.
another black house servant wilmington insurrection a mob of white supremacists pose with their rifles before the demolished printing press of the daily record an african american newspaper.
812 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 ann beston stabbed and killed her abusive mistress in rome georgia.
a mob then lynched her.
in the face of such overwhelming discrimination and abuse most african americans had no choice but to accommodate themselves to the realities of white supremacy and segregation.
had to walk a quiet life explained james plunkett a virginian.
the least little thing you would do they whites would kill ya survival in the jim crow south required blacks to wear a mask of deference and discretion.
they readily behaved in a servile way when shopping at white owned stores.
news of lynchings burnings and beatings sent chilling reminders of the dangers they constantly faced.
black novelist richard wright remembered how in his native mississippi the sustained expectation of violence at the hands of whites induced a paralysis of will and impulse in him and others.
it unconsciously affected his speech movements and manners around whites.
the penalty of death awaited me if i made a false move yet accommodation did not mean surrender as african americans constructed their own lively culture.
a young white visitor to mississippi in 1910 noticed that nearly every black person he met had two distinct social selves the one he reveals to his own people the other he assumes among the whites african churches continued to provide an anchor and hub for black communities.
in fact they were often the only public buildings blacks could use for large group gatherings such as club meetings political rallies and social events.
for men especially churches offered leadership roles and political status.
being elected or appointed a deacon was one of the most prestigious roles a black man could achieve.
as was the case in many white churches men preached and governed church affairs the women often did everything else.
religious life provided great comfort to people worn down by the daily hardships and abuses associated with segregation.
as the reverend benjamin mays explained he and his black neighbors in south carolina believed that the trials and tribulations of the world would be all over when one got to heaven.
beaten down at every turn by the white man as they were negroes could perhaps not have survived without this kind of religion one irony of jim crow segregation is that it opened up new economic opportunities for african americans.
black entrepreneurs emerged to provide essential services to the black community insurance banking barbering funerals hair salons.
at the same time blacks formed their own social and fraternal clubs and organizations all of which provided fellowship mutual support and opportunities for service.
middle class african american women formed a network of thousands of social clubs that served as engines of social service across the south and the race relations during the 1890s 813 nation.
they cared for the aged infirm orphaned and abandoned.
they provided homes for single mothers and nurseries for working mothers and they sponsored health clinics and classes in home economics.
in 1896 the leaders of womens clubs formed the national association of colored women.
the organizations first president mary church terrell told the members that they had an obligation to serve the lowly the illiterate and even the vicious to whom we are bound by the ties of race and sex and put forth every effort to uplift and reclaim them courageous african american women declared that black men were not providing sufficient leadership.
an editorial in the womans era called for timid men and ignorant men to step aside and let the women show the way.
ida b wells one of the most outspoken african american activists of the time was ida b.
born into slavery in 1862 in mississippi she attended a school staffed by white missionaries.
she moved in 1880 to memphis where she taught in segregated schools and gained entrance to the social life of the citys african american middle class.
in 1883 after being denied a seat on a railroad car because she was black wells became the first african american to file suit against such discrimination.
the circuit court decided in her favor and fined the railroad but the tennessee supreme court overturned the ruling.
wells thereafter discovered my first and it might be said my only love journalism and through it a weapon with which to wage her crusade for justice.
she became editor of memphis free speech a newspaper that focused on african american issues.
in 1892 when three of her friends were lynched by a white mob wells launched a crusade against lynching.
angry whites responded by destroying her office and threatening to lynch her.
she moved to new york where she continued to criticize jim crow ida b.
wells while raising four children wells sustained her laws and demand that blacks have commitment to ending racial and gender their voting rights restored.
she helped discrimination and lynching.
found the national association for 814 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 the advancement of colored people naacp in 1909 and worked for womens suffrage.
in promoting racial equality wells often found herself in direct opposition to booker t washington the most influential african american leader of the time.
booker t washington born a slave in virginia in 1856 the son of a black mother and a white father booker t washington at sixteen had enrolled at hampton normal and agricultural institute one of several colleges for ex slaves created during reconstruction.
there he met the schools founder samuel chapman armstrong who preached moderation booker t washington founder of the and urged the students be thrifty and tuskegee institute a historically black industrious command the respect of vocational training school.
he went on your neighbors by a good record and a to become the nations most prominent good character make the best of your african american leader.
difficulties and live down prejudice washington listened and learned well.
nine years later armstrong received a request from a group in northern alabama starting a black college called tuskegee institute.
the new college needed a president and armstrong urged them to hire washington.
although only twenty five years old washington was according to armstrong a very capable mulatto clear headed modest sensible polite and a thorough teacher and superior man young washington quickly went to work.
he became a skilled fundraiser gathering substantial gifts from wealthy whites most of them northerners.
the complicated racial dynamics of the late nineteenth century required him to walk a tightrope between being candid and being an effective college president.
he learned that he needed to be like a fox rather than a lion if he hoped to maintain the support of the white community.
as the years passed tuskegee institute became celebrated for its dedication to discipline and vocational training and booker t washington became a source of inspiration and hope to millions.
washingtons recurring message to black students focused on the importance of gaining practical knowledge in part to please his white donors he argued that race relations during the 1890s 815 african americans should not focus on fighting racial segregation.
they should instead work hard and remain silent their priority should be s elf improvement rather than social change.
washington told young african americans to begin at the bottom as well educated hardworking farmers not as social activists.
in a famous speech at the cotton states and international exposition in atlanta in 1895 washington urged the african american community to cast down your bucket where you are cast it down in making friends.
of the people of all races by whom we are surrounded.
cast it down in agriculture mechanics in commerce in domestic service and in the professions fighting for social equality and directly challenging white rule would be a huge mistake the extremest folly.
any effort at agitation in the w hite dominant south would he warned backfire.
african americans first needed to become self sufficient economically.
civil rights would have to wait.
w e b du bois other african american leaders disagreed with booker t washingtons accommodationist strategy.
du bois emerged at the turn of the century as washingtons foremost rival.
a native of massachusetts du bois first experienced racial prejudice as a student at fisk university in nashville tennessee.
later he became the first african american to earn a doctoral degree from harvard in history and sociology.
in addition to promoting civil rights he left a distinguished record as a scholar authoring more than twenty books.
du bois had a flamboyant personality and a combative spirit.
not long after he began teaching at atlanta university in 1897 he launched a public assault on washingtons strategy for improving the quality of life for african americans.
du bois called washingtons celebrated 1895 speech the atlanta compromise and said that he would not surrender the leadership of this race to cowards washington du bois argued accepted the alleged inferiority of the w e b.
du bois a fierce advocate for negro so blacks could concentrate all black education and civil rights.
their energies on industrial education 816 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 the accumulation of wealth and the conciliation of the south du bois stressed that african american leaders should adopt a strategy of ceaseless agitation directed at ensuring the right to vote and winning civil equality.
the education of blacks du bois maintained should not be merely vocational but comparable to that enjoyed by the white elite.
black education should help develop bold leaders willing to challenge jim crow segregation and discrimination.
the dispute between washington and du bois came to define the tensions that would divide the t wentieth century civil rights movement militancy versus conciliation separatism versus assimilation social justice versus economic opportunities.
what du bois and others did not know was that washington secretly worked to finance lawsuits challenging segregation and disfranchisement to stop the brutal culture of race lynching and to increase funding for public schools.
he acted privately because he feared that public activism would trigger violence against tuskegee and himself.
the settling of the new west like the south the west has always been a region wrapped in myths and stereotypes.
the vast land west of the mississippi river contains remarkable geographic extremes majestic mountains roaring rivers d eep sculpted canyons searing deserts grassy plains and dense forests.
for most western americans the civil war and reconstruction were remote events that hardly touched the lives of the indians mexicans asians farmers ranchers trappers miners and mormons scattered through the plains valleys and mountains.
in the west the relentless march of white conquest settlement and exploitation continued propelled by a special sense of manifest destiny a lust for land a hope for quick fortunes and a restless desire to improve ones lot in life.
between 1870 and 1900 americans settled more land in the west than they had in the centuries before 1870.
by 1900 a third of the nation lived west of the mississippi river.
the p ost civil war west came to symbolize economic opportunity and personal freedom.
on another level however the economic exploitation of the west was a story of irresponsible behavior and reckless abuse of nature that scarred the land decimated its wildlife and nearly exterminated much of native american culture.
the western landscape after midcentury farmers and their families began spreading west to the great p lains western kansas nebraska oklahoma northern texas the dakotas eastern colorado wyoming and montana.
from california miners moved eastward through the mountains to utah and nevada drawn by one new strike after another.
from texas nomadic the settling of the new west 817 cowboys annually migrated with herds of cattle northward onto the plains and even across the rocky mountains into the great basin of utah and nevada.
the settlers in the west encountered challenges markedly different from those they had left behind.
the great plains had little rainfall and few rivers.
the scarcity of water and timber rendered useless the familiar trappings of the p ioneer the ax the log cabin the rail fence as well as traditional methods of tilling the soil.
for a long time the region had been called the great american desert unfit for human habitation and therefore in the minds of most americans the perfect refuge for indians who refused to embrace the white way of life.
but that view changed in the last half of the nineteenth century.
the discovery of gold silver copper iron and coal the completion of the transcontinental railroads the collapse of indian resistance and the rise of the buffalo hide and range cattle industries convinced many americans as well as the federal government that economic development of the west held the key to national prosperity.
capitalists made huge profits investing in western mines cattle railroads and commercial farms.
with the use of what water was available new techniques of dry farming and irrigation could make the vast western lands fruitful after all.
the migratory stream during the second half of the nineteenth century an unrelenting stream of migrants flowed into what had been the largely indian and hispanic west.
as millions of anglo americans native americans african americans mexicans south americans and european and chinese immigrants intermingled they transformed western life and culture.
most of the settlers were white n ative born farm folk.
three quarters of the p ost civil war western migrants were men but they often traveled with wives and children.
the largest number of foreign immigrants to the west came from northern europe and canada.
in the northern plains germans scandinavians and irish were especially numerous.
in nebraska in 1870 a quarter of the 123 000 residents were foreign born.
in north dakota in 1890 immigrants composed 45 percent of the residents.
compared with european immigrants those from china and mexico were much less numerous but nonetheless significant.
more than 200 000 chinese arrived in california between 1876 and 1890 joining some 70 000 others who had come earlier to build railroads and work in mining communities.
the chinese were frequently discriminated against and denied citizenship rights and they became scapegoats whenever there was an economic downturn.
in 1882 congress passed the chinese exclusion act effectively banning further immigration from china.

here its residents are photographed in front of the first baptist church and general store.
found their own towns in kansas oklahoma and mississippi.
others had larger communities in mind.
thousands of african americans began migrating westward some 6 000 southern blacks arrived in kansas in 1879 and as many as 20 000 followed the next year.
these migrants came to be known as exodusters because they were making their exodus from the south in search of a haven from racism and poverty.
the foremost promoter of black migration to the west was benjamin pap singleton.
born a slave in tennessee in 1809 he escaped and made his way to michigan.
after the civil war he returned to tennessee and decided that african americans could never gain equal treatment if they stayed in the former confederacy.
when he learned that land in kansas could be had for 1 25 an acre he led a party of 200 colonists to the state in 1878 bought 7 500 acres that had been an indian reservation and established the dunlop community.
over the next several years thousands of african americans followed singleton to kansas leading many southern leaders to worry about the loss of black laborers.
in 1879 white southerners closed access to the mississippi river and threatened to sink all boats carrying blacks to the west.
an army the settling of the new west 821 officer reported to president rutherford b hayes that every river landing is blockaded by white enemies of the colored exodus some of whom are mounted and armed as if we are at war by the early 1880s however the exodus of black southerners to the west had petered out.
many african american settlers were unprepared for the harsh living conditions on the plains.
their kansas homesteads were often not large enough to be self sustaining and most of the black farmers were forced to supplement their income by hiring themselves out to white ranchers.
drought grasshoppers prairie fires and dust storms led to frequent crop failures and bankruptcy.
the sudden influx of so many southern blacks also taxed resources and patience.
there were not enough houses stores or construction materials few government services and rarely enough water.
disappointed and frustrated many african american pioneers in kansas soon abandoned their land and moved to the few cities in the state.
the frontier was not the promised land that they had been led to expect but it was better than what they had experienced in the south.
as an exoduster minister stressed we had rather suffer and be free by 1890 some 520 000 african americans lived west of the mississippi river.
as many as 25 percent of the cowboys who participated in the texas cattle drives were african americans and many federal horse soldiers in the west were black.
western mining after the civil war the dream of striking it rich by finding gold or silver continued to be the most powerful lure to the west.
the nature of mining however had changed drastically.
like much of western agriculture mining had become a m ass production industry as individual prospectors gave way to large mining companies.
the first wave of miners who rushed to california in 1849 had sifted gold dust and nuggets out of riverbeds by means of placer mining or panning but once the placer deposits were exhausted efficient mining required l arge scale operations massive machinery and substantial capital investment.
companies shifted from surface digging to hydraulic mining dredging or d eep shaft hard rock mining.
industrial miners used huge hydraulic cannons to strip canyon walls of rock and topsoil in a search for veins of gold or silver.
the tons of dirt and debris unearthed by the water cannons covered rich farmland downstream and created sandbars that clogged rivers and killed fish.
all told some 12 billion tons of earth were blasted out of the sierra nevada and washed into local rivers.
irate california farmers in the fertile central valley bitterly protested the damage done downstream by the industrial mining operations.
in 1878 they formed the a nti debris association to challenge the powerful mining companies.
efforts to pass state legislation restricting hydraulic mining r epeatedly 822 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 failed because mining companies controlled the votes.
the a nti debris association then turned to the courts.
on january 7 1884 the farmers won their case when federal judge lorenzo sawyer a former miner outlawed the dumping of mining debris where it could reach farmland or navigable r ivers.
thus woodruff v north bloomfield gravel mining company became the first major environmental legal victory in the nation.
as a result of the ruling hydraulic mining dried up leaving a legacy of abandoned equipment ugly ravines ditches gullies and mountains of discarded rock and gravel.
mining boomtowns tombstone arizona only thirty miles from the mexican border was a major silver mining site in the 1870s.
by only its fourth year of existence it was the fastest growing boomtown in the south west.
it boasted a bowling alley four churches a school two banks three newspapers and an ice cream parlor alongside 110 saloons fourteen gambling halls and numerous dance halls and brothels.
some of the other largest and most famous mining boomtowns included virginia city in nevada cripple creek and leadville in colorado and deadwood in the dakota territory.
they were male dominated communities with a substantial population of immigrants chinese chileans peruvians mexicans french germans scots welsh irish and english.
ethnic prejudice was as common as violence in mining towns.
the chinese for example were usually prohibited from laboring in the mines but were allowed to operate laundries and work in boardinghouses.
mexicans were often treated the worst.
mexicans have no business in this country a californian insisted.
the men were made to be shot at and the women were made for our purposes most of the boomtowns lasted only a few years.
once the mines played out the people moved on leaving ghost towns behind.
in 1870 virginia city then called the richest city in america had a population of 20 000.
today it has fewer than 1 000 residents.
deadwood dakota territory a gold rush town in 1876 before the dakotas became states.
life in the new west 823 new discoveries of gold and silver kept occurring throughout the late nineteenth century.
the comstock lode was found near gold hill nevada on the eastern slope of the sierra nevadas near the california border.
henry comstock a c anadian born fur trapper gave the new discovery actually made by other prospectors in 1859 his name.
the comstock lode a seam of gold and silver more than fifty feet wide and thousands of feet deep was the most profitable mine in history to that point.
the rapid growth of mining spurred the creation of territorial governments and cries for statehood.
but after colorados admission in 1876 there was a long pause in admitting new states because of party divisions in congress democrats refused to create states out of territories that were dominated by republicans.
after the sweeping republican victory in the 1888 legislative races however congress admitted north and south dakota montana and washington as states in 1889 and idaho and wyoming in 1890.
utah entered the union in 1896 after the mormons agreed to abandon the practice of polygamy oklahoma in 1907 and in 1912 arizona and new mexico became the forty seventh and forty eighth contiguous states.
the final two states alaska and hawaii were added fifty years later.
life in the new west in the 1880s james h kyner a railroad builder in oregon witnessed an almost unbroken stream of emigrants from horizon to horizon these hardy optimistic folk traveled west in wagons on horses and on foot going west to seek their fortunes and to settle an empire most of them thought little about forcing out the native americans chinese workers and hispanic cowboys who were there first.
americans claimed a special destiny to settle develop and dominate the entire continent.
to encourage new settlers in the west the federal government generously helped finance the construction of four transcontinental railroads dispatched federal troops to conquer and relocate indians to designated reservations and sold government owned land at low p rices or gave it to railroad companies as a means of rapidly populating areas served by trains.
the transcontinental railroads received some 200 million acres of government land.
over time the railroads sold much of the land to create towns and ranches along the rail lines.
the new west of ranchers and farmers was in fact largely the product of the railroads the arrival of trains was the lifeblood of the western economy.
the surge of western migration had many of the romantic qualities so often depicted in novels films and television shows.
those who braved harsh con 824 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 ditions and uncertain circumstances were indeed courageous and tenacious.
cowboys and indians outlaws and vigilantes farmers ranchers and herders populated the plains while miners and trappers led more nomadic lives in the hills and backwoods.
these familiar images of western life tell only part of the story however.
drudgery and tragedy were as commonplace as adventure and success.
in contrast to the hollywood versions of the west the people who settled the trans mississippi frontier were a diverse lot they included women as well as men african americans hispanics asians and european immigrants.
the feverish quest for quick profits also helped fuel a boom bust economic cycle that injected chronic instability into the society and politics of the region.
while the west was being taken from the indians cattle were herded into the grasslands where the buffalo had roamed.
for many years wild cattle first brought to america by the spanish had competed with buffalo in the borderlands of texas and arizona.
breeding them with anglo american domesticated cattle produced the hybrid texas longhorns tough lean and rangy they were noted more for speed and endurance than for yielding lots of choice steak.
by the time the confederacy surrendered millions of longhorns in texas were wandering freely across the state.
they had marginal value moreover because the largest urban markets for beef were so far away until the railroads arrived.
the cattle boom at the end of the civil war the kansas pacific railroad crews were beginning to lay rails in the buffalo country of the southern plains between st louis and kansas city.
as buffalo hunters roamed the prairies a few entrepreneurs began to imagine how the extension of the railroad might establish a market whereat the southern cattle drover and northern buyer would meet upon an equal footing that junction was abilene kansas a very small dead place consisting of about one dozen log huts once the rail lines reached kansas from missouri joseph g mccoy an illinois livestock dealer recognized the possibilities of driving vast herds of cattle raised in texas northward to kansas where they would be loaded onto freight cars and sent to the rest of the nation.
in 1867 in tiny abilene in eastern kansas mccoy bought 250 acres and built a s tockyard barn an office building livestock scales a hotel and a bank.
he then sent an agent to texas to convince the owners of herds bound north on the chisholm trail to go through abilene.
once the bellowing mass of texas longhorns reached abilene in august 1867 cattle by the thousands were loaded onto rail cars and shipped to chicago stockyards where they were slaughtered and then sent as sides of beef to the cities around the nation.
life in the new west 825 herding cattle cowboys on horseback herd cattle into a corral beside the cimarron river in 1905.
abilene flourished as the first successful cow town.
by 1871 there were 700 000 steers passing through it every year.
the ability to ship huge numbers of cattle by rail transformed ranching into a huge national industry and turned kansas into a major economic crossroads.
other cattle towns sprouted along the rail line ellsworth wichita caldwell dodge city.
none of them lasted more than a few years.
once people bought farms nearby they lobbied successfully to stop the stampeding texas herds from coming through their area.
the cattlemen simply developed new routes north to new cow towns and rail hubs in colorado wyoming and montana.
soon those states had their own cattle ranches.
by 1883 there were half a million cattle in eastern montana alone as the disappearing buffalo herds gave way to steers and sheep.
like miners cattle ranchers were forced to meet together and develop their own code of laws and ways of enforcing them.
as cattle often wandered onto other ranchers land cowboys would ride the line to keep the animals off the adjoining ranches.
in the spring they would round up the herds which invariably got mixed up and sort out ownership by identifying the distinctive ranch symbols branded or burned into the cattle.
826 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 all that changed in 1873 when joseph glidden an illinois farmer developed the first effective and inexpensive form of b arbed wire fencing.
soon the open range owned by all where a small rancher could graze his cattle anywhere was no more.
b arbed wire fences triggered range wars where small ranchers called fence cutters fought to retain the open range.
fencing converted prairie into pastures put a lot of ranchers out of business and many of them became cowboys working for wages.
cattle raising like mining evolved from a romantic adventure into a business dominated by cattle barons and large corporations.
as one cowboy lamented times have changed chicago the rise of the cattle industry helped make chicago the fastest growing city in the nation in the decades after the civil war.
no city had more influence on the development of post civil war america than chicago.
located on lake michigan and served by several rivers and nine railroads in 1865 it was the gateway to the western economy a crossroads where city and frontier intersected for mutual benefit.
its lumber yards grain elevators stockyards and slaughterhouses became magnets for immigrants seeking jobs.
chicago so large so powerful so rapidly growing was the catalyst for much of the wests development the bridge between city and country urban and rural.
the great grey city brooking no rival wrote frank norris in his novel the pit 1903 imposed its dominion upon a reach of country larger than many a k ingdom of the old world.
for thousands of miles beyond its confines its i nfluence was felt.
here mid most in the land beat the heart of the nation whence inevitably must come its immeasurable power its infinite infinite inexhaustible vitality the meatpacking industry in places like cincinnati and chicago had started not with cattle but with hogs in part because pork could be preserved longer with salt and smoking than beef.
since colonial days pork packing had been one of the earliest and most important frontier industries.
hogs reproduce much faster than cattle and they thrive on corn.
as a n ineteenth century economist explained what is a hog but fifteen or twenty bushels of corn on four legs in 1850 chicago slaughterhouses butchered and packed 20 000 hogs.
by contrast cincinnati called porkopolis processed 334 000 each year.
that changed after the civil war as the federal government ordered vast quantities of pork for its armies.
by 1862 chicago had displaced cincinnati as the worlds largest p ork packing center.
by the 1870s thanks to the railroad connections the city was processing over 2 million hogs per year.
the use of ice cut from frozen lake michigan and placed in freight trains enabled chicago pork to be shipped all the way to the east coast.
but there was no ice in the summer months.
this challenge led gustavus f swift a new englander who arrived in chicago in 1875 to begin life in the new west 827 e xperimenting with ways to refrigerate railcars year round.
within a few years swift and his main competitor philip armour had engineered refrigerated freight cars that enabled them to ship processed meat rather than live hogs and cattle long distances.
it was this key innovation that enabled chicago to add beef packing to its already huge h og processing operations.
the refrigerator car announced swift and company is one of the vehicles on which the packing industry has ridden to greatness by the end of the nineteenth century the economies of scale enjoyed by the four dominant chicago meatpacking corporations drove most local butchers across the nation out of business.
a new york city butcher in 1888 confessed that up and down the east coast the slaughtering of cattle by butchers is a thing of the past gustavus swift and philip armour became two of the richest men in the world.
they soon branched out beyond pork and beef processing by becoming traders in g rain wheat and corn.
they also built packing plants across the west in cattle towns such as kansas city and omaha which soon were processing almost half as much meat as chicago.
farming on the plains farming on the great plains was made harder by the regions unforgiving environment bitterly cold winters and scorching summers.
a new york newspaper publisher traveling to california described the great plains as a treeless desert that baked during daylight and was chill and piercing cold at night.
still people made the dangerous trek lured by inexpensive federal land and misleading advertisements celebrating life on the plains.
between 1870 and 1900 homesteaders ranchers miners railroad operators and commercial farmers took control of 430 million acres of land west of the mississippi river.
homesteaders the first homesteaders in the great plains were mostly landless folk eager to try their hand at farming.
many of them had never used a hoe or planted a seed.
i was raised in chicago without so much as a back yard to play in said a montana homesteader and i worked 48 hours a week for 1 25.
when i heard you could get 320 acres just by living on it i felt that i had been offered a kingdom yet the farmers faced a grim struggle.
although land was essentially free as a result of the homestead act 1862 horses livestock wagons wells lumber fencing seed machinery and fertilizer were not.
freight rates and interest rates were criminally high.
declining crop prices produced chronic indebtedness leading strapped farmers to embrace virtually any plan to increase the money supply and thus pay off their debts with inflated currency.
the virgin land itself although fertile resisted planting the heavy sod woven with tough 828 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 innovative farming powered by over a dozen horses and driven by two men this early nineteenth century combine machine could cut thresh bag and weigh wheat all at the same time.
grass roots broke many a plow.
since wood and coal were rare on the prairie pioneer families initially had to use buffalo chips dried dung from buffaloes and cattle for fuel.
farm families also fought a constant battle with the elements tornadoes hailstorms droughts prairie fires blizzards and pests.
swarms of locusts often clouded the horizon a wichita newspaper reported in 1878 that they devoured everything green.
destroying every plant that is good for food or pleasant to the eyes in the late 1880s a prolonged drought forced many homesteaders to give up.
in the end t wo thirds of the people who gained land under the homestead act failed to become self sustaining farmers.
commercial farming eventually as the railroads brought piles of lumber from the east farmers could upgrade their houses built of sod kansas brick into more comfortable wood framed dwellings.
new machinery and equipment for those who could afford them improved productivity.
in 1868 james oliver a scottish immigrant living in indiana made a sturdy life in the new west 829 c hilled iron sodbuster plow that greatly eased the task of preparing land for planting.
at the same time new threshing machines hay mowers planters manure spreaders and other equipment lightened the burden of farm labor but often deepened the debts that farmers owed.
in minnesota the dakotas and central california wealthy capitalists created gigantic bonanza farms that became the marvels of the age.
on one bonanza farm in north dakota a single field of wheat encompassed 13 000 acres.
wheat became for farmers in the high plains what cotton had been for southern planters a perennial cash crop.
american grown wheat was exported around the world.
another bonanza farm in south dakota employed more than 1 000 migrant workers to tend 34 000 acres.
such agribusinesses were the wave of the future.
thomas jeffersons dream of an america primarily made up of small farmers continued to give way to industrial agriculture and bonanza farms.
while the overall value of farmland and farm products increased in the late nineteenth century small farmers did not keep up.
their numbers grew in size but decreased in proportion to the population at large.
wheat in the western states like cotton in the antebellum south was the great export crop that spurred economic growth.
for a variety of reasons however including an inability to afford new machinery few small farmers prospered.
by the 1890s they were in open revolt against the system of corrupt processors middlemen and greedy bankers who they believed conspired against them.
women in the west the west remained a largely male society throughout the nineteenth century.
women in mining towns most of whom worked as house cleaners were as valued as gold.
many mining towns had a male to female ratio as high as nine to one.
when four respectable women arrived in nevada city one of them reported that the men stood and gazed at us with mouth and eyes wide open every time we go out in the streets.
in both mining and farming communities women were prized as spouses in part because farming required help.
in 1900 an estimated 98 percent of the women in nebraska were married.
but the women pioneers continued to face many of the same legal barriers and social prejudices prevalent in the east.
a wife could not sell property without her husbands approval for example.
texas women could not sue except for divorce nor could they serve on juries act as lawyers or witness a will.
the constant fight for survival west of the mississippi however made men and women more equal partners than in the east.
many women who lost their mates to the deadly toil of sod busting assumed complete responsibility for their farms.
in general women on the prairie became more independent than 830 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 women of the frontier a woman and her family in front of their sod house.
the difficult life on the prairie led to more egalitarian marriages than were found in other regions of the country because women had to play so many roles.
women leading domestic lives back east.
a kansas woman explained that the environment was such as to bring out and develop the dominant qualities of individual character.
kansas women of that day learned at an early age to depend on t hemselves to do whatever work there was to be done and to face danger when it must be faced as calmly as they were able it was not coincidental then that the new western territories and states were among the first to allow women to vote and hold o ffice in the hopes that by allowing women to vote they would attract more women settlers.
in 1890 wyoming was admitted to the union as the first state that allowed women to vote in all elections.
utah colorado and idaho followed soon thereafter.
the fate of western indians as settlers spread across the continent some 250 000 native americans many of them originally from east of the mississippi were forced into what was supposed to be their last refuge the great plains and mountain regions of the far west.
the 1851 fort laramie treaty in which the chiefs of the plains indians agreed to accept definite tribal borders and allow white emigrants to travel the fate of western indians 831 across their lands worked for a while.
fighting resumed however as indians continued their ancient practice of following the buffalo herds and as white and black emigrants began to settle on indian lands rather than pass through them.
indian relations in the west from the early 1860s until the late 1870s the trans mississippi west often called indian country raged with the so called indian wars.
although the u s government had signed numerous treaties with indian nations giving them ownership of reservation lands for as long as waters run and the grass shall grow those commitments were repeatedly violated by buffalo hunters miners ranchers farmers railroad surveyors and horse soldiers.
in the 1860s the federal government ousted numerous tribes from lands they had been promised forever a sioux chieftain named spotted tail expressed the grieving anger felt by many indians when he asked why does not the great father u s president put his red children on wheels so that he can move them as he will in the two decades before the civil war the u s armys central mission in the west was to protect pioneers traveling on the major overland trails.
during and after the war the mission changed to ensuring that native americans stayed on the reservations they had been assigned and that americans did not trespass on indian lands.
americans however repeatedly violated treaties with native american peoples.
the result was simmering frustration punctuated by outbreaks of tragic violence.
in the summer of 1862 an uprising of sioux warriors killed 644 white traders settlers government officials and soldiers in the minnesota valley.
it was the first of many clashes between the growing number of american settlers and miners and the indians living on reservations in the great plains.
the sand creek massacre two years later a horrible i ncident occurred in colorado as a result of the influx of white miners into the territory.
after indians murdered a white family near denver john evans the t erritorial governor called on whites to kill and destroy the hostile indians on the plains at the same time evans persuaded friendly indians mostly cheyenne and arapaho to gather at places of safety such as fort lyon in southeastern colorado near the kansas border where they were promised protection.
despite that promise at dawn on november 29 1864 colonel john m chivingtons 700 untrained militiamen attacked a camp of cheyennes and arapahoes along sand creek about forty miles from fort lyon.
black kettle the chief frantically waved first an american flag and then a white flag but 832 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 the attacking soldiers paid no heed.
over seven hours the colorado militiamen slaughtered scalped and mutilated 165 peaceful indians men women children and the elderly.
chivington a former abolitionist and methodist minister the fighting parson who had preached against the brutalities of slavery had told his men to kill and scalp all indians big and little you come across in his report on the lopsided bloodbath to army officials chivington lied claiming a great victory against 1 000 entrenched cheyenne warriors.
the bloodthirsty colonel was greeted as a hero back in denver.
colorado soldiers have again covered themselves in glory the rocky mountain news in denver initially proclaimed.
then the truth about sand creek began to come out.
captain silas soule an abolitionist from kansas who had joined the union army at the start of the civil war witnessed the massacre but along with his company of soldiers had disobeyed orders to join the attack.
i refused to fire and swore to my men that none but a coward would shoot unarmed women and children.
three weeks after the massacre soule wrote a letter to a superior officer revealing in graphic detail what had actually happened at sand creek hundreds of women and children were coming toward us and getting on their knees for mercy he noted only to be murdered and have their brains beat out by men professing to be civilized far from being a hero soule added chivington encouraged the one sided slaughter through his lack of leadership there was no organization among our troops they were a perfect mob every man on his own hook soules company was the only one that did not fire a shot he predicted that we will have a hell of a time with indians this winter because of what had happened at sand creek.
congress and the army launched lengthy investigations into the tragedy at sand creek and captain soule was among those called to testify in january 1865.
the eventual congressional report concluded that chivington had deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly massacre murdering in cold blood indians who had every reason to believe they were under u s protection an army general described the sand creek massacre as the foulest and most unjustifiable crime in the annals of america chivington resigned from the militia in disgrace in order to escape a military trial.
he soon became the denver sheriff.
on april 23 1865 soule the whistle blower was shot and killed in denver.
one of his murderers never prosecuted was identified as one of chivingtons soldiers.
instead of pacifying the indians the sand creek massacre ignited warfare that raged across the central plains for the next three years.
arapaho cheyenne and sioux war parties attacked scores of ranches and stagecoach the fate of western indians 833 stations killing hundreds of white men and kidnapping many white women and children.
more massacres were to come on both sides.
the federal government responded by authorizing the recruitment of soldiers from among confederate military prisoners called white washed rebels and the creation of african american cavalry regiments.
in 1866 congress passed legislation establishing two colored cavalry units and dispatched them to the western frontier.
the cheyenne nicknamed them buffalo soldiers because they fought like a cornered buffalo who like a buffalo had suffered wound after wound yet had not died and who like a buffalo had a thick and shaggy mane of hair the buffalo soldiers were mostly civil war veterans from louisiana and kentucky.
they built and maintained forts mapped vast areas of the southwest strung hundreds of miles of telegraph lines protected railroad construction crews subdued hostile indians and captured outlaws and rustlers.
eighteen of the buffalo soldiers won congressional medals of honor for their service.
indian relocation with other scattered battles erupting a congressional committee in 1865 gathered evidence on the grisly indian wars and massacres.
its 1867 report on the condition of the indian tribes led to the creation of an indian peace commission charged with removing the causes of the indian wars.
congress decided that this would be best accomplished by persuading nomadic indians yet again to move to o ut of the way federal reservations where they would take up farming that would civilize them.
they were to give up their ancestral lands in return for peace so that the whites could move in.
in 1870 indians outnumbered whites in the dakota territory by two to one by 1880 whites mostly gold prospectors would outnumber indians by more than six to one.
the u s government had decided it had no choice but to gain control of the r egion by purchase if possible by force if necessary.
in 1867 a conference at medicine lodge kansas ended with the kiowas comanches arapahoes and cheyennes reluctantly agreeing to move to land in western oklahoma.
the following spring the western sioux the lakotas signed the treaty of fort laramie 1868 in which they agreed to settle within the huge black hills reservation in southwestern dakota territory in part because they viewed the black hills as holy ground.
grants indian policy in his inaugural address in 1869 president ulysses s grant urged congress to adopt more progressive policies toward native americans the proper treatment of the original inhabitants of 834 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 this land should enable the native americans to become citizens with all the rights enjoyed by every other american grants noble intentions however ran afoul of longstanding prejudices against native americans and the unrelenting efforts of miners farmers railroaders and ranchers to trespass on indian lands and reservations.
the president recognized the challenges he faced.
indians he admitted would be harmless and peaceable if they were not put upon by whites yet he also stressed that protecting the new transcontinental railroad across the plains was his top priority.
in the end however grant told army officers that it is much better to support a peace commission than a military campaign against indians periodic clashes brought vengeful demands for military action.
william t sherman commanding general of the u s army directed general philip sheridan who was in charge of the military effort in the west to kill and punish the hostiles indian war parties capture and destroy the ponies of the cheyennes arapahoes and kiowas sherman then declared that the more we kill this year the less we will have to kill next year neither sherman nor sheridan agreed with grants peace policy in their view the presidents naive outlook was shaped by the distance between the great plains and washington d c.
fairness and understanding were not the correct weapons against indian warriors.
sherman ordered sheridan to force all nonhostile indians onto federal reservations where they would be provided land for farming immediate rations of food and supplies and equipment a promise that was rarely kept.
some native americans refused to be moved again.
in the southern plains of new mexico north texas colorado kansas and oklahoma the native americans dominated by the comanches the greatest h orse borne warriors in america focused on hunting buffalo.
armed clashes occurred with increasing frequency until the red river war of 1874 1875 when sheridans soldiers won a series of battles in the texas panhandle.
he boasted that it was the most successful of any indian campaign in this country since its settlement by the whites the defeated comanches cheyennes kiowas and arapahoes were forced onto reservations.
custer and the sioux meanwhile trouble was brewing again in the northern plains.
white prospectors searching for gold were soon trespassing on sioux hunting grounds in the dakotas despite promises that the army would keep them out.
ohio senator john sherman warned that nothing would stop the mass migration of americans across the mississippi river if the whole army of the united states stood in the way the wave of emigration would pass over it to seek the valley where gold was found the fate of western indians 835 the massive gold rush in the black hills convinced some indians to make a last stand.
as red cloud a sioux chief said the white men have crowded the indians back year by year and now our last hunting ground the home of my people is to be taken from us.
our women and children will starve but for my part i prefer to die fighting rather than by starvation another prominent sioux war chief sitting bull told indians living on the black hills reservation that the whites may get me at last but i will have good times till then in 1875 lieutenant colonel george george a custer the reckless and armstrong custer a veteran indian glory seeking lieutenant colonel of fighter driven by reckless ambition and the u s army.
courage led 1 000 soldiers in the seventh cavalry regiment into the black hills where he announced the discovery of gold on french creek near p resent day custer south dakota.
the news set off a massive gold rush and within two years the mining town of deadwood overflowed with 10 000 miners.
the undermanned army units in the area could not keep the miners from violating the rights guaranteed the sioux by federal treaties.
president grant and federal authorities tried to convince the sioux to sell the black hills to the government.
sitting bull told the american negotiator to tell the great father grant that i do not want to sell any land to the government with that news custer was sent back to the black hills this time to find roving bands of sioux and cheyenne warriors and force them back onto reservations.
if they resisted he was to kill them.
the colorful custer strikingly handsome with golden curly hair stood out among his 600 horse soldiers.
having graduated last in his class at west point he was first in his class at gambling and socializing.
free spirited and f un loving he studied and behaved just enough to graduate.
he later urged cadets not to follow his own example.
custer loved war and the thrill of combat.
an army officer said custer was one of the few soldiers who fought for the fun of it to him war was glorious like crazy horse custer was a natural warrior whose goal was not to be wealthy not to be learned but to be great for all of custers flamboyant rebelliousness and lust for adventure he was a bold talented cavalry officer with remarkable endurance.
during the civil 836 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 war he had been promoted to general at the age of twenty three reporters dubbed him the boy general and had played an important role in the union victory at gettysburg leading a gallant cavalry charge.
now he was in charge of an expedition to attack the wandering bands of sioux hunting parties even though he recognized that intruding american miners had caused the renewal of warfare.
as custer told newspaper reporters we are goading the indians to madness by invading their hallowed hunting grounds what became the great sioux war was the largest military campaign since the end of the civil war.
the war against the northern indians lasted fifteen months and entailed fifteen battles in present day wyoming montana south dakota and nebraska.
in june 1876 after several indecisive encounters custer found a large encampment of sioux and their northern cheyenne and arapaho allies on the little bighorn river in the southeast corner of the montana territory.
on june 25 custer ordered his exhausted men to attack the indian camp.
hurrah boys weve got them he shouted not realizing how vastly outnumbered they were.
within minutes they were surrounded by as many as 2 500 warriors led by the fierce crazy horse a good day to fight a good day to die.
after a half hour of desperate fighting custers 210 men their ammunition exhausted were all dead.
custer was said to laugh as he fired his last bullet for battle of little bighorn 1876 amos bad heart bull an oglala sioux artist and historian painted this scene from the battle of little bighorn.
the fate of western indians 837 he knew his fate.
among the dead were two of custers brothers a b rother in law and a nephew.
afterwards cheyenne women pierced custers eardrums with sewing needles because he had failed to listen to their warnings to stay out of their ancestral lands.
custers brave death echoed a line from his favorite shakespeare play julius caesar i shall have glory by this losing day the sioux had won their greatest battle but in doing so they helped ensure that they would lose the war.
upon learning of the battle of little bighorn custers last stand president grant and congress abandoned the peace policy and dispatched more supplies and troops custers avengers to the plains.
general sheridan now planned for total war against the sioux.
under sheridans aggressive leadership the army quickly regained the offensive and relentlessly pursued the sioux and cheyenne across montana.

by 1880 most of the western indians were confined on reservations.
the demise of the buffalo over the long run the collapse of indian resistance in the face of white settlement on the great plains resulted as much from the decimation of the buffalo herds as from the actions of federal troops.
in 1750 there were an estimated 30 million buffalo on the plains the herds were so vast that one traveler said they changed the color of the landscape blackening the whole surface of the country by 1850 there were fewer than 10 million by 1900 only a few hundred were left.
what happened to them.
the conventional story focuses on intensive harvesting of buffalo by white commercial hunters after the civil war.
the construction of railroads through buffalo country brought hundreds of commercial hunters who shipped huge numbers of hides each year to cities in the east where consumers developed a voracious demand for buffalo robes buffalo leather and trophy heads.
the 838 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 average commercial hunter killed 100 of the shaggy beasts a day.
the buffalo reported an army officer melted away like snow before a summers sun the story is more complicated however.
the buffalo disappeared for a variety of health and environmental reasons notably a prolonged drought during the late 1880s into the 1890s that severely reduced the grasslands upon which the animals depended.
at the same time the buffalo had to compete for food with other grazing animals by the 1880s more than 2 million horses were roaming buffalo lands.
the plains indians themselves empowered by horses and rifles and spurred by the profits reaped from selling hides and meat to white traders accounted for much of the devastation of the buffalo herds after 1840.
if there had been no white hunters the buffalo would probably have lasted only another thirty years because their numbers had been so greatly reduced by other factors.
whatever the reasons the disappearance of the buffalo gave the plains indians little choice but to settle on the government reservations.

a generation of indian wars virtually ended in 1886 with the capture of geronimo a powerful chief of the chiricahua apaches who had outridden outwitted and outfought american forces in the southwest for fifteen years.
once the apaches captured a group of settlers tied them to their wagon wheels and roasted them alive.
u s army units routinely lynched captured apaches and treated women and children as combatants.

late in 1888 wovoka or jack wilson a paiute in western nevada fell ill.
in a delirium he imagined being in the spirit world where he learned of a deliverer coming to rescue the indians and restore their lands.
to hasten their deliverance he said the indians must perform a ceremonial dance that would make them bulletproof against white soldiers.
the ghost dance craze fed upon old legends of the dead reuniting with the living and bringing prosperity and peace.
the ghost dance movement spread rapidly.
in 1890 the western sioux adopted it with such passion that it alarmed white authorities.
they banned the ghost dance on lakota reservations but the indians defied the order and a crisis erupted.

could anyone expect less many politicians and religious leaders condemned the persistent mistreatment of indians.
in his annual message of 1877 president rutherford b hayes joined the protest many if not most of our indian wars have had their origin in broken promises and acts of injustice on our part helen hunt jackson a novelist and poet focused attention on the indian cause in a century of dishonor 1881 a book that powerfully detailed the sad history of americas exploitation of native americans over the centuries.
the end of the frontier 841 in part as a reaction to jacksons book u s policies regarding native americans gradually improved but they did little to enhance the indians difficult living conditions and actually helped destroy remnants of their culture.
the reservation policy inaugurated by the peace commission in 1867 did little more than extend a practice that dated from colonial virginia.
partly humanitarian in motive it also saved money housing and feeding indians on reservations cost less than fighting them.
well intentioned but biased white reformers sought to americanize indians by forcing them to become self reliant farmers owning their own plots of land rather than allowing them to be members of nomadic bands or tribes holding property in common.
such reform efforts produced the dawes severalty act of 1887 also called the general allotment act the most sweeping policy directed at native americans in u s history.
sponsored by senator henry l dawes of massachusetts the act divided tribal lands and allotted them to individuals granting 160 acres to each head of a family and lesser amounts to others.
white bear a kiowa chief expressed a common complaint when he said that his people did not want to settle down in houses you the federal government would build for us.
i love to roam over the wild prairie.
there i am free and happy but his preferences were not heeded.
between 1887 and 1934 indians lost an estimated 86 million of their 130 million acres.
as new york born henry teller a congressman from colorado pointed out the allotment policy was designed solely to strip the indians of their lands and to make them vagabonds on the face of the earth the end of the frontier the end of native american resistance was one of several developments at the close of the nineteenth century that suggested that the new west was indeed different from the old west.
other indicators of the regions transformation led some scholars to conclude that american society itself had reached a turning point as the century came to a close.
frederick jackson turner the 1890 national census reported that the frontier era was over americans by then had spread across the entire continent.
this news led frederick jackson turner a young historian at the university of wisconsin to announce his frontier thesis in 1893 in which he argued that more than slavery or any other single factor the existence of an area of free land its continuous recession and the advance of american settlement westward explain american development the experience of t aming 842 chapter 18 the new south and the new west 1865 1900 and settling the frontier he added had shaped the national character in fundamental ways.
it was to the frontier that the american intellect owes its striking characteristics.
that coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and acquisitiveness that practical inventive turn of mind quick to find expedients that masterful grasp of material things lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends that restless nervous energy that dominant individualism working for good and for evil and withal that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom these are traits of the frontier or traits called out elsewhere because of the existence of the frontier.
now however turner stressed the frontier has gone and with its going has closed the first period of american history turners view of the frontier as the westward moving source of the nations democratic politics open society unfettered economy and rugged individualism gripped the popular imagination.
but his frontier thesis left out much of the story of american development.
the frontier experience that turner described was in many respects a s elf serving myth involving only christian white men and devoid of towns and cities which in fact grew along with the frontier not after it had been tamed.
he virtually ignored the role of women african americans native americans hispanics and asians in shaping the human geography of the western united states.
moreover turners frontier was always the site of heroism triumph and progress.
he downplayed the evidence of greed exploitation and failure in the settling of the west.
turner also implied that america would be fundamentally different after 1890 because the frontier experience was essentially over.
in many respects however the west has retained the qualities associated with the rush for land gold timber and water rights.
the mining frontier as one historian has recently written set a mood that has never disappeared from the west the attitude of every extractive industry get in get rich get out discontented farmers by 1900 both the south and west were quite different socially and culturally from what they had been in 1865.
in both cases dramatically changed economic conditions spurred the emergence of a new south and a new west.
in the west the widespread use of mechanized commercial agriculture changed the dynamics of farming.
by the end of the nineteenth century many homesteaders had been forced to abandon their own farms and become wage earning laborers migrant workers moving with the seasons to different states to harvest different crops produced on the end of the frontier 843 large commercial farms or ranches.
migrant workers were often treated as poorly as the white and black sharecroppers in the south.
one western worker complained that the landowner looked at me his hired hand as if i was just another workhorse as discontent rose among farmers and farmworkers in the south and the west many of them joined the peoples party whose followers were known as populists a grassroots social and political movement that was sweeping the poorest rural regions of the nation.
in 1892 a minnesota farm leader named ignatius donnelly told populists at their national convention that we meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral political and material ruin he affirmed that populism sought to restore the government of the republic to the hands of the plain people with whom it originated the populist movement would tie the south and west together in an effort to wrest control of the political system from republicans in the northeast and midwest.
that struggle would come to define the 1890s and determine the shape of the twentieth century.
chapter review summary the new south many southerners embraced the vision of the new south p romoted by henry grady and others who called for a more diverse economy with greater industrialization more vocational training and a widespread acceptance of white supremacy in social relations.
the cotton textile industry grew to surpass that of new england iron manufacturing increased and the american tobacco company became the worlds largest manufacturer of cigarettes.
but agriculture and especially the growing of cotton still dominated the southern e conomy much as it had before the civil war.
under the crop lien system large landowners rented land to cash poor tenant farmers or sharecroppers the latter usually african americans in return for a share of the cotton they grew each year.
the crop lien system kept millions in long term debt and limited where they could live and how they could make a living.
jim crow policies in the south during the 1890s southern states disfranchised the vast majority of african american voters and instituted a series of p olicies known as jim crow laws segregating blacks and whites in public facilities.
starting with the mississippi plan state governments passed a series of comprehensive measures that included poll taxes grandfather clauses literacy tests and residency requirements making voting nearly impossible for most african americans and some poor whites.
disfranchisement was followed by legalized segregation ruled constitutional by the supreme court in the 1896 plessy v ferguson decision.
african americans who resisted were often the target of violence at the hands of whites the worst form being organized lynching.
western migrants life in the west was often harsh and violent but the promise of cheap land or wealth from mining drew settlers from the east.
although most westerners were white protestant americans or immigrants from germany and scandinavia mexicans african americans the exodusters and chinese as well as many other nationalities contributed to the wests diversity.
about t hree fourths of those who moved to the west were men.
miners farmers ranchers and women many migrants to the west were attracted to opportunities to mine ranch farm or work on the railroads.
miners were drawn to the discovery of precious minerals such as silver at the comstock lode in nevada in 1861.
but most miners and cattle ranchers did not become wealthy because mining and raising cattle particularly after the development of barbed wire and the end of the open range became large scale enterprises.
farmers on the great plains were able to produce wheat for export but declining grain prices and the need for expensive machinery and transportation meant that only large scale farms owned by a wealthy few could sustain real profits.
indian wars and policies by 1900 native americans were no longer free to roam the plains as the influx of miners ranchers farmers and soldiers had curtailed their traditional way of life.
instances of armed resistance such as the great sioux war were crushed.
beginning in 1887 with the dawes severalty act the american governments indian policy shifted.
it now forced indians to relinquish their traditional culture and adopt the american way of individual landownership.
the south and west in 1900 by 1900 the west resembled the south where agricultural resources were concentrated in the hands of a few.
in the 1890s poor farmers in the west joined with tenant farmers in the south to support the peoples party or the populist movement which sought to wrest control of the political and economic system from the powerful east and return it to the plain folk.
this contest would dominate the nations politics in the 1890s and set its course for the twentieth century.

w ithin three decades after the civil war american life had experienced a stunning transformation.
an agricultural society long rooted in the soil and little involved in global issues had become an urban and industrialized nation deeply entwined in world markets and international politics.
the period from the end of the civil war to the beginning of the twentieth century was an era noted for the widening social economic and political gap between the powerful and the powerless the haves and h ave nots.
it was sardonically labeled the gilded age for its greed and vulgarity and was a time marked by conspicuous consumption by the newly rich as they flaunted their enormous personal wealth the same wealth that financed extensive political and corporate corruption.
while the gilded age brought dramatic changes across all socioeconomic classes the resulting transformations to social and cultural life could hardly be considered gilded to average americans or recent immigrants.
urban america during the late nineteenth century the united states became a nation dominated by rapidly growing cities.
between 1865 and 1900 the urban population skyrocketed from 8 million to 30 million.
in 1865 fewer than twenty cities had populations of more than 50 000 by 1900 there were four times that many.

how did it impact american politics.
900 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 in the law of civilization and decay 1895 historian brooks adams argued that for the united states to survive and prosper it had to keep pushing beyond its borders.
as historian frederick jackson turner had proclaimed in 1893 the continental frontier was gone so americans needed new frontiers in which to exercise their expansive character and to spread their democratic ideals capitalist investments and christian beliefs.
manifest destiny also took on racial meaning many americans agreed with future president theodore roosevelt that the united states needed to expand on behalf of the destiny of the anglo saxon race roosevelt and others believed that the americans and british were at the top of the racial pyramid superior to all others in intellect ambition and creativity.
political and business leaders argued that americas rapid industrial development required the nation to acquire foreign t erritories by conquest if necessary to gain easier access to vital raw materials such as rubber tin copper palm oil and various dyes.
at the same time manufacturers and c ommercial farmers had become increasingly dependent on international trade which required an expanded force of warships to protect the merchant vessels.
and a modern s team powered navy needed ocean bases in the caribbean and pacific where its ships could replenish their supplies of coal and water.
for these and other reasons america expanded its military presence and territorial possessions both within and beyond the western hemisphere.
during just a few months in 1898 as the result of a o ne sided war against spain the united states born in a revolution against british colonial rule would itself become an imperial ruler of colonies around the world.
motivated by a mixture of moral and religious idealism assumptions of anglo saxon racial superiority and naked greed the expansionist push also met with strong opposition.
but most americans sided with future president theodore roosevelt who in his 1896 book the winning of the west declared that the conquest of the backward peoples of the world like the defeat of the indians in the american west benefited civilization and the interests of mankind toward the new imperialism the united states was a latecomer to imperialism.
by the 1880s the british french belgians italians dutch spanish and germans had conquered most of africa and asia.
often competing with one another for territories they had established colonial governments to rule over the native populations and exploited the colonies economically.
each imperial nation dispatched toward the new imperialism 901 missionaries to convert conquered peoples to christianity.
by 1900 some 18 000 protestant and catholic missionaries were scattered around the world.
writing in 1902 the british economist j.
a hobson declared that imperialism was the most powerful factor in the current politics of the western world a small yet influential group of public officials aggressively encouraged the idea of expansion beyond north america.
in addition to theodore roosevelt they included naval captain alfred thayer mahan president of the u s.
naval war college and senators albert j beveridge of indiana and henry cabot lodge of massachusetts.
referring to european imperialism lodge said we must not be left behind in 1890 mahan published the influence of sea power upon history 1660 1783 in which he argued that national greatness flowed from naval power.
mahan insisted that industrial development required a powerful navy centered on huge battleships a strong merchant marine foreign commerce colonies to provide raw materials and new markets for american products and global naval bases.
mahan urged leaders to look outward beyond the continental united states.
he championed americas destiny to control the caribbean sea build a canal across central america to connect the atlantic and pacific oceans acquire hawaii and the philippine islands and spread american values and investments across the pacific.
his ideas were widely circulated and by 1896 the united states had built eleven new battleships making its navy the third most powerful in the world behind great britain and germany.
claims of racial superiority reinforced the new imperialist spirit.
many americans and europeans readily assumed that some races were dominant anglo saxons and some inferior indians africans.
such racist notions were given scientific authority by researchers at universities throughout europe and america.
prominent americans used the arguments of social darwinism to justify economic exploitation and territorial conquest abroad and racial segregation at home.
among nations as among individuals they claimed only the strongest survived.
john fiske a harvard historian proclaimed the superior character of anglo saxon institutions and peoples.
the english speaking race he argued was destined to dominate the globe and transform the institutions traditions language and even the blood of the worlds backward races.
such theories of racial superiority were often used to justify armed conquest.
theodore roosevelt for example insisted that all the great masterful races have been fighting races.
no triumph of peace is so great as the triumphs of war 902 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 expansion in the pacific for john fiske and other imperialists asia offered an especially attractive target.
in 1866 secretary of state william h seward had predicted that the united states must inevitably impose its economic domination on the pacific ocean and its islands and continents eager for american manufacturers to take advantage of the huge asian markets seward believed that the nation first had to remove all foreign powers from its northern pacific coast and gain access to the regions valuable ports.
to that end he tried to acquire the english colony of british columbia sandwiched between r ussian owned alaska and the washington territory.
late in 1866 while encouraging business leaders and civil authorities in british columbia to consider becoming a u s territory seward learned of russias desire to sell alaska.
he leaped at the opportunity thinking the purchase might influence british columbia to join the union.
in 1867 the united states bought alaska for 7 2 million thus removing the threat of russian imperialism in north america.
critics scoffed at sewards folly but the purchase of alaska proved to be the biggest bargain since the louisiana purchase in part because of its vast deposits of gold and oil.
sewards successors at the state department sustained his expansionist vision.
acquiring key ports in the pacific ocean was the major focus of overseas activity throughout the rest of the nineteenth century.
two island groups occupied especially strategic positions samoa and hawaii the sandwich slands.
both had major harbors pago pago and pearl harbor respectively.
in the years after the civil war american interest in those islands deepened.
samoa in 1878 the samoans signed a treaty with the united states that granted a naval base at pago pago and extraterritoriality for americans meaning that in samoa americans remained subject only to u s law exchanged trade concessions and called for the united states to help resolve any disputes with other nations.
the senate ratified this accord and in the following year the german and british governments worked out similar arrangements with other islands in the samoan group.
there matters rested until civil war broke out in samoa in 1887.
a peace conference in berlin in 1889 established a protectorate over samoa with germany great britain and the united states in an uneasy partnership.
hawaii seward and other americans also wanted the hawaiian islands.
the islands a unified kingdom since 1795 had a sizable population of american missionaries and a profitable crop sugarcane.
in 1875 hawaii had signed expansion in the pacific 903 our new senators mocking the alaska purchase this political cartoon shows president andrew johnson and secretary of state seward welcoming two new senators from alaska an eskimo and a penguin.
a reciprocal trade agreement with the united states through which hawaiian sugar would enter the country duty free in exchange for hawaiis promise that none of its territory would be leased or granted to a third power.
this agreement led to a boom in sugar production based on cheap immigrant labor mainly chinese and japanese and white american sugar planters soon formed an economic elite.
by the 1890s the native hawaiian population had been reduced to a minority by smallpox and other foreign diseases and asians became the largest ethnic group.
beginning in 1891 queen liliuokalani the hawaiian ruler tried to restrict the growing political power exercised by american planters in the islands.
904 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 two years later however hawaiis white population called haoles overthrew the monarchy with the help of u s marines brought in by john l stevens the u s ambassador.
within a month a committee representing the haoles came to washington d c to ask the united states to annex the islands.
president benjamin harrison sent an annexation treaty to the senate just as he was leaving the presidency.
to investigate the situation the new president grover cleveland sent a special commissioner to hawaii who reported that the americans there had acted improperly and that most native hawaiians opposed annexation.
cleveland tried to restore the queen queen liliuokalani the hawaiian to power but met resistance from queen sought to preserve her nations the haoles.
on july 4 1894 the govindependence.
ernment they controlled created the republic of hawaii which included in its constitution a provision for american annexation.
in 1897 when william mckinley became president he was looking for an excuse to annex the islands.
we need hawaii he claimed.
it is americas manifest destiny the united states annexed hawaii in the summer of 1898 over the protests of native hawaiians.
the spanish american war the war of 1898 the annexation of hawaii set in motion a series of efforts to create an american presence in asia.
ironically this imperialist push originated in cuba a spanish colony ninety miles south of florida.
even more ironically the chief motive for american intervention in cuba was outrage at spains brutal imperialism.
free cuba throughout the second half of the nineteenth century cubans had repeatedly revolted against spanish rule only to be ruthlessly suppressed.
as one of spains oldest colonies cuba was a major market for the spanish american war the war of 1898 905 spanish goods.
yet powerful american sugar and mining companies had also invested heavily in cuba.
in fact the united states traded more with cuba than spain did and american owners of sugar plantations in cuba had grown increasingly concerned about the security of their investments.
on february 24 1895 cubans began another guerrilla war against spanish troops.
during what became the cuban war for independence 1895 1898 tens of thousands of cuban peasants died of combat wounds as well as disease and starvation in spanish detention camps.
americans followed the conflict through the newspapers.
two newspapers locked in a fierce competition for readers william randolph hearsts new york journal and joseph pulitzers new york world.
both worked to outdo the other with sensational headlines about spanish atrocities in cuba real or invented.
hearst explained that the role of newspapers was to shape public opinion and legislation.
newspapers he claimed had the power to declare wars hearsts efforts to manipulate public opinion came to be called yellow journalism.
editors sent their best reporters to cuba and encouraged them to distort exaggerate or even make up stories to attract more readers.
in addition to boosting the journals circulation hearst wanted a war against spain to propel the united states to world power status.
once war was declared he took credit for it one of his headlines blared how do you like the journals war many protestant ministers and publications also campaigned for war in part because of antagonism toward catholic spain.
the political path to war at the outset of the cuban war for independence president grover cleveland tried to protect u s business interests while avoiding military involvement.
mounting public sympathy for the rebel cause prompted concern in congress however.
by concurrent resolutions on april 6 1896 the house and senate endorsed granting official recognition to the cuban rebels.
after his inauguration in march 1897 president william mckinley continued the official policy of neutrality while taking a sympathetic stance toward the rebels.
mckinley a civil war veteran did not want war.
i have been through one war he said.
i have seen the dead piled up and i do not want to see another later that year spain offered cubans autonomy self government without formal independence in return for ending the rebellion but the cubans rejected the offer.
early in 1898 events pushed spain and the united states into a war that neither wanted.
on january 25 the u s battleship maine docked in havana the cuban capital supposedly on a courtesy call.
on february 9 the new york journal released the text of a letter from dupuy de lme spanish ambassador 906 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 50 000 reward as if the news of the maine sinking were not disturbing enough the new york journal sought to sensationalize the incident by offering a 50 000 reward for the perpetrator the equivalent of 1 3 million today.
to the united states to a friend in havana summarizing mckinleys annual message to congress.
in the de lme letter the spaniard called mckinley weak and a bidder for the admiration of the crowd besides being a would be politician who tries to leave a door open behind himself while keeping on good terms with the jingoes warmongers of his party six days later at 9 40 on the night of february 15 the maine mysteriously exploded.
within minutes its ruptured hull filled with water.
sailors most of whom were asleep struggled frantically in the dark only to drown as the ship sank.
of the 350 sailors on board 260 died.
years later the sinking was ruled an accident resulting from a coal explosion but in 1898 those eager for war with spain saw no need to delay judgment.
theodore roosevelt the thirty nine year old assistant secretary of the navy called the sinking an act of dirty treachery and told a friend that he would give anything if president mckinley would order the fleet to havana tomorrow the united states he claimed needs a war and he hoped it would come soon congress authorized 50 million to prepare for combat with spain but mckinley who assumed that the sinking was an accident did his best to resist demands for war while negotiating with the spanish and gauging the public mood.
he also avoided interacting with roosevelt who he said was too pugnacious as the days passed roosevelt told his w ar hungry friends that the president had no more backbone than a chocolate clair with roosevelts the spanish american war the war of 1898 907 encouragement the publics antagonism toward spain grew behind the popular saying remember the maine to hell with spain in the weeks following the sinking the spanish government grudgingly agreed to virtually every american demand regarding cuba but the weight of public opinion the cry of revenge from democratic leaders and the influence of republican jingoists eroded mckinleys neutrality.
as a senator explained the current was too strong the demagogues too numerous the fall elections too near for mckinley to hold out against war.
on april 11 mckinley asked congress for authority to use the armed forces to end the fighting in cuba.
on april 20 congress declared cuba independent from spain and demanded the withdrawal of spanish forces.
the spanish government quickly broke diplomatic ties with the united states and after u s ships began blockading cuban ports declared war on april 24.
the next day congress passed its own declaration of war.
the teller amendment to the war resolution denied any u s intention to annex cuba.
president mckinley called for 125 000 volunteers to supplement the 28 000 men already serving in the u s army.
among the first to enlist was theodore roosevelt who resigned from his government post and told his tailor to make him a dashing army uniform.
never has an american war generated such unexpected and far reaching consequences.
although mckinley had gone to war reluctantly he soon saw it as an opportunity to acquire overseas territories.
while we are conducting war and until its conclusion he wrote privately we must keep all we get when the war is over we must keep what we want a war to free cuba became a way to gain an empire.
what had long been called the spanish american war has been renamed the war of 1898 because it involved not just spanish and american combatants but cubans filipinos and puerto ricans.
a splendid little war the war with spain lasted only 114 days but it set the united states on a course toward overseas imperialism that would transform americas role in the world.
the conflict was barely under way before the u s navy produced a spectacular victory 7 000 miles away from cuba in the pacific at manila bay in the philippine islands a colony controlled by the spanish for more than 300 years.
just before war was declared roosevelt who was still assistant secretary of the navy had taken advantage of his boss being away from the office one afternoon to order commodore george dewey commander of the u s asiatic squadron to engage spanish forces in the philippines in case of war in cuba.
908 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 dewey arrived in manila bay on april 30 with six modern warships which quickly destroyed or captured the outdated spanish vessels there.

an english reporter called it a military execution rather than a real contest news of the battle set off wild celebrations in america.
dewey was now in possession of manila bay but had no soldiers to go onshore.
he and his warships stayed for several months waiting for reinforcements while german and british warships cruised offshore like watchful vultures ready to seize the philippines if the united states did not.
in the meantime emilio aguinaldo the leader of the filipino nationalist movement declared the philippines independent on june 12 1898.
with aguinaldos help deweys forces entered manila on august 13 and accepted the surrender of the spanish troops who had feared revenge if they surrendered to the filipinos.
news of the american victory sent president mckinley in search of a map of asia to locate the islands now occupied by u s soldiers and sailors.
senator lodge was delighted with the news from the philippines we hold the other side of the pacific he announced.
we must on no account let the philippine islands go the cuban campaign at the start of the war the spanish army in cuba was five times as large as the entire u s army.
but mckinleys call for volunteers inspired nearly a million men to enlist.
the new recruits including some 10 000 african american soldiers mostly northerners eager to show our loyalty to our land had to be equipped and trained before they would be ready for battle.
in the jim crow south however blacks were less eager to enlist because as a richmond newspaper editor observed they suffered a system of oppression as barbarous as that which is alleged to exist in cuba in the meantime the u s navy blockaded the spanish fleet inside santiago harbor while some 17 000 american troops hastily assembled at tampa african american troops in cuba soldiers stand in formation wearing old wool uniforms unsuited to cubas tropical heat.

one prominent unit was the first volunteer cavalry better known as the rough riders a special regiment made up of former ivy league athletes e x convicts western cowboys texas rangers and cherokee choctaw chickasaw pawnee and creek indians.
all were young good shots and good riders the rough riders are best remembered because theodore roosevelt was second in command.
one of the rough riders said that roosevelt was nervous energetic virile manly.
he may wear out some day but he will never rust out when the 578 rough riders accompanied by a gaggle of reporters and photographers landed on june 22 1898 at the undefended southeastern tip of cuba chaos followed.
except for roosevelts horse little texas almost all of the other horses and mules had been mistakenly sent elsewhere leaving the rough riders to become the weary walkers nevertheless land and sea battles on the southern coast around santiago quickly broke spanish resistance.
on july 1 about 7 000 u s soldiers took the fortified village of el caney.
while a much larger force attacked san juan hill a smaller unit led by roosevelt on horseback and including the rough riders on foot seized nearby kettle hill.
thanks to widespread newspaper coverage much of it exaggerated roosevelt became a h ome front legend for his headlong gallop toward the spanish defenders.
the new york times reported that he had led the charge with bulldog ferociousness acting in a grand drama for the world to watch and admire roosevelt loved being in the headlines.
being a military hero was his lifelong dream.
according to the new york world the young lieutenant colonel had become more talked about than any man in the country a friend reported to roosevelts wife that her husband was reveling in victory and gore unburdened by humility roosevelt requested a congressional medal of honor for his much publicized charge in cuba.
it did not come.
president bill clinton finally awarded the medal posthumously in 2001.
while colonel roosevelt was basking in the glory of battle other u s soldiers in cuba were less enthusiastic about the terrors of modern warfare.
walter bartholomew a private from new york reported that the war in all its awfulness was so much more hideous than my wildest imagination that i have not yet recovered from the shock a soldier standing beside him had the front of his throat torn completely off by a spanish bullet.
as his unit was charging up san juan hill they became totally disorganized and thrown into utter confusion amid the intense shooting.
he discarded all he carried except for his rifle in the mad scramble to get out of the valley of death while stopping to shoot he saw the 24th regiment of colored infantry racing up the hill and he decided to follow their lead so excited that i forgot to fire my gun and i actually charged clean up to the top of the hill without shooting in as great panic as if i had been retreating the spanish american war the war of 1898 911 colonel roosevelt with one hand on his hip roosevelt rides with the rough riders in cuba.
most of his regiment was culled from arizona new mexico and texas because the southwestern climate resembled that of cuba.
spanish defeat and concessions on july 3 the spanish navy trapped at santiago made a gallant run to evade the american fleet blockading the harbor.
the spanish ships reported captain john philip commander of the u s warship texas came out as gaily as brides to the altar but they were quickly destroyed.
the casualties were as one sided as those at manila 474 spaniards were killed or wounded while only 1 american was killed and 1 wounded.
spanish officials in santiago surrendered on july 17.
on july 25 an american force moved into s panish held puerto rico wealthy port in english meeting only minor resistance.
the next day july 26 the spanish government sued for peace.
a ceasefire agreement was signed on august 12.
in cuba the spanish forces formally surrendered to the u s commander and then sailed for home excluded from the ceremony were the cubans for whom the war had supposedly been fought.
on december 10 1898 the united states and spain signed the treaty of paris.
under its terms cuba was to become independent and the united states was to annex puerto rico and continue to occupy manila pending a transfer of power in the philippines.
thus the spanish empire in the americas initiated by the voyages of christopher columbus some four centuries earlier came to a humiliating end.
now the united states was ready to create its own empire.
during the four month war of 1898 more than 60 000 spanish soldiers and sailors died of wounds or disease mostly malaria typhoid dysentery 912 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 the spanish american war in the caribbean the war of 1898 san juan hill santiago de cuba el caney santiago harbor spanish fleet florida kettle u s hill blockade u.

some 10 500 cubans died.
among the americans who served in the war 5 462 died but only 379 in battle most died from disease.
at such a cost the united states was launched onto the world scene as a great power with all the benefits and b urdens that come with being an imperial nation.
halfway through the conflict in cuba john hay the u s ambassador to great britain who would soon become secretary of state wrote a letter to roosevelt calling the conflict a splendid little war begun with the highest motives carried on with magnificent intelligence and spirit favored by that fortune which loves the brave the u s ambassador to france concluded that no war in history has accomplished so much in so short a time with consequences of victory 913 so little loss the spanish reaction was quite different for the war destroyed the remnants of the spanish empire.
spaniards called the catastrophic war the disaster a humiliating defeat that called into question spains status as a major world power.
everything is broken in this unhappy country a spanish newspaper reported.
consequences of victory victory in the war of 1898 boosted american s elf confidence and reinforced the self serving belief influenced by racism and social darwinism that the united states had a manifest destiny to reshape the world in its own image.
in 1885 the reverend josiah strong wrote a best selling book titled our country in which he used a darwinian argument to strengthen the appeal of manifest destiny.
the wonderful progress of the united states he boasted was an illustration of charles darwins concept of natural selection since americans had demonstrated that they were the worlds superior civilization a race of unequaled energy who represented the largest liberty the purest christianity the highest civilization in the world a race of superior people destined to spread itself over the earth strong asserted that the united states had a christian duty and economic opportunity to expand anglo saxon influence.
a growing international trade he noted would emerge from americas missionary evangelism and racial superiority.
can anyone doubt he asked that this race.
is destined to dispossess many weaker races assimilate others and mold the remainder until.
it has anglo saxonized mankind europeans agreed that the united states had now made a forceful entrance onto the world stage.
the times of london announced that the american victory over spain must effect a profound change in the whole attitude and policy of the united states.
in the future america will play a part in the general affairs of the world such as she has never played before annexing the philippines the united states had liberated most of spains remaining colonies yet it soon substituted its own imperialism for spains.
if war with spain had saved many lives by ending the insurrection in cuba it had also led the united states to take many lives in suppressing another a nti colonial insurrection in the philippines.
the acquisition of americas first imperial colonies created a host of long lasting moral and practical problems from the difficulties of imposing u s rule on native peoples to those of defending far flung territories.
914 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 mckinleys motives the treaty of paris had left the political status of the philippines unresolved.
american business leaders wanted the united states to keep the islands so that they could more easily penetrate the vast markets of nearby china.
as mark hanna mckinleys top adviser stressed controlling the philippines would enable the united states to take a large slice of the commerce of asia american missionary organizations mostly protestant also favored annexation they viewed the philippines as a base from which to bring christianity to the little brown brother not long after the united states took control american authorities ended the roman catholic churchs status as the philippines official religion and made english the official language thus opening the door for protestant missionaries in the region.
these factors helped convince president mckinley of the need to annex those darned islands making up the philippines.
he explained that one night late it came to me this way i dont know how it was but it came 1 that we could not give them back to spain that would be cowardly and dishonorable 2 that we could not turn them over to france or germany our commercial rivals in the o rient that would be bad business and discreditable 3 that we could not leave them to themselves they were unfit for self government and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there worse than spains was and 4 that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all and to educate the filipinos and uplift and civilize and christianize them and by gods grace do the very best we could by them as our fellowmen for whom christ also died.
and then i went to bed and went to sleep and slept soundly.
in this brief statement mckinley had summarized the motivating ideas of american imperialism 1 national glory 2 commerce 3 racial superiority and 4 evangelism.
american negotiators in paris finally offered spain 20 million for the philippines puerto rico and guam a spanish controlled island between hawaii and the philippines that would serve as a coaling station for ships headed across the pacific.
meanwhile the nation took other expansive steps.
in addition to annexing hawaii in 1898 the united states also claimed wake island between guam and hawaii which would become a vital link in a future transpacific telegraph cable.
then in 1899 germany and the united states agreed to divide the samoa islands.
debating the treaty by early 1899 the treaty of paris had yet to be ratified in the senate because of growing opposition to the idea of a global consequences of victory 915 american empire.
a nti expansionists argued that taking control of former spanish colonies would violate the longstanding american principle embodied in the constitution that people should be self governing.
the opposition might have killed the treaty had not the most prominent democratic leader william jennings bryan argued that ending the war would open the way for the future independence of the philippines.
his position convinced enough senate democrats to support the treaty on february 6 1899 by the narrowest of margins only one vote more than the necessary two thirds.
president mckinley however had no intention of granting independence to the philippines.
although he privately told a friend that if old dewey had just sailed away when he smashed that spanish fleet what a lot of trouble he would have saved us he publicly insisted that the united states take control of the islands as an act of benevolent assimilation of the native population.
a california newspaper gave a more candid explanation however.
let us be frank the editor exclaimed.
we do not want the filipinos.
we want the philippines many filipinos had a different vision.
in january 1899 they declared again their independence and named twenty nine year old emilio aguinaldo president.
the following month an american soldier outside manila fired on soldiers in aguinaldos nationalist forces called insurrectos killing two.
the next day the u s army commander without investigating the cause of the turmoil in the philippines emilio aguinaldo seated third from right and other leaders of the filipino insurgence.
916 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 shooting ordered his troops to assault the insurrectos beginning a full scale armed conflict that continued for weeks.
general elwell s otis rejected aguinaldos proposals for a truce saying that fighting having begun must go on to the grim end he would accept only the unconditional surrender of the filipino forces.
on june 2 1899 the philippine republic declared war against the united states.
since the insurrectos more or less controlled the philippines outside manila what followed was largely an american war of conquest at odds with the founding principle of the united states that people have the right to govern themselves.
the war would rob the filipinos of the chance to be their own masters.
the philippine american war 1898 1902 the effort to crush filipino nationalism lasted three years and involved some 126 000 u s troops four times as many as had been sent to liberate cuba.
it cost the american government 600 million and took the lives of 200 000 filipinos most of them civilians and 4 234 american soldiers.
it was an especially brutal conflict fought in tropical heat and humidity with massacres committed by both sides and racism contributing to numerous atrocities by the americans many of whom referred to the filipinos as niggers u s troops burned villages tortured and executed prisoners and imprisoned civilians in overcrowded concentration camps.
a reporter for the philadelphia ledger noted that u s soldiers had killed to exterminate men women children prisoners and captives active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up the idea prevailing that the filipino as such was little better than a dog one u s soldier from indiana celebrated the slaughter of an entire village in retaliation for the murder of an american i am in my glory when i can sight my gun on some dark skin and pull the trigger both sides in the war used torture to gain information.
a favorite method employed by americans was the water cure a technique to simulate drowning developed in the spanish inquisition during the sixteenth century.
today it is called waterboarding.
a captured insurgent would be placed on his back on the ground.
while soldiers stood on his outstretched arms and feet they pried his mouth open and held it in place with a bamboo stick.
they then poured salt water into the captives mouth and nose until his stomach was bloated whereupon the soldiers would stomp on his abdomen forcing the water now mixed with gastric juices out of his mouth.
this process would be repeated until the captive told the soldiers what they wanted to know or died.
theodore roosevelt was convinced that nobody was seriously damaged by the water cure whereas filipinos had inflicted terrible tortures upon our own people consequences of victory 917 thus did the united states destroy a revolutionary movement modeled after americas own struggle for independence.
organized filipino resistance had collapsed by the end of 1899.
on april 1 1901 aguinaldo swore an oath accepting the authority of the united states over the philippines and pledging his allegiance to the u s government.
against the backdrop of this nasty guerrilla war the great debate over imperialism continued in the united states.
in 1899 several anti imperialist groups combined to form the american anti imperialist league.
andrew carnegie footed the bills for the league and even offered 20 million to buy independence for the filipinos.
other prominent anti imperialists included union leader samuel gompers who feared the competition of cheap filipino labor college presidents charles eliot of harvard and david starr jordan of stanford and social reformer jane addams.
even former presidents grover cleveland and benjamin harrison urged president mckinley to withdraw u s forces from the philippines.
the drive for imperialism in asia said harvard philosopher william james had caused the united states to puke up its ancient soul of the philippine american war james asked could there be any more damning indictment of that whole bloated ideal termed modern civilization senator george frisbie hoar led the opposition to annexation of the philippines.
the water cure american soldiers torture a filipino prisoner during the p hilippine american war.
918 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 under the constitution he pointed out no power is given the federal government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as colonies or to conquer alien people and hold them in subjugation organizing the new colonies in the end the imperialists won the debate over the status of the territories acquired from spain.

therefore we must find new markets for our produce american controlled colonies would make the best new markets.
without acknowledging it beveridge and others were using many of the same arguments that england had used in founding the american colonies in the seventeenth century.
on july 4 1901 the u s military government in the philippines came to an end and william howard taft became the civil governor.
in 1902 congress passed the philippine government act which declared the islands an unorganized territory in 1917 the jones act affirmed americas intention to grant the philippines independence but that would not happen until 1946.
closer to home puerto rico had been acquired in part to serve as a u s outpost guarding the caribbean sea.

named head of the army yellow fever commission in 1900 he proved that mosquitoes carry yellow fever.
the commissions experiments led the way to effective control of the disease worldwide.
in 1900 on mckinleys order cubans drafted a constitution modeled on that of the united states.
the platt amendment added to an army appropriations bill in 1901 sharply restricted the cuban governments independence however.
the amendment required that cuba never impair its independence by signing a treaty with a third power that it keep its debt within the governments power to repay it out of ordinary revenues and that it acknowledge the right of the united states to intervene whenever it saw fit.
finally cuba had to sell or lease to the united states lands to be used for coaling or naval stations a stipulation that led to a u s naval base at guantnamo bay that still exists today.
imperial rivalries in east asia while the united states was conquering the philippines other nations were threatening to carve up china.
after japan defeated china in the first s ino japanese war 1894 1895 european nations set out to exploit the weakness of the huge virtually defenseless nation.
by the end of the century russia germany france and great britain had each established spheres of influence in c hina territories that they rather than the chinese government controlled but did not formally annex.
in 1898 and again in 1899 the british asked the american government to join them in preserving the territorial integrity of china against further imperialist actions.
both times however the senate rejected the request because the united states as yet had no strategic investment in the region.
the american outlook changed with the defeat of spain and the acquisition of the philippines.
instead of acting jointly with great britain though the u s government decided to act alone.
what came to be known as the open door policy was outlined in secretary of state john hays open door note dispatched in 1899 to his european counterparts.
without consulting the chinese hay announced that china should remain an open door to european and american trade and that other nations should not try to take control of chinese ports or territory.
none of the european powers except britain accepted hays principles but none rejected them either.
so hay announced that all major powers involved in china had accepted the policy.
consequences of victory 921 intervention in china after quelling the boxer rebellion u s troops march in the forbidden palace the imperial palace in the chinese capital of beijing.
the open door policy was rooted in the desire of american businesses to exploit and ultimately dominate chinese markets.
however it also appealed to those who opposed imperialism because it pledged to keep china from being carved up by powerful european nations.
the policy had little legal standing however.
when the japanese became concerned about growing russian influence in the disputed region of manchuria in northeast china and asked how the united states intended to enforce the policy hay replied that america was not prepared.
to enforce these views so the situation would remain for forty years until continued japanese military expansion in china would bring about a diplomatic dispute with america that would lead to war.
the boxers a new asian crisis arose in 1900 when a group of chinese nationalists known to the western world as b oxers they called themselves the fists of righteous harmony rebelled against foreign involvement in china especially christian missionary efforts and laid siege to foreign embassies in peking now known as beijing.
an expedition of british german russian japanese and american soldiers was organized to rescue the international diplomats and their staffs.
hay fearful that the intervention might become an 922 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 excuse for other nations to dismember china took the opportunity to refine the open door policy.
the united states he said sought a solution that would preserve chinese territorial and administrative integrity as well as equal and impartial trade with all parts of the chinese empire six weeks later the foreign military expedition reached peking and ended the boxer rebellion.
roosevelts b ig s tick diplomacy on september 6 1901 president mckinley was shaking hands at the p an a merican exposition in buffalo new york when a twenty eight year old unemployed laborer named leon czolgosz pronounced chol gots an anarchist who did not believe in governments or rulers approached him with a concealed gun and fired twice at p oint blank range.
one bullet was deflected by the presidents coat button and breastbone but the other tore through his stomach and lodged in his back.
for several days the attending doctors issued opti mistic reports about the presidents condition but after a week mckinley knew he was dying.
it is useless gentlemen he told the doctors and nurses.
i think we ought to have a prayer theodore roosevelt his vice president became the new president and soon launched a new era in national development.
more than any other american of his time roosevelt transformed the role of the united states in world affairs.
the nation had emerged from the war of 1898 a world power with major international responsibilities.
to ensure that americans accepted their new global role roosevelt stretched both the constitution and executive power to the limit.
in the process he pushed a reluctant nation onto the center stage of world affairs.
a rocket rise to prominence born in 1858 teedie roosevelt had grown up in new york city in an upper class family.
he visited europe as a child studied with a personal tutor spoke german fluently and graduated from harvard with honors in 1880.
a frail and sickly boy nearly blind in one eye he followed his fathers advice to make your own body he compulsively lifted weights wrestled hiked rowed swam boxed and climbed mountains all in an effort to build himself into a physical and intellectual athlete.
the results were startling.
roosevelt transformed himself into a man of almost superhuman energy who fiercely championed the strenuous life he told his children that he would rather see them dead than have them grow up to be weaklings and sissies roosevelts big stick diplomacy 923 roosevelt was a fearless he man who also displayed extraordinary intellectual curiosity.
he became a voracious reader and talented writer a natural scientist a dedicated bird watcher a renowned historian and essayist and a zealous moralist who divided the world into two camps good and evil.
roosevelts zest for life and his combative spirit were contagious and he was ever eager to express an opinion on any subject.
after young roosevelt participated in a buffalo hunt in the dakotas one of the cowboys said there goes the most remarkable man i ever met.
unless i am badly mistaken the world is due to hear from him one of these days within two years after graduating from harvard roosevelt a r eform minded republican won election as the youngest member of the new york legislature.
fearlessly independent he could not be bought.
nor did he tolerate the excesses of the spoils system.
though i am a strong party man he warned if i find a corrupt public official i would take off his head with the world seemingly at roosevelts feet however disaster struck.
in 1884 his mother mittie only forty eight years old died of typhoid fever.
eleven hours later his bewitchingly pretty twenty two year old wife alice died in his arms of kidney failure having given birth to their only child just two days earlier.
the light has gone out of my life roosevelt noted in his diary.
the double funeral service for his wife and mother was so emotional that the officiating minister wept throughout his prayer.
to recover from this strange and terrible fate roosevelt turned his newborn daughter over to his sister quit his political career sold the family house and moved to a cattle ranch in the dakota territory where he threw himself into roping and branding steers shooting buffalo and bears capturing outlaws fighting indians whom he called a lesser race and reading novels by the campfire.
he was by his own admission a poor shot a bad roper and an average horseman but he loved every minute of his western life.
although his time in the west lasted only two years he never got over being a cowboy.
i owe more than i can express to the west he wrote in his memoirs.
back in new york city roosevelt remarried and ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1886.
he later served six years as a u s civil service commissioner and two years as the citys police commissioner.
in 1896 he campaigned energetically for william mckinley and the new president was asked to reward him with the position of assistant secretary of the navy.
mckinley resisted at first saying that roosevelt was too hotheaded but eventually gave in.
roosevelt took full advantage of the celebrity he had gained with the rough riders in cuba to win the governorship of new york in 1898.
by then he had become the most visible young republican in the nation.
i have played it in bull luck this summer he wrote a friend about his recent streak of successes.
924 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 first to get into the war then to get out of it then to get elected two years later republican leaders were urging him to become the vice presidential running mate for mckinley who was hoping for a second term.
from vice president to president in the 1900 presidential contest the democrats turned again to william jennings bryan who wanted to make american imperialism the paramount issue of the campaign.
the democratic platform condemned the philippine conflict as an unnecessary war that had placed the united states in the false and un american position of crushing with military force the efforts of our former allies to achieve liberty and self government the republicans renominated mckinley and named roosevelt now known as mr.
imperialism their candidate for vice president.
roosevelt who despised bryan crisscrossed the nation condemning bryans communistic and socialistic doctrines promoting higher taxes and the unlimited coinage of silver.
in the end mckinley and roosevelt won by 7 2 million to 6 4 million popular votes and 292 to 155 electoral votes.
bryan even lost nebraska his home state.
on september 14 1901 mckinley died and theodore roosevelt was elevated to the white house.
now look exclaimed marcus mark hanna the ohio senator who had been mckinleys political manager that damned cowboy is president of the united states mckinleys assassination marked the end of one political era and the beginning of another.
six weeks short of his forty third birthday roosevelt was the youngest man ever to become president.
but he had more experience in public affairs than most new presidents and perhaps more vitality than any.
one observer compared his boundless personality and energy to niagara falls both great wonders of nature roosevelts glittering spectacles glistening teeth and overflowing enthusiasm were like divine gifts to political cartoonists as was his famous motto an old african proverb speak softly and carry a big stick roosevelts unshakable s elf righteousness led him to cast nearly every issue in moral and patriotic terms.
he was the first truly activist president.
the presidency was as he put it a bully pulpit a wonderful platform for delivering fist pumping speeches on the virtues of honesty courage and civic duty.
nowhere was roosevelts forceful will more evident than in his handling of foreign affairs.
like many of his political friends and associates he was convinced that the civilized and barbarian people of the world faced inevitable roosevelts big stick diplomacy 925 u s.

wwn64 figure m20 4 how did the u s government interfere with colombian politics in an effort first proof to gain control of the canal zone.
what was the roosevelt corollary.
conflict not unlike the fate of the native americans pushed off their ancestral lands by americans.
in 1899 roosevelt argued that the united states as a great civilized power needed to take control of other regions of the world to bring law order and righteousness to backward peoples he believed that american imperialists would be missionaries of civic virtue rather than colonial masters spreading the merits of their superior race the panama canal after the spanish american war the war of 1898 as the united states became more deeply involved in the c aribbean one issue overshadowed every other the proposed panama canal.
by enabling ships to travel from the pacific ocean to the gulf of mexico such a canal would cut the travel distance between san francisco and new york city by almost 8 000 miles.
926 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 the narrow nation of panama had first become a major concern of americans in the late 1840s when it became an important overland link in the sea route from the east coast to the california goldfields.
two treaties dating from that period loomed as obstacles to the construction of a canal however.
the bidlack treaty 1846 with colombia then called new granada guaranteed colombias control over panama.
in the clayton bulwer treaty 1850 the british had agreed to acquire no more central american territory and the united states joined them in agreeing to build or fortify a canal only by mutual consent.
secretary of state john hay asked the british ambassador for consent to digging the canal president theodore roosevelt operating a steam shovel build a canal and the outcome was during his 1906 visit to the panama the hay pauncefote treaty of 1901.
other obstacles remained however.
from 1881 to 1887 a french company led by ferdinand de lesseps who had engineered the suez canal in egypt had already spent nearly 300 million and some 20 000 lives to dig a canal a third of the way across panama which was still under colombian control.
the company asked that the united states purchase the partially completed canal which it did.
meanwhile secretary hay had opened negotiations with ambassador toms herrn of colombia.
in return for acquiring a canal zone six miles wide the united states agreed to pay 10 million.
the u s senate ratified the h ay herrn treaty in 1903 but the colombian senate held out for 25 million.
as president roosevelt raged against the foolish and homicidal corruptionists in bogot the panamanians revolted against colombian rule.
philippe b unau varilla an employee of the french canal company assisted them and reported after visiting roosevelt and hay in washington d c that u s warships would arrive at coln panama on november 2.
colombian troops who could not penetrate the overland jungle sepa rating them from the canal zone found the u s ships blocking the s ea lanes roosevelts big stick diplomacy 927 to the area.
on november 13 the roosevelt administration received its first ambassador from the newly independent panama bunau varilla who eagerly signed a treaty that extended the canal zone from six to ten miles wide.
for a 10 million down payment and 250 000 a year the united states received in perpetuity the use occupation and control of the fifty mile long canal zone.
not everyone applauded the presidents actions.
a chicago news paper attacked roosevelt for his rough riding assault upon another republic over the shattered wreckage of international law the u s attorney general asked to supply a legal opinion upholding roosevelts actions responded wryly no mr president if i were you i would not have any taint of legality about it he then added you were accused of seduction and you have conclusively proved that you were guilty of rape roosevelt later explained i took the canal zone and let congress debate and while the debate goes on the construction of the canal does also big stick diplomacy president theodore roosevelt wields the big stick symbolizing his aggressive diplomacy.
as he stomps through the caribbean he drags a string of american warships behind him.
928 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 building the panama canal was one of the greatest engineering feats in history.
over ten years some 60 000 mostly unskilled workers from europe asia and the caribbean used dynamite and steam shovels to gouge out the canal from dense jungle.
almost a third of the workers died.
people get killed and injured almost every day a worker reported in his journal.
and all the bosses want is to get the canal built with great fanfare the canal opened on august 15 1914 two weeks after the outbreak of the great war in europe.
roosevelt and latin america theodore roosevelts theft of the panama canal zone created ill will throughout latin america that would last for generations.
latin americans were also upset by constant interference from both the united states and european countries in their internal affairs.
a frequent excuse for intervention was to promote a safe and stable environment for american businesses including the collection of debts owed by latin american governments.
the latin americans responded with the drago doctrine 1902 named after argentinian foreign minister luis mara drago which prohibited armed intervention by other countries to collect debts.
in december 1902 however german and british warships blockaded venezuela to force repayment of debts in defiance not only of the drago doctrine but also of the monroe doctrine the u s policy dating to 1823 that prohibited european intervention in the western hemisphere.
roosevelt decided that if the united states were to keep european nations from intervening militarily in latin america then sooner or later we must keep order there ourselves in 1904 a crisis over the debts of the dominican republic prompted roosevelt to send two warships to the island nation and issue what came to be known as the roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine the principle in short that in certain circumstances the united states was justified in intervening in latin american nations to prevent europeans from doing so.
thereafter u s presidents would repeatedly use military force to ensure that latin american nations paid their debts to u s and european banks.
relations with japan while wielding a big stick in latin america roosevelt was playing the role of peacemaker in east asia.
the principle of equal trading rights represented by the open door policy was tested in 1904 when the long standing rivalry between russia and japan flared into the russo japanese war over japans attempts to expand its influence in china and korea.
roosevelts big stick diplomacy 929 on february 8 japanese warships devastated the russian fleet.
the japanese then occupied the korean peninsula and drove the russians back into manchuria.
when the japanese signaled that they would welcome a negotiated settlement roosevelt sponsored a peace conference in portsmouth new hampshire.
in the treaty of portsmouth signed on september 5 1905 russia acknowledged japans predominant political military and economic interests in korea japan would annex the kingdom in 1910.
both powers agreed to leave manchuria.
japans show of strength against russia raised concerns among u s leaders about the security of the philippines.
during the portsmouth talks roosevelt sent william howard taft to meet with the japanese foreign minister in tokyo.
they negotiated the taft katsura agreement of july 29 1905 in which the united states accepted japanese control of korea in exchange for japan acknowledging u s control of the philippines.
three years later the r oot takahira agreement negotiated by secretary of state elihu root and the japanese ambassador to the united states reinforced the open door policy by supporting the independence and integrity of china and the principle of equal opportunity for commerce and industry in china behind the outward appearances of goodwill however lay mutual distrust.
for many americans the russian threat in east asia now gave way to concerns about the yellow peril a term apparently coined by kaiser wilhelm ii of germany.
racial conflict on the west coast especially in califor japanese immigration japanese nia helped sour relations with japan.
immigrants are vaccinated aboard in 1906 san franciscos school board a steamship on their way to hawaii.
by 1900 about 40 percent of hawaiis ordered students of asian descent to population was japanese.
attend a separate public school.
when 930 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 the japanese government protested president roosevelt persuaded the school board to change its policy but only after making sure that japanese authorities would stop encouraging unemployed japanese laborers to go to america.
this gentlemens agreement of 1907 the precise terms of which have never been revealed halted the influx of japanese immigrants to california and relieved some of the racial tension.
the great white fleet after roosevelts election to a full term as president in 1904 he celebrated americas rise as a world power.
since his youth he had retained a boyish enthusiasm for ships and sea power.
in 1907 he sent the entire u s navy by then second in strength only to britains royal navy on a grand fourteen month tour around the world as a demonstration of americas power.
at every port of c all down the atlantic coast of south america then up the pacific coast out to hawaii and down to new zealand and a ustralia the great white fleet of sixteen gleaming battleships received a rousing welcome.
the triumphal procession continued to japan china the philippines then egypt through the suez canal and across the mediterranean sea before steaming back to virginia in early 1909 just in time to close roosevelts presidency on a note of triumph.
roosevelts success in expanding u s power abroad would have mixed consequences however because underlying his imperialism was a militantly racist view of the world.
roosevelt and others believed that the world was made up of civilized societies such as the united states japan and the nations of europe and those they described as barbarous backward or impotent it was the responsibility of the civilized nations to exercise control of the barbarous peoples by force if necessary.
roosevelt called warfare the best way to promote the clear instinct for race selfishness and insisted that the most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages such belligerent self righteous bigotry defied american ideals of equality and would come back to haunt the united states.
tafts dollar diplomacy republican william howard taft who succeeded roosevelt as president in 1909 continued to promote americas economic interests abroad practicing what roosevelt called dollar diplomacy taft used the state department to help american companies and banks invest in foreign countries especially east asia and the less developed nations of latin america and the caribbean.
to ensure the stability of those investments taft did not hesitate to intervene in nations experiencing political roosevelts big stick diplomacy 931 and economic turmoil.
in 1909 he dispatched u s marines to support a revolution in nicaragua.
once the new government was formed secretary of state philander c knox helped u s banks negotiate loans to prop it up.
two years later taft again sent american troops to restore political stability.
this time they stayed for more than a decade.
wilsons interventionism in 1913 the new democratic president woodrow wilson attacked dollar diplomacy as a form of economic imperialism.
he promised to treat latin american nations on terms of equality and honor yet wilson along with william jennings bryan his secretary of state dispatched american military forces to latin america more often than taft and roosevelt combined.
wilson argued that the united states must intervene to stabilize weak governments in the western hemisphere to keep european nations from doing so.
during his two presidential terms wilson sent u s troops into cuba once panama twice and honduras five times.
in 1915 when the dominican republic refused to sign a treaty that would have given the united states a special role in governing the island nation wilson sent u s marines who established a military government and fought a nasty guerrilla war against anti american rebels.
that same year wilson intervened in haiti next door to the dominican republic.
he admitted that his actions were high handed but argued that they were justified because the necessity for exercising control there is immediate urgent imperative others disagreed.
as the new york times charged wilsons frequent interventions made tafts dollar diplomacy look like ten cent diplomacy the united states in mexico mexico was a much thornier problem.
in 1910 l ong suffering mexicans had revolted against the dictatorship of porfirio daz who had given foreign corporations a free rein in developing the nations economy.
after revolutionary armies occupied mexico city in 1911 the victorious rebels began squabbling among themselves.
the leader of the rebellion francisco madero was overthrown by his chief of staff general victoriano huerta who assumed power in early 1913 and then had madero and thirty other political opponents murdered.
a shocked president wilson refused to recognize a government of butchers huerta ignored wilsons criticism and established a dictatorship.
wilson decided that huerta must be removed and ordered u s warships to halt shipments of foreign weapons to the new government.
meanwhile several rival revolutionary mexican armies the largest of which was led by francisco pancho villa began trying to unseat huerta.
932 chapter 20 seizing an american e mpire 1865 1913 intervention in mexico u s marines enter veracruz mexico in 1914.
on april 9 1914 nine american sailors were arrested in tampico mexico while trying to buy supplies.
mexican officials quickly released them and apologized to the u s naval commander.
there the incident might have ended but the imperious u s admiral demanded that the mexicans fire a t wenty one gun salute to the american flag.
after they refused wilson sent u s troops ashore at veracruz on april 21 1914.
they occupied the city at a cost of 19 american lives at least 300 mexicans were killed or wounded.
the use of military force in mexico played out like many previous american interventions in the caribbean and central america.
congress readily supported the decision because american honor was supposedly at stake and wilson was sure that most mexicans would welcome u s intervention since his intentions were so unselfish but his strategy backfired.
instead of welcoming the americans as liberators mexicans viewed them as invaders.
for seven months the americans governed veracruz.
they left in late 1914 after huerta was overthrown by venustiano carranza.
still the troubles south of the border continued.
in 1916 rebel leader pancho villa launched raids into texas and new mexico in a deliberate attempt roosevelts big stick diplomacy 933 to trigger u s intervention.
on march 9 he and his men attacked columbus new mexico just three miles across the border.
villa shouted kill all the gringos as his army of 500 peasant revolutionaries burned the town and killed seventeen americans.
a furious wilson sent general john j pershing to mexico with 6 000 u s soldiers.
for nearly a year pershings troops chased villas army through the rugged mountains of northern mexico.
as pershing muttered its like trying to chase a rat in a cornfield in 1917 the american troops were ordered home.
the elusive villa meanwhile named his mule president wilson by then however wilson paid little notice for he was distracted by a much greater threat massive war in europe.
chapter review summary toward the new imperialism near the end of the nineteenth century the popular idea that america had a manifest destiny to expand its territory abroad combined with industrialists desire for new markets for their goods helped to fuel americas new imperialism white americans believed that their advanced industrial development proved their racial superiority and by conquering backward peoples the united states was simply enacting the theory of the survival of the fittest.
american evangelical protestants also thought they had a duty to christianize and uplift people throughout the world.
expansion in the pacific business leaders hoped to extend americas commercial reach across the pacific to exploit vast asian markets.
american planters in the kingdom of hawaii developed a thriving sugar industry which increased hawaiis commercial connections to the united states.
in 1894 hawaiis minority white population ousted the native hawaiian queen declared a republic and requested that hawaii be annexed by the united states.
in 1898 president william mckinley agreed to annex the hawaiian islands.
the spanish american war the war of 1898 when cubans revolted against spanish colonial rule in 1895 many americans supported their demand for independence.
yellow journalism publicizing the harsh spanish suppression of the revolt further aroused americans sympathy.
early in 1898 the publication of the de lme letter followed by the sinking the u s battleship maine in havana harbor helped propel america into war with spain.
the war lasted only 114 days.
under the treaty of paris ending the war cuba became independent and the united states annexed spains other caribbean possession puerto rico which it had occupied.
in the spanish colony of the philippine islands americas pacific naval fleet under commodore george dewey defeated the spanish fleet in the battle of manila bay.
consequences of victory a vicious guerrilla war followed in the philippines when filipinos rebelled against american control.
the rebellion was suppressed and president mckinley announced that the united states would annex the philippines.
the anti imperialist league and others argued that acquiring overseas territories violated american principles of self determination and independence.
but the imperialists won the debate and congress set up a government in the philippines and in puerto rico.
in the pacific region the united states also annexed hawaii guam wake island and some of the samoa islands during or shortly after the spanish american war the war of 1898.
in east asia secretary of state john hay promoted the open door policy of preserving chinas territorial integrity and equal access by all nations to trade with china.
theodore roosevelt and big stick diplomacy theodore roosevelt pursued an imperialist foreign policy that confirmed the united states new role as a world power.
he helped negotiate the treaty that ended the russo japanese war seized control of the panama canal and sent the navys fleet of new battleships around the world as a symbol of american might.
he also proclaimed the roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine asserting that the united states would intervene in latin america as necessary in order to prevent european intervention.
taft and wilsons interventionism abroad william h taft and woodrow wilson continued roosevelts pattern of intervening in the internal affairs of other nations especially in latin america and the caribbean.
what taft called dollar diplomacy involved the u s government fostering american investments in less developed nations and then using u s military force to protect those investments.
wilsons frustrations at the instability of the mexican government led him to intervene with american troops twice.
in both cases the presence of u s soldiers only deepened the resentment of yankee imperialism throughout latin america.
