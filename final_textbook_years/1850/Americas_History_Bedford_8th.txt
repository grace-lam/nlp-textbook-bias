the disillusioned liberals as a result of the depression and rising criticism of postwar activist government a revolt emerged in the republican party.
it was led by influential intellectuals journalists and businessmen who believed in classical liberalism free trade small government low property taxes and limitation of voting rights to men of education and property.
liberals responded to the massive increase in federal power during the civil war and reconstruction by urging a policy of laissez faire in which government let alone business and the economy.
in the postwar decades laissez faire advocates never succeeded in ending federal policies such as the protective tariff and national banking system chapter 16 but their arguments helped roll back reconstruction.
unable to block grants renomination for the presidency in 1872 the dissidents broke away and formed a new party under the name liberal republican.
their candidate was horace greeley longtime publisher of the new york tribune and veteran reformer and abolitionist.
the democrats still in disarray also nominated greeley notwithstanding his editorial diatribes against them.
a poor campaigner greeley was assailed so severely that as he said i hardly knew whether i was running for the presidency or the penitentiary grant won reelection overwhelmingly capturing 56 percent of the popular vote and every electoral vote.
yet liberal republicans had shifted the terms of debate.
the agenda they advanced smaller government restricted voting rights and reconciliation with ex confederates resonated with democrats who had long advocated limited government and were working to reclaim their status as a legitimate national party.
liberalism thus crossed party lines uniting disillusioned conservative republicans understand with democrats who denounced points of view government activism.

ion against reconstruction.
with unabashed elitism godkin and others claimed that freedmen were unfit to vote.
they denounced universal suffrage which can only mean in plain english the government of ignorance and vice the second grant administration gave liberals plenty of ammunition.
the most notorious scandal involved crdit mobilier a sham corporation set up by shareholders in the union pacific railroad to secure government grants at an enormous profit.
organizers of the scheme protected it from investigation by providing gifts of crdit mobilier stock to powerful members of congress.
another scandal involved the whiskey ring a network of liquor distillers and treasury agents who defrauded the government of millions of dollars of excise taxes on whiskey.
the ringleader was grants private secretary orville babcock.
others went to prison but grant stood by babcock possibly perjuring himself to save his secretary from jail.
the stench of scandal permeated the white house.
counterrevolution in the south while northerners became preoccupied with scandals and the shock of economic depression ex confederates seized power in the south.
most believed as northern liberals had also begun to argue that southern reconstruction governments were illegitimate regimes led by the planters ex confederates staged a massive insurgency to take back the south.
when they could win at the ballot box southern democrats took that route.
they got ex confederate voting rights restored and campaigned against negro rule but when force was necessary southern democrats used it.
present day americans witnessing political violence in other countries seldom remember that our own history includes the overthrow of elected governments by paramilitary groups.
but this is exactly how reconstruction ended in many parts of the south.
ex confederates terrorized republicans especially in districts with large proportions of black voters.
black political leaders were shot hanged beaten to death and in one case even beheaded.
many republicans both black and white went into hiding or fled for their lives.
southern democrats called this violent process redemption a heroic name that still sticks today even though this seizure of power was murderous and undemocratic.
no one looms larger in this bloody story than nathan bedford forrest a decorated confederate general.
born in poverty in 1821 forrest had risen to become a big time slave trader and mississippi planter.
a fiery secessionist forrest had formed a tennessee chapter 15 confederate cavalry regiment fought bravely at the battle of shiloh and won fame as a daring raider.
on april 12 1864 his troops perpetrated one of the wars worst atrocities the massacre at fort pillow tennessee of black union soldiers who were trying to surrender.
after the civil war forrests determination to uphold white supremacy altered the course of reconstruction.
william g brownlow elected as tennessees republican governor in 1865 was a tough man a former prisoner of the confederates who was not shy about calling his enemies to account.
ex confederates struck back with a campaign of terror targeting especially brownlows black supporters.
amid the mayhem ex confederates formed the first ku klux klan group in late 1865 or early 1866.
as it proliferated across the state the klan turned to forrest who had been trying unsuccessfully to rebuild his prewar fortune.
late in 1866 at a secret meeting in nashville forrest donned the robes of grand wizard.
his activities are mostly cloaked in mystery but there is no mistake about his goals the klan would strike blows against the despised republican government of tennessee.
in many towns the klan became virtually identical to the democratic party.
klan members including forrest dominated tennessees delegation to the democratic national convention of 1868.
at home the klan unleashed a murderous campaign of terror and though governor brownlow responded resolutely in the end republicans cracked.
the klan and similar groups organized under such names as the white league and knights of the white camelia arose in other states.
vigilantes burned freedmens schools beat teachers attacked republican gatherings and murdered political opponents.
by 1870 democrats had seized power in georgia and north carolina and were making headway across the south.
once they took power they slashed property taxes and passed other laws favorable to landowners.
they terminated reconstruction programs and cut funding for schools especially those teaching black students.
in responding to the klan between 1869 and 1871 the federal government showed it could still exert power effectively in the south.
determined to end klan violence congress held extensive hearings and in 1870 passed laws designed to protect freedmens rights under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
these so called enforcement laws authorized federal prosecutions military intervention and martial law to suppress terrorist activity.
grants administration made full use of these new powers.
in south carolina where the klan was deeply entrenched u s troops occupied reconstruction 1865 1877 ku klux klan mask white supremacists of the 1870s organized under many names and wore many costumes not simply or often the white cone shaped hats that were made famous later in the 1920s when the klan underwent a nationwide resurgence.
few masks from the 1870s have survived.
the horns and fangs on this one from north carolina suggest how klan members sought to strike terror in their victims while also hiding their own identities.
north carolina museum of history.
nine counties made hundreds of arrests and drove as many as 2 000 klansmen from the state.
this assault on the klan while raising the spirits of southern republicans revealed how dependent they were on washington.
no such law could be enforced by state authority one mississippi republican observed the local power being too weak but northern republicans were growing disillusioned with reconstruction while in the south prosecuting klansmen was an uphill battle against all white juries and unsympathetic federal judges.
after 1872 prosecutions dropped off.
in the meantime the texas government fell to the democrats in 1873 and alabama and arkansas in 1874.
reconstruction rolled back as divided republicans debated how to respond voters in the congressional election of 1874 handed them one of the most stunning defeats of the nineteenth century.
responding especially to the severe depression that gripped the nation they removed almost half of the partys 199 representatives in the house.
democrats who had held 88 seats now commanded an overwhelming majority of 182.
the election is not merely part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 a victory but a revolution exulted a democratic newspaper in new york.
after 1874 with democrats in control of the house republicans who tried to shore up their southern wing had limited options.
bowing to election results the grant administration began to reject southern republicans appeals for aid.
events in mississippi showed the outcome.
as state elections neared there in 1875 paramilitary groups such as the red shirts operated openly.
mississippis republican governor adelbert ames a union veteran from maine appealed for u s troops but grant refused.
the whole public are tired out with these annual autumnal outbreaks in the south complained a grant official who told southern republicans that they were responsible for their own fate.
facing a rising tide of brutal murders governor ames realizing that only further bloodshed could result urged his allies to give up the fight.
brandishing guns and stuffing ballot boxes democratic redeemers swept the 1875 elections and took control of mississippi.
by 1876 reconstruction was largely over.
republican governments backed by token u s military units remained in only three southern states louisiana south carolina and florida.
elsewhere former confederates and their allies took power.
the supreme court rejects equal rights though ex confederates seized power in southern states new landmark constitutional amendments and federal laws remained in force.
if the supreme court had left these intact subsequent generations of civil rights advocates could have used the federal courts to combat racial discrimination and violence.
instead the court closed off this avenue for the pursuit of justice just as it dashed the hopes of womens rights advocates.
as early as 1873 in a group of decisions known collectively as the slaughter house cases the court began to undercut the power of the fourteenth amendment.
in this case and a related ruling u s v cruikshank 1876 the justices argued that the fourteenth amendment offered only a few rather trivial federal protections to citizens such as access to navigable waterways.
in cruikshank a case that emerged from a gruesome killing of african american farmers by ex confederates in colfax louisiana followed by a democratic political coup the court ruled that voting rights remained a state matter unless the state itself violated those rights.
if former slaves rights were violated by individuals or private groups including the klan that lay beyond federal jurisdiction.
the fourteenth amendment did not protect citizens from armed vigilantes even when those vigilantes seized political power.
the court thus gutted the fourteenth amendment.
in the civil rights cases 1883 the justices also struck down the civil rights act of 1875 paving the way for later decisions that sanctioned segregation.
the impact of these decisions endured well into the twentieth century.
the political crisis of 1877 after the grim election results of 1874 republicans faced a major battle in the presidential election of 1876.
abandoning grant they nominated rutherford b hayes a former union general who was untainted by corruption and even more important hailed from the key swing state of ohio.
hayess democratic opponent was new york governor samuel j tilden a wall street lawyer with a reform reputation.
tilden favored home rule for the south but so more discreetly did hayes.
with enforcement on the wane reconstruction did not figure prominently in the campaign and little was said about the states still led by reconstruction governments florida south carolina and louisiana.
once returns started coming in on election night however those states loomed large.
tilden led in the popular vote and seemed headed for victory until sleepless politicians at republican headquarters realized that the electoral vote stood at 184 to 165 with the 20 votes from florida south carolina and louisiana still uncertain.
if hayes took those votes he would win by a margin of 1.
citing ample evidence of democratic fraud and intimidation republican officials certified all three states for hayes.
redeemer democrats who had taken over the states governments submitted their own electoral votes for tilden.
when congress met in early 1877 it confronted two sets of electoral votes from those states.
the constitution does not provide for such a contingency.
all it says is that the president of the senate in 1877 a republican opens the electoral certificates before the house democratic and the senate republican and the votes shall then be counted article 2 section 1.
suspense gripped the country.
there was talk of inside deals or a new election even a violent coup.
finally congress appointed an electoral commission to settle the question.
the commission included seven republicans seven democrats and as the deciding member david davis a supreme court justice not known to have fixed party loyalties.
davis however disqualified himself by accepting an illinois senate seat.
he was replaced by republican justice joseph p bradley and by a vote of 8 to 7 on party lines the commission awarded the election to hayes.
in the house of representatives outraged democrats vowed to stall the final count of electoral votes so chapter 15 reconstruction 1865 1877 grantism president grant was lampooned on both sides of the atlantic for the problems of his scandal ridden administration.
the british magazine puck shows grant barely defying gravity to keep himself and his corrupt subordinates aloft and out of jail.
to a great extent however the hero of the union army remained personally popular at home and abroad.
the british public welcomed grant with admiration on his triumphant foreign tour in 1877.

as to prevent hayess inauguration on march 4.
but in the end they went along partly because tilden himself urged that they do so.
hayes had publicly indicated his desire to offer substantial patronage to the south including federal funds for education and internal improvements.
he promised a complete change of men and policy naively hoping at the same time that he could count on support from old line southern whigs and protect black voting rights.
hayes was inaugurated on schedule.
he expressed hope in his inaugural address that the federal government could serve the interests of both races carefully and equally but setting aside the u s troops who were serving on border duty in texas only 3 000 union soldiers remained in the south.
as soon as the new president ordered them back to their barracks the last republican administrations in the south collapsed.
reconstruction had ended.
lasting legacies in the short run the political events of 1877 had little impact on most southerners.
much of the work of redemption had already been done.
what mattered thinking like a historian the souths lost cause after reconstruction ended many white southerners celebrated the confederacy as a heroic lost cause through organizations such as the sons of confederate veterans and united daughters of the confederacy they profoundly influenced the nations memories of slavery the civil war and reconstruction.

matthew page andrewss the women of the south in war times approved by the udc was a popular textbook for decades in schools throughout the south.
the southern people of the old regime have been pictured as engaged primarily in a protracted struggle for the maintenance of negro slavery.
fighting on behalf of slavery was as far from the minds of these americans as going to war in order to free the slaves was from the purpose of abraham lincoln whose sole object frequently expressed by him was to preserve the union.

to what extent was this true based on the evidence here.
what do these documents suggest about the influence of the lost cause and also the limitations and challenges it faced.
what do they tell us about the legacies of reconstruction more broadly.
part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 was the long slow decline of radical republican power and the corresponding rise of democrats in the south and nationally.
it was obvious that so called redeemers in the south had assumed power through violence.
but many americans including prominent classical liberals who shaped public opinion believed the democrats had overthrown corrupt illegitimate governments thus the end justified the means.
after 1874 those who deplored the results had little political traction.
the only remaining question was how far reconstruction would be rolled back.
the south never went back to the antebellum status quo.
sharecropping for all its flaws and injustices was not slavery.
freedmen and freedwomen managed to resist gang labor and work on their own terms.
they also established their right to marry read and write worship as they pleased and travel in search of a better life rights that were not easily revoked.
across the south black farmers overcame great odds to buy and work their own land.
african american businessmen built thriving enterprises.
black churches and community groups sustained networks of mutual aid.
parents sacrificed to send their children to school and a few proudly watched their sons and daughters graduate from college.
reconstruction had also shaken if not fully overturned the legal and political framework that had made the united states a white mans country.
this was a stunning achievement and though hostile courts and political opponents undercut it no one ever repealed the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
they remained in the constitution and the civil rights movement of the twentieth century would return and build on this framework chapter 26.
still in the final reckoning reconstruction failed.
the majority of freedpeople remained in poverty and by the late 1870s their political rights were also eroding.
vocal advocates of smaller government argued that reconstruction had been a mistake pressured by economic hardship northern voters abandoned their southern unionist allies.
one of the enduring legacies of this process was the way later americans remembered reconstruction itself.
after redemption generations of schoolchildren were taught that ignorant lazy blacks and corrupt whites had imposed illegitimate reconstruction regimes on the south.
white southerners won national support for their celebration of a heroic confederacy thinking like a historian p 502.

ex confederates had lost the war but they won control over the nations memory of reconstruction.
meanwhile though their programs failed in the south republicans carried their nation building project into the west where their policies helped consolidate a continental empire.
there the federal power that had secured emancipation created the conditions for the united states to become an industrial power and a major leader on the world stage.
summary postwar republicans faced two tasks restoring rebellious states to the union and defining the role of emancipated slaves.
after lincolns assassination his successor andrew johnson hostile to congress unilaterally offered the south easy terms for reentering the union.
exploiting this opportunity southerners adopted oppressive black codes and put ex confederates back in power.
congress impeached johnson and though failing to convict him seized the initiative and placed the south under military rule.
in this second or radical phase of reconstruction republican state governments tried to transform the souths economic and social institutions.
congress passed innovative civil rights acts and funded new agencies like the freedmens bureau.
the fourteenth amendment defined u s citizenship and asserted that states could no longer supersede it and the fifteenth amendment gave voting rights to formerly enslaved men.
debate over this amendment precipitated a split among womens rights advocates since women did not win inclusion.
freedmen found that their goals conflicted with those of republican leaders who counted on cotton to fuel economic growth.
like southern landowners national lawmakers envisioned former slaves as wageworkers while freedmen wanted their own land.
sharecropping which satisfied no one completely emerged as a compromise suited to the needs of the cotton market and an impoverished credit starved region.
chapter 15 nothing could reconcile ex confederates to republican government and they staged a violent counterrevolution in the name of white supremacy and redemption meanwhile struck by a massive economic depression northern voters handed republicans a crushing defeat in the election of 1874.
by 1876 reconstruction was dead.
rutherford b hayess narrow chapter review victory in the presidential election of that year resulted in withdrawal of the last union troops from the south.
a series of supreme court decisions also undermined the fourteenth amendment and civil rights laws setting up legal parameters through which over the long term disenfranchisement and segregation would flourish.

these tariff revenues gave u s manufacturers who did not pay the fees a competitive advantage in americas vast domestic market.
the economic depression that began in 1873 set limits on republicans economic ambitions just as it hindered their reconstruction plans in the south.
but their policies continued to shape the economy.
though some historians argue that the late nineteenth century was an era of laissez faire or unrestrained capitalism in which government sat passively by the industrial united states was actually the product of a massive public private partnership in which government played critical roles.
the new union and the world the united states emerged from the civil war with new leverage in its negotiation with european countries especially great britain whose navy dominated the seas.
britain which had allowed confederate raiding ships such as css alabama to be built in its shipyards submitted afterward to arbitration and paid the united states 15 5 million in damages.
flush with victory many americans expected more british and spanish territories to drop into the unions lap.
senator charles sumner proposed in fact that britain settle the alabama claims by handing over canada.
such dreams were a logical extension of pre civil war conquests especially in the mexican war.
with the coasts now linked by rail merchants and manufacturers looked across the pacific hungry for trade with asia.
americans had already established a dominant presence in hawaii where u s whalers and merchant ships stopped for food and repairs.
with the advent of steam powered vessels both the u s navy and private shippers wanted more refueling points in the caribbean and pacific.
even before the civil war these commercial aims had prompted the u s government to force japan to open trade.
for centuries since unpleasant encounters with portuguese traders in the 1600s japanese leaders had adhered to a policy of strict isolation.
americans who wanted coal stations in japan argued that trade would extend what one missionary called commerce knowledge and christianity with their multiplied blessings whether or not japan wanted these blessings was irrelevant.
in 1854 commodore matthew perry succeeded in getting japanese officials to sign the treaty of kanagawa allowing u s ships to refuel at two ports.
by 1858 america and japan had commenced trade and a u s consul took up residence in japans capital edo now known as tokyo.
union victory also increased u s economic influence in latin america.
while the united states was preoccupied with its internal war france had deposed mexicos government and installed an emperor.
on may 5 1867 mexico overthrew the french invaders and executed emperor maximilian.
but while mexico regained independence it lay open to the economic designs of its increasingly powerful northern neighbor.
a new model emerged for asserting u s power in latin america and asia not by direct conquest but through trade.
the architect of this vision was william seward secretary of state from 1861 to 1869 under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson.
a new yorker of grand ambition and ego seward believed like many contemporaries that asia would become the chief theatre of world events and that commerce there was key to americas prosperity.
he urged the senate to purchase sites in both the pacific and the caribbean for naval bases and refueling stations.
when japan changed policy and tried to close its ports to foreigners seward dispatched u s naval vessels to join those of britain france and the netherlands in reopening trade by force.
at the same time seward urged annexation of hawaii.
he also predicted that the chapter 16 conquering a continent 1854 1890 an american merchant ship in yokohama harbor 1861 after the united states forcibly opened japan to foreign trade in 1854 american and european ships and visitors became a familiar sight in the port of yokohama.

united states would one day claim the philippines and build a panama canal.
sewards short term achievements were modest.
exhausted by civil war americans had little enthusiasm for further military exploits.
seward achieved only two significant victories.
in 1868 he secured congressional approval for the burlingame treaty with china which guaranteed the rights of u s missionaries in china and set official terms for the emigration of chinese laborers some of whom were already clearing farmland and building railroads in the west.
that same year seward negotiated the purchase of alaska from russia.
after the senate approved the deal seward waxed poetic our nation with united interests blest not now content to poise shall sway the rest abroad our empire shall no limits know but like the sea in endless circles flow.
many americans scoffed at the purchase of alaska a frigid arctic tract that skeptics nicknamed sewards icebox but the secretary of state mapped out a path his republican successors would follow thirty years later in an aggressive bid for global power.
integrating the national economy closer to home republicans focused on transportation infrastructure.
railroad development in the united states began well before the civil war with the first locomotives arriving from britain in the early 1830s.
unlike canals or roads railroads offered the promise of year round all weather service.
locomotives could run in the dark and never needed to rest except to take on coal and water.
steam engines crossed high mountains and rocky gorges where pack animals could find no fodder and canals could never reach.
west of the mississippi railroads opened vast regions for farming trade and tourism.
a transcontinental railroad executive was only half joking when he said the west is purely a railroad enterprise governments could choose to build and operate railroads themselves or promote construction by part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 building the central pacific railroad in 1865 chinese workers had labored to build the 1 100 foot long 90 foothigh trestle over the divide between the american and bear rivers at secret town in the sierra nevada mountains.
in 1877 the chinese workers shown in this photograph by carleton watkins were again at work on the site burying the trestle to avoid replacement of the aging timbers which had become a fire hazard.

private companies.
unlike most european countries the united states chose the private approach.
the federal government however provided essential loans subsidies and grants of public land.
states and localities also lured railroads with offers of financial aid mainly by buying railroad bonds.
without this aid rail networks would have grown much more slowly and would probably have concentrated in urban regions.
with it railroads enjoyed an enormous and reckless boom.
by 1900 virtually no corner of the country lacked rail service map 16 1.
at the same time u s railroads built across the border into mexico america compared p 514.
railroad companies transformed american capitalism.
they adopted a legal form of organization the corporation that enabled them to raise private capital in prodigious amounts.
in earlier decades state legislatures had chartered corporations for specific public purposes binding these creations to government goals and oversight.
but over the course of the nineteenth century legislatures gradually began to allow any business to become a corporation by simply applying for a state charter.
among the first corporations to become large interstate enterprises private railroads were much freer than earlier companies to do as they pleased.
after the civil war they received lavish public aid with few strings attached.
their position was like that of american banks in late 2008 after the big federal bailout even critics acknowledged that public aid to these giant companies was good for the economy but they observed that it also lent government support to fabulous accumulations of private wealth.
tariffs and economic growth along with the transformative power of railroads republicans protective tariffs helped build other u s industries including textiles and steel in the northeast and midwest and through tariffs on imported sugar and wool sugar beet farming and sheep ranching in the west.
tariffs also funded government itself.

the tremendous burst of construction during the last twenty years of that period essentially completed the nations rail network although there would be additional expansion for the next two decades.
the main areas of growth were in the south and in lands west of the mississippi.
time zones introduced by the railroad companies in 1883 are marked by the gray lines.
not levy income taxes tariffs provided the bulk of treasury revenue.
the civil war had left the union with a staggering debt of 2 8 billion.
tariff income erased that debt and by the 1880s generated huge budget surpluses a circumstance hard to imagine today.
as reconstruction faltered tariffs came under political fire.
democrats argued that tariffs taxed american consumers by denying them access to lowcost imported goods and forcing them to pay subsidies to u s manufacturers.
republicans claimed conversely that tariffs benefitted workers because they created jobs blocked low wage foreign competition and safeguarded america from the kind of industrial poverty that had arisen in europe.
according to this argument tariffs helped american men earn enough to support their families wives could devote themselves to homemaking and children could go to school not the factory.
for protectionist republicans high tariffs were akin to the abolition of slavery they protected and uplifted the most vulnerable workers.
in these fierce debates both sides were partly right.
protective tariffs did play a powerful role in economic growth.
they helped transform the united states into a global industrial power.
eventually though even protectionist republicans had to admit that democrats had a point tariffs had not prevented industrial poverty in the united states.
corporations accumulated massive benefits from tariffs but failed to pass them along to workers who often toiled long hours for low wages.
furthermore tariffs helped foster trusts corporations that dominated whole sectors of the economy and wielded near monopoly power.
the rise of large private corporations and trusts generated enduring political problems.

state legislatures did pass hundreds of regulatory laws after the civil war but interstate companies challenged them in federal courts.
in munn v illinois 1877 the supreme court affirmed that states could regulate key businesses such as railroads and grain elevators that were clothed in the public interest however the justices feared that too many state and local regulations would impede business and fragment the national marketplace.
starting in the 1870s they interpreted the due process clause of the new fourteenth amendment which dictated that no state could deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law as shielding corporations from excessive regulation.
ironically the court refused to use the same amendment to protect the rights of african americans.
chapter 16 in the southwest as well federal courts promoted economic development at the expense of racial justice.
though the united states had taken control of new mexico and arizona after the mexican war much land remained afterward in the hands of mexican farmers and ranchers.
many lived as penes under longstanding agreements with landowners who held large tracts originally granted by the spanish crown.
the post civil war years brought railroads and an influx of land hungry anglos.
new mexicos governor reported indignantly that mexican shepherds were often asked to leave their ranges by a cowboy or cattle herder with a brace of pistols at his belt and a winchester in his hands existing land claims were so complex that congress eventually set up a special court to rule on land titles.
between 1891 and 1904 the court invalidated most traditional claims including those of many new mexico ejidos or villages owned collectively by their communities.
mexican americans lost about 64 percent of the contested lands.
in addition much land was sold or appropriated through legal machinations like those of a notorious cabal of politicians and lawyers known as the santa fe ring.
the result was displacement of thousands of mexican american villagers and farmers.
some found work as railroad builders or mine workers others moving into the sparse high country of the sierras and rockies where cattle could not survive developed sheep raising into a major enterprise.
silver and gold in an era of nation building u s and european policymakers sought new ways to rationalize markets.
industrializing nations for example tried to develop an international system of standard measurements and even a unified currency.
though these proposals failed as each nation succumbed to self interest governments did increasingly agree that for scientific reasons money should be based on gold which was thought to have an intrinsic worth above other metals.
great britain had long held to the gold standard meaning that paper notes from the bank of england could be backed by gold held in the banks vaults.
during the 1870s and 1880s the united states germany france and other countries also converted to gold.
beforehand these nations had been on a bimetallic standard they issued both gold and silver coins with respective weights fixed at a relative value.
the united states switched to the gold standard in part because treasury officials and financiers were watching developments out west.
geologists accurately predicted the discovery of immense silver deposits such as nevadas comstock lode without comparable new gold strikes.
a massive influx of silver would clearly upset the long conquering a continent 1854 1890 standing ratio.
thus with a law identify causes that became infamous to later what federal policies critics as the crime of 1873 contributed to the rise congress chose gold.
it directed of americas industrial the u s treasury to cease minting economy and what were silver dollars and over a six their results.
year period retire civil war era greenbacks paper dollars and replace them with notes from an expanded system of national banks.
after this process was complete in 1879 the treasury exchanged these notes for gold on request.
advocates of bimetallism did achieve one small victory the bland allison act of 1878 required the u s mint to coin a modest amount of silver.
by adopting the gold standard republican policymakers sharply limited the nations money supply to the level of available gold.
the amount of money circulating in the united states had been 30 35 per person in 1865 by 1880 it fell to only 19 36 per person.
today few economists would sanction such a plan especially for an economy growing at breakneck speed.
they would recommend instead increasing money supplies to keep pace with development.
but at the time policymakers remembered rampant antebellum speculation and the hardships of inflation during the civil war.
the united states as a developing country also needed to attract investment capital from britain belgium and other european nations that were on the gold standard.
making it easy to exchange u s bonds and currency for gold encouraged european investors to send their money to the united states.
republican policies fostered exuberant growth and a breathtakingly rapid integration of the economy.
railroads and telegraphs tied the nation together.
u s manufacturers amassed staggering amounts of capital and built corporations of national and even global scope.
with its immense integrated marketplace of workers consumers raw materials and finished products the united states was poised to become a mighty industrial power.
incorporating the west republicans wanted farms as well as factories.

part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 the homestead act 1862 gave 160 acres of federal land to any applicant who occupied and improved the property.
republicans hoped the bill would help build up the interior west which was inhabited by indian peoples but remained empty on u s government survey maps.
implementing this plan required innovative policies.
the same year it passed the homestead act congress also created the federal department of agriculture and through the morrill act set aside 140 million federal acres that states could sell to raise money for public universities.
the goal of these land grant colleges was to broaden educational opportunities and foster technical and scientific expertise.
after the civil war congress also funded a series of geological surveys dispatching u s army officers scientists and photographers to chart unknown western terrain and catalog resources.
to a large extent these policies succeeded in incorporating lands west of the mississippi.
the united states began to exploit its western empire for minerals lumber and other raw materials.
but for ordinary americans who went west dreams often outran reality.
well financed corporations not individual prospectors reaped most of the profits from western mines while the great plains environment proved resistant to ranching and farming.
mining empires in the late 1850s as easy pickings in the california gold rush diminished prospectors scattered in hopes of finding riches elsewhere.
they found gold at many sites including nevada the colorado rockies and south dakotas black hills map 16 3.
as news of each strike spread remote areas turned overnight into mob scenes of prospectors traders prostitutes and saloon keepers.
at community meetings white prospectors made their own laws often using them as an instrument for excluding mexicans chinese and blacks.

the technology was simple using high pressure streams of water to wash away hillsides of gold bearing soil.
although building the reservoirs piping systems and sluices cost money the profits from hydraulic mining helped transform western mining into big business.
but as this daguerreotype suggests the large scale on which hydraulic mining was done wreaked large scale havoc on the environment.

americans idealized the notion of the lone hardy mining prospector with his pan and his mule but digging into deep veins of underground ore required big money.
consortiums of powerful investors bringing engineers and advanced equipment generally extracted the most wealth.
this was the case for the new york trading firm phelps dodge which invested in massive copper mines and smelting operations on both sides of the u s mexico border.
the mines created jobs in new towns like bisbee and morenci arizona but with dangerous conditions and low pay especially for those who received the segregated mexican wage anglos testified one mexican mine worker occupied decorous residences.

chapter 16 conquering a continent 1854 1890 advertisement for silver pine healing oil c 1880s conquest of the great plains was made possible in part by the invention of barbed wire which could cheaply enclose wide areas even where trees and wood were scarce.
inventor joseph glidden received a patent in 1874 for the most familiar form of barbed wire.
his wire proved durable and glidden invented machinery to mass produce it while his business associates skillfully promoted the product to farmers in the west.
by 1880 gliddens company sold 80 million pounds of barbed wire a year.
this image shows however that the new thorny fence also had a downside.
other businessmen profited by healing the injuries that barbed wire caused to valuable animals.

with this incentive ranchers inaugurated the long drive hiring cowboys to herd cattle hundreds of miles north to the new rail lines which soon extended into kansas.
at abilene and dodge city kansas ranchers sold their longhorns and trail weary cowboys crowded into saloons.

further hit by a severe drought the following summer the cattle boom collapsed.
thanks to new strategies however cattle ranching survived and became part of the integrated national economy.
as railroads reached texas and ranchers there abandoned the long drive the invention of barbed wire which enabled ranchers and farmers to fence large areas cheaply and easily on the plains where wood was scarce and expensive made it easier for northern cattlemen to fence small areas and feed animals on hay.

hoping frontier land values would appreciate rapidly many farmers planned to profit from selling acres as much as or more than from their crops.
in boom times many rushed into debt to acquire more land and better equipment.
all these enthusiasms for cash crops land speculation borrowed money and new technology bore witness to the conviction that farming was as one agricultural journal remarked a business like all other business women in the west early miners lumbermen and cowboys were overwhelmingly male but homesteading was a family affair.
the success of a farm depended on the work of wives and children who tended the garden and animals preserved food and helped out at harvest time.
some women struck out on their own a study of north dakota found between 5 and 20 percent of homestead claims filed by single women often working land adjacent to that of sisters brothers and parents.
family members thus supported one another in the difficult work of farming while easing the loneliness many newcomers felt.
looking back with pride on her homesteading days one dakota woman said simply it was a place to stay and it was mine while promoting farms in the west republicans clashed with the distinctive religious group that had chapter 16 already settled utah mormons or members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints lds.
after suffering persecution in missouri and illinois mormons had moved west to utah in the 1840s attracting many working class converts from england as well.
most americans at the time were deeply hostile to mormonism especially the lds practice of plural marriage sanctioned by church founder joseph smith through which some mormon men married more than one wife.
mormons had their own complex view of womens role illustrated by the career of mormon leader emmeline wells.
born in new hampshire emmeline converted to mormonism at age thirteen along with her mother and joined the exodus to utah in 1848.
after her first husband abandoned her when he left the church emmeline became the seventh wife of church elder daniel wells.
in 1870 due in part to organized pressure from wells and other mormon women the utah legislature granted full voting rights to women becoming the second u s territory to do so after wyoming in 1869.
the measure increased lds control since most utah women were mormons while non mormons in mining camps were predominantly male.
it also recognized the central role of women in mormon life.

clearly 160 acre homesteads were the wrong size for the west farmers needed either small irrigated plots or immense tracts for dry farming which involved deep planting to bring subsoil moisture to the roots and quick harrowing after rainfalls to slow evaporation.
dry farming developed most fully on huge corporate farms in the red river valley of north dakota.
but even family farms the norm elsewhere could not survive on less than 300 acres of grain.
crop prices were too low and the climate too unpredictable to allow farmers to get by on less.
in this struggle settlers regarded themselves as natures conquerors striving as one pioneer remarked to get the land subdued and the wilde nature out of it much about its wilde nature was hidden to the newcomers.
they did not know that destroying biodiversity which was what farming the plains really meant opened pathways for exotic destructive pests and weeds and that removing native grasses left the soil vulnerable to erosion.
by the turn of the twentieth century about half the nations cattle and sheep one third of its cereal crops and nearly three fifths of its wheat came from the great plains.
but in the drier parts of the region it was not a sustainable achievement.
this renowned breadbasket was later revealed to be in the words of one historian the largest longest run agricultural and environmental miscalculation in american history john wesley powell a one armed union veteran predicted the catastrophe from an early date.
powell employed by the new u s geological survey led a famous expedition in the west in which his team navigated the rapids of the colorado river through the grand canyon in wooden boats.
in his report on the american voices womens rights in the west in 1870 utahs territorial legislature granted voting rights to women.
the decision was a shock to advocates of womens suffrage in the east they expected their first big victories would come in new england.
furthermore utah was overwhelmingly peopled by mormons members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints lds.
critics saw mormonism as a harshly patriarchal religion.
they especially loathed the mormon practice of plural marriage in which some mormon men took more than one wife.
most easterners thought this practice was barbaric and demeaning to women.
over the next two decades republicans pressured mormons to abolish plural marriage.
they also disenfranchised mormon women and required men to take an anti polygamy oath congress refused to admit utah as a state.
only after 1890 when the lds church officially abolished plural marriage was utah statehood possible.
in 1896 when utah became a state womens voting rights were finally reinstated.
fanny stenhouse expos of polygamy a ladys life among the mormons 1872 an englishwoman who converted to the faith and moved to utah stenhouse became disillusioned and published her book to criticize the practice of mormon polygamy.
how little do the mormon men of utah know what it is in the truest sense to have a wife though they have so many wives after their own fashion.
almost imperceptibly to the husband and even the wife herself a barrier rises between them the very day that he marries another woman.
it matters not how much she believes in the doctrine of plural marriages or how willing she may be to submit to it the fact remains the same.
the estrangement begins by her trying to hide from him all secret sorrow for she feels that what has been can not be undone now and she says i cannot change it neither would i if i could because it is the will of god and i must bear it besides what good will it do to worry my husband with all my feelings.
a man may have a dozen wives but from the whole of them combined he will not receive as much real love and devotion as he might from one alone if he had made her feel that she had his undivided affection and confidence.
how terribly these men deceive themselves.
when peace or rather quiet reigns in their homes they think that the spirit of god is there.
but it is not so.
it is a calm not like the gentle silence of sleep but as the horrible stillness of death the death of the hearts best affections and all that is worth calling love.
all true love has fled and indifference has taken its place.
the very children feel it.
what do they what can they care about their fathers.
they seldom see them.
whatever in the providence of god may be the action of congress toward utah if the word of a feeble woman can be listened to let me respectfully ask the honorable senators and representatives of the united states that in the abolition of polygamy if such should be the decree of the nation let no compromise be made where subtlety can bind the woman now living in polygamy to remain in that condition.

eliza snow harriet cook young phoebe woodruff a defense of plural marriage the vast majority of mormon women defended their faith and the practice of plural marriage.
the statements by eliza snow harriet cook young and phoebe woodruff below were made at a public protest meeting in salt lake city in 1870.
lds women pointed proudly to their new suffrage rights as proof of their religions just treatment of women.
why did mormons who dominated the utah legislature give women full voting rights.
in part they sought to protect their church by increasing mormon voting power most of the non mormons were single men who worked on ranches or in mining camps.
but the lds church also celebrated womens central role in the family and community.
some women achieved prominence as midwives teachers and professionals.
eliza snow our enemies pretend that in utah woman is held in a state of vassalage that she does not act from choice but by coercion that we would even prefer life elsewhere were it possible for us to make our escape.
what nonsense.
we all know that if we wished we could leave at any time either go singly or to rise en masse and there is no power here that could or would wish to prevent us.
i will now ask this assemblage of intelligent ladies do you know of anyplace on the face of the earth where woman has more liberty and where she enjoys such high and glorious privileges as she does here as a latter day saint.
the very idea of woman here in a state of slavery is a burlesque on good common sense.
harriet cook young wherever monogamy reigns adultery prostitution and foeticide directly or indirectly are its concomitants.
the women of utah comprehend this and they see in the principle of plurality of wives the only safeguard against adultery prostitution and the reckless waste of pre natal life practiced throughout the land.
phoebe woodruff god has revealed unto us the law of the patriarchal order of marriage and commanded us to obey it.
we are sealed to our husbands for time and eternity that we may dwell with them and our children in the world to come which guarantees unto us the greatest blessing for which we are created.
if the rulers of the nation will so far depart from the spirit and letter of our glorious constitution as to deprive our prophets apostles and elders of citizenship and imprison them for obeying this law let them grant this our last request to make their prisons large enough to hold their wives for where they go we will go also.

womans work in monogamy and polygamy is essentially one and the same that of planting her feet on the solid ground of self support.
there is and can be no salvation for womanhood but in the possession of power over her own subsistence.
the saddest feature here is that there really is nothing by which these women can earn an independent livelihood for themselves and children.

part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 lands of the arid region of the united states 1879 powell told congress bluntly that 160 acre homesteads would not work in dry regions.
impressed with the success of mormon irrigation projects in utah powell urged the united states to follow their model.
he proposed that the government develop the wests water resources building dams and canals and organizing landowners into local districts to operate them.
doubting that rugged individualism would succeed in the west powell proposed massive cooperation under government control.
after heated debate congress rejected powells plan.
critics accused him of playing into the hands of large ranching corporations boosters were not yet willing to give up the dream of small homesteads.
but powell turned out to be right.
though environmental historians do not always agree with powells identify causes proposed solutions they point to what factors led to the his report on arid lands as a creation of the first cogent critique of what went national parks.
wrong on the great plains.
later federal funding paid for dams and canals that supported intensive agriculture in many parts of the west.
the first national park powell was not the only one rethinking land use.
the wests incorporation into the national marketplace occurred with such speed that some americans began to fear rampant overdevelopment.
perhaps the federal government should not sell off all its public land but instead hold and manage some of it.
amid the heady initiatives of reconstruction congress began to preserve sites of unusual natural splendor.
as early as 1864 congress gave 10 square miles of the yosemite valley to california for public use resort and recreation in 1890 yosemite reverted to federal control.
in 1872 it set aside 2 million acres of wyomings yellowstone valley as the worlds first national park preserved as a public holding it would serve as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people the yo hamite falls 1855 this is one of the earliest artistic renderings of the yosemite valley drawn in fact before the place came to be called yosemite.

in this romantic lithograph one can already see the grandeur of the west that yosemite came to represent for americans.

chapter 16 railroad tourism which developed side by side with other western industries was an important motive for the creation of yellowstone national park.
the northern pacific railroad lobbied congress vigorously to get the park established.
soon luxury pullman cars ushered visitors to yellowstones hotel operated by the railroad itself.
but creation of the park was fraught with complications.
since no one knew exactly what a national park was or how to operate it the u s army was dispatched to take charge only in the early 1900s when congress established many more parks in the west did consistent management policies emerge.
in the meantime soldiers spent much of their time arresting native peoples who sought to hunt on yellowstone lands.
the creation of yellowstone was an important step toward an ethic of respect for land and wildlife.
so was the 1871 creation of a u s.
fisheries commission which made recommendations to stem the decline in wild fish by the 1930s it merged with other federal wildlife bureaus to become the u s.
fish and wildlife service.
at the same time eviction of indians showed that defining small preserves of uninhabited wilderness was part of conquest itself.
in 1877 for example the federal government forcibly removed the nez perce tribe from their ancestral land in what is now idaho washington and oregon.
under the leadership of young chief joseph the nez perces tried to flee to canada.
after a journey of 1 100 miles they were forced to surrender just short of the border.
during their trek five bands crossed yellowstone as a nez perce named yellow wolf recalled they knew that killing the bison this woodcut shows passengers shooting bison from a kansas pacific railroad train a small thrill added to the modern convenience of traveling west by rail.
by the end of the 1870s the plains bison shown here which once numbered in the tens of millions and had been a large part of the plains indians way of life had been hunted almost to extinction.

but in minnesota the dakota sioux were increasingly frustrated.
in 1858 the year minnesota secured statehood they had agreed to settle on a strip of land reserved by the government in exchange for receiving regular payments and supplies.
but indian agents contractors and even minnesotas territorial governor pocketed most of the funds.
when the dakotas protested that their children were starving state officials dismissed their appeals.
corruption was so egregious that one leading minnesotan episcopal bishop henry whipple wrote an urgent appeal to president james buchanan.
a nation which sows robbery he warned will reap a harvest of blood whipples prediction proved correct.
during the summer of 1862 a decade of anger boiled over.
in a surprise attack dakota fighters fanned out through the minnesota countryside killing immigrants and burning farms.
they planned to sweep eastward to st paul but were stopped at fort ridgely.
in the end more than four hundred whites lay dead including women and children from farms and small towns.

a measles epidemic broke out in the crowded camp and dozens died especially children.
though u s soldiers were often unfriendly toward their captives local sentiment was even more hostile troops regularly marched through the camp in part to protect the dakotas from vigilante violence.

minnesotans ferocious response to the uprising set the stage for further conflict.
a hastily appointed military court bent on revenge sentenced 307 dakotas to death making it clear that rebellious indians would be treated as criminals rather than warriors.
president abraham lincoln reviewed the trial records and commuted most of the sentences but authorized the deaths of 38 dakota men.
they were hanged just after christmas 1862 in the largest mass execution in u s history.
two months later congress canceled all treaties with the dakotas revoked their annuities and expelled them from minnesota.
the scattered bands fled west to join nonreservation allies.
as the uprising showed the civil war created two dangerous conditions in the west compounding the problems already caused by corruption.
with the union army fighting the confederacy western whites felt vulnerable to indian attacks.
they also discovered they could fight indians with minimal federal oversight.

ordered to subdue these peoples the u s army failed part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 miserably officers could not even locate the enemy who traveled rapidly in small bands and knew the country well.
a further shock occurred in december 1866 when 1 500 sioux warriors executed a perfect ambush luring captain william fetterman and 80 soldiers from a wyoming fort and wiping them out.
with the fetterman massacre the sioux succeeded in closing the bozeman trail a private road under army protection that had served as the main route into montana.
general william tecumseh sherman now commanding the army in the west swore to defeat defiant indians.
but the union hero met his match on the plains.
another year of fighting proved expensive and inconclusive.
in 1868 the sioux led by the oglala band under chief red cloud told a peace commission they would not sign any treaty unless the united states pledged to abandon all its forts along the bozeman trail.
the commission agreed.
red cloud had won.
in the wake of these events eastern public opinion turned against the indian wars which seemed at best ineffective at worst brutal.
congress held hearings on the slaughter at sand creek.
though chivington now a civilian was never prosecuted the massacre became an infamous example of western vigilantism.
by the time ulysses grant entered the white house in 1869 the authors of reconstruction in the south also began to seek solutions to what they called the indian problem grants peace policy grant inherited an indian policy in disarray.
federal incompetence was highlighted by yet another mass killing of friendly indians in january 1870 this time on the marias river in montana by an army detachment that shot and burned to death 173 piegans blackfeet.
having run out of other options grant introduced a peace policy based on recommendations from christian advisors.
he offered selected appointments to the reformers including many former abolitionists who had created such groups as the indian rights association and the womens national indian association.
rejecting the virulent anti indian stance of many westerners reformers argued that native peoples had the innate capacity to become equal with whites.
they believed however that indians could achieve this only if they embraced christianity and white ways.
reformers thus aimed to destroy native languages cultures and religions.
despite humane intentions their condescension was obvious.
they ignored dissenters like dr thomas bland of the national indian defense association who suggested that instead of an indian problem there might be a white problem refusal to permit indians to follow their own lifeways.
to most nineteenth century americans such a notion was shocking and uncivilized.
increasingly dismissive of blacks capacity for citizenship and hostile toward heathen chinese immigrants white americans were even less willing to understand and respect indian cultures.
they believed that in the modern world native peoples were fated for extinction thinking like a historian p 530.
indian boarding schools reformers focused their greatest energy on educating the next generation.
realizing that acculturation adoption of white ways was difficult when children lived at home agents and missionaries created off reservation schools.
native families were exhorted bullied and bribed into sending their children to these schools where in addition to school lessons boys learned farming skills and girls practiced housekeeping.

i felt that i was no more indian but would be an imitation of a white man to see a longer excerpt of mourning doves autobiography along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
even in the first flush of reform zeal grants policies faced major hurdles.
most indians had been pushed off traditional lands and assigned to barren ground that would have defeated the most enterprising farmer.
poverty and dislocation left indians especially vulnerable to the ravages of infectious diseases like measles and scarlet fever.

some tribes and families have been left in geographical isolation to work out the problems of progress.
others have been adulterated through external influence.
thus while africa was and is an ethnical chaos of savagery and barbarism australia and polynesia were in savagery pure and simple.

lower status of barbarism from the invention of the art of pottery.
v middle status of barbarism from the domestication of animals on the eastern hemisphere and in the western from the cultivation of maize and plants by irrigation.
upper status of barbarism from the invention of the process of smelting iron ore with the use of iron tools.
civilization from the invention of writing to the present time.
the far northern indians and some of the coast tribes of north and south america were in the upper status of savagery the partially village indians east of the mississippi were in the lower status of barbarism and the village indians of north and south america were in the middle status.

the senate agreed provided that existing treaties remained in force.
it was one more step in a long torturous erosion of native rights.
eventually the u s supreme court ruled in lone wolf v hitchcock 1903 that congress could make whatever indian policies it chose ignoring all existing treaties.
that same year in ex parte crow dog the court ruled that no indian was a citizen unless congress designated him so.
indians were henceforth wards of the government.

dawes saw the reservation system as an ugly relic of the past.
through severalty division of tribal lands he hoped to force indians onto individual landholdings partitioning reservations into homesteads just like those of white farmers.
supporters of the plan believed that landownership would encourage indians to assimilate.
it would lead as dawes wrote to a personal sense of independence individual property echoed another reformer would make the indian man intelligently selfish.

the dawes act was a disaster.
it played into the hands of whites who coveted indian land and who persuaded the government to sell them land that was not needed for individual allotments.
in this and other ways the bureau of indian affairs bia implemented the law carelessly to the outrage of dawes.
in indian territory a commission seized more than 15 million surplus acres from native tribes by 1894 opening the way for whites to convert the last federal territory set aside for native peoples into the state of oklahoma.
in addition to catastrophic losses of collectively held property native peoples lost 66 percent of their individually allotted lands between the 1880s and the 1930s through fraud bia mismanagement and pressure to sell to whites.
the end of armed resistance as the nation consolidated control of the west in the 1870s americans hoped that grants peace policy was solving the indian problem in the southwest such formidable peoples as the kiowas and comanches had been forced onto reservations.
the din or navajo nation exiled under horrific conditions during the civil war but permitted to reoccupy their traditional land gave up further military resistance.

only sitting bull a leader of the powerful lakota sioux on the northern plains openly refused to go to a reservation.
when pressured by u s troops he repeatedly crossed into canada where he told reporters that the life of white men is slavery.
i have seen nothing that a white man has houses or railways or clothing or food that is as good as the right to move in open country and live in our own fashion in 1874 the lakotas faced direct provocation.
lieutenant colonel george armstrong custer a brash self promoter who had graduated last in his class at west point led an expedition into south dakotas black hills and loudly proclaimed the discovery of gold.
amid the severe depression of the 1870s prospectors rushed in.
the united states wavering on its 1868 treaty pressured sioux leaders to sell the black hills.
the chiefs said no.
ignoring this answer the government demanded in 1876 that all sioux gather at the federal agencies.
the policy backfired not only did sitting bull refuse to report but other sioux cheyennes and arapahos slipped away from reservations to join him.
knowing they might face military attack they agreed to live together for the summer in one great village numbering over seven thousand people.
by june they were camped on the little big horn river in what is now southeastern montana.
some of the young men wanted to organize raiding parties but elders counseled against it.
we are within our treaty rights as hunters they argued.
we must keep ourselves so the u s army dispatched a thousand cavalry and infantrymen to drive the indians back to the reservation.
despite warnings from experienced scouts including crow indian allies most officers thought the job would be easy.
their greatest fear was that the indians would manage to slip away.
but amid the nations centennial celebration on the fourth of july 1876 americans received dreadful news.
on june 26 and 27 lieutenant colonel custer leading the 7th cavalry as part of a three pronged effort to surround the indians had led 210 men in an ill considered assault on sitting bulls camp.
the sioux and their allies had killed the attackers to the last man.

curtiss extensive collection of photographs of native americans remains a valuable resource for historians.
however curtis altered his images to make his native subjects seem more authentic though indians made widespread use of nonnative furniture clothes and other consumer goods such as singer sewing machines curtis removed those from the frame.
he also retouched photographs to remove items such as belts and watches.

savages long after americans forgot the massacres of cheyenne women and children at sand creek and of piegan people on the marias river prints of the battle of little big horn hung in barrooms across the country.
william f buffalo bill cody in his traveling wild west performances enacted a revenge killing of a cheyenne man named yellow hand in a tableau cody called first scalp for custer notwithstanding that the tableau featured a white man scalping a cheyenne cody depicted it as a triumph for civilization.

santee reservation map 16 6 the sioux reservations in south dakota 1868 1889 in 1868 when they bent to the demand that they move onto the reservation the sioux thought they had gained secure rights to a substantial part of their ancestral hunting grounds.
but harsh conditions on reservations led to continuing military conflicts.
landhungry whites exerted continuous local pressure and officials in washington repeatedly changed the terms of sioux land holdings always eroding native claims.
strategies of survival though the warpath closed many native peoples continued secretly to practice traditional customs.
away from the disapproving eyes of trace change agents and teachers they passed over time on their languages histories and in what ways did the traditional arts and medicine to outlook of native peoples younger generations.
frustrated change in the era after missionaries often concluded that armed resistance had little could be accomplished ended.
because bonds of kinship and custom were so strong.
parents also hated to relinquish their children to off reservation boarding schools.
thus more and more indian schools ended up on or near reservations white teachers had to accept their pupils continued participation in the rhythms of indian community life.
selectively most native peoples adopted some white ways.
many parents urged their sons and daughters to study hard learn english and develop skills to help them succeed in the new world they confronted.
even sitting bull announced in 1885 that he wanted his children to be educated like the white children are some indian students grew up to be lawyers doctors and advocates for their people including writers and artists who interpreted native experiences for national audiences.
one of the most famous was a santee sioux boy named ohiyesa who became dr charles eastman.
posted to the pine ridge reservation in south dakota eastman practiced medicine side by side with traditional healers whom he respected and wrote popular books under his sioux name.
he remembered that when he left for boarding school his father had said we have now entered upon this life and there is no going back.
remember my boy it is the same as if i sent you on your first war path.
i shall expect you to conquer nothing exemplified this syncretism or cultural blending better than the ghost dance movement of the late 1880s and early 1890s which fostered native peoples hope that they could through sacred dances resurrect the bison and call a great storm to drive whites back across the atlantic.
the ghost dance drew on christian elements as well as native ones.
as the movement spread from reservation to reservation paiutes arapahos sioux native peoples developed new forms of pan indian identity and cooperation.
white responses to the ghost dance showed continued misunderstanding and lethal exertion of authority.
in 1890 when a group of lakota sioux ghost dancers left their south dakota reservation they were pursued by the u s army who feared that further spread of the religion would provoke war.
on december 29 at wounded knee the 7th cavalry caught up with fleeing lakotas and killed at least 150 perhaps as many as 300.
like other massacres this one could have been avoided.
the deaths at wounded knee stand as a final indictment of decades of relentless u s expansion white ignorance and greed chaotic and conflicting policies and bloody mistakes.
chapter 16 western myths and realities the post civil war frontier produced mythic figures who have played starring roles in americas national folklore ever since savage indians brave pioneers rugged cowboys and gun slinging sheriffs.
far from being invented by hollywood in the twentieth century these oversimplified characters emerged in the era when the nation incorporated the west.
pioneers helped develop the mythic ideal.
as one montana woman claimed they had come west at peril of their lives and faced down scalp dances and other terrors in the end they conquered the wilderness and transformed it into a land of peace and plenty some former cowboys capitalizing on the popularity of dime novel westerns spiced up their memoirs for sale.
eastern readers were eager for stories like the life and adventures of nat love 1907 written by a texas cowhand who had been born in slavery in tennessee and who as a rodeo star in the 1870s had won the nickname deadwood dick no myth maker proved more influential than buffalo bill cody.
unlike those who saw the west as free or empty bill understood that the united states had taken it by conquest.
ironically his famous wild west which he insisted was not a show but an authentic representation of frontier experience provided one of the few employment options for plains indians.
to escape harsh reservation conditions sioux and cheyenne men signed on with bill and demonstrated their riding skills for cheering audiences across the united states and europe chasing buffalo and attacking u s soldiers and pioneer wagons in the arena.
buffalo bill proved to be a good employer.
black elk a sioux man who joined codys operation recalled that bill was generous and had a strong heart but black elk had a mixed reaction to the wild west.
i liked the part of the show we made he told an interviewer but not the part the wasichus white people made as he observed the wild west of the 1880s was at its heart a celebration of u s military conquest.
at this same moment of transition a young historian named frederick jackson turner reviewed recent census data and proclaimed the end of the frontier.
up to 1890 he wrote a clear westward moving line had existed between civilization and savagery the frontier experience turner argued shaped americans national character.
it left them a heritage of coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness as well as restless nervous energy today historians reject turners depiction of indian savagery and his contradictory idea that white conquering a continent 1854 1890 pioneers in the west claimed empty free land many scholars have noted that frontier conquest was both violent and incomplete.
the dust bowl of the 1930s as well as more recent cycles of drought have repeated late nineteenth century patterns of hardship and depopulation on the plains.
during the 1950s and 1960s also uranium mining rushes in the west mimicked earlier patterns of boom and bust leaving ghost towns in their wake.
turner himself acknowledged that the frontier had both good and evil elements.
he noted that in the west frontier liberty was sometimes confused with absence of all effective government but in 1893 when turner first published the significance of the frontier in american history eager listeners heard only the positives.
they saw pioneering in the west as evidence of american exceptionalism of the nations unique history and destiny.
they claimed that peaceful american expansion was the opposite of european empires ignoring the many military and economic similarities.
although politically the american west became a set of states rather than a colony historians today emphasize the legacy of conquest that is central to its and americas history.
less than two months after the massacre at wounded knee general william t sherman died in new york.
as the nation marked his passing with pomp and oratory commentators noted that his career reflected a great era of conquest and consolidation of national power.
known primarily for his role in defeating the confederacy shermans first military exploits had been against seminoles in florida.
later during the mexican war 1846 1848 he had gone west with the u s army to help claim california.
after the civil war the general went west again supervising the forced removal of sioux and cheyennes to reservations.
when sherman graduated from west point in 1840 the united states had counted twenty six states none of them west of missouri.
at his death in 1891 the nation boasted forty four states stretching to the pacific coast.
the united states now rivaled britain and germany as an industrial giant and its dynamic economy was drawing immigrants from around the world.
over the span of shermans career the united states had become a major player on the world stage.
it had done so through the kind of fierce military conquest that sherman made famous as well as through bold expansions of federal authority to foster economic expansion.
from the wars and policies of shermans lifetime the children and grandchildren of civil war heroes inherited a vast empire.
in the coming decades it would be up to them to decide how they would use the nations new power.
part 5 chapter review summary between 1861 and 1877 the united states completed its conquest of the continent.
after the civil war expansion of railroads fostered integration of the national economy.
republican policymakers promoted this integration through protective tariffs while federal court rulings facilitated economic growth and strengthened corporations.
to attract foreign investment congress placed the nation on the gold standard.
federal officials also pursued a vigorous foreign policy acquiring alaska and asserting u s power indirectly through control of international trade in latin america and asia.
an important result of economic integration was incorporation of the great plains.
cattlemen built an industry linked to the integrated economy in the process nearly driving the native bison to extinction.
homesteaders confronted harsh environmental conditions as they converted the grasslands for agriculture.
republicans championed homesteader families as c h a p t e r representatives of domesticity an ideal opposed to mormon plural marriage in utah.
homesteading accelerated the rapid often violent transformation of western environments.
perceiving this transformation federal officials began setting aside natural preserves such as yellowstone often clashing with native americans who wished to hunt there.
conflicts led to the dispossession of native american lands.
during the civil war whites clashed with the sioux and their allies.
grants peace policy sought to end this conflict by forcing native americans to acculturate to european style practices.
indian armed resistance continued through the 1880s ending with geronimos surrender in 1886.
thereafter native americans survived by secretly continuing their traditions and selectively adopting white ways.
due in part to the determined military conquest of this period the united states claimed a major role on the world stage.
frontier myths shaped americans view of themselves as rugged individualists with a unique national destiny.

vay attending the funeral worried that immigration was of no use except to help fill the moneybags of the insatiable millionaires vay witnessed americas emergence as an industrial power and the consequences of that transformation.
in 1877 the united states was overwhelmingly rural and dependent on foreign capital.
by 1917 its landscapes population and ways of life were forever altered.
industrialization brought millions of immigrants from around the globe and built immense cities whose governance and social relations offered unaccustomed rewards and challenges.
it sharpened class divisions and led to the rise of national labor movements while prompting americans to redefine mens and womens roles.
industrialization also created pressure for political innovation.
as ex president theodore roosevelt declared in 1910 american citizens needed to control the mighty commercial forces which they have called into being workers farmers and urban reformers sought to regulate corporations fight poverty and clean up politics and the environment.
in their creative responses to the problems of the industrial age such reformers gave their name to the progressive era.
corporations and conflicts a diverse urban society.
in the post civil war decades giant corporations developed national and even global networks of production marketing and finance.
in many fields vertical integration enabled corporate managers to control production from the harvesting of raw materials through the sale of finished products.
nationwide marketing networks developed through innovative use of railroads and through ruthless competitive tactics such as predatory pricing.
corporations complex structures opened career opportunities for middle managers and salesmen.
women filling new niches as telephone operators and department store clerks also played an important role in the expanding service sector.
at the same time traditional craftsmen found themselves displaced as deskilled wage work steadily expanded.
factory workers and miners endured dangerous conditions health hazards low pay and frequent bouts of unemployment.
the most dangerous low wage work was often allotted to african americans and immigrants from europe mexico and asia.
workers organized to protest these conditions.
in addition to creating labor unions they forged political alliances with farmers who also found their livelihoods at risk in the changing global economy.
native born workers and european immigrants successfully agitated for the legal exclusion of chinese workers.
these events are covered in chapter 17.
while the old values of thrift piety and domesticity never entirely faded they faced challenges in the era of industrialization.
women asserted more independent roles in public life.
the new model for men was an aggressive masculinity embodied in the rise of sports.
widespread acceptance of charles darwins theory of evolution prompted influential thinkers to justify economic inequality as a law of nature.
in culture the rise of literary realism and abstract art marked decisive innovations.
responding to these upheavals people of religious faith reshaped their institutions.
some accepted modernity while others called for a return to christian fundamentals see chapter 18 for these developments.
great cities arose becoming playgrounds for the new superrich while also housing millions of poor immigrants in tenements.
at the same time people of all classes in the vibrant cities enjoyed new pleasures from amusement parks to vaudeville and movies.
the fast growing cities proved challenging to govern.
to the frustration of middle class reformers many immigrant voters supported political machines like new yorks tammany hall.
by 1900 though even some machine leaders admitted the need for reform and big cities began to serve as seedbeds for progressive experiments.
on these developments see chapters 18 and 19.
part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 reform initiatives political debates in this era centered on the scope of government power as reformers called for regulation of corporations and other measures to blunt the impact of industrialization.
after the 1880s republicans increasingly defended big business.
though republican theodore roosevelt championed landmark legislation during his presidency 1901 1909 much reform energy passed to other parties.
democrats who had long called for limited government began to advocate stronger federal intervention to fight poverty and restrain big business.
by the 1910s during the presidency of democrat woodrow wilson 1913 1921 the party enacted an impressive slate of laws.
meanwhile the populist socialist and progressive parties proposed more radical responses to industrialization and concentrated wealth.
while none of these parties won national power their ideas helped shape the course of reform.
progressive era reformers a diverse group who were not at all united sought to enhance democracy rein in the power of corporations uphold labor rights protect the environment and promote public health and safety.
they faced formidable obstacles especially from supreme court rulings.
nonetheless by 1917 national state and local governments enacted a range of new laws representing the early emergence of the modern state.

arriving from scotland did industrialization bring and how as a poor twelve year old in 1848 carnegie did it reshape american society.
found work as an errand boy for the pennsylvania railroad and rapidly scaled the managerial ladder.
in 1865 he struck out on his own as an iron manufacturer selling to friends in the railroad business.
encouraged by republican tariffs to enter the steel industry he soon built a massive steel mill outside pittsburgh where a state of the art bessemer converter made steel refining dramatically more efficient.
with carnegie leading the way steel became a major u s industry reaching annual production of 10 million metric tons by 1900 almost as much as the combined output of the worlds other top producers germany 6 6 million tons and britain 4 8 million.
at first skilled workers at carnegies mill in homestead pennsylvania earned good wages.
they had a strong union and carnegie affirmed workers right to organize.
but carnegie confident that new machinery enabled him to replace many skilled laborers eventually decided that collective bargaining was too expensive.
in the summer of 1892 he withdrew to his estate in scotland leaving his partner henry clay frick in command.
a former coal magnate and veteran foe of labor frick was well qualified to do the dirty work.
he announced that after july 1 members of the amalgamated association of iron and steel workers would be locked out of the homestead mill.
if they wanted to return to work they would have to abandon the union and sign new individual contracts.
frick fortified the mill and prepared to hire replacement workers.
the battle was on.
at dawn on july 6 barges chugging up the monongahela river brought dozens of private armed guards from the pinkerton detective agency hired by carnegie to defend the plant.
locked out workers opened fire starting a gunfight that left seven workers and three pinkertons dead.
frick appealed to pennsylvanias governor who sent the state militia to arrest labor leaders on charges of riot and murder.
most of the lockedout workers lost their jobs.
the union was dead.
as the homestead lockout showed industrialization was a controversial and often bloody process.
during the half century after the civil war more and more americans worked not as independent farmers or artisans but as employees of large corporations.
conditions of work changed for people of all economic classes.
drawn by the dynamic economy immigrants arrived from around the globe.
these transformations provoked working people including farmers as well as industrial workers to organize and defend their interests.
marianna mine disaster the bituminous mines of marianna pennsylvania and many other rich sites provided the coal that fueled american industrial growth.
on november 28 1908 an explosion in the mine killed 158 workers.
many were american born some were irish welsh italian and polish immigrants.
here a horse drawn wagon carries bodies recovered from the mine.
such catastrophes laid bare the human cost of industrialization.
marianna was one among many in the same decade disasters at scofield utah jacobs creek pennsylvania monongah west virginia and cherry illinois each killed over 200 men.
library of congress.
part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 the rise of big business in the late 1800s industrialization in europe and the united states revolutionized the world economy.
it brought large scale commercial agriculture to many parts of the globe and prompted millions of migrants both skilled workers and displaced peasants to cross continents and oceans in search of jobs.
industrialization also created a production glut.
the immense scale of agriculture and manufacturing caused a long era of deflation when prices dropped worldwide figure 17 1.
falling prices normally signal low demand for goods and services and thus stagnation.
in england a mature industrial power the late nineteenth century did bring economic decline.
but in the united states production expanded.
between 1877 and 1900 americans average real income increased from 388 to 573 per capita.
in this sense andrew carnegie was right when he argued that even though industrialization increased the gap between rich and poor everyones standard of living rose.
in his famous 1889 essay wealth later called the gospel of wealth he observed that the poor enjoy what the rich could not before afford.
what were the luxuries have become the necessaries of life to see a longer excerpt of the gospel of wealth along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
technological and business efficiencies allowed american firms to grow invest in new equipment and earn profits even as prices for their products fell.
growth depended in turn on americas large and innovators in enterprise as rail lines stretched westward between the 1850s and 1880s operators faced a crisis.
as one erie railroad executive noted a superintendent on a 50 mile line could personally attend to every detail.
but supervising a 500 mile line was impossible trains ran late communications failed and trains crashed.
managers gradually invented systems to solve these problems.
they distinguished top executives from those responsible for day to day operations.
they departmentalized operations by function purchasing machinery freight traffic passenger traffic and established clear lines of communication.
they perfected cost accounting which allowed an industrialist like carnegie to track expenses and revenues carefully and thus follow his scottish mothers advice take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves this management revolution created the internal structure adopted by many large complex corporations.
during these same years the united states became an industrial power by tapping north americas vast natural resources particularly in the west.
industries that had once depended on water power began to use prodigious amounts of coal.
steam engines replaced human and animal labor and kerosene replaced whale oil and wood.
by 1900 americas factories and urban homes were converting to electric power.
with new management structures and dependency on fossil fuels oil coal natural gas corporations transformed both the economy and the countrys natural and built environments.
business activity and wholesale prices 1869 1900 this graph shows the key feature of the performance of the late nineteenth century economy while output was booming wholesale prices were on the whole falling.
thus while workers often struggled with falling wages especially during decades of severe economic crisis consumer products also became cheaper to buy.
wholesale prices gdp growing population expansion into the west and an integrated national marketplace.
in many fields large corporations became the dominant form of business.

such a system a national livestock market with local processing could have lasted as it did in europe.
but gustavus swift a shrewd chicago cattle dealer saw that local slaughterhouses lacked the scale to utilize waste by products and cut labor costs.
to improve productivity swift invented the assembly line where each wageworker repeated the same slaughtering task over and over.
swift also pioneered vertical integration a model in which a company controlled all aspects of production from raw materials to finished goods.
once his engineers designed a cooling system swift invested in a fleet of refrigerator cars to keep beef fresh as he shipped it eastward priced below what local butchers could afford.
in cities that received his chilled meat swift built branch houses and fleets of delivery wagons.
he also constructed factories to make fertilizer and chemicals from the by products of slaughter and he developed marketing strategies for those products as well.
other chicago packers followed swifts lead.
by 1900 five firms all vertically integrated produced nearly 90 percent of the meat shipped in interstate commerce.

where a large firm like swift could survive temporary losses in one locality until competitors went under.
afterward swift could raise prices again.
this technique known as predatory pricing helped give a few firms unprecedented market control.
standard oil and the rise of the trusts no one used ruthless business tactics more skillfully than the king of petroleum john d rockefeller.
after inventors in the 1850s figured out how to extract kerosene a clean burning fuel for domestic heating and lighting from crude oil enormous oil deposits were discovered at titusville pennsylvania.
just then the civil war severely disrupted whaling forcing whale oil customers to look for alternative lighting sources.
overnight a forest of oil wells sprang up around titusville.
connected to these pennsylvania oil fields by rail in 1863 cleveland ohio became a refining part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 center.
john d rockefeller was then an up and coming cleveland grain dealer.
he like carnegie and most other budding tycoons hired a substitute to fight for him in the civil war.
rockefeller had strong nerves a sharp eye for able partners and a genius for finance.
he went into the kerosene business and borrowed heavily to expand.
within a few years his firm standard oil of ohio was clevelands leading refiner.
like carnegie and swift rockefeller succeeded through vertical integration to control production and sales all the way from the oil well to the kerosene lamp he took a big stake in the oil fields added pipelines and developed a vast distribution network.
rockefeller allied with railroad executives who like him hated the oil markets boom and bust cycles.
what they wanted was predictable high volume traffic and they offered rockefeller secret rebates that gave him a leg up on competitors.
rockefeller also pioneered a strategy called horizontal integration.
after driving competitors to the brink of failure through predatory pricing he invited them to merge their local companies into his conglomerate.
most agreed often because they had no choice.
through such mergers standard oil wrested control of 95 percent of the nations oil refining capacity by the 1880s.
in 1882 rockefellers lawyers created a new legal form the trust.
it organized a small group of associates the board of trustees to hold stock from a group of combined firms managing them as a single entity.
rockefeller soon invested in mexican oil fields and competed in world markets against russian and middle eastern producers.
other companies followed rockefellers lead creating trusts to produce such products as linseed oil sugar and salt.
many expanded sales and production overseas.
as early as 1868 singer manufacturing company established a factory in scotland to produce sewing machines.
by world war i such brands as ford and general electric had become familiar around the world.
distressed by the development of near monopolies reformers began to denounce the trusts a term that in popular usage referred to any large corporation that seemed to wield excessive power.
some states outlawed trusts as a legal form.
but in an effort to attract corporate headquarters to its state new jersey broke ranks in 1889 passing a law that permitted the creation of holding companies and other combinations.
delaware soon followed providing another legal haven for consolidated corporations.
a wave of mergers further concentrated corporate power during the depression of the 1890s as weaker firms succumbed to powerful rivals.
by 1900 americas largest one hundred companies controlled a third of the nations productive capacity.
purchasing several steel companies in 1901 including carnegie steel j p morgan created u s steel the nations first billion dollar corporation.
such familiar firms as dupont and eastman kodak assumed dominant places in their respective industries.
assessing the industrialists the work of men like swift rockefeller and carnegie was controversial in their lifetimes and has been ever since.
opinions have tended to be harsh in eras of economic crisis when the shortcomings of corporate america appear in stark relief.
during the great depression of the 1930s a historian coined the term robber barons which is still used today.
in periods of prosperity both scholars and the public have tended to view early industrialists more favorably calling them industrial statesmen.
some historians have argued that industrialists benefitted the economy by replacing the chaos of market competition with a visible hand of planning and expert management.
but one recent study of railroads asserts that the main skills of early tycoons as well as those of today were cultivating political friends defaulting on loans and lying to the public.
whether we consider the industrialists heroes villains or something in between it is clear that the corporate economy was not the creation of just a few individuals however famous or influential.
it was a systemic transformation of the economy.
a national consumer culture as they integrated vertically and horizontally corporations innovated in other ways.
companies such as bell telephone and westinghouse set up research laboratories.
steelmakers invested in chemistry and materials science to make their products cheaper better and stronger.
mass markets brought an appealing array of goods to consumers who could afford them.
railroads whisked florida oranges and other fresh produce to the shelves of grocery stores.
retailers such as f w woolworth and the great atlantic and pacific tea company a p opened chains of stores that soon stretched nationwide.
the department store was pioneered in 1875 by john wanamaker in philadelphia.
these megastores displaced small retail shops tempting customers with large show windows and christmas displays.
like industrialists department store magnates developed economies of scale that enabled them to slash prices.
an 1898 newspaper advertisement for macys department store urged shoppers to read our books cook in our saucepans dine off our china wear our silks get chapter 17 industrial america corporations and conflicts 1877 1911 the active shaping of consumer demand became in itself a new enterprise.
outdoors advertisements appeared everywhere in new yorks madison square the heinz company installed a 45 foot pickle made of green electric lights.
tourists had difficulty admiring niagara falls because billboards obscured the view.
by 1900 companies were spending more than 90 million a year 2 3 billion today on print advertising as the press itself became a mass market industry.
rather than charging subscribers the cost of production magazines began to cover their costs by selling ads.
cheap subscriptions built a mass readership which in turn attracted more advertisers.
in 1903 the ladies home journal became the first magazine with a million subscribers.
the corporate workplace thomas edison the wondrous inventions that emerged from edisons laboratory in menlo park new jersey ranged from the phonograph shown here to electric light bulbs moving pictures and portland cement.
edison 1847 1931 became a national hero and the holder of over one thousand patents.
he was also a shrewd entrepreneur who artfully cultivated both publicity and investor support.
in demonstrating electric lights he chose first to illuminate the headquarters of the new york times and the nearby offices of powerful financier j p morgan.
in this advertisement he makes a democratic appeal to all americans but only the affluent could afford a phonograph which cost about 20.

mail order companies used money back guarantees to coax wary customers to buy products they could not see or touch.

tell us what you want in your own way by 1900 america counted more than twelve hundred mail order companies.
before the civil war most american boys had hoped to become farmers small business owners or independent artisans.
afterward more and more americans both male and female began working for someone else.
because they wore white shirts with starched collars those who held professional positions in corporations became known as white collar workers a term differentiating them from blue collar employees who labored with their hands.
for a range of employees managers and laborers clerks and salespeople the rise of corporate work had wide ranging consequences.
managers and salesmen as the managerial revolution unfolded the headquarters of major corporations began to house departments handling specific activities such as purchasing and accounting.
these departments explain were supervised by middle man consequences agers something not seen before what opportunities did in american industry.
middle the rise of corporations managers took on entirely new offer to different types of tasks directing the flow of goods middle workers those labor and information through who were neither top out the enterprise.
they were key executives nor blue collar innovators counterparts to the laborers.
engineers in research laboratories who in the same decades worked to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
corporations also needed a new kind of sales force.
in post civil war america the drummer or traveling salesman became a familiar sight on city streets and in remote country stores.
riding rail networks from town to town drummers introduced merchants to new products offered incentives and suggested sales part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 too little were singled out for remedial training or dismissal.
executives embraced the ideas of business psychologist walter dill scott who published the psychology of advertising in 1908.
scotts principles which included selling to customers based on their presumed instinct of escape and instinct of combat were soon taught at harvard business school.
others also promised that a scientific attitude would attract attention and create desire the salesman as professional 1906 salesmanship magazine featured this image in its june 1906 issue depicting the traveling salesman as an energetic well dressed professional.
the advertisement urges salesmen to join the united commercial travelers of america ucta a fraternal organization founded by salesmen in 1888 and still in existence today.
ucta offered its members the opportunity to purchase insurance and build business networks with fellow salesmen.
through such organizations white collar workers and managers who were almost never unionized banded together to pursue their common interests and express professional pride.

they built nationwide distribution networks for such popular consumer products as cigarettes and coca cola.
by the late 1880s the leading manufacturer of cash registers produced a sales script for its employees conversations with local merchants.
take for granted that he will buy the script directed.
say to him now mr blank what color shall i make it.
handing him your pen say just sign here where i have made the cross with such companies in the vanguard sales became systematized.
managers set individual sales quotas and awarded prizes to top salesmen while those who sold women in the corporate office beneath the ranks of managers emerged a new class of female office workers.
before the civil war most clerks at small firms had been young men who expected to rise through the ranks.
in a large corporation secretarial work became a dead end job and employers began assigning it to women.
by the turn of the twentieth century 77 percent of all stenographers and typists were female by 1920 women held half of all low level office jobs.
for white working class women clerking and office work represented new opportunities.
in an era before most families had access to day care mothers most often earned money at home where they could tend children while also taking in laundry caring for boarders or doing piecework sewing or other assembly projects paid on a per item basis.
unmarried daughters could enter domestic service or factory work but clerking and secretarial work were cleaner and better paid.
new technologies provide additional opportunities for women.
the rise of the telephone introduced by inventor alexander graham bell in 1876 was a notable example.
originally intended for business use on local exchanges telephones were eagerly adopted by residential customers.
thousands of young women found work as telephone operators.
by 1900 more than four million women worked for wages.
about a third worked in domestic service another third in industry the rest in office work teaching nursing or sales.
as new occupations arose the percentage of wage earning women in domestic service dropped dramatically a trend that continued in the twentieth century.
on the shop floor despite the managerial revolution at the top skilled craft workers almost all of them men retained considerable autonomy in many industries.
a coal miner for example was not an hourly wageworker but essentially an independent contractor paid by the amount of coal he produced.
he provided his own tools worked at his own pace and knocked off early chapter 17 industrial america corporations and conflicts 1877 1911 telephone operators 1888 like other women office workers these switchboard operators enjoyed relatively high pay and comfortable working conditions especially in the early years of the telephone industry before operators work routines speeded up.
these young women worked for the central union telephone company in canton ohio.

when he chose.
the same was true for puddlers and rollers in iron works molders in stove making and machinists glass blowers and skilled workers in many other industries.
such workers abided by the stint a self imposed limit on how much they would produce each day.
this informal system of restricting output infuriated efficiency minded engineers but to the workers it signified personal dignity manly pride and brotherhood with fellow employees.
one shop in lowell massachusetts posted regulations requiring all employees to be at their posts by the time of the opening bell and to remain with the shop door locked until the closing bell.
a machinist promptly packed his tools declaring that he had not been brought up under such a system of slavery skilled workers craftsmen inside contractors and foremen enjoyed a high degree of autonomy.
but those who paid helpers from their own pocket could also exploit them.
subcontracting arose in part to enable manufacturers to distance themselves from the consequences of shady labor practices.
in pittsburgh steel mills foremen were known as pushers notorious for driving their gangs mercilessly.
on the other hand industrial labor operated on a human scale through personal relationships that could be close and enduring.
striking craft workers would commonly receive the support of helpers and laborers and labor gangs would sometimes walk out on behalf of a popular foreman.
as industrialization advanced however workers increasingly lost the independence characteristic of craft work.
the most important cause of this was the deskilling of labor under a new system of mechanized manufacturing that men like meat packer gustavus swift had pioneered and that automobile maker henry ford would soon call mass protrace change duction.
everything from typewriters to automobiles came to over time how did conditions be assembled from standardized change for industrial parts using machines that increasworkers in the late nineingly operated with little human teenth century and why.
a machinist protested part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 ironworkers noontime 1880 the ideal qualities of the nineteenth century craft worker dignity brotherhood manliness shine through in this painting by thomas p anschutz.
ironworkers noontime became a popular painting after it was reproduced as an engraving in harpers weekly in 1884.
fine arts museum of san francisco.
in 1883 that the sewing machine industry was so subdivided that one man may make just a particular part of a machine and may not know anything whatever about another part of the same machine such a worker noted an observer cannot be master of a craft but only master of a fragment employers who originally favored automatic machinery because it increased output quickly found that it also helped them control workers and cut labor costs.
they could pay unskilled workers less and replace them easily.
by the early twentieth century managers sought to further reduce costs through a program of industrial efficiency called scientific management.
its inventor a metal cutting expert named frederick w taylor recommended that employers eliminate all brain work from manual labor hiring experts to develop rules for the shop floor.
workers must be required to do what they are told promptly and without asking questions or making suggestions in its most extreme form scientific management called for engineers to time each task with a stopwatch companies would pay workers more if they met the stopwatch standard.
taylor assumed that workers would respond automatically to the lure of higher earnings.
but scientific management was not in practice a great success.
implementing it proved to be expensive and workers stubbornly resisted.
corporate managers however adopted bits and pieces of taylors system and they enthusiastically agreed that decisions should lie with management alone over time in comparison with businesses in other countries american corporations created a particularly wide gap between the roles of managers and those of the blue collar workforce.
blue collar workers had little freedom to negotiate and their working conditions deteriorated markedly as mass production took hold.
at the same time industrialization brought cheaper products that enabled many americans to enjoy new consumer products if they could avoid starvation.
from executives down to unskilled workers the hierarchy of corporate employment contributed to sharper distinctions among three economic classes the wealthy elite an emerging selfdefined middle class and a struggling class of workers who bore the brunt of the economys new risks chapter 17 industrial america corporations and conflicts 1877 1911 the singer sewing machine the sewing machine was an american invention that swiftly found markets abroad.
the singer manufacturing company the dominant firm by the time the civil war began exported sewing machines to markets as far flung as ireland russia china and india.
the company also moved some manufacturing operations abroad producing 200 000 machines annually at a scottish plant that employed 6 000 workers.
singers advertising rightly boasted of the international appeal of a product that the company dubbed the universal sewing machine collection of the new york historical society.
and included many americans living in dire poverty.
as it wrought these changes industrialization prompted intense debate over inequality thinking like a historian p 554.
health hazards and pollution industrialized labor also damaged workers health.
in 1884 a study of the illinois central railroad showed that over the previous decade one in twenty of its workers had been killed or permanently disabled by an accident on the job.
for brakemen one of the most dangerous jobs the rate was one in seven.
due to lack of regulatory laws and inspections mining was 50 percent more dangerous in the united states than in germany between 1876 and 1925 an average of over 2 000 u s coal miners died each year from cave ins and explosions.
silver gold and copper mines were not immune from such tragedies but mining companies resisted demands for safety regulation.
extractive industries and factories also damaged nearby environments and the people who lived there.
in big cities poor residents suffered from polluted air and the dumping of noxious by products into the water supply.
mines like those in leadville colorado contaminated the land and water with mercury and lead.
alabama convicts forced to work in coal mines faced brutal working conditions and fatal illnesses caused by the mines contamination of local water.
at the time people were well aware of many of these dangers but workers had an even more urgent priority work.
pittsburghs belching smokestacks meant coughing and lung damage but they also meant running mills and paying jobs.
unskilled labor and discrimination as managers deskilled production the ranks of factory workers came to include more and more women and children who were almost always unskilled and low paid.
men often resented womens presence in factories and male labor unions often worked to exclude women especially wives who they argued should remain in the home.
women vigorously defended their right to work.
on hearing accusations that married women worked only to buy frivolous luxuries one female worker in a massachusetts shoe factory wrote a heated response to the local newspaper when the husband and father cannot provide for his wife and children it is perfectly natural that the wife and mother should desire to work.
dont blame married women if the land of the free has become a land of slavery and oppression thinking like a historian poverty and food amid rising industrial poverty food emerged as a reference point.
how much was too little or too much.
if some americans were going hungry how should others respond.
the documents below show some contributions to these debates.

what assumptions does she make about her audience.
in what ways was her cookbook itself a product of industrialization.
for family of six average price 78 cents per day or 13 cents per person.
i am going to consider myself as talking to the mother of a family who has six mouths to feed and no more money than this to do it with.
perhaps this woman has never kept accurate accounts.
i have in mind the wife who has time to attend to the housework and children.
if a woman helps earn as in a factory doing most of her housework after she comes home at night she must certainly have more money than in the first case in order to accomplish the same result.

werner sombart why is there no socialism in the united states 1906.
sombart a german sociologist compared living conditions in germany and the united states in order to answer the question above.
what conclusion did he reach.
the american worker eats almost three times as much meat three times as much flour and four times as much sugar as his german counterpart.
the american worker is much closer to the better sections of the german middle class than to the german wage labouring class.
he does not merely eat but dines.
it is no wonder if in such a situation any dissatisfaction with the existing social order finds difficulty in establishing itself in the mind of the worker.
all socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie.

in 1900 one of every five children under the age of sixteen worked outside the home.
child labor was most widespread in the south where a lowwage industrial sector emerged after reconstruction map 17 1.
textile mills sprouted in the carolinas and georgia recruiting workers from surrounding farms whole families often worked in the mills.
many children also worked in pennsylvania coal fields where death and injury rates were high.
state law permitted children as young as twelve to labor with a family member but turn of the century investigators estimated that about 10 000 additional boys at even younger ages were illegally employed in the mines.
also at the bottom of the pay scale were most african americans.
corporations and industrial manufacturers widely discriminated against them on the basis of race and such prejudice was hardly limited to the south.
after the civil war african american women who moved to northern cities were largely barred from office work and other new employment options instead they remained heavily concentrated in domestic service with more than half employed as cooks or servants.
african american men confronted similar exclusion.
americas booming vertically integrated corporations turned black men away from all but the most menial jobs.
in 1890 almost a third of black men worked in personal service.
employers in the north and west recruited instead a different kind of low wage labor newly arrived immigrants.

in 1900 census takers found that more than 75 percent of san francisco and new york city residents had at least one parent who was foreign born.
in the new industrial order immigrants made an ideal labor supply.
they took the worst jobs at low pay and during economic downturns tens of thousands returned to their home countries reducing the shock of unemployment in the united states.
but many native born americans viewed immigrants with hostility through the lens of racial ethnic and religious prejudices.
they also feared that immigrants would take more coveted jobs and erode white mens wages.
for immigrants themselves america could be disorienting liberating and disappointing.
newcomers from europe mass migration from western europe had started in the 1840s when more than one million irish fled a terrible famine.

along with italians and greeks eastern european jews were among the most numerous arrivals.
the first american jews who numbered around 50 000 in 1880 had been mostly of german jewish descent.
in the next four decades more than 3 million poverty stricken jews arrived from russia ukraine poland and other parts of eastern europe transforming the jewish presence in the united states.
like other immigrants they sought economic opportunity but they also came to escape religious repression american voices p 562.
wherever they came from immigrants took a considerable gamble in traveling to the united states.
some prospered quickly especially if they came with education money or well placed business contacts.
others by toiling many years in harsh conditions succeeded in securing a better life for their children or grandchildren.

asian americans and exclusion compared with europeans newcomers from asia faced even harsher treatment.
the first chinese immigrants had arrived in the late 1840s during the california gold rush.

in the 1885 rock springs massacre in wyoming white men burned the local chinatown and murdered at least twenty eight chinese miners.
despite such atrocities some chinese managed to build profitable businesses and farms.
many did so by filling the only niches native born americans left open to them running restaurants and laundries.
facing intense political pressure congress in 1882 passed the chinese exclusion act specifically barring chinese chinese workers in a salmon cannery c 1900 shut out of many fields of employment by racial discrimination many chinese immigrants founded their own restaurants laundries and other small businesses.
others like these cannery workers in astoria oregon took on some of the most grueling and lowest paid work in the american economy.
job segregation reinforced in turn racial prejudice.

asian immigrants made vigorous use of the courts to try to protect their rights.
in a series of cases brought by chinese and later japanese immigrants the u s supreme court ruled that all persons born in the united states had citizenship rights that could not be revoked even if their parents had been born abroad.
nonetheless well into the twentieth century chinese immigrants as opposed to native born chinese americans could not apply for citizenship.
meanwhile japanese and a few korean immigrants also began to arrive by 1909 there were 40 000 japanese immigrants working in agriculture 10 000 on railroads and 4 000 in canneries.
in 1906 the u s attorney general ruled that japanese and koreans like chinese immigrants were barred from citizenship.

that was a big chance for a lot of chinese remembered one immigrant.
they forged themselves certificates saying they could go back to china and bring back four or five sons just like that such persistence explain consequences ensured that despite the harsh policies of chinese exclusion the flow of asian immigrants never fully ceased.
labor gets organized in the american political system labor has typically been weak.
industrial workers cluster in cities near factories and jobs compared with small towns and rural areas urban areas have been underrepresented in bodies such as the u s senate and the presidential electoral college in which representation is calculated by state rather than or in addition to individuals.
this problem became acute in the era of industrialization and it has lingered.
even today the twenty two u s senators elected from alaska idaho iowa maine mississippi montana new mexico north dakota vermont west virginia and wyoming represent a smaller number of people combined than the two u s senators who represent heavily urban california.
faced with this obstacle labor advocates could adopt one of two strategies.
first they could try to make political alliances with sympathetic rural voters anti chinese racism this cartoon from the magazine puck drawn by james a wales during the 1880 presidential campaign offers vivid evidence of the widespread and virulent american prejudice against chinese immigrants.
republican candidate james garfield on the left and democratic candidate winfield scott hancock on the right both nail up their partys planks in favor of restricting chinese immigration.
asian immigrants were not permitted to apply for naturalization as u s citizens they thus had no vote and no power in politics.
congress passed the chinese exclusion act with bipartisan support soon after garfields victory.

chapter 17 industrial america corporations and conflicts 1877 1911 who shared their problems.
second they could reject politics and create narrowly focused trade unions to negotiate directly with employers.
in general labor advocates emphasized the first strategy between the 1870s and the early 1890s and the latter in the early twentieth century.
across this era while industrialization made america increasingly rich and powerful it also brought large scale conflict between labor and capital.
the emergence of a labor movement the problem of industrial labor entered americans consciousness dramatically with the great railroad strike of 1877.
protesting steep wage cuts amid the depression that had begun in 1873 thousands of railroad workers walked off the job.
broader issues were at stake.
the officers of the road reported strike leader barney donahue in upstate new york were bound to break the spirit of the men and any or all organizations they belonged to he believed railroad companies wanted to block workers from all fellowship for mutual aid the strike brought rail travel and commerce to a halt.
thousands of people poured into the streets of buffalo pittsburgh and chicago to protest the economic injustice wrought by railroads as well as fires caused by stray sparks from locomotives and injuries and deaths on train tracks in urban neighborhoods.
when pennsylvanias governor sent state militia to break the strike pittsburgh crowds reacted by burning railroad property and overturning locomotives.
similar clashes between police and protesters occurred in other cities across the country from galveston texas to san francisco.
the 1877 strike left more than fifty people dead and caused 40 million worth of damage primarily to railroad property.
it seemed as if the whole social and political structure was on the very brink of ruin wrote one journalist.
for their role in the strike many railroad workers were fired and blacklisted railroad companies circulated their names on a do not hire list to prevent them from getting any work in the industry.
in the aftermath of the strike the u s government created the national guard intended not to protect americans against foreign invasion but to enforce order at home.
watching the upheavals of industrialization some radical thinkers pointed out its impact on workers.
among the most influential was henry george whose book progress and poverty 1879 was a best seller for decades after publication.
george warned that americans had been too optimistic about the impact of railroads and manufacturing which they hoped would after an initial period of turmoil bring prosperity to all.
george believed the emerging industrial order meant permanent poverty.
industrialization he wrote was driving a wedge through society lifting the fortunes of professionals and the middle class but pushing the working class down by forcing them into deskilled dangerous and low paid labor.
georges proposed solution a federal single tax on landholdings did not win widespread support but his insightful diagnosis of the problem helped encourage radical movements for economic reform.
many rural people believed they faced the same problems as industrial workers.
in the new economy they found themselves at the mercy of large corporations from equipment dealers who sold them harvesters and plows to railroads and grain elevators that shipped and stored their products.
though farmers appeared to have more independence than corporate employees many felt trapped in a web of middlemen who chipped away at their profits while international forces robbed them of decision making power.
farmers denounced not only corporations but also the previous two decades of government efforts to foster economic development policies that now seemed wrongheaded.
farmers advocates argued that high tariffs forced rural families to pay too much for basic necessities while failing to protect americas great export crops cotton and wheat.
at the same time they charged republican financial policies benefitted banks not borrowers.
farmers blamed railroad companies for taking government grants and subsidies to build but then charging unequal rates that privileged big manufacturers.
from the farmers point of view public money had been used to build giant railroad companies that turned around and exploited ordinary people.
the most prominent rural protest group of the early postwar decades was the national grange of the patrons of husbandry founded in 1867.
like industrial workers grange farmers sought to counter the rising power of corporate middlemen through cooperation and mutual aid.
local grange halls brought farm families together for recreation and conversation.
the grange set up its own banks insurance companies and grain elevators and in iowa even a farm implement factory.
many grange members also advocated political action building independent local parties that ran on anticorporate platforms.

federal government to print more greenback dollars and increase the amount of money in circulation this they argued would stimulate the economy create jobs and help borrowers by allowing them to pay off debts in dollars that over time slowly decreased in value.
greenbackers like many industrial labor leaders subscribed to the ideal of producerism they dismissed middlemen bankers lawyers and investors as idlers who lived off the sweat of people who worked with their hands.
as a pittsburgh worker put it in an 1878 poem it was not the money handlers or executives at the top but the noble sons of labor.
who with bone and brain and fiber make the nations wealth the greenback movement radicalized thousands of farmers miners and industrial workers.
in alabamas coal mining regions black and white miners cooperated in the party.
texas boasted seventy african american greenback clubs.
in 1878 greenback labor candidates won more than a million votes and the party elected fifteen congressmen nationwide.
in the midwest greenback pressure helped trigger a wave of economic regulatory actions known as granger laws.
by the early 1880s twenty nine states had created railroad commissions to supervise railroad rates and policies others appointed commissions to regulate insurance and utility companies.
such early regulatory efforts were not always effective but they were crucial starting points for reform.
while short lived the greenback movement created the foundation for more sustained efforts to regulate big business.
chapter 17 industrial america corporations and conflicts 1877 1911 the knights of labor the most important union of the late nineteenth century the knights of labor was founded in 1869 as a secret society of garment workers in philadelphia.
in 1878 as the greenback movement reached its height some knights served as delegates to greenback labor conventions.
like grangers knights believed that ordinary people needed control over the enterprises in which they worked.
they proposed to set up shops owned by employees transforming america into what they called a cooperative commonwealth.
in keeping with this broad based vision the order practiced open membership irrespective of race gender or field of employment though like other labor groups the knights excluded chinese immigrants.
the knights had a strong political bent.
they believed that only electoral action could bring about many of their goals such as government regulation of corporations and laws that required employers to negotiate during strikes.
their 1878 platform denounced the aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life the knights warned a check must be placed upon unjust accumulation and the power for evil of aggregated wealth among their demands were workplace safety laws prohibition of child labor a federal tax on the nations highest incomes public ownership of telegraphs and railroads and government recognition of workers right to organize.
the knights also advocated personal responsibility and self discipline.
their leader terence powderly warned that the abuse of liquor robbed as many workers of their wages as did ruthless employers.
growing rapidly in the 1880s the knights union was sprawling and decentralized.
it included not only skilled craftsmen such as carpenters ironworkers and beer brewers but also textile workers in rhode island domestic workers in georgia and tenant farmers in arkansas.
knights organized workingmens parties to advocate a host of reforms ranging from an eight hour workday to cheaper streetcar fares and better garbage collection in urban areas.
one of their key innovations was hiring a full time womens organizer leonora barry.
an irish american widow who was forced into factory work after her husbands death barry became a labor advocate out of horror at the conditions she experienced on the job.
to the discomfort of some male knights she investigated and exposed widespread evidence of sexual harassment on the job.
the knights growth in the 1880s showed the grassroots basis of labor activism.
powderly tried to avoid the knights of labor the caption on this union card by industry we thrive expresses the core principle of the knights of labor that everything of value is the product of honest labor.

strikes which he saw as costly and risky.
but the organizations greatest growth resulted from spontaneous grassroots striking.
in 1885 thousands of workers on the southwest railroad walked off the job to protest wage cuts afterward they telegraphed the knights and asked to be admitted as members.
the strike enhanced the knights reputation among workers and built membership to 750 000.
by the following year local assemblies had sprung up in every state and almost every county in the united states.

mccormick reaper works in part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 industrial violence a dynamited mine 1894 strikes in the western mining regions pitted ruthless owners bent on control of their property and workforce against fiercely independent miners who knew how to use dynamite.
some of the bloodiest conflicts occurred in colorado mining towns where the western federation of miners wfm had strong support and a series of republican governors sent state militia to back the mine owners.
violence broke out repeatedly between the early 1890s and the 1910s.
at victor colorado in may 1894 as dozens of armed sheriffs deputies closed in on angry wfm members occupying the strong mine in protest the miners blew up the mines shaft house and boiler.
showered with debris the deputies boarded the next train out of town.
because colorado then had a populist governor davis waite who sympathized with the miners and ordered the deputies to disband this strike was one of the few in which owners and miners reached a peaceful settlement a temporary victory for the union.
library of congress.
chicago led to a clash with police that left four strikers dead.
three unions including a knights of labor assembly had struck but the knights had reached an agreement and returned to work.
only the machinists union remained on strike when the incident occurred.
chicago was a hotbed of anarchism the revolutionary advocacy of a stateless society.
local anarchists many of them german immigrants called a protest meeting the next day may 4 1886 at haymarket square.
when police tried to disperse the crowd someone threw a bomb that killed several policemen.
officers responded with gunfire.
in the trial that followed eight anarchists were found guilty of murder and criminal conspiracy.
all were convicted not on any definitive evidence that one of them threw the bomb the bombers identity still remains unknown but on the basis of their antigovernment speeches.
four of the eight were executed by hanging one committed suicide in prison and the others received long sentences.
the haymarket violence profoundly damaged the american labor movement.
seizing on resulting antiunion hysteria employers took the offensive.
they broke strikes with mass arrests tied up the knights in expensive court proceedings and forced workers to sign contracts pledging not to join labor organizations.
the knights of labor never recovered.
in the view of the press and many prosperous americans they were tainted by their alleged links with anarchism.
struggles between industrialists and workers had created bitter divides.
farmers and workers the cooperative alliance in the aftermath of haymarket the knights cooperative vision did not entirely fade.
a new rural movement the farmers alliance arose to take up many of the issues that grangers and greenbackers had earlier chapter 17 industrial america corporations and conflicts 1877 1911 sought to address.
founded in texas during the depression of the 1870s the farmers alliance spread across the plains states and the south becoming by the late 1880s the largest farmer based movement in american history.
a separate colored farmers alliance arose to represent rural african americans.
the harsh conditions farmers were enduring including drought in the west and plunging global prices for corn cotton and wheat intensified the movements appeal.
traveling alliance lecturers exhorted farmers to stand as a great conservative body against.
the growing corruption of wealth and power like earlier movements alliance leaders pinned their initial hopes on cooperative stores and exchanges that would circumvent middlemen.
cooperatives gathered farmers orders and bought in bulk at wholesale prices passing the savings along.
alliance cooperatives achieved notable victories in the late 1880s.
the dakota alliance for example offered members cheap hail insurance and low prices on machinery and farm supplies.
the texas alliance established a huge cooperative enterprise to market cotton and provide farmers with cheap loans.
when cotton prices fell further in 1891 however the texas exchange failed.
other cooperatives also suffered from chronic underfunding and lack of credit and they faced hostility from merchants and lenders they tried to circumvent.
the texas farmers alliance thus proposed a federal price support system for farm products modeled on the national banks.
under this plan the federal government would hold crops in public warehouses and issue loans on their value until they could be profitably sold.
when democrats still wary of big government schemes declared the idea too radical alliances in texas kansas south dakota and elsewhere decided to create a new political party the populists see chapter 20.
in this venture the alliance cooperated with the weakened knights of labor seeking to use rural voters substantial clout on behalf of urban workers who shared their vision.
by this time farmer labor coalitions had made a considerable impact on state politics.
but state laws and commissions were proving ineffective against corporations of national and even global scope.
it was difficult for wisconsin for instance to enforce new laws against a railroad company whose lines might stretch from chicago to seattle and whose corporate headquarters might be in minnesota.
militant farmers and labor advocates demanded federal action.
in 1887 responding to this pressure congress and president grover cleveland passed two landmark laws.
the hatch act provided federal funding for agricultural research and education meeting place events farmers demands for government in context aid to agriculture.
the interstate why did farmers and commerce act counteracted a industrial workers supreme court decision of the cooperate and what previous year wabash v illinois political objectives did 1886 that had struck down they achieve.
states authority to regulate railroads.
the act created the interstate commerce commission icc charged with investigating interstate shipping forcing railroads to make their rates public and suing in court when necessary to make companies reduce unjust or unreasonable rates.
though creation of the icc was a direct response to farmer labor demands its final form represented a compromise.
radical leaders wanted congress to establish a direct set of rules under which railroads must operate.
if a railroad did not comply any citizen could take the company to court if the new rules triggered bankruptcy the railroad could convert to public ownership.
but getting such a plan through congress proved impossible.
lawmakers more sympathetic to business called instead for an expert commission to oversee the railroad industry.
in a pattern that repeated frequently over the next few decades the commission model proved more acceptable to the majority of congressmen.
the icc faced formidable challenges.
though the new law forbade railroads from reaching secret ratesetting agreements evidence was difficult to gather and secret pooling continued.
a hostile supreme court also undermined the commissions powers.
in a series of sixteen decisions over the two decades after the icc was created the court sided with railroads fifteen times.
the justices delivered a particularly hard blow in 1897 when they ruled that the icc had no power to interfere with shipping rates.
nonetheless the iccs existence was a major achievement.
in the early twentieth century congress would strengthen the commissions powers and the icc would become one of the most powerful federal agencies charged with overseeing private business.
another path the american federation of labor while the knights of labor exerted political pressure other workers pursued a different strategy.
in the 1870s printers ironworkers bricklayers and other skilled workers organized nationwide trade unions.
these brotherhoods focused on the everyday needs of workers in skilled occupations.
trade unions sought part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 samuel gompers c 1890s samuel gompers 1850 1924 was one of the founders of the american federation of labor and its president for nearly forty years.

union rules specified terms of work sometimes in minute detail.
many unions emphasized mutual aid.
because working on the railroads was a high risk occupation for example brotherhoods of engineers brakemen and firemen pooled contributions into funds that provided accident and death benefits.
above all trade unionism asserted craft workers rights as active decision makers in the workplace trace change not just cogs in a managementover time run machine.
how did the key instituin the early 1880s many trade tions and goals of the unionists joined the knights of labor movement change labor coalition.
but the aftermath and what gains and losses of the haymarket violence perresulted from this shift.
suaded them to leave and create the separate american federation of labor afl.
the man who led them was samuel gompers a dutchjewish cigar maker whose family had emigrated to new york in 1863.
gompers headed the afl for the next thirty years.
he believed the knights relied too much on electoral politics where victories were likely to be limited and he did not share their sweeping critique of capitalism.
the afl made up of relatively skilled and well paid workers was less interested in challenging the corporate order than in winning a larger share of its rewards.
having gone to work at age ten gompers always contended that what he missed at school he more than made up for in the shop where cigar makers paid one of their members to read to them while they worked.
as a young worker intellectual gompers gravitated to new yorks radical circles where he participated in lively debates about which strategies workingmen should pursue.
partly out of these debates and partly from his own experience in the cigar makers union gompers hammered out a doctrine that he called pure and simple unionism.
pure referred to membership strictly limited to workers organized by craft and occupation with no reliance on outside advisors or allies.
simple referred to goals only those that immediately benefitted workers better wages hours and working conditions.
pure and simple unionists distrusted politics.
their aim was collective bargaining with employers.
on one level pure and simple unionism worked.
the afl was small at first but by 1904 its membership rose to more than two million.
in the early twentieth century it became the nations leading voice for workers lasting far longer than movements like the knights of labor.
the afls strategy personified by gompers was well suited to an era when congress and the courts were hostile to labor.
by the 1910s the political climate would become more responsive at that later moment gompers would soften his antipolitical stance and join the battle for new labor laws chapter 20.
what gompers gave up most crucially in the meantime was the inclusiveness of the knights.
by comparison the afl was far less welcoming to women and blacks it included mostly skilled craftsmen.
there was little room in the afl for department store clerks and other service workers much less the farm tenants and domestic servants whom the knights had organized.
despite the afls success among skilled craftsmen the narrowness of its base was a problem that would come back to haunt the labor movement later on.
gompers however saw that corporate titans and their political allies held tremendous power and he chapter 17 advocated what he saw as the most practical defensive plan.
in the meantime the upheaval wrought by industrialization spread far beyond the workplace transforming every aspect of american life.
summary the end of the civil war ushered in the era of american big business.
exploiting the continents vast resources vertically integrated corporations emerged as the dominant business form and giant companies built near monopolies in some sectors of the economy.
corporations devised new modes of production distribution and marketing extending their reach through the department store the mail order catalog and the new advertising industry.
these developments laid the groundwork for mass consumer culture.
they also offered emerging jobs in management sales and office work.
rapid industrialization drew immigrants from around the world.
until the 1920s most european and latin american immigrants were welcome to enter chapter review the united states though they often endured harsh conditions after they arrived.
asian immigrants by contrast faced severe discrimination.
the chinese exclusion act blocked all chinese laborers from coming to the united states it was later extended to other asians and it built the legal framework for broader forms of exclusion.
nationwide movements for workers rights arose in response to industrialization.
during the 1870s and 1880s coalitions of workers and farmers notably the knights of labor and the farmers alliance sought political solutions to what they saw as large corporations exploitation of working people.
pressure from such movements led to the first major attempts to regulate corporations such as the federal interstate commerce act.
radical protest movements were weakened however after public condemnation of anarchist violence in 1886 at chicagos haymarket square.
meanwhile trade unions such as the american federation of labor organized skilled workers and negotiated directly with employers becoming the most popular form of labor organization in the early twentieth century.

including what foods exhibitors would offer.
one cartoonist humorously proposed that russians would serve castor oil arabs would bring camels milk punch and germans would offer beer.
reflecting widespread racial prejudices the cartoon showed chinese men selling hashed cat and rat pie in reality though the 1876 exposition offered only plain lunchrooms and for the wealthiest visitors expensive french fare.
by the early twentieth century american food had undergone a revolution.
visitors to the st louis worlds fair in 1904 could try food from scandinavia india and the philippines.
across the united states chinese american restaurants flourished as a chop suey craze swept the nation.
new yorkers could sample hungarian and syrian cuisine a san francisco journalist enthusiastically reviewed local mexican and japanese restaurants.
even small town diners could often find an italian or german meal.
what had happened.
americans had certainly not lost all their prejudices while plates of chop suey were being gobbled up laws excluding chinese immigrants remained firmly in place.
industrialization reshaped class identities however and promoted a creative consumer culture.
in the great cities amusement parks and vaudeville theaters catered to industrial workers chapter 19.
other institutions served middle class customers who wanted novelty and variety at a reasonable price.
a victorian ethos of selfrestraint and moral uplift gave way to expectations of leisure and fun.
as african americans and women claimed a right to public spaces to shop dine and travel freely they built powerful reform movements.
at the same time the new pressures faced by professional men led to aggressive calls for masculine fitness exemplified by the rise of sports.
stunning scientific discoveries from dinosaur fossils to distant galaxies also challenged long held beliefs.
faced with electricity medical vaccines and other wonders americans celebrated technological solutions to human problems.
but while science gained popularity religion hardly faded.
in fact religious diversity grew as immigrants brought new faiths and protestants responded with innovations of their own.
americans found themselves living in a modern world one in which their grandparents beliefs and ways of life no longer seemed to apply.
in a market driven society that claimed to champion individual freedom americans took advantage of new ideas while expressing anxiety over the accompanying upheavals and risks.

part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 commerce and culture as the united states industrialized the terms middle class and working class came widely into use.
americans adopted these broad identities not only in the workplace but also in their leisure time.
professionals and corporate managers prospered they and their families enjoyed rising income and an array of tempting ways to spend their dollars.
celebrating these new technological wonders americans hailed inventors as heroes.
the most famous thomas edison operated an independent laboratory rather than working for a corporation.
edison like many of the eras businessmen was a shrewd entrepreneur who focused on commercial success.
he and his colleagues helped introduce such lucrative products as the incandescent lightbulb and the phonograph which came widely into use in american homes.
even working class americans enjoyed cheaper products delivered by global trade and mass production from bananas and cigarettes to colorful dime novels and magazines.
edisons moving pictures for example first found popularity among the urban working class chapter 19.
consumer culture appeared at least to be democratic anyone should be able to eat at a restaurant or buy a rail ticket for the ladies car as long as she or he could pay.
in practice though this was not the case and consumer venues became sites of struggle over class inequality race privilege and proper male and female behavior.
consumer spaces americas public spaces from election polls to saloons and circus shows had long been boisterous and male centered.
a woman who ventured there pacific railway poster c 1900 this color lithograph emphasized the family atmosphere of the railroads pullman palace dining cars.
pullman a chicago based manufacturer became a household name by providing high class sleeping and dining cars to the nations railroads.
such advertisements invited prosperous americans to make themselves at home in public commercial spaces that were safe and comfortable for respectable women and children.
note that all the passengers are white and the waiters black.
work as a railroad waiter or porter was one of the better paid more prestigious jobs available to african american men.
demands for segregated rail cars often focused on the alleged threat that black men might pose to white women while at the same time such men and women regularly came in contact as railroad employees and passengers.

chapter 15 of 1864 placing lincoln and this war democrat on the ticket together had seemed a smart move designed to promote unity.
but after lincolns death johnsons disagreement with republicans combined with his belligerent and contradictory actions wreaked political havoc.
the new president and congress confronted a set of problems that would have challenged even lincoln.
during the war unionists had insisted that rebel leaders were a small minority and most white southerners wanted to rejoin the union.
with even greater optimism republicans hoped the defeated south would accept postwar reforms.
ex confederates however contested that plan through both violence and political action.
new southern state legislatures created under johnsons limited reconstruction plan moved to restore slavery in all but name.
in 1865 they enacted black codes designed to force former slaves back to plantation labor.
like similar laws passed in other places after slavery ended the codes reflected plantation owners economic interests america compared p 482.
they imposed severe penalties on blacks who did not hold full year labor contracts and also set up procedures for taking black children from their parents and apprenticing them to former slave masters.
faced with these developments johnson gave all the wrong signals.
he had long talked tough against southern planters.
but in practice johnson allied himself with ex confederate leaders forgiving them when they appealed for pardons.
white southern leaders were delighted.
by this wise and noble statesmanship wrote a confederate legislator you have become the benefactor of the southern people northerners and freedmen were disgusted.
the president had left reconstruction to the tender mercies of the rebels wrote one republican.
an angry union veteran in missouri called johnson a traitor to the loyal people of the union emboldened by johnsons indulgence exconfederates began to filter back into the halls of power.
when georgians elected alexander stephens former vice president of the confederacy to represent them in congress many outraged republicans saw this as the last straw.
congress versus the president under the constitution congress is the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members article 1 section 5.
using this power republican majorities in both houses had refused to admit southern delegations when congress convened in december 1865 effectively blocking johnsons reconstruction 1865 1877 program.
hoping to mollify congress some southern states dropped the most objectionable provisions from their black codes.
but at the same time antiblack violence erupted in various parts of the south.
congressional republicans concluded that the federal government had to intervene.
back in march 1865 congress had established the freedmens bureau to aid displaced blacks and other war refugees.
in early 1866 congress voted to extend the bureau gave it direct funding for the first time and authorized its agents to investigate southern abuses.
even more extraordinary was the civil rights act of 1866 which declared formerly enslaved people to be citizens and granted them equal protection and rights of contract with full access to the courts.
these bills provoked bitter conflict with johnson who vetoed them both.
johnsons racism hitherto publicly muted now blazed forth this is a country for white men and by god as long as i am president it shall be a government for white men galvanized republicans in congress gathered two thirds majorities and overrode both vetoes passing the civil rights act in april 1866 and the freedmens bureau law four months later.
their resolve was reinforced by continued upheaval in the south.
in addition to the violence in memphis twenty four black political leaders and their allies in arkansas were murdered and their homes burned.
anxious to protect freedpeople and reassert republican power in the south congress took further measures to sustain civil rights.
in what became the fourteenth amendment 1868 it declared that all persons born or naturalized in the united states were citizens.
no state could abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law or deny anyone equal protection in a stunning increase of federal power the fourteenth amendment declared that when peoples essential rights were at stake national citizenship henceforth took priority over citizenship in a state.
johnson opposed ratification but public opinion had swung against him.
in the 1866 congressional elections voters gave republicans a 3 to 1 majority in congress.
power shifted to the so called radical republicans who sought sweeping transformations in the place events defeated south.
radicals leader in context in the senate was charles sumner under what circumstances did the fourteenth amendof massachusetts the fiery aboliment win passage and tionist who in 1856 had been what problems did its nearly beaten to death by south authors seek to address.
carolina congressman preston america c o m pa r e d labor laws after emancipation haiti and the united states many government officials agreed with former masters on the need to control rural workers.
often planters themselves or allied with the planter class they believed that economic strength and public revenue depended on plantation export crops and that workers would not produce those without legal coercion.
this was true in the british caribbean and also haiti which eventually after a successful slave revolt ending in 1803 became an independent republic led by former slaves and in particular by propertied free men of color.
in the passage below a british observer describes a rural labor code adopted by haitis government in 1826.
despite the law haitis large plantations did not revive the islands economy even more than that of the u s south came to be dominated by small scale impoverished farmers.
the code of laws before us is one that could only have been framed by a legislature composed of proprietors of land having at their command a considerable military power of which they themselves were the leaders for a population whom it was necessary to compel to labour.
the choice of a master altho expressly reserved to the labourer is greatly modified by the clauses which restrain the labourer from quitting the section of country to which he belongs and from the absence of any clause compelling proprietors to engage him so that the cultivator must consent to bind himself to whomsoever may be willing to engage him or remain in prison to be employed among convicts.
the code begins article 1 by declaring agriculture to be the foundation of national prosperity and then decrees article 3 that all persons excepting soldiers and civil servants of the state professional persons artizans and domestic servants shall cultivate the soil.
the next clause article 4 forbids the inhabitants of the country quitting it to dwell in towns or villages and every kind of wholesale or retail trade is forbidden article 7 to be exercised by persons dwelling in the country.
further articles stipulate that any person dwelling in the country not being the owner or occupier of land and not having bound himself in the manner directed.
shall be considered a vagabond be arrested and taken before a justice who after reading the law to him shall commit him to jail until he consent to bind himself according to law.
those who are hired from a job master labor agent.
are entitled to receive half the produce after deducting the expences of cultivation those who are bound to the proprietor directly one fourth of the gross produce of their labour.
out of their miserable pittance these haitian labourers are to provide themselves and their children with almost every thing and to lay by a provision for old age.
these with the regulations already detailed clearly shew what is intended to be the condition of the labouring population of haiti.
i must not call it slavery the word is objectionable but few of the ingredients of slavery seem to be wanting.
radicals in the house followed thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania a passionate advocate of freedmens political and economic rights.
with such men at the fore and with congressional republicans now numerous and united enough to override johnsons vetoes on many questions congress proceeded to remake reconstruction.
questions for analysis 1.

johnson however had misjudged grant who publicly objected to the presidents machinations.
when the senate overruled stantons suspension grant now an open enemy of johnson resigned so stanton could resume his place as secretary of war.
on february 21 1868 johnson formally dismissed stanton.
the feisty secretary of war responded by barricading himself in his office precipitating a crisis.

congress required the four states remaining under federal control to ratify the measure as a condition for readmission to the union.
a year later the fifteenth amendment became law.
passage of the fifteenth amendment despite its limitations was an astonishing feat.
elsewhere in the western hemisphere lawmakers had left emancipated slaves in a condition of semi citizenship with no voting rights.
but like almost all americans congressional republicans had extraordinary faith in the power of the vote.

to see a longer excerpt of the arkansas delegates document along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
woman suffrage denied passage of the fifteenth amendment was a bittersweet victory for one group of union loyalists women.
some formerly enslaved women believed they would win voting rights along with their men until northern allies corrected that impression.
national womens rights leaders who had campaigned for the ballot since the seneca falls convention of 1848 hoped to secure voting rights for women and african american men at the same time.
as elizabeth cady stanton put it women could avail ourselves of the strong arm and the blue uniform of the black soldier to walk in by his side the protected categories for voting in the fifteenth amendment could have read race color sex or previous condition of servitude but that word proved impossible to obtain.
enfranchising black men had clear benefits for the authors of reconstruction.
it punished ex confederates and ensured republican support in the south.
but womens partisan loyalties were not so clear and a substantial majority of northern voters all men of course opposed womens enfranchisement.
even radicals feared that this side issue would overburden their program.
influential abolitionists such as wendell philips refused to campaign for womens suffrage fearing it would detract from the focus on black men.
philips criticized womens leaders for being selfish do you believe stanton hotly replied the african race is entirely composed of males by may 1869 the former allies were at an impasse.

douglasss plea.
one african american woman remarked that they all go for sex letting race occupy a minor position embittered elizabeth cady stanton lashed out against patrick and sambo and hans and ung tung maligning uneducated freedmen and immigrants who could vote while educated white women could not.
douglasss resolution in support of the fifteenth amendment failed and the convention broke up.
at this searing moment a rift opened in the womens movement.
the majority led by lucy stone reconciled themselves to disappointment.
organized into the american woman suffrage association they remained loyal to the republican party in hopes that once reconstruction had been settled it would be womens turn.
a group led by elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony struck out in a new direction.
they saw that once the reconstruction amendments had passed womens suffrage was unlikely in the near future.
stanton declared that woman must not put her trust in man the new organization she headed understand points of view the national woman suffrage association nwsa focused exclusively on womens rights and took up the battle for a federal suffrage amendment.
in 1873 nwsa members decided to test the new constitutional amendments.
suffragists all over the united states including some black women in the south tried to register and vote.
most were turned away.
in an ensuing lawsuit suffrage advocate virginia minor of missouri argued that the registrar who denied her a ballot had violated her rights under the fourteenth amendment.
in minor v happersett 1875 the supreme court dashed such hopes.
it ruled that suffrage rights were not inherent in citizenship women were citizens but state legislatures could deny women the vote if they wished.
despite these defeats radical reconstruction had created the conditions for a nationwide womens rights movement.
some argued for suffrage as part of a broader expansion of democracy.
others on the contrary saw white womens votes as a possible counterweight to the votes of african american or chinese men while opponents pointed out that black and immigrant women would likely be enfranchised too.
when wyoming territory gave women full voting rights in 1869 its governor received telegrams of congratulation from around the world.

womens chapter 15 suffrage could no longer be dismissed as the absurd notion of a tiny minority.
it had become a serious issue for national debate.
the meaning of freedom while political leaders wrangled in washington emancipated slaves acted on their own ideas about freedom american voices p 488.
emancipation meant many things the end of punishment by the lash the ability to move around reunion of families and opportunities to build schools and churches and to publish and read newspapers.
foremost among freedpeoples demands were voting rights and economic autonomy.
former confederates opposed these goals.
most southern whites believed the proper place for blacks was as servants and inferiors as a virginia planter testified to congress.
mississippis governor elected under president johnsons plan vowed that ours is and it shall ever be a government of white men meanwhile as reconstruction unfolded it became clear that on economic questions southern blacks and northern republican policymakers did not see eye to eye.
the quest for land during the civil war wherever union forces had conquered portions of the south rural black workers had formed associations that agreed on common goals and even practiced military drills.
after the war when resettlement became the responsibility of the freedmens bureau thousands of rural blacks hoped for land distributions.
but johnsons amnesty plan which allowed pardoned confederates to recover property seized during the war blasted such hopes.
in october 1865 for example johnson ordered general oliver o howard head of the freedmens bureau to restore plantations on south carolinas sea islands to white property holders.
dispossessed blacks protested why do you take away our lands.
you take them from us who have always been true always true to the government.
you give them to our all time enemies.
that is not right former slaves resisted efforts to evict them.
led by black union veterans they fought pitched battles with former slaveholders and bands of exconfederate soldiers.
but white landowners sometimes aided by federal troops generally prevailed.
freed slaves and northerners conflicting goals on questions of land and labor freedmen in the south and republicans in washington seriously differed.
the reconstruction 1865 1877 economic revolution of the antebellum period had transformed new england and the mid atlantic states.
believing similar development could revolutionize the south most congressional leaders sought to restore cotton as the countrys leading export and they envisioned former slaves as wageworkers on cash crop plantations not independent farmers.
only a handful of radicals like thaddeus stevens argued that freed slaves had earned a right to land grants through what lincoln had referred to as four hundred years of unrequited toil stevens proposed that southern plantations be treated as forfeited estates of the enemy and broken up into small farms for former slaves.
nothing will make men so industrious and moral stevens declared as to let them feel that they are above want and are the owners of the soil which they till today most historians of reconstruction agree with stevens policymakers did not do enough to ensure freedpeoples economic security.
without land former slaves were left poor and vulnerable.
at the time though stevens had few allies.
a deep veneration for private property lay at the heart of his vision but others interpreted the same principle differently they defined ownership by legal title not by labor invested.
though often accused of harshness toward the defeated confederacy most republicans even radicals could not imagine giving land to former slaves.
the same congressmen of course had no difficulty giving away homesteads on the frontier that had been taken from indians.
but they were deeply reluctant to confiscate white owned plantations.
some southern republican state governments did try without much success to use tax policy to break up large landholdings and get them into the hands of poorer whites and blacks.
in 1869 south carolina established a land commission to buy property and resell it on easy terms to the landless about 14 000 black families acquired farms through the program.
but such initiatives were the exception not the rule.
over time some rural blacks did succeed in becoming small scale landowners especially in upper south states such as virginia north carolina and tennessee.
but it was an uphill fight and policymakers provided little aid.
wage labor and sharecropping without land most freedpeople had few options but to work for former slave owners.
landowners wanted to retain the old gang labor system with wages replacing the food clothing and shelter that slaves had once received.
southern planters who had recently scorned the north for the cruelties of wage labor now embraced american voices freedom slavery meant one thing to slave masters something altogether different to those enslaved.
emancipation exposed these radically different points of view.
henry william ravenel edward barnell heyward diary march 8 1865 letter january 22 1866 ravenel from a formerly wealthy plantation family in south carolina wrote amid the confederacys collapse and the aftermath of defeat.
in this letter to a friend in the north the son of a south carolina plantation owner made grim predictions for the future.
the breath of emancipation has passed over the country we are now in that transition state between the new the old systems a state of chaos disorder.
will the negro be materially benefitted by the change.
will the condition of the country in its productive resources in material prosperity be improved.
will it be a benefit to the landed proprietors.
these are questions which will have their solution in the future.
they are in the hands of that providence which over ruleth all things for good.
it was a strong conviction of my best judgment that the old relation of master slave had received the divine sanction was the best condition in which the two races could live together for mutual benefit.
there were many defects to be corrected many abuses to be remedied.
among these defects i will enumerate the want of legislation to make the marriage contract binding to prevent the separation of families to restrain the cupidity of cruel masters.
perhaps it is for neglecting these obligations that god has seen fit to dissolve that relation.
i believe the negro must remain in this country that his condition although a freed man must be to labour on the soil.
nothing but necessity will compel him to labour.
now the question is will that necessity be so strong as to compel him to labour which will be profitable to the landed proprietors.
will he make as much cotton sugar rice tobacco for the world as he did previously.
they will now have a choice where to labour.
this will ensure good treatment the best terms.
the most humane the most energetic the most judicious managers have the best chances in the race for success.
i expect to see a revolution in the ownership of landed estates.
those only can succeed who bring the best capacity for the business.
time will show.
my dear jim your letter of date july 1865 has just reached me and you will be relieved by my answers to find that i am still alive and extremely glad to hear from you.
i have served in the army my brother died in the army and every family has lost members.
no one can know how reduced we are particularly the refined educated.
my father had five plantations on the coast and all the buildings were burnt and the negroes now left to themselves are roaming in a starvation condition.
like lost sheep with no one to care for them.
they find the yankee only a speculator and they have no confidence in anyone.
they very naturally poor things think that freedom means doing nothing and this they are determined to do.
they look to the government to take care of them and it will be many years before this once productive country will be able to support itself.
the former kind and just treatment of the slaves and their docile and generous temper make them now disposed to be quiet and obedient but the determination of your northern people to give them a place in the councils of the country and make them the equal of the white man will at last bear its fruit and we may then expect them to rise against the whites and in the end be exterminated themselves.
i am now interested in a school for the negroes who are around me and will endeavor to do my duty to them as ever before but i am afraid their best days are past.
i feel now that i have no country i obey like a subject but i cannot love such a government.
perhaps the next letter you get from me will be from england.

i am doing tolerably well here.
i get twenty five dollars a month with victuals and clothing have a comfortable home for mandy the folks here call her mrs anderson and the children milly jane and grundy go to school and are learning well.
mandy says she would be afraid to go back without some proof that you were disposed to treat us justly and kindly and we have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send us our wages for the time we served you.
this will make us forget and forgive old scores and rely on your justice and friendship in the future.
i served you faithfully for thirty two years and mandy twenty years.
at twenty five dollars a month for me and two dollars a week for mandy our earnings would amount to eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars.
add to this the interest for the time our wages have been kept back and deduct what you paid for our clothing and three doctors visits to me and pulling a tooth for mandy and the balance will show what we are in justice entitled to.
please send the balance by adams express in care of v winters esq dayton ohio.
if you do not pay us for faithful labors in the past we can have little faith in your promises in the future.
in answering this letter please state if there would be any safety for my milly and jane who are now grown up and both good looking girls.
i would rather stay here and starve and die if it come to that than have my girls brought to shame by the violence and wickedness of their young masters.

wage work with apparent satisfaction.
maliciously comparing black workers to free roaming pigs landowners told them to root hog or die former slaves found themselves with rock bottom wages it was a shock to find that emancipation and free labor did not prevent a hardworking family from nearly starving.
african american workers used a variety of tactics to fight back.
as early as 1865 alarmed whites across the south reported that former slaves were holding mass meetings to agree on plans and terms for labor such meetings continued through the reconstruction years.
facing limited prospects at home some workers left the fields and traveled long distances to seek betterpaying jobs on the railroads or in turpentine and lumber camps.
others from rice cultivators to laundry workers organized strikes.
at the same time struggles raged between employers and freedpeople over womens work.
in slavery african american womens bodies had been the sexual property of white men.
protecting black women from such abuse as much as possible was a crucial priority for freedpeople.
when planters demanded that black women go back into the fields african americans resisted resolutely.
i seen on some plantations one freedman recounted where the white men would.
tell colored men that their wives and children could not live on their places unless they work in the fields.
the colored men answered that whenever they wanted their wives to work they would tell them themselves there was a profound irony in this mans definition of freedom it designated a wifes labor as her husbands chapter 15 gin house ary nd plantation bou map 15 2 the barrow plantation 1860 and 1881 this map is a modern redrawing of one that first appeared in the popular magazine scribners monthly in april 1881 accompanying an article about the barrow plantation.
comparing the 1860 map of this central georgia plantation with the 1881 map reveals the impact of sharecropping on patterns of black residence.
in 1860 the slave quarters were clustered near the planters house.
in contrast by 1881 the sharecroppers were scattered across the plantations 2 000 acres having built cabins on the ridges between the low lying streams.
the surname barrow was common among the sharecropping families which means almost certainly that they had been slaves who years after emancipation still had not moved on.
for sharecroppers freedom meant not only their individual lots and cabins but also the school and church shown on the map.

but cotton planters lacked money to pay wages and sometimes in lieu of a wage they offered a share of the crop.
freedmen in turn paid their rent in shares of the harvest.
thus the reconstruction years gave rise to a distinctive system of cotton agriculture known as sharecropping in which freedmen worked as renters exchanging their labor for the use of land house implements and sometimes seed and fertilizer.
sharecroppers typically turned over half of their crops to the landlord map 15 2.
in a credit starved agricultural region that grew crops for a world economy sharecropping was an effective strategy enabling laborers and landowners to share risks and returns.
but it was a very s property.
some black women asserted their independence and headed their own households though this was often a matter of necessity rather than choice.
for many freedpeople the opportunity for a stable family life was one of the greatest achievements of emancipation.
many enthusiastically accepted the northern ideal of domesticity.
missionaries teachers and editors of black newspapers urged men to work diligently and support their families and they told women though many worked for wages to devote themselves to motherhood and the home.
even in rural areas former slaves refused to work under conditions that recalled slavery.
there would be no gang work they vowed no overseers no whippings no regulation of their private lives.
across the south planters who needed labor were forced to yield to what one planter termed the prejudices of the freedmen reconstruction 1865 1877 part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 unequal relationship.
starting out penniless sharecroppers had no way to make it through the first growing season without borrowing for food and supplies.
country storekeepers stepped in.
bankrolled by northern suppliers they furnished sharecroppers with provisions and took as collateral a lien on the crop effectively assuming ownership of croppers shares and leaving them only what remained after debts had been paid.
crop lien laws enforced lenders ownership rights to the crop share.
once indebted at a store sharecroppers became easy targets for exorbitant prices unfair interest rates and crooked bookkeeping.
as cotton prices declined in the 1870s more and more sharecroppers fell into permanent debt.
if the merchant was also the landowner or conspired with the landowner debt became a pretext for forced labor or peonage.
sharecropping arose in part because it was a good fit for cotton agriculture.
cotton unlike sugarcane could be raised efficiently by small farmers provided they had the lash of indebtedness identify causes always on their backs.
we can see why did sharecropping this in the experience of other emerge and how did it regions that became major proaffect freedpeople and the ducers in response to the global southern economy.
cotton shortage set off by the civil war.
in india egypt brazil and west africa variants of the sharecropping system emerged.
everywhere international merchants and bankers who put up capital insisted on passage of crop lien laws.
indian and egyptian villagers ended up like their american counterparts permanently under the thumb of furnishing merchants.
by 1890 three out of every four black farmers in the south were tenants or sharecroppers among white farmers the ratio was one in three.
for freedmen sharecropping was not the worst choice in a world where former masters threatened to impose labor conditions that were close to slavery.
but the costs were devastating.
with farms leased on a year to year basis neither tenant nor owner had much incentive to improve the property.
the crop lien system rested on expensive interest payments money that might otherwise have gone into agricultural improvements or to meet human needs.
and sharecropping committed the south inflexibly to cotton a crop that generated the cash required by landlords and furnishing merchants.
the result was a stagnant farm economy that blighted the souths future.
as republican governments tried to remake the region they confronted not only wartime destruction but also the failure of their hopes that free cotton farmers marietta georgia c 1880 before the civil war the south had proudly called itself the cotton kingdom after the war cotton was still king but few southerners got rich on cotton profits.
instead thousands of small scale farmers white and black struggled with plunging crop prices debt and taxes on land to support an array of ambitious reconstruction programs.

chapter 15 labor would create a modern prosperous south built in the image of the industrializing north.
instead the souths rural economy remained mired in widespread poverty and based on an uneasy compromise between landowners and laborers.
republican governments in the south between 1868 and 1871 all the former confederate states met congressional stipulations and rejoined the union.
protected by federal troops republican administrations in these states retained power for periods ranging from a few months in virginia to nine years in south carolina louisiana and florida.
these governments remain some of the most misunderstood institutions in all u s history.
ex confederates never accepted their legitimacy.
many other whites agreed focusing particularly on the role of african americans who began to serve in public office.
it is strange abnormal and unfit declared one british visitor to louisiana that a negro legislature should deal.
with the gravest commercial and financial interests during much of the twentieth century historians echoed such critics condemning reconstruction leaders as ignorant and corrupt.
these historians shared the racial prejudices of the british observer blacks were simply unfit to govern.
in fact reconstruction governments were ambitious.
they were hated in part because they undertook impressive reforms in public education family law social services commerce and transportation.
like their northern allies southern republicans admired the economic and social transformations that had occurred in the north before the civil war and worked energetically to import them.
the southern republican party included former whigs a few former democrats black and white newcomers from the north and southern african americans.
from the start its leaders faced the dilemma of racial prejudice.
in the upcountry white unionists were eager to join the party but sometimes reluctant to work with black allies.
in most areas the republicans also desperately needed african americans who constituted a majority of registered voters in alabama florida south carolina and mississippi.
for a brief moment in the late 1860s black and white republicans joined forces through the union league a secret fraternal order.
formed in border states and northern cities during the civil war the league became a powerful political association that spread through the former confederacy.
functioning as a grassroots wing of radical republicanism it reconstruction 1865 1877 pressured congress to uphold justice for freedmen.
after blacks won voting rights the league organized meetings at churches and schoolhouses to instruct freedmen on political issues and voting procedures.
league clubs held parades and military drills giving a public face to the new political order.
the freedmens bureau also supported grassroots reconstruction efforts.
though some bureau officials sympathized with planters most were dedicated idealistic men who tried valiantly to reconcile opposing interests.
bureau men kept a sharp eye out for unfair labor contracts and often forced landowners to bargain with workers and tenants.
they advised freedmen on economic matters provided direct payments to desperate families especially women and children and helped establish schools.
in cooperation with northern aid societies the bureau played a key role in founding african american colleges and universities such as fisk tougaloo and the hampton institute.
these institutions in turn focused on training teachers.
by 1869 there were more than three thousand teachers instructing freedpeople in the south.
more than half were themselves african americans.
ex confederates viewed the union league freedmens bureau and republican party as illegitimate forces in southern affairs and they resented the political education of freedpeople.
they referred to southern whites who supported reconstruction as scalawags an ancient scots irish term for worthless animals and denounced northern whites as carpetbaggers self seeking interlopers who carried all their property in cheap suitcases called carpetbags.
such labels glossed over the actual diversity of white republicans.
many arrivals from the north while motivated by personal profit also brought capital and skills.
interspersed with ambitious schemers were reformers hoping to advance freedmens rights.
so called scalawags were even more varied.
some southern republicans were former slave owners others were ex whigs or even ex democrats who hoped to attract northern capital.
but most hailed from the backcountry and wanted to rid the south of its slaveholding aristocracy believing slavery had victimized whites as well as blacks.
southern democrats contempt for black politicians whom they regarded as ignorant field hands was just as misguided as their stereotypes about white republicans.
many african american leaders in the south came from the ranks of antebellum free blacks.
others were skilled men like robert smalls of south carolina who as a slave had worked for wages that he turned over to his master.
smalls a steamer pilot in part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 hiram r revels in 1870 hiram rhoades revels 1827 1901 was elected to the u s senate from mississippi to fill jefferson daviss former seat.
revels was a free black from north carolina who had moved to the north and attended knox college in illinois.
during the civil war he had recruited african americans for the union army and as an ordained methodist minister served as chaplain of a black regiment in mississippi where he settled after the war.

in 1869 he moved to mississippi and became five years later mississippis second black u s senator.
political leaders such as smalls and bruce were joined by northern blacks including ministers teachers and union veterans who moved south to support reconstruction.
during radical reconstruction such men fanned out into plantation districts and recruited former slaves to participate in politics.

in south carolina african americans constituted a majority in the lower house of the legislature in 1868.
over the course of reconstruction twenty african americans served in state administrations as governor lieutenant governor secretary of state or lesser offices.
more than six hundred became state legislators and sixteen were congressmen.
both white and black republicans had big plans.
their southern reconstruction governments eliminated property qualifications for the vote and abolished black codes.
their new state constitutions expanded the rights of married women enabling them to own their own property and wages a wonderful reform one white woman in georgia wrote for the cause of womens rights like their counterparts in the north southern republicans also believed in using government to foster economic growth.
seeking to diversify the economy beyond cotton agriculture they poured money into railroads and other projects.
in myriad ways republicans brought southern state and city governments up to date.
they outlawed corporal punishments such as whipping and branding.
they established hospitals and asylums for orphans and the disabled.
south carolina offered free public health services while alabama provided free legal representation for defendants who could not pay.
some municipal governments paved streets and installed streetlights.
petersburg virginia established a board of health that offered free medical care during the smallpox epidemic of 1873.
nashville tennessee created soup kitchens for the poor.
most impressive of all were achievements in public education where the south had lagged woefully.
republicans viewed education as the foundation of a true democratic order.
by 1875 over half of black children were attending school in mississippi florida and south carolina.
african americans of all ages rushed to the newly established schools even when they had to pay tuition.
they understood why slaveholders had criminalized slave literacy the practice of freedom rested on the ability to read newspapers labor contracts history books and the bible.
a school official in virginia reported that freedpeople were crazy to learn one louisiana man explained why he was sending his children to school even though he needed their help in the field.
it was better than leaving them a fortune because if you left them even five hundred dollars some man having more education than they had would come along and cheat them out of it all chapter 15 thousands of white children particularly girls and the sons of poor farmers and laborers also benefitted from new public education systems.
young white womens graduation from high school an unheard of occurrence before the civil war became a celebrated event in southern cities and towns.
southern reconstruction governments also had their flaws flaws that would become more apparent as the 1870s unfolded.
in the race for economic development for example state officials allowed private companies to hire out prisoners to labor in mines and other industries in a notorious system known as convict leasing.
corruption was rife and conditions horrific.
in 1866 alabamas governor leased 200 state convicts to a railroad construction company for the grand total of 5.
while they labored to build state subsidized lines such as the alabama and chattanooga prisoners were housed at night in open rolling cages.
physical abuse was common and medical care nonexistent.
at the start of 1869 alabama counted 263 prisoners available for leasing by the end of the year a staggering 92 of them had died.
while convict leasing expanded in later decades it began during reconstruction supported by both republicans and democrats.
building black communities in slavery days african americans had built networks of religious worship and mutual aid but these operated largely in secret.
after emancipation southern blacks could engage in open community building.
in doing so they cooperated with northern missionaries and teachers both black and white who came to help in the freedmens school petersburg virginia 1870s a union veteran returning to virginia in the 1870s to photograph battlefields captured this image of an african american teacher and her students at a freedmens school.
note the difficult conditions in which they study many are barefoot and there are gaps in the walls and floor of the school building.
nonetheless the students have a few books.
despite poverty and relentless hostility from many whites freedpeople across the south were determined to get a basic education for themselves and their children.

while preaching they drink down and respond to with an earnestness that sets your heart all on fire independent churches quickly became central community institutions as blacks across the south left white dominated congregations where they had sat in segregated balconies and built churches of their own.
these churches joined their counterparts in the north to become national denominations including most prominently the national baptist convention and the african methodist episcopal church.
black churches served not only as sites of worship but also as schools social centers and meeting halls.
ministers were often political spokesmen as well.
as charles h pearce a black methodist pastor in florida declared a man in this state cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people religious leaders articulated the special destiny of freedpeople as the new children of israel the flowering of black churches schools newspapers and civic groups was one of the most enduring initiatives of the reconstruction era.
dedicated teachers and charity leaders embarked on a project of race uplift that never ceased thereafter while black part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 fisk jubilee singers 1873 fisk university in nashville tennessee was established in 1865 to provide higher education for african americans from all across the south.
when university funds ran short in 1871 the jubilee singers choral group was formed and began touring to raise money for the school.
they performed african american spirituals and folksongs such as swing low sweet chariot arranged in ways that appealed to white audiences making this music nationally popular for the first time.

money raised by this acclaimed chorale saved fisk from bankruptcy.

others made it clear that they preferred their children to attend all black schools especially if they encountered hostile or condescending white teachers and classmates.
many had pragmatic concerns.
asked whether she wanted her boys to attend an integrated school one woman in new orleans said no i dont want my children to be pounded by.
white boys.
i dont send them to school to fight i send them to learn at the national level congressmen wrestled with similar issues as they debated an ambitious civil rights bill championed by radical republican senator charles sumner.
sumner first introduced his bill in 1870 seeking to enforce among other things equal access to schools public transportation hotels and churches.
despite a series of defeats and delays the bill remained on capitol hill for five years.
opponents charged that shared public spaces would lead to race mixing and intermarriage.
some sympathetic republicans feared a backlash while others questioned whether because of the first amendment the federal government had the right to regulate churches.
on his deathbed in 1874 sumner exhorted a visitor to remember the civil rights bill dont let it fail in the end the senate removed sumners provision for integrated churches and the house removed the clause requiring integrated schools.
but to honor the great massachusetts abolitionist congress passed the civil rights act of 1875.
the law required full and equal access to jury service and to transportation and public accommodations irrespective of race.
it was the last such act for almost a hundred years until the civil rights act of 1964.
chapter 15 the undoing of reconstruction sumners death marked the waning of radical reconstruction.
that movement had accomplished more than anyone dreamed a few years earlier.
but a chasm had opened between the goals of freedmen who wanted autonomy and policymakers whose first priorities were to reincorporate ex confederates into the nation and build a powerful national economy.
meanwhile the north was flooded with one sided racist reports such as james m pikes influential book the prostrate state 1873 which claimed south carolina was in the grip of black barbarism events of the 1870s deepened the northern publics disillusionment.
scandals rocked the grant administration and an economic depression curbed both private investment and public spending.
at the same time northern resolve was worn down by continued ex confederate resistance and violence.
only full scale military intervention could reverse the situation in the south and by the mid 1870s the north had no political willpower to renew the occupation.
the republicans unravel republicans had banked on economic growth to underpin their ambitious program but their hopes were dashed in 1873 by the sudden onset of a severe worldwide depression.
in the united states the initial panic was triggered by the bankruptcy of the northern pacific railroad backed by leading financier jay cooke.
cookes supervision of union finances during the civil war had made him a national hero his downfall was a shock and since cooke was so well connected in washington it raised suspicions that republican financial manipulation had caused the depression.
officials in the grant administration deepened public resentment toward their party when they rejected pleas to increase the money supply and provide relief from debt and unemployment.
the impact of the depression varied in different parts of the united states.
farmers suffered a terrible plight as crop prices plunged while industrial workers faced layoffs and sharp wage reductions.
within a year 50 percent of american iron manufacturing had stopped.
by 1877 half the nations railroad companies had filed for bankruptcy.
rail construction halted.
with hundreds of thousands thrown out of work people took to the road.
wandering tramps who camped by railroad tracks and knocked on doors reconstruction 1865 1877 to beg for work and food terrified prosperous americans.
in addition to discrediting republicans the depression directly undercut their policies most dramatically in the south.
the ex confederacy was still recovering from the ravages of war and its new economic and social order remained fragile.
the bold policies of southern republicans for education public health and grants to railroad builders cost a great deal of money.
federal support through programs like the freedmens bureau had begun to fade even before 1873.
republicans had banked on major infusions of northern and foreign investment capital for the most part these failed to materialize.
investors who had sunk money into confederate bonds only to have those repudiated were especially wary.
the souths economy grew more slowly than republicans had hoped and after 1873 growth screeched to a halt.
state debts mounted rapidly and as crushing interest on bonds fell due public credit collapsed.
not only had republican officials failed to anticipate a severe depression during the era of generous spending considerable funds had also been wasted or had ended up in the pockets of corrupt officials.
two swindlers in north carolina one of them a former union general were found to have distributed more than 200 000 in bribes and loans to legislators to gain millions in state funds for rail construction.
instead of building railroads they used the money to travel to europe and speculate in stocks and bonds.
not only republicans were on the take.
you are mistaken wrote one southern democrat to a northern friend if you suppose that all the evils.
result from the carpetbaggers and negroes.
the democrats are leagued with them when anything is proposed that promises to pay in south carolina when african american congressman robert smalls was convicted of taking a bribe the democratic governor pardoned him in exchange for an agreement that federal officials would drop an investigation of democratic election frauds.
one of the depressions most tragic results was the failure of the freedmans savings and trust company.
this private bank founded in 1865 had worked closely with the freedmens bureau and union army across the south.
former slaves associated it with the party of lincoln and thousands responded to northerners call for thrift and savings by bringing their small deposits to the nearest branch.
african american farmers entrepreneurs churches and charitable groups opened accounts at the bank.
but in the early 1870s the banks directors sank their money into risky loans and speculative investments.
in june 1874 the bank failed.
part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 some republicans believed that because the bank had been so closely associated with the u s army and federal agencies congress had a duty to step in.
even one southern democrat argued that the government was morally bound to see to it that not a dollar is lost but in the end congress refused to compensate the 61 000 depositors.
about half recovered small amounts averaging 18 51 but the others received nothing.
the party of reconstruction was losing its moral gloss.

for the planting or spreading of slavery in 1787 1821 and 1850 the north and south had resolved their differences over slavery.
in 1861 there would be no compromise.
in his march 1861 inaugural address lincoln carefully outlined his positions.
he promised to safeguard slavery where it existed but vowed to prevent its expansion.
equally important the republican president declared that the union was perpetual consequently the secession of the confederate states was illegal.
lincoln asserted his intention to hold occupy and possess federal property in the seceded states and to collect duties and imposts there.
if military force was necessary to preserve the union lincoln like democrat andrew jackson during the nullification crisis would use it.

there can be no neutrals in this war only patriots or traitors how then could the democratic party function as a loyal opposition supporting the union while challenging certain republican policies.
it would not be an easy task.
whites in the middle and border south now had to choose between the union and the confederacy and their decision was crucial.
those eight states accounted for two thirds of the whites in the slaveholding states three fourths of their industrial production and well over half of their food.
they were home to many of the nations best military leaders including colonel robert e lee of virginia a career officer whom veteran general winfield scott recommended to lincoln to lead the new union army.
those states were also geographically strategic.
kentucky with its 500 mile border on the ohio river was essential to the movement of troops and supplies.
maryland was vital to the unions security because it bordered the nations capital on three sides.
the weight of its history as a slave owning society decided the outcome in virginia.

when maryland secessionists destroyed railroad bridges and telegraph lines lincoln ordered union troops to occupy the state and arrest confederate sympathizers including legislators.
he released them only in november 1861 after unionists had secured control of marylands government.
lincoln was equally energetic in the mississippi river valley.
to win control of missouri and the adjacent missouri and upper mississippi rivers lincoln mobilized the states german american militia which strongly opposed slavery.
in july the german americans defeated a force of confederate sympathizers commanded by the states governor.
despite continuing chapter 14 raids by confederate guerrilla bands which included the notorious outlaws jesse and frank james the union retained control of missouri.
in kentucky where secessionist and unionist sentiment was evenly balanced lincoln moved cautiously.
he allowed kentuckys thriving trade with the confederacy to continue until august 1861 when unionists took over the state government.
when the confederacy responded to the trade cutoff by invading kentucky in september illinois volunteers commanded by ulysses s grant drove them out.
mixing military force with political persuasion lincoln had kept four border states delaware maryland missouri and kentucky and the northwestern portion of virginia in the union.
setting war objectives and devising strategies speaking as provisional president of the confederacy in april 1861 jefferson davis identified the confederates cause with that of the patriots of 1776 like their grandfathers he said white southerners were fighting for the sacred right of self government the confederacy sought no conquest no aggrandizement.
all we ask is to be let alone daviss renunciation of expansion was probably a calculated short run policy after all the quest to extend slavery into kansas and cuba had sparked lincolns election.
still this decision simplified the confederacys military strategy it needed only to defend its boundaries to achieve independence.
ignoring strong antislavery sentiment among potential european allies the confederate constitution explicitly ruled out gradual emancipation or any other law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves indeed confederate vice president alexander stephens insisted that his nations cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural or normal condition lincoln responded to davis in a speech to congress on july 4 1861.
he portrayed secession as an attack on representative government americas great contribution to world history.
the issue lincoln declared was whether a constitutional republic had the will and the means to maintain its territorial integrity against a domestic foe determined to crush the rebellion lincoln rejected general winfield scotts strategy of peaceful persuasion through economic sanctions and a naval blockade.
instead he insisted on an aggressive military campaign to restore the union.
two societies at war 1861 1865 union thrusts toward richmond lincoln hoped that a quick strike against the confederate capital of richmond virginia would end the rebellion.
many northerners were equally optimistic.
what a picnic thought one new york volunteer to go down south for three months and clean up the whole business so in july 1861 lincoln ordered general irvin mcdowells army of 30 000 men to attack general p g t beauregards force of 20 000 troops at manassas a virginia rail junction 30 miles southwest of washington.
mcdowell launched a strong assault near bull run but panic swept his troops when the confederate soldiers counterattacked shouting the hairraising rebel yell the peculiar corkscrew sensation that it sends down your backbone.
can never be told one union veteran wrote.
you have to feel it mcdowells troops and the many civilians who had come to observe the battle retreated in disarray to washington.
the confederate victory at bull run showed the strength of the rebellion.
lincoln replaced mcdowell with general george mcclellan and enlisted a million men to serve for three years in the new army of the potomac.
a cautious military engineer mcclellan spent the winter of 1861 1862 training the recruits and launched a major compare offensive in march 1862.

during 1862 confederate generals thomas jonathan stonewall jackson and robert e lee won battles that defended the confederate capital 3 6 8 and 13 and launched offensive strikes against union forces guarding washington 1 4 5 7 9 and 10.
they also suffered a defeat at antietam 12 in maryland that was almost fatal to the confederate cause.
as was often the case in the civil war the victors in these battles were either too bloodied or too timid to exploit their advantage.
virginia he routed union troops in the second battle of bull run august 1862 and then struck north through western maryland.
there he nearly met with disaster.
when the confederate commander divided his force sending jackson to capture harpers ferry in west virginia a copy of lees orders fell into mcclellans hands.
the union general again failed to exploit his advantage delaying an attack against lees depleted army thereby allowing it to secure a strong defensive position west of antietam creek near sharpsburg chapter 14 maryland.
outnumbered 87 000 to 50 000 lee desperately fought off mcclellans attacks until jacksons troops arrived and saved the confederates from a major defeat.
appalled by the union casualties mcclellan allowed lee to retreat to virginia.
the fighting at antietam was savage.
a wisconsin officer described his men loading and firing with demoniacal fury and shouting and laughing hysterically a sunken road nicknamed bloody lane was filled with confederate bodies two and three deep and the advancing union troops knelt on this ghastly flooring to shoot at the retreating confederates.
the battle at antietam on september 17 1862 remains the bloodiest single day in u s military history.
together two societies at war 1861 1865 the confederate and union dead numbered 4 800 and the wounded 18 500 of whom 3 000 soon died.
by comparison there were 6 000 american casualties on d day which began the invasion of nazi occupied france in world war ii.
in public lincoln claimed antietam as a union victory privately he criticized mcclellan for not fighting lee to the bitter end.
a masterful organizer of men and supplies mcclellan refused to risk his troops fearing that heavy casualties would undermine public support for the war.
lincoln worried more about the danger of a lengthy war.
he dismissed mcclellan and began a long search for an aggressive commanding general.
his first choice ambrose e burnside proved the battle of pea ridge arkansas march 1862 pea ridge was the biggest battle of the civil war fought west of the mississippi and was of considerable strategic significance.
by routing one confederate army and holding another to a draw outnumbered union forces maintained their control of missouri for the duration of the war.
the lithograph published in chicago in 1889 commemorates the union units from illinois and other midwestern states who fought at pea ridge.

as 1862 ended confederates were optimistic they had won a stalemate in the east.
the war in the mississippi valley meanwhile union commanders in the upper south had been more successful map 14 3.
their goal was to control the ohio mississippi and missouri rivers dividing the confederacy and reducing the mobility of its armies.
because kentucky did not join the rebellion the union already dominated the ohio river valley.
in february 1862 the union army used an innovative tactic to take charge of the tennessee and mississippi rivers as well.
general ulysses s grant used riverboats clad with iron plates to capture fort donelson on the cumberland river and fort henry on the tennessee river.
when grant moved south toward mississippi to seize critical railroad lines confederate troops led by albert sidney johnston and p g t beauregard caught his army by surprise near a small log church at shiloh tennessee.
however grant relentlessly committed troops and forced a confederate withdrawal.
as the fighting at shiloh ended on april 7 grant surveyed a large field so covered with dead that it would have been possible to walk over the clearing in any direction stepping on dead bodies without a foot touching the ground the cost in lives was horrific but lincoln was resolute what i want.
is generals who will fight battles and win victories three weeks later union naval forces commanded by david g farragut struck the confederacy from the gulf of mexico.
they captured new orleans the souths financial center and largest city.
the union army also took control of fifteen hundred plantations and 50 000 slaves in the surrounding region striking a strong blow against slavery.
workers on some plantations looted their owners mansions others refused to labor unless they were paid wages.
slavery there is forever destroyed and worthless declared one northern reporter.
union victories had significantly undermined confederate strength in the mississippi river valley.
toward total war the military carnage in 1862 revealed that the war would be long and costly.
grant later remarked that after shiloh he gave up all idea of saving the union except by complete conquest lincoln agreed.
during the summer of 1862 he abandoned hope for a compromise peace that would restore the union.
instead he committed the nation to a total war that would mobilize all of societys resources economic political and cultural in support of the norths military effort and end slavery in the south.
aided by the republican party and a talented cabinet lincoln gradually organized an effective central government able to wage allout war and urged on by antislavery politicians and activists he moved toward a controversial proclamation of emancipation.
jefferson davis had less success at harnessing southern resources because the eleven states of the confederacy remained suspicious of centralized rule and southern yeomen grew increasingly skeptical of the war effort.
mobilizing armies and civilians initially patriotic fervor filled both armies with eager young volunteers.
all he heard was war.

even those of sober minds joined up.
i dont think a young man ever went over all the considerations more carefully than i did reflected william saxton of cincinnatus new york.
it might mean sickness wounds loss of limb and even life itself.
but my country was in danger the southern call for volunteers was even more successful thanks to its strong military tradition and a culture that stressed duty and honor.
would you my darling.
be willing to leave your children under such a despotic union government james b griffin of edgefield south carolina asked his wife.
no i know you would sacrifice every comfort on earth rather than submit to it however enlistments declined as potential recruits learned the realities of mass warfare epidemic diseases in the camps and wholesale death on the battlefields.
both governments soon faced the need for conscription.
the military draft the confederacy acted first.
in april 1862 following the bloodshed at shiloh the confederate congress imposed the first legally binding draft conscription in american history.
new laws required existing soldiers to serve for the duration of the war and mandated three years of military service from all men between the ages of eighteen and thirtyfive.
in september 1862 after the heavy casualties at antietam the age limit jumped to forty five.
the souths draft had two loopholes both controversial.
first it exempted one white man the planter a son or an overseer for each twenty slaves allowing some chapter 14 m iss iss ip r pi missouri.

this provision a mississippi legislator warned jefferson davis has aroused a spirit of rebellion in some places second draftees could hire substitutes.
by the time the confederate congress closed this loophole in 1864 the price of a substitute had soared to 300 in gold three times the annual wage of a skilled worker.
laborers and yeomen farmers angrily complained that it was a rich mans war and a poor mans fight consequently some southerners refused to serve.
because the confederate constitution vested sovereignty in the individual states the government in richmond could not compel military service.
independent minded governors such as joseph brown of georgia and zebulon vance of north carolina simply ignored president daviss first draft call in place events early 1862.
elsewhere state judges in context issued writs of habeas corpus how did the union and legal instruments used to protect confederacy mobilize their people from arbitrary arrest and populations for war and ordered the confederate army to how effective were these release reluctant draftees.
howmethods.
ever the confederate congress overrode the judges authority to free conscripted men so the government was able to keep substantial armies in the field well into 1864.
the union government acted more ruthlessly toward draft resisters and confederate sympathizers.
in missouri and other border states union commanders levied special taxes on southern supporters.
lincoln went further suspending habeas corpus and over the course of the war temporarily imprisoning about 15 000 southern sympathizers without trial.
he also gave military courts jurisdiction over civilians who discouraged enlistments or resisted the draft preventing acquittals by sympathetic local juries.
however most union governments used incentives to lure recruits.
to meet the local quotas set by the militia act of 1862 towns counties and states used cash bounties of as much as 600 about 11 000 today and signed up nearly 1 million men.
the union also allowed men to avoid military service by providing a substitute or paying a 300 fee.
when the enrollment act of 1863 finally initiated conscription recent german and irish immigrants often refused to serve.
it was not their war they said.
chapter 14 northern democrats used the furor over conscription to bolster support for their party which increasingly criticized lincolns policies.
they accused lincoln of drafting poor whites to liberate enslaved blacks who would then flood the cities and take their jobs.
slavery was nearly dead but the negro is not there is the misfortune declared a democratic newspaper in cincinnati.
in july 1863 the immigrants hostility to conscription and blacks sparked riots in new york city.
for five days irish and german workers ran rampant burning draft offices sacking the homes of influential republicans and attacking the police.
the rioters lynched and mutilated a dozen african americans drove hundreds of black families from their homes and burned down the colored orphan asylum.
to suppress the mobs lincoln rushed in union troops who had just fought at gettysburg they killed more than a hundred rioters.

despite these efforts dysentery typhoid and malaria spread through the camps as did mumps and measles viruses that were often deadly to rural recruits.
diseases and infections killed about 250 000 union soldiers nearly twice the 135 000 who died in combat.
still thanks to the sanitary commission union troops had a far lower mortality rate than soldiers fighting in nineteenth century european wars.

so much death created new industries and cultural rituals.

the war also drew more women into the wageearning workforce as nurses clerks and factory operatives.
dorothea dix chapter 11 served as superintendent of female nurses and by successfully combating the prejudice against women providing medical treatment to men opened a new occupation to women.
thousands of educated union women became government clerks while southern women staffed the efficient confederate postal service.

in that regard the union had a distinct advantage.
with nearly two thirds of the nations population two thirds of the railroad mileage and almost 90 percent of the industrial output the norths economy was far superior to that of the south figure 14 2.
furthermore many of its arms factories were equipped for mass production.
still the confederate position was far from weak.
virginia north carolina and tennessee had substantial industrial capacity.
richmond with its tredegar iron works was an important manufacturing center and in 1861 it acquired the gun making machinery from the u s armory at harpers ferry.
the production at the richmond armory the purchase of enfield rifles from britain and the capture of 100 000 union guns enabled the confederacy to provide every infantryman with a modern rifle musket by 1863.
moreover with 9 million people the confederacy could mobilize enormous armies.
enslaved blacks one third of the population became part of the war effort by producing food for the army and raw cotton for export.
confederate leaders counted on king chapter 14 two societies at war 1861 1865 figure 14 2 economies north and south 1860 the military advantages of the north were even greater than this chart suggests.
the population figures for the south include slaves whom the confederacy feared to arm.
also the souths commodity output was primarily in farm goods rather than manufactures.
finally southern factories were much smaller on average than those in the north.
cotton the leading american export and a cru cial staple of the nineteenth century economy to purchase clothes boots blankets and weapons from abroad.
leaders also saw cotton as a diplomatic weapon that would persuade britain and france which had large textile industries to assist the confederacy.
north south population 61 39 commodity output 70 30 farm acreage 67 33 factories 85 15 railroad mileage 66 34 however british manufacturers had stockpiled cotton and developed new sources in egypt and india.
still the south received some foreign support.
although britain never recognized the confederacy as an independent nation it treated the rebel government as a belligerent power with the right under international richmond capital city and industrial center the confederacy chose richmond as its capital because of the historic importance of virginia as the home of washington jefferson madison and monroe.
however richmond was also a major industrial center.
exploiting the citys location at the falls of the james river the citys entrepreneurs had developed a wide range of industries flour mills tobacco factories railroad and port facilities and most important a substantial iron industry.
in 1861 the tredegar iron works employed nearly a thousand workers and as the only facility in the south that could manufacture large machinery and heavy weapons made a major contribution to the confederate war effort.

they quickly removed limbs too shattered to mend which increased the chances of survival.

although 73 percent of the union amputees survived the war infected wounds deadly gangrene took the lives of most soldiers who suffered certain gunshot injuries in this pre antibiotic pre antiseptic era.
keen who later became the first brain surgeon in the united states served as a surgeon in the union army.
not more than one incontestable example of recovery from a gunshot wound of the stomach and not a single incontestable case of wound of the small intestines are recorded during the entire war among the almost 250 000 wounded.
of 852 amputations of the shoulder joint 236 died a mortality of 28 5 per cent.
of 66 cases of amputation of the hip joint 55 or 83 3 per cent died.
of 155 cases of trephining cutting a hole in the skull to relieve pressure 60 recovered and 95 died a mortality of over 61 per cent.
of 374 ligations of the femoral artery 93 recovered and 281 died a mortality of over 75 per cent.
these figures afford a striking evidence of the dreadful mortality of military surgery in the days before antisepsis and first aid packages.
happily such death rates can never again be seen at least in civilized warfare.

the odds then did not necessarily favor the union despite its superior resources.
republican economic and fiscal policies to mobilize northern resources the republican dominated congress enacted a neomercantilist program of government assisted economic development that far surpassed henry clays american system chapter 10.
the republicans imposed high tariffs averaging nearly 40 percent on various foreign goods thereby encouraging domestic industries.
to boost agricultural output they offered free land to farmers.
the homestead act of 1862 gave settlers the title to 160 acres of public land after five years of residence.

nomic program won the allegiance of farmers workers and entrepreneurs and bolstered the unions ability to fight a long war.
new industries sprang up to provide the union army and its 1 5 million men with guns clothes and food.
over the course of the war soldiers consumed more than half a billion pounds of pork and other packed meats.
to meet this demand chicago railroads built new lines to carry thousands of hogs and cattle to the citys stockyards and slaughterhouses.
by 1862 chicago had passed cincinnati as the meatpacking capital of the nation bringing prosperity to thousands of midwestern farmers and great wealth to philip d armour and other meatpacking entrepreneurs.
bankers and financiers likewise found themselves pulled into the war effort.
the annual spending of the union government shot up from 63 million in 1860 to more than 865 million in 1864.
to raise that enormous sum the republicans created a modern system of public finance that secured funds in three ways.
first the government increased tariffs placed high duties on alcohol and tobacco and imposed direct taxes on business corporations large inheritances and the incomes of wealthy citizens.
these levies paid about 20 percent of the cost.
second interest paying bonds issued by the u s treasury financed another 65 percent.
the national banking acts of 1863 and 1864 forced most banks to buy those bonds and philadelphia banker and treasury department agent jay cooke used newspaper ads and 2 500 subagents to persuade a million northern families to buy them.
the union paid the remaining 15 percent by printing paper money.
the legal tender act of 1862 authorized 150 million in paper currency soon known as greenbacks and required the public to accept them as legal tender.
like the continental currency of the revolutionary era greenbacks could not be exchanged for specie however the treasury issued a limited amount of paper money so it lost only a small part of its face value.

the south resorts to coercion and inflation the economic demands on the south were equally great but true to its states rights philosophy the confederacy initially left most matters to the state governments.
however as the realities of total war became clear jefferson daviss administration took extraordinary measures.
it built and operated shipyards armories foundries and textile mills commandeered food and scarce raw materials such as coal iron copper and lead requisitioned slaves to work on fortifications and directly controlled foreign trade.
the confederate congress and ordinary southern citizens opposed many of daviss initiatives particularly those involving taxes.
the congress refused to tax cotton exports and slaves the most valuable property held by wealthy planters and the urban middle classes and yeomen farm families refused to pay more than their fair share.
consequently the confederacy covered less than 10 percent of its expenditures through america c o m pa r e d war debt britain and the united states 1830 1900 wars cost money sometimes a lot of money and nations often pay for them by issuing bonds and expanding the national debt.
the british national debt grew enormously between 1750 and 1815 as it fought a great series of wars all of which involved either its american colonies or the united states the great war for empire 1754 1763 the war of american independence 1776 1783 and the wars of the french revolution and napoleon 1793 1815.
consequently britains national debt peaked in 1815 at 260 percent of its gross domestic product gdp.
even in 1830 after years of high taxation and economic growth the debt amounted to 180 percent of british gdp.
by comparison the united states in 1830 was virtually debt free as the policies of jeffersonian republicans reduced its debt from about 27 percent of gdp in 1790 to less than 5 percent.
ample tariff revenues and the frugal policies of presidents andrew jackson and martin van buren then cut the debt nearly to zero by the early 1840s.
even the war with mexico barely raised the level of the debt thanks to the return of prosperity and the growth of gdp between 1844 and 1857.
then came the civil war which boosted the union debt from 62 million in 1860 to 2 2 billion at the end of 1865 a 1 500 percent increase.
the fourteenth amendment ratified in 1868 declared illegal and void all debts incurred by the confederacy.
in relation to gdp the u s national debt shot up to 27 percent the same level as 1790 and then thanks again to tariff revenue decreased gradually to about 10 percent of gdp by 1900.
by then the british national debt had fallen to about 40 percent of its gdp as the british the worlds strongest power mostly avoided new wars and built a prosperous commercial and industrial economy.
the cost of war civil or international may well be a high national debt.

in 2012 the national debt of the united states now the worlds premier economic and military power was nearly 100 percent of gdp and since 1940 has averaged about 60 percent of gdp.
given those facts and the evidence in this chart is it fair to conclude that one of the costs of global power is a high national debt.

their leaders were treasury secretary salmon chase senator charles sumner of massachusetts and representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania.
a longtime member of congress stevens was a masterful politician skilled at fashioning legislation that could win majority support.
in april 1862 stevens and the radicals persuaded congress to end slavery in the district of columbia by providing compensation for owners in june congress outlawed slavery in the federal territories finally enacting the wilmot proviso of 1846 and in july it passed a second confiscation act which declared forever free the thousands of refugee slaves and all slaves captured by the union army.
emancipation had become an instrument of war.

the proclamation legally abolished slavery in all states that remained out of the union on january 1 1863.
the rebel states could preserve slavery by renouncing secession.
none chose to do so.
the proclamation was politically astute.

hailed by reformers in europe emancipation was extraordinarily controversial in america.
in the confederacy jefferson davis labeled it the most execrable measure recorded in the history of guilty man in the north white voters unleashed a racist backlash.
during the elections of 1862 the democrats denounced emancipation as unconstitutional warned of slave uprisings and predicted that freed blacks would take white jobs.
every freed slave suggested a nativistminded new yorker should shoulder an irishman and leave the continent such sentiments propelled democrat horatio seymour into the governors office in new york if abolition was a war goal seymour argued the south should not be conquered.
in the november election democrats swept to victory in pennsylvania ohio and illinois and gained thirty four seats in congress.
however republicans still held a twenty five seat majority in the house and gained five seats in the senate.
lincoln refused to retreat.

democrats had made significant gains in 1862 and popular support was growing for a negotiated peace.
two brilliant victories in virginia by general robert e lee whose army defeated union forces at fredericksburg december 1862 and chancellorsville may 1863 further eroded northern support for the war.
the battle for the mississippi at this critical juncture general grant mounted a major offensive to split the confederacy in two.
grant drove south along the west bank of the mississippi in arkansas and then crossed the river near vicksburg mississippi.
there he defeated two confederate armies and laid siege to the city.
after repelling union assaults for six weeks the exhausted and starving vicksburg garrison surrendered on july 4 1863.
five days later union forces took port hudson louisiana near baton rouge and seized control of the entire mississippi river.
grant had taken 31 000 prisoners cut off louisiana arkansas and texas from the rest of the confederacy and prompted thousands of slaves to desert their plantations.
confederate troops responded by targeting refugees for re enslavement and massacre.
the battlefield was sickening a confederate officer reported from arkansas no orders threats or commands could restrain the men from vengeance on the negroes and they were piled in great heaps about the wagons in the tangled brushwood and upon the muddy and trampled road chapter 14 first day of battle lee drove the unions advance guard to the south of town.
there union commander george g meade placed his troops in well defended hilltop positions and called up reinforcements.
by the morning of july 2 meade had 90 000 troops to lees 75 000.
lee knew he was outnumbered but was intent on victory he ordered assaults on meades flanks but failed to turn them.
on july 3 lee decided on a dangerous frontal assault against the center of the union line.
after the heaviest artillery barrage of the war lee sent general george e pickett and his 14 000 men to take cemetery ridge.
when picketts men charged across a mile of open terrain they faced deadly fire from artillery and massed riflemen thousands suffered death wounds or capture.
as the three day battle ended the confederates counted 28 000 casualties one third of the army of northern virginia while 23 000 of meades soldiers lay as grant had advanced toward vicksburg in may confederate leaders had argued over the best strategic response.
president davis and other politicians wanted to send an army to tennessee to relieve the union pressure along the mississippi river.
general lee buoyed by his recent victories favored a new invasion of the north.

still gettysburg was a great union victory and together with the simultaneous triumph at vicksburg marked a major military political and diplomatic turning point.
as southern citizens grew increasingly critical of their government the confederate elections of 1863 went sharply against the politicians who supported jefferson davis.
meanwhile northern citizens rallied to the union and republicans swept state elections in pennsylvania ohio and new york.
in europe the victories boosted the leverage of american diplomats.
since 1862 the british built ironclad cruiser the alabama had sunk or captured more than a hundred union merchant ships and the confederacy was about to accept delivery of two more ironclads.
with a union victory increasingly likely the british government decided to impound the warships and subsequently to pay 15 5 million for the depredations of the alabama.
british workers and reformers had long condemned slavery and praised emancipation moreover because of poor grain harvests britain depended on imports of wheat and flour from the american midwest.
king cotton diplomacy had failed and king wheat stood triumphant.
rest not your hopes in foreign nations president jefferson davis advised his people.
this war is ours we must fight it ourselves explain consequences the union victorious 1864 1865 the union victories of 1863 meant that the south could not win independence through a decisive military triumph.
however the confederacy could still hope for a battlefield stalemate and a negotiated peace.
to keep the union in republican hands lincoln faced the daunting task of conquering the south.
soldiers and strategy the promotion of aggressive generals and the enlistment of african american soldiers allowed the union to prosecute the war vigorously.
as early as 1861 free african americans and fugitive slaves had volunteered both to end slavery and as frederick douglass put it to win the right to citizenship yet many northern whites refused to serve with blacks.
i am as much opposed to slavery as any of them a new york soldier told his local newspaper but i am not willing to be put on a level with the negro and fight with them union generals also opposed the enlistment of african americans doubting they would make good soldiers.
nonetheless free and contraband blacks formed volunteer regiments in new england south carolina louisiana and kansas.
the impact of black troops the emancipation proclamation changed military policy and popular sentiment.
the proclamation invited former slaves to serve in the union army and northern whites having suffered thousands of casualties now accepted that blacks should share in the fighting and dying.
a heroic and costly attack by the 54th massachusetts infantry on fort wagner south carolina in 1863 convinced union officers of the value of black soldiers.
by the spring of 1865 the lincoln administration had recruited and armed nearly 200 000 african americans.
without black soldiers said lincoln we would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks military service did not end racial discrimination.
black soldiers initially earned less than white soldiers 10 a month versus 13 and died mostly from disease at higher rates than white soldiers.
nonetheless african americans continued to volunteer seeking freedom and a new social order.
hello massa said one black soldier to his former master who had been taken prisoner.
bottom rail on top dis time the worst fears of the secessionists had come true through the disciplined agency of the union army african americans had risen in a successful rebellion against slavery just as six decades earlier enslaved haitians had won emancipation in the army of toussaint louverture chapter 7.
capable generals take command as african americans bolstered the armys ranks lincoln finally found a ruthless commanding general.
in march 1864 lincoln placed general ulysses s grant in charge of all union armies from then on the president determined overall strategy and grant implemented it.
lincoln favored a simultaneous advance against the major confederate armies a strategy grant had long favored in order to achieve a decisive victory before the election of 1864.
grant knew how to fight a war that relied on industrial technology and targeted an entire society.
at vicksburg in july 1863 he had besieged the whole city chapter 14 two societies at war 1861 1865 black soldiers in the union army determined to end racial slavery tens of thousands of african americans volunteered for service in the union army in 1864 and 1865 boosting the northern war effort at a critical moment.
these soldiers were members of the 107th colored infantry stationed at fort corcoran near washington d c.
in january 1865 their regiment saw action in the daring capture of fort fisher which protected wilmington north carolina the last confederate port open to blockade runners.

and forced its surrender.
then in november he had used railroads to rescue an endangered union army near chattanooga tennessee.
grant believed that the cautious tactics of previous union commanders had prolonged the war.
he was willing to accept heavy casualties a stance that earned him a reputation as a butcher of enemy armies and his own men.
in may 1864 grant ordered two major offensives.
personally taking charge of the 115 000 man army of the potomac he set out to destroy lees force of 75 000 troops in virginia.
grant instructed general william tecumseh sherman who shared his harsh outlook to invade georgia and take atlanta.
all that has gone before is mere skirmish sherman wrote as he prepared for battle.
the war now begins grant advanced toward richmond hoping to force lee to fight in open fields where the unions superior manpower and artillery would prevail.
remembering his tactical errors at gettysburg lee remained in strong defensive positions and attacked only when he held an advantage.
the confederate general seized that opportunity twice in may 1864 winning costly victories at the battles of the wilderness and spotsylvania court house.
at spotsylvania the troops fought at point blank range an iowa recruit explain recalled lines of blue and grey consequences soldiers firing into each others how did the emancipation faces for an hour and a half proclamation and grants despite heavy losses in these appointment as general in battles and then at cold harbor chief affect the course of grant drove on map 14 5.

attacks severely eroded lees forces which suffered 31 000 casualties but union losses were even higher 55 000 killed or wounded.
stalemate the fighting took a heavy psychological toll.
many a man has gone crazy since this campaign began from the terrible pressure on mind and body observed a union captain.
as morale declined soldiers deserted.
in june 1864 grant laid siege to petersburg an important railroad center near richmond.
as the siege continued union and confederate soldiers built complex networks of trenches tunnels and artillery emplacements stretching for 40 miles along the eastern edge of richmond and petersburg foreshadowing the devastating trench warfare in france in world war i.

he moved his army to the southeast seeking to outflank lees forces.
photographer timothy h osullivan caught up to the union armys high command at massaponax church virginia and captured this image of grant to the left leaning over a pew and reading a map held by general george h meade.
as grant plots the armys movement his officers smoke their pipes and read reports of the war in newspapers that had just arrived from new york city.
intercepting grants forces lee took up fortified positions first at the north anna river and then at cold harbor where the confederates scored their last major victory of the war may 31 june 3.
library of congress.
as living night and day within the valley of the shadow of death the stress was especially great for the outnumbered confederate troops who spent months in the muddy hellish trenches without rotation to the rear.
as time passed lincoln and grant felt pressures of their own.
the enormous casualties and military stalemate threatened lincoln with defeat in the november election.
the republican outlook worsened in july when jubal earlys cavalry raided and burned the pennsylvania town of chambersburg and threatened washington.
to punish farmers in the shenandoah valley who had aided the confederate raiders grant ordered general philip h sheridan to turn the region into a barren waste sheridans troops conducted a scorched earth campaign destroying grain barns and gristmills and any other resource useful to the confederates.
these tactics like earlys raid violated the military norms of the day which treated civilians as noncombatants.
rising desperation and anger were changing the definition of conventional warfare.
the election of 1864 and shermans march as the siege at petersburg dragged on lincolns hopes for reelection depended on general sherman in georgia.
shermans army of 90 000 men had moved methodically toward atlanta a railway hub at the heart of the confederacy.
general joseph e johnsons confederate army of 60 000 stood in his way and in june 1864 inflicted heavy casualties on shermans forces near kennesaw mountain georgia.
by late july the union army stood on the northern outskirts of atlanta but the next month brought little gain.
like grant sherman seemed bogged down in a hopeless campaign.
the national union party versus the peace democrats meanwhile the presidential campaign of 1864 was heating up.
in june the republican partys convention rebuffed attempts to prevent lincolns renomination.
it endorsed the presidents war strategy demanded the confederacys unconditional surrender and called for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery.
the delegates likewise embraced lincolns political strategy.
to attract border state and democratic voters the republicans took a new name the national union party and chose andrew johnson a tennessee slave owner and unionist democrat as lincolns running mate.
the democratic party met in august and nominated general george b mcclellan for president.
lincoln had twice removed mcclellan from military commands first for an excess of caution and then for chapter 14 map 14 5 two societies at war 1861 1865 potomac r grant the closing virginia campaign 1864 1865 lee confederate defense line beginning in may 1864 general ulysses s grant launched an all out campaign against richmond trying to lure general robert e lee into open battle.
lee avoided a major test of strength.
instead he retreated to defensive positions and inflicted heavy casualties on union attackers at the wilderness spotsylvania court house north anna and cold harbor 1 4.
from june 1864 to april 1865 the two armies faced each other across defensive fortifications outside richmond and petersburg 5.
grant finally broke this ten month siege by a flanking maneuver at five forks 6.

like mcclellan the democratic delegates rejected emancipation and condemned lincolns repression of domestic dissent particularly the suspension of habeas corpus and the use of military courts to prosecute civilians.
however they split into two camps over war policy.
war democrats vowed to continue fighting until the rebellion ended while peace democrats called for a cessation of hostilities and a constitutional convention to negotiate a peace settlement.
although personally a war democrat mcclellan promised if elected to recommend to congress an immediate armistice and a peace convention.
hearing this news confederate vice president alexander stephens celebrated the first ray of real light i have seen since the war began he predicted that if atlanta and richmond held out lincoln would be defeated and mcclellan would eventually accept an independent confederacy.
the fall of atlanta and lincolns victory stephenss hopes collapsed on september 2 1864 as atlanta fell to shermans army.
in a stunning move the union general pulled his troops from the trenches swept around the city and destroyed its rail links to the south.

mary chesnut a plantation mistress and generals wife wrote in her diary i felt as if all were dead within me forever and foresaw the end of the confederacy we are going to be wiped off the earth recognizing the dramatically changed military situation mcclellan repudiated the democratic peace platform.
the national union party went on the offensive attacking mcclellans inconsistency and labeling peace democrats as copperheads poisonous snakes who were hatching treasonous plots.
a man must go for the union at all hazards declared a republican legislator in pennsylvania if he would entitle himself to be considered a loyal man lincoln won a clear cut victory in november.
the president received 55 percent of the popular vote and won 212 of 233 electoral votes.
republicans and national unionists captured 145 of the 185 seats in the house of representatives and increased their senate majority to 42 of 52 seats.
many republicans owed their victory to the votes of union troops who wanted to crush the rebellion and end slavery.
legal emancipation was already under way at the edges of the south.

when seated he crossed and uncrossed his legs incessantly and a journalist described his fingers as constantly twitching his red whiskers his coat buttons playing a tattoo on the table or running through his hair on the battlefield sherman was a decisive general who commanded the loyalty of his troops.
a photographer captured this image of sherman in 1865 following his devastating march through georgia and the carolinas.
library of congress.
three confederate states occupied by the union army tennessee arkansas and louisiana followed suit.
still abolitionists worried that the emancipation proclamation based legally on the presidents wartime powers would lose its force at the end of the war.
urged on by lincoln and the national equal rights league in january 1865 the republican congress approved the thirteenth amendment ending slavery and sent it to the states for ratification.
slavery was nearly dead.
william tecumseh sherman hard war warrior thanks to william tecumseh sherman the confederacy was nearly dead as well.
as a young military officer stationed in the south sherman sympathized with the planter class and felt that slavery upheld social stability.
however sherman believed in the union.
secession meant anarchy he told his southern friends in early 1861 if war comes.
i must fight your people whom i best love serving under grant sherman distinguished himself at shiloh and vicksburg.
taking command of the army of the tennessee he developed the philosophy and tactics of hard war when one nation is at war with another all the people of one are enemies of the other sherman declared.
when confederate guerrillas fired on a boat carrying unionist civilians near randolph tennessee sherman sent a regiment to destroy the town asserting we are justified in treating all inhabitants as combatants after capturing atlanta sherman advocated a bold strategy.
instead of pursuing the retreating confederate army northward into tennessee he proposed to move south live off the land and cut a swath through to the sea to persuade lincoln and grant to approve his unconventional plan sherman argued that his march would be a demonstration to the world foreign and domestic that we have a power jefferson davis cannot resist the union general lived up to his pledge.

in this chapter we surveyed the dramatic events of the civil war.
looking at the south we watched the fireeaters declare secession form a new confederacy and attack fort sumter.
subsequently we saw its generals repulse union attacks against richmond and go on the offensive.
however as the war continued the inherent weaknesses of the confederacy came to the fore.
enslaved workers fled or refused to work and yeomen farmers refused to fight for an institution that primarily benefitted wealthy planters.
examining the north we witnessed its military shortcomings.
its generals mcclellan and meade moved slowly to attack and did not pursue their weakened foes.
however the unions significant advantages in industrial output financial resources and military manpower became manifest over time.
congress created efficient systems of banking and war finance lincoln found efficient and ruthless generals and the emancipation and recruitment of african americans provided an abundant supply of soldiers determined to end slavery.
we explored the impact of the war on civilians in both regions the imposition of conscription and high taxes the increased workload of farm women and the constant food shortages and soaring prices.
above all else there was the omnipresent fact of death a tragedy that touched nearly every family north and south.

ebration where african americans shouted hurrah for abe lincoln a white policeman responded your old father abe lincoln is dead and damned the scuffle that followed precipitated three days of white violence and rape that left forty eight african americans dead and dozens more wounded.
mobs burned black homes and churches and destroyed all twelve of the citys black schools.
unionists were appalled.
they had won the civil war but where was the peace.
ex confederates murdered freedmen and flagrantly resisted federal control.
after the memphis attacks republicans in congress proposed a new measure that would protect african americans by defining and enforcing u s citizenship rights.
eventually this bill became the most significant law to emerge from reconstruction the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.
andrew johnson however the unionist democrat who became president after abraham lincolns assassination refused to sign the bill.
in may 1865 while congress was adjourned johnson had implemented his own reconstruction plan.
it extended amnesty to all southerners who took a loyalty oath except for a few high ranking confederates.
it also allowed states to reenter the union as soon as they revoked secession abolished slavery and relieved their new state governments of financial burdens by repudiating confederate debts.
a year later at the time of the memphis carnage all ex confederate states had met johnsons terms.
the president rejected any further intervention.
johnsons vetoes combined with ongoing violence in the south angered unionist voters.
in the political struggle that ensued congressional republicans seized the initiative from the president and enacted a sweeping program that became known as radical reconstruction.
one of its key achievements would have been unthinkable a few years earlier voting rights for african american men.
black southeners though had additional urgent priorities.
we have toiled nearly all our lives as slaves and have made these lands what they are a group of south carolina petitioners declared.
they pleaded for some provision by which we as freedmen can obtain a homestead though northern republicans and freedpeople agreed that black southerners must have physical safety and the right to vote former slaves also wanted economic independence.
northerners sought instead to revive cash crop plantations with wage labor.
reconstructions eventual failure stemmed from the conflicting goals of lawmakers freedpeople and relentlessly hostile ex confederates.
celebrating the fifteenth amendment 1870 this lithograph depicts a celebration in baltimore on may 15 1870.

part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 the struggle for national reconstruction congress clashed with president johnson in part because the framers of the constitution did not anticipate a civil war or provide for its aftermath.
had confederate states legally left the union when they seceded.
if so then their reentry required action by congress.
if not if even during secession they had retained u s statehood then restoring them might be an administrative matter best left to the president.
lack of clarity on this fundamental question made for explosive politics.
presidential approaches from lincoln to johnson as wartime president lincoln had offered a plan similar to johnsons.
it granted amnesty to most exconfederates and allowed each rebellious state to return to the union as soon as 10 percent of its voters had taken a loyalty oath and the compare and state had approved the thirteenth contrast amendment abolishing slavery.
how did lincoln and but even amid defeat confederate johnson approach reconstates rejected this ten percent struction differently.
plan an ominous sign for the future.
in july 1864 congress proposed a tougher substitute the wade davis bill that required an oath of allegiance by a majority of each states adult white men new governments formed only by those who had never taken up arms against the union and permanent disenfranchisement of confederate leaders.
lincoln defeated the wade davis bill with a pocket veto leaving it unsigned when congress adjourned.
at the same time he opened talks with key congressmen aiming for a compromise.
we will never know what would have happened had lincoln lived.
his assassination in april 1865 plunged the nation into political uncertainty.
as a special train bore the presidents flag draped coffin home to illinois thousands of americans lined the railroad tracks in mourning.
furious and grief stricken many unionists blamed all confederates for the acts of southern sympathizer john wilkes booth and his accomplices in the murder.
at the same time lincolns death left the presidency in the hands of andrew johnson a man utterly lacking in lincolns moral sense and political judgment.
johnson was a self styled common man from the hills of eastern tennessee.
trained as a tailor he built his political career on the support of farmers and laborers.
loyal to the union johnson had refused to leave the u s senate when tennessee seceded.
after federal forces captured nashville in 1862 lincoln appointed johnson as tennessees military governor.
in the election memphis riot 1866 whites in postwar memphis as in much of the south bitterly resented the presence in their city of former black soldiers mustered out of service with the u s army.
on april 30 1866 when some black veterans no longer protected by their uniforms celebrated the end of their army service by drinking violence broke out.
for three days whites burned black neighborhoods churches and schools raped several african american women and killed dozens of black residents.
two whites also died in the rioting which hardened northern public opinion and prompted calls for stronger measures to put down ex confederate resistance.

the fifty five story woolworth building completed in 1913 marked the beginning of manhattans modern skyline.
the electric city one of the most dramatic urban amenities was electric light.
gaslight produced from coal gas had been used for residential light since the early nineteenth century but gas lamps were too dim to brighten streets and public spaces.
in the 1870s as generating technology became commercially viable electricity proved far better.
electric arc lamps installed in wanamakers department store in philadelphia in 1878 astonished viewers with their brilliant illumination.
electric streetlights soon replaced gaslights on city streets.

traditionally rural daughters had provided essential labor for spinning and weaving cloth but industrialization relocated those tasks from the household to the factory.

part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 the san francisco earthquake californias san andreas fault had caused earthquakes for centuries but when a major metropolis arose nearby it created new potential for catastrophe.
the devastating earthquake of april 18 1906 occurred at 5 12 a m when many residents were sleeping.
this photograph of sacramento street shows the resulting devastation and fires.
the quake probably killed over 2 000 people though the exact number will never be known.
a massive 296 mile rupture along the fault felt as far away as los angeles oregon and central nevada the earthquake refuted contemporary geological theories.
it prompted researchers to open new lines of inquiry aimed at predicting tremors and constructing urban buildings that could withstand them.

the attraction of america was obvious to one young man who had grown up in a poor southern italian farm family.

bohemians gathered in singing societies while new york jews patronized a lively yiddish theater.
by 1903 italians in chicago had sixty six mutual aid societies most composed of people from a particular province or town.
these societies collected dues from members and paid support in case of death or disability on the job.
mutual benefit societies also functioned as fraternal clubs.

though ethnically diverse east los angeles was resolutely working class middleclass white neighborhoods grew up predominantly in west los angeles.
african americans also sought urban opportunities.
in 1900 almost 90 percent of american blacks still lived in the south but increasing numbers had moved to cities such as baton rouge jacksonville montgomery and charleston all of whose populations were galician polish russian mixed middle eastern and romanian more than 50 percent african american.
blacks also settled in northern cities albeit not in the numbers that would arrive during the great migration of world war i.
though blacks constituted only 2 percent of new york citys place events population in 1910 they already in context numbered more than 90 000.

when migration intensified after 1900 longersettled urban blacks like the cherrys often became uncomfortable and relations with needy rural newcomers were sometimes tense.

women took up work in the service sector becoming porters laundrywomen and domestic servants.
blacks faced another urban danger the so called race riot an attack by white mobs triggered by street altercations or rumors of crime.
one of the most virulent episodes occurred in atlanta georgia in 1906.
the violence was fueled by a nasty political campaign that generated sensational false charges of negro crime roaming bands of white men attacked black atlantans invading middle class black neighborhoods and in one case lynching two barbers after seizing them in their shop.
the rioters killed at least twenty four blacks and wounded more than a hundred.
the disease of hatred was not limited to the south.
race riots broke out in new york citys tenderloin district 1900 evansville indiana 1903 and springfield illinois 1908.
by then one journalist observed in every important northern city a distinct race problem already exists which must in a few years assume serious proportions whether they arrived from the south or from europe mexico or asia working class city residents needed cheap housing near their jobs map 19 2.
they faced grim choices.
as urban land values climbed speculators tore down houses that were vacated by middle class families moving away from the industrial core.
in their place they erected five or six story tenements buildings that housed twenty or more families in cramped airless apartments figure 19 1.
tenements fostered rampant disease and horrific infant mortality.
chapter 19 civilizations inferno the rise and reform of industrial cities 1880 1917 yorks tenement house law of 1901 which required interior courts indoor toilets and fire safeguards for new structures.
the law however had no effect on the 44 000 tenements that already existed in manhattan and the bronx.
reformers were thwarted by the economic facts of urban development.
industrial workers could not afford transportation and had to live near their jobs commercial development pushed up land values.
only high density cheaply built housing earned landlords a significant profit.
city cultures despite their dangers and problems industrial cities could be exciting places to live.
in the nineteenth century white middle class protestants had set the cultural standard immigrants and the poor were expected to follow cues from their betters seeking uplift and respectability.
but in the cities new mass based entertainments emerged among the working classes especially youth.
these entertainments spread from the working class to the middle class much to the distress of many middle class parents.
at the same time cities became stimulating centers for intellectual life.
the atlanta race riot seen from france the cover of this paris newsmagazine depicts the atlanta race riot of 1906.
while the artist had almost certainly never visited atlanta his dramatic illustration shows that from this early date racial violence could be a source of embarrassment to the united states in its relations with other countries.

one investigator in philadelphia described twenty six people living in nine rooms of a tenement.

a study of albany syracuse and troy new york noted the colored people are relegated to the least healthful buildings denouncing these conditions reformers called for model tenements financed by public spirited citizens willing to accept a limited return on their investment.
when private philanthropy failed to make a dent cities turned to housing codes.
the most advanced was new urban amusements one enticing attraction was vaudeville theater which arose in the 1880s and 1890s.
vaudeville customers could walk in anytime and watch a continuous sequence of musical acts skits magic shows and other entertainment.
first popular among the working class vaudeville quickly broadened its appeal to include middle class audiences.
by the early 1900s vaudeville faced competition from early movie theaters or nickelodeons which offered short films for a nickel entry fee.
with distaste one reporter described a typical movie audience as mothers of bawling infants and newsboys bootblacks and smudgy urchins by the 1910s even working girls who refrained from less respectable amusements might indulge in a movie once or twice a week.
more spectacular were the great amusement parks that appeared around 1900 most famously at new yorks coney island.
these parks had their origins in worlds fairs whose paid entertainment areas had offered giant ferris wheels and camel rides through a street in cairo entrepreneurs found that such attractions were compare and big business.

the parks offered new yorkers a part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 map 19 2 the expansion of chicago 1865 1902 city limits the residential areas of the city tended to spread out along elevated lightrail railroad lines and streetcar tracks.
these new forms of mass transit enabled people living in distant neighborhoods to reach the central business district and other places of employment.
in 1865 chicagoans depended on horsecar lines to get around town.
by 1900 the city limits had expanded enormously and so had the streetcar service which was by then electrified.
elevated trains eased the congestion on downtown streets.
ongoing extension of the streetcar lines some beyond the city limits ensured that suburban development would continue as well.

central business district horsecar lines 1865 note that some areas of the old city were not used for either residence or industry.
most of these were large regional parks or undeveloped land.

the interior indentation which created an airshaft between adjoining buildings gave the tenement its dumbbell shape.
but what was touted as a model tenement demonstrated instead the futility of trying to reconcile maximum land usage with decent housing.
each floor contained four apartments of three or four rooms the largest only 10 by 11 feet.
the two toilets in the hall became filthy or broke down under daily use by forty or more people.
the narrow airshaft provided almost no light for the interior rooms and served mainly as a dumping ground for garbage.
so deplorable were these tenements that they became the stimulus for the next wave of new york housing reform.

by the summer of 1903 philadelphias willow grove counted three million visitors annually so did two amusement parks outside los angeles.
ragtime and city blues music also became a booming urban entertainment.
by the 1890s tin pan alley the nickname for new york citys songpublishing district produced such national hit tunes as a bicycle built for two and my wild irish rose the most famous sold more than a million copies of sheet music as well as audio recordings for the newly invented phonograph.
to find out what would sell publishers had musicians play at new yorks workingclass beer gardens and dance halls.
one publishing agent who visited sixty joints a week to test new songs declared that the best songs came from the gutter african american musicians brought a syncopated beat that began by the 1890s to work its way into mainstream hits like a hot time in the old town tonight black performers became stars in their own right with the rise of ragtime.
this music apparently named for its ragged rhythm combined a steady beat in the bass played with the left hand on the piano with syncopated off beat rhythms in the treble played with the right.
ragtime became wildly popular among audiences of all classes and races who heard in its infectious rhythms something exciting a decisive break with victorian hymns and parlor songs.
for the master of the genre composer scott joplin ragtime was serious music.
joplin the son of former slaves grew up along the texas arkansas border and took piano lessons as a boy from a german teacher.
he and other traveling performers introduced ragtime to national audiences at the chicago worlds fair in 1893.
seeking to elevate african american music and secure a broad national audience joplin warned pianists it is never right to play ragtime fast but his instructions were widely ignored.
young americans embraced ragtime.
they also embraced each other as ragtime ushered in an urban dance craze.
by 1910 new york alone had more than five hundred dance halls.
in kansas city shocked guardians of morality counted 16 500 dancers on the floor on a saturday night chicago had 86 000.
some young polish and slovak women chose restaurant jobs rather than domestic service so they would have free time to visit dance halls several nights a week new dances like the bunny hug and grizzly bear were overtly sexual they called for close body contact and plenty of hip movement.
in fact many of these dances originated in brothels.
despite widespread denunciation dance mania quickly spread from the urban working classes to rural and middle class youth.
by the 1910s black music was achieving a central place in american popular culture.
african american trumpet player and bandleader w c handy born in alabama electrified national audiences by performing music drawn from the cotton fields of the mississippi delta.
made famous when it reached the big city this part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 music became known as the blues.
blues music spoke of hard work and heartbreak as in handys popular hit st.
louis blues 1914 got de st louis blues jes blue as i can be dat man got a heart lak a rock cast in the sea or else he wouldnt gone so far from me.
blues spoke to the emotional lives of young urbanites who were far from home experiencing dislocation loneliness and bitter disappointment along with the thrills of city life.
like coney island and other leisure activities ragtime and blues helped forge new collective experiences in a world of strangers.
ragtime and blues spread quickly and had a profound influence on twentieth century american culture.
by the time handy published st.
louis blues composer irving berlin a russian jewish immigrant was introducing altered ragtime pieces into musical theater which eventually transferred to radio and film.
lyrics often featured sexual innuendo as in the title of berlins hit song if you dont want my peaches youd better stop shaking my tree the popularity of such music marked the arrival of modern youth culture.
its enduring features included crossover music that originated in the black working class and a commercial music industry that brazenly appropriated african american musical styles.
sex and the city in the city many young people found parental oversight weaker than it had been before.
amusement parks and dance halls helped foster the new custom of dating which like other cultural innovations emerged first among the working class.
gradually it became acceptable for a young man to escort a young woman out on the town for commercial entertainments rather than spending time at home under a chaperones watchful eye.
dating opened a new world of pleasure sexual adventure and danger.
young women headed to dance halls alone to meet men the term gold digger came into use to describe a woman who wanted a mans money more than the man himself.
but young women not men proved most vulnerable in the system of dating.
having less money to spend because they earned half or less of mens wages working class girls relied on the treat some tried to maintain strict standards of respectability keenly aware that their prospects for marriage depended on a virtuous reputation.
others became so called charity girls eager for a good time.
such young women one investigator reported offer themselves to strangers not for money but for presents attention and pleasure for some women sexual favors were a matter of practical necessity.
if i did not have a man declared one waitress i could not get along on my wages in the anonymous city there was not always a clear line between working class treats and casual prostitution.
dating and casual sex were hallmarks of an urban world in which large numbers of residents were young and single.
the 1900 census found that more than 20 percent of women in detroit philadelphia and boston lived as boarders and lodgers not in family units the percentage topped 30 percent in st paul and minneapolis.
single men also found social opportunities in the city.
one historian has called the late nineteenth century the age of the bachelor a time when being an unattached male lost its social stigma.
with boardinghouses restaurants and abundant personal services the city afforded bachelors all the comforts of home and on top of that an array of mens clubs saloons and sporting events.
many industrial cities developed robust gay subcultures.
new yorks gay underground for example included an array of drinking and meeting places as well as clubs and drag balls.
middle class men both straight and gay frequented such venues for entertainment or to find companionship.
one medical student remembered being taken to a ball at which he was startled to find five hundred gay and lesbian couples waltzing to a good band by the 1910s the word queer had come into use as slang for homosexual.
though harassment was frequent and moral reformers like anthony comstock issued regular denunciations of sexual degeneracy arrests were few.
gay sex shows and saloons were lucrative for those who ran them and for police who took bribes to look the other way just as they did for brothels.
the exuberant gay urban subculture offered a dramatic challenge to victorian ideals.
high culture for elites the rise of great cities offered an opportunity to build museums libraries and other cultural institutions that could flourish only in major metropolitan centers.
millionaires patronized the arts partly to advance themselves socially but also out of a sense of civic duty and national pride.
as early as the 1870s symphony orchestras emerged in boston and new york.
composers and conductors soon joined europe in new experiments.
the metropolitan opera founded in 1883 by wealthy businessmen drew enthusiastic crowds to hear the innovative work of richard wagner.
in 1907 the met shocked audiences by presenting richard strausss sexually scandalous opera salome.
art museums and natural history museums also became prominent new institutions in this era.
the nations first major art museum the corcoran gallery chapter 19 civilizations inferno the rise and reform of industrial cities 1880 1917 of art opened in washington d c in 1869 while new yorks metropolitan museum of art settled into its permanent home in 1880.
in the same decades public libraries grew from modest collections into major urban institutions.
the greatest library benefactor was steel magnate andrew carnegie who announced in 1881 that he would build a library in any town or city that was prepared to maintain it.
by 1907 carnegie had spent more than 32 7 million to establish over a thousand libraries throughout the united states.
urban journalism patrons of carnegies libraries could read in addition to books an increasing array of mass market newspapers.
joseph pulitzer owner of the st louis post dispatch and new york world led the way in building his sales base with sensational investigations human interest stories and targeted sections covering sports and high society.
by the 1890s pulitzer faced a challenge from william randolph hearst thinking like a historian p 620.
the arrival of sunday color comics featuring the yellow kid gave such publications the name yellow journalism a derogatory term for mass market newspapers.
hearsts and pulitzers sensational coverage was often irresponsible.
in the late 1890s for example their papers helped whip up frenzied pressure for the united states to declare war against spain chapter 21.
but hearst and pulitzer also exposed scandals and injustices.
they believed their papers should challenge the powerful by speaking to and for ordinary americans.
along with hearsts and pulitzers stunt reporters other urban journalists also worked to promote reform.
new magazines such as mcclures introduced national audiences to reporters such as ida tarbell who exposed the machinations of john d rockefeller and david graham phillips whose treason of the senate published in cosmopolitan in 1906 documented the deference of u s senators especially republicans to wealthy corporate interests.
theodore roosevelt dismissed such writers as muckrakers who focused too much on the negative side of american life.
the term stuck but muckrakers influence was profound.
they inspired thousands of readers to get involved in reform movements and tackle the problems caused by industrialization.
governing the great city one of the most famous muckrakers was lincoln steffens whose book the shame of the cities 1904 first published serially in mcclures magazine denounced the corruption afflicting americas urban governments.
steffens used dramatic language to expose swindling politicians.
he claimed for example that the mayor of minneapolis had turned his city over to outlaws in st louis bribery was a joke while pittsburghs democratic party operated a private company that handled most of the citys street paving projects at a hefty profit.
historians now believe that steffens and other middle class crusaders took a rather extreme view of urban politics the reality was more complex.
but charges of corruption could hardly be denied.
as industrial cities grew with breathtaking speed they posed a serious problem of governance.
urban machines in the united states cities relied largely on private developers to build streetcar lines and provide urgently needed water gas and electricity.
this preference for business solutions gave birth to what one urban historian calls the private city an urban environment shaped by individuals and profit seeking businesses.
private enterprise americans believed spurred great innovations trolley cars electric lighting skyscrapers and drove urban real estate development.
investment opportunities looked so tempting in fact that new cities sprang up almost overnight from the ruins of a catastrophic chicago fire in 1871 and a major san francisco earthquake in 1906.
real estate interests were often instrumental in encouraging streetcar lines to build outward from the central districts.
when contractors sought city business or saloonkeepers needed licenses they turned to political machines local party bureaucracies that kept an unshakable grip on both elected and appointed public offices.
a machine like new yorks infamous tammany society known by the name of its meeting place tammany hall consisted of layers of political functionaries.
at the bottom were precinct captains who knew every city neighborhood and block above them were ward bosses and at the top powerful citywide leaders who had usually started at the bottom and worked their way up.
machines dispensed jobs and patronage arranged for urban services and devoted their energies to staying in office which they did year after year on the strength of their political clout and popularity among urban voters.
for constituents political machines acted as a rough and ready social service agency providing jobs for the jobless or a helping hand for a bereaved family.
tammany ward boss george washington plunkitt for example reported that he arranged housing for thinking like a historian making mass media newspaper empires among the businesses that served urban consumers were mass market newspapers.
joseph pulitzers new york world led the way in the 1880s a decade later pulitzer had a powerful rival in the new york journal owned by william randolph hearst.

working class readers instantly recognized the kid slang that then referred to working class immigrant children.

nellie bly in a night haunt of the citys wretchedest of women new york world february 9 1896.
pulitzer and hearst hired many stunt reporters the most famous was elizabeth jane cochrane who took her pen name nellie bly from a popular song.
in 1892 sponsored by the world bly beat the record in jules vernes famous novel around the world in eighty days circumnavigating the world in seventy two days.
she filed many investigative pieces such as this one.
an old woman stood with her back against the side of a building.
over her head was a ragged shawl that had once been red.
around her knees hung a limp and shapeless calico skirt.
the rain and sleet were falling steadily and lay thick and slushy upon the streets.
i shivered as i stopped to watch.
if the old woman felt the cold she gave no sign.
she stood motionless peeping around the corner.
her eyes were fixed upon the door of the oak street station house.
just then three small boys unmindful of the weather came trudging down the street.
industriously gathering every white spot that showed upon the pavement to add to the black snowballs they held in their wet red hands.
turning the corner suddenly they came upon the old woman.
for a second they paused and looked at her and she glared at them.
it reminded me of the way dogs behave when they turn a corner and espy a cat.
the old woman started on a frantic hobble across the street the boys after her.
their black snowballs landed squarely and soakingly against her bent back.
the old woman shouted things as she ran things that do not sound well and are never by any chance reproduced in print but they seemed to increase the delight of the fiendish boys.
she could hobble she made for the station house and the boys pursued her pelting her.

part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 families after their apartments burned fix ing them up until they get things runnin again plunkitt was an irishman and so were most tammany hall leaders.
but by the 1890s plunkitts fifteenth district was filling up with italians and russian jews.
on a given day as recorded in his diary he might attend an italian funeral in the afternoon and a jewish wedding in the evening.
wherever he went he brought gifts listened to his constituents troubles and offered a helping hand.
the favors dispensed by men like plunkitt came via a system of boss control that was as lincoln steffens charged corrupt.
though rural state and national politics were hardly immune to such problems cities offered flagrant opportunities for bribes and kickbacks.
the level of corruption as plunkitt observed was greater in cities accordin to the opportunities when politicians made contracts for city services some of the money ended up in their pockets.
in the 1860s william marcy tweed known as boss tweed had made tammany hall a byword for corruption until he was brought down in 1871 by flagrant overpricing of contracts for a lavish city courthouse.
thereafter machine corruption became more surreptitious.
plunkitt declared that he had no need for outright bribes.
he favored what he called honest graft the profits that came to savvy insiders who knew where and when to buy land.
plunkitt made most of his money building wharves on manhattans waterfront.
middle class reformers condemned immigrants for supporting machines.
but urban immigrants believed that few middle class americans cared about the plight of poor city folk like themselves.
machines were hardly perfect but immigrants could rely on them for jobs emergency aid and the only public services they could hope to obtain.
astute commentators saw that bosses dominated city government because they provided what was needed with no condescending moral judgments.
as reformer jane addams put it the ward boss was a stalking survival of village kindness voters knew he was corrupt but on election day they might say ah well he has a big irish heart.
he is good to the widow and the fatherless or he knows the poor addams concluded that middle class reformexplain ers would only make headway if consequences they set aside their prejudices why given that everyone learned to stand by and for and agreed machines were with the people and did a betcorrupt did urban voters ter job of it than the machine support them.
bosses did.
to see a longer excerpt of the jane addams essay along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
machine style governments achieved some notable successes.
they arranged at a profit for companies to operate streetcars bring clean water and gaslight and remove garbage.
nowhere in the world were there more massive public projects aqueducts sewage systems bridges and spacious parks than in the great cities of the united states.
the nature of this achievement can be grasped by comparing chicago illinois with berlin the capital of germany in 1900.
at that time chicagos waterworks pumped 500 million gallons of water a day providing 139 gallons per resident berliners made do with 18 gallons each.
flush toilets a rarity in berlin could be found in 60 percent of chicago homes.
chicago lit its streets with electricity while berlin still relied mostly on gaslight.
chicago had twice as many parks as the german capital and it had just completed an ambitious sanitation project that reversed the course of the chicago river carrying sewage into lake michigan away from city residents.
these achievements were remarkable because american municipal governments labored under severe political constraints.
judges did grant cities some authority in 1897 for example new yorks state supreme court ruled that new york city was entirely within its rights to operate a municipally owned subway.
use of private land was also subject to whatever regulations a city might impose.
but starting with an 1868 ruling in iowa the american legal system largely classified the city as a corporate entity subject to state control.
in contrast to state governments cities had only a limited police power which they could use for example to stop crime but not to pass more ambitious measures for public welfare.
states not cities held most taxation power and received most public revenues.
machines and their private allies flourished in part because cities were starved for legitimate cash.
thus money talked powerful economic interests warped city government.
working class residents even those loyal to their local machines knew that the newest electric lights and best trolley lines served affluent neighborhoods where citizens had the most clout.
hilda satt a polish immigrant who moved into a poor chicago neighborhood in 1893 recalled garbagestrewn streets and filthy backyard privies.
the streets were paved with wooden blocks she later wrote and after a heavy rainfall the blocks would become loose and float about in the street she remembered that on one such occasion local pranksters posted a sign chapter 19 civilizations inferno the rise and reform of industrial cities 1880 1917 city garbage how to get rid of the garbage was a question that bedeviled every american city.

saying the mayor and the aldermen are invited to swim here as cities expanded the limitations of political machines became increasingly clear.
the limits of machine government the scale of urban problems became dramatically evident in the depression of the 1890s when unemployment reached a staggering 25 percent in some cities.
homelessness and hunger were rampant newspapers nationwide reported on cases of starvation desperation and suicide.
to make matters worse most cities had abolished the early nineteenth century system of outdoor relief which provided public support for the indigent.
fearing the system promoted laziness among the poor middle class reformers had insisted on private not public charity.
even cities that continued to provide outdoor relief in the 1890s were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crisis.
flooded with tramps police stations were forced to end the long standing practice of allowing homeless individuals to sleep inside.
faced with this crisis many urban voters proved none too loyal to the machines when better alternatives arose.
cleveland ohio for example experienced part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917.
chapter 18 without a male chaperone risked damaging her reputation.
but the rise of new businesses encouraged change.
to attract an eager public purveyors of consumer culture invited women and families especially those of the middle class to linger in department stores and enjoy new amusements.
no one promoted commercial domesticity more successfully than showman p t barnum 1810 1891 who used the countrys expanding rail network to develop his famous traveling circus.
barnum condemned earlier circus managers who had opened their tents to the rowdy element proclaiming children as his key audience he created family entertainment for diverse audiences though in the south black audiences sat in segregated seats or attended separate shows.
he promised middle class parents that his circus would teach children courage and promote the benefits of exercise.
to encourage womens attendance barnum emphasized the respectability and refinement of his female performers.
department stores also lured middle class women by offering tearooms childrens play areas umbrellas and clerks to wrap and carry every purchase.
store credit plans enabled well to do women to shop without handling money in public.
such tactics succeeded so well that new yorks department store district became known as ladies mile.
boston department store magnate william filene called the department store an adamless eden these edens were for the elite and middle class.
though bargain basements and neighborhood stores served working class families big department stores enlisted vagrancy laws and police to discourage the wrong kind from entering.
working class women gained access primarily as clerks cashiers and cash girls who at age twelve or younger served as internal store messengers carrying orders and change for 1 50 a week.
the department store was no eden for these women who worked long hours on their feet often dealing with difficult customers.
nevertheless many clerks claimed their own privileges as shoppers making enthusiastic use of employee discounts and battling employers for the right to wear their fashionable purchases while they worked in the store.
in similar ways class status was marked by the ways technology entered american homes.
the rise of electricity in particular marked the gap between affluent urban consumers and rural and working class families.
in elite houses domestic servants began to use or find themselves replaced by an array of new devices from washing machines to vacuum cleaners.
when alexander graham bell invented the telephone in the victorians make the modern 1880 1917 1876 entrepreneurs introduced explain the device for business use but it consequences soon found eager residential cus how did new consumer tomers.
telephones changed eti practices arising from quette and social relations for industrialization reshape middle class suburban women americans gender class while providing their working and race relationships.
class counterparts with new employment options thinking like a historian p 578.
railroads also reflected the emerging privileges of professional families.
finding prosperous americans eager for excursions railroad companies like department stores made things comfortable for middle class women and children.
bostons south terminal station boasted of its modern amenities including everything that the traveler needs down to cradles in which the baby may be soothed an 1882 tourist guide promised readers that they could live on the pacific railroad with as much true enjoyment as the home drawing room rail cars manufactured by the famous pullman company of chicago set a national standard for taste and elegance.
fitted with rich carpets upholstery and woodwork pullman cars embodied the growing prosperity of americas elite influencing trends in home decor.
part of their appeal was the chance for people of modest means to emulate the rich.
an experienced train conductor observed that the wives of grocers not millionaires were the ones most likely to sweep.
into a parlor car as if the very carpet ought to feel highly honored by their tread first class ladies cars soon became sites of struggle for racial equality.
for three decades after the end of the civil war state laws and railroad regulations varied and african americans often succeeded in securing seats.
one reformer noted however there are few ordeals more nerve wracking than the one which confronts a colored woman when she tries to secure a pullman reservation in the south and even in some parts of the north when they claimed first class seats black women often faced confrontations with conductors resulting in numerous lawsuits in the 1870s and 1880s.
riding the chesapeake ohio line in 1884 young african american journalist ida b.
wells was told to leave.
i refused she wrote later saying that the nearest alternative car was a smoker and as i was in the ladies car i proposed to stay wells resisted but the conductor and a baggage handler threw her bodily off the train.
returning home to memphis wells sued and won in local courts but tennessees supreme court reversed the ruling.
in 1896 the u s supreme court settled such issues decisively but not justly.
the case plessy v ferguson thinking like a historian america picks up the telephone new consumer technologies often had different impacts on working class and rural americans than they did on the prosperous elite and the middle class.
the documents below also suggest some of the ways that telephone use reflected new expectations about womens roles in the home workplace and society.

what does this document tell us about the values of the emerging corporate workplace.
the operator must now be made as nearly as possible a paragon of perfection a kind of human machine the exponent of speed and courtesy a creature spirited enough to move like chain lightning and with perfect accuracy docile enough to deny herself the sweet privilege of the last word.
she must assume that the subscriber is always right and even when she knows he is not her only comeback must be excuse it please in the same smiling voice.

telephone etiquette from a woman of fashion 1898.
at the turn of the century etiquette authorities began grudgingly to acknowledge the role of telephones in social life.
do you notice any contradictions in the advice below.
invitations by telephone for anything other than informal engagements.
are hopelessly vulgar.
they should be the last resort.
invitations to bicycle or to play golf may be transmitted in this way and the telephone is a blessing often in adjusting details or making explanations but for most social matters the use of the telephone is questionable at best.
many women will stand with aching feet and irritated brow at a telephone for half an hour rather than write a note which would take four minutes.
invitation by telephone is one of those modern innovations to which the conservative have never been accustomed and which shocks elderly conventional persons still.
the convenience of the telephone for quickness and prompt response appeals however to so many persons that it is hopeless and useless to inveigh against it.
if some ones note has been mislaid or forgotten there is nothing simpler than to telephone to repair the error and to explain.
it is much speedier than sending a note.
there is no excuse for telephoning an invitation when time is not an object or when the person invited is not an intimate friend.

the text from this ad was accompanied by a picture of a young woman on the telephone with young men and women in a room behind her dancing.
for social arrangements the informal invitation which comes over the phone is generally the most welcome.

for impromptu invitations the easiest way to get up an informal party quickly is by telephone.

placing a national stamp of approval on segregation the plessy decision remained in place until 1954 when the courts brown v topeka board of education ruling finally struck it down.
until then blacks exclusion from first class public accommodations was one of the most painful marks of racism.
the plessy decision like the rock bottom wages earned by twelve year old girls at macys showed that consumer culture could be modern and innovative without being politically progressive.
business and consumer culture were shaped by and themselves shaped racial and class injustices.
masculinity and the rise of sports horatio alger jr.
in dozens of popular boys books published between 1867 and 1917 horatio alger jr assured young readers that if they were honest worked hard and cultivated good character they could succeed in the new competitive economy.
his heroes such as the famous ragged dick often grew up in poverty on the streets of big cities.
brave and bold 1874 told the story of a small town boy forced to work in a factory he is unfairly fired but through persistence and courage he wins a good job and recovers an inheritance for his mother.
algers books were republished often as in this boys magazine from 1911 and many remain in print today.

was brought by civil rights advocates on behalf of homer plessy a new orleans resident who was oneeighth black.
ordered to leave a first class car and move to the colored car of a louisiana train plessy refused and was arrested.
the court ruled that such segregation did not violate the fourteenth amendment as long as blacks had access to accommodations that were separate but equal to those of whites.
separate but equal was a myth segregated facilities in the south were flagrantly inferior.
jim crow segregation laws named for a stereotyped black character who appeared in minstrel shows clearly discriminated but the court allowed them to stand.
while industrialization spawned public domesticity a consumer culture that courted affluent women and families it also changed expectations for men in the workplace.
traditionally the mark of a successful american man was economic independence he was his own boss.
now tens of thousands worked for other men in big companies and in offices rather than using their muscles.
would the professional american male through his concentration on brain work become weak effeminate and decaying as one editor warned.
how could well to do men assert their independence if work no longer required them to prove themselves physically.
how could they develop toughness and strength.
one answer was athletics.
muscular christianity the young mens christian association ymca was one of the earliest and most successful promoters of athletic fitness.
introduced in boston in 1851 the group promoted muscular christianity combining evangelism with gyms and athletic facilities where men could make themselves clean and strong focusing first on white collar workers the ymca developed a substantial industrial program after 1900.
railroad managers and other corporate titans hoped ymcas would foster a loyal and contented workforce discouraging labor unrest.
business leaders also relied on sports to build physical and mental discipline and help men adjust their bodies to the demands of the industrial clock.
sports honed mens competitive spirit they believed employer sponsored teams instilled teamwork and company pride.
working class men had their own ideas about sports and leisure and ymcas quickly became a site of negotiation.
could workers come to the y to play chapter 18 billiards or cards.
could they smoke.
at first ymca leaders said no but to attract working class men they had to make concessions.
as a result the y became a place where middle class and working class customs blended or existed in uneasy tension.
at the same time ymca leaders innovated.
searching for winter activities in the 1890s ymca instructors invented the new indoor games of basketball and volleyball.
for elite americans meanwhile country clubs flourished both men and women could enjoy tennis golf and swimming facilities as well as social gatherings.
by the turn of the century perhaps because country club women were encroaching on their athletic turf elite men took up even more aggressive physical sports including boxing weightlifting and martial arts.
as early as 1890 future president theodore roosevelt argued that such virile activities were essential to maintain and defend this very civilization most masterful nations he claimed have shown a strong taste for manly sports roosevelt son of a wealthy new york family became one of the first american devotees of jujitsu.
during his presidency 1901 1909 he designated a judo room in the white house and hired an expert japanese instructor.
roosevelt also wrestled and boxed urging other american men especially among the elite to increase their leadership fitness by pursuing the strenuous life to see a longer excerpt of theodore roosevelts views on sports along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
americas game before the 1860s the only distinctively american game was native american lacrosse and the most popular team sport among european americans was cricket.
after the civil war however team sports became a fundamental part of american manhood none more successfully than baseball.
a derivative of cricket the games formal rules had begun to develop in new york in the 1840s and 1850s.
its popularity spread in military camps during the civil war.
afterward the idea that baseball received its baptism in the bloody days of our nations direst danger as one promoter put it became part of the games mythology.
until the 1870s most amateur players were clerks and white collar workers who had leisure to play and the income to buy their own uniforms.
business frowned on baseball and other sports as a waste of time especially for working class men.
but latenineteenth century employers came to see baseball like other athletic pursuits as a benefit for workers.
it the victorians make the modern 1880 1917 provided fresh air and exercise trace change kept men out of saloons and pro over time moted discipline and teamwork.
how and why did ameriplayers on company sponsored can sports evolve and teams wearing uniforms embla how did athletics soften or zoned with their employers sharpen social divisions.
names began to compete on paid work time.
baseball thus set a pattern for how other american sports developed.
begun among independent craftsmen it was taken up by elite men anxious to prove their strength and fitness.
well to do americans then decided the sport could benefit the working class.
big time professional baseball arose with the launching of the national league in 1876.
the league quickly built more than a dozen teams in large cities from the brooklyn trolley dodgers to the cleveland spiders.
team owners were in their own right profitminded entrepreneurs who shaped the sport to please consumers.
wooden grandstands soon gave way to concrete and steel stadiums.
by 1900 boys collected lithographed cards of their favorite players and the baseball cap came into fashion.
in 1903 the boston americans defeated the pittsburgh pirates in the first world series.
american men could now adopt a new consumer identity not as athletes but as fans.
rise of the negro leagues baseball stadiums like first class rail cars were sites of racial negotiation and conflict.
in the 1880s and 1890s major league managers hired a few african american players.
as late as 1901 the baltimore orioles succeeded in signing charlie grant a light skinned black player from cincinnati by renaming him charlie tokohoma and claiming he was cherokee.
but as this subterfuge suggested black players were increasingly barred.
a toledo team received a threatening note before one game in richmond virginia if their negro catcher played he would be lynched.
toledo put a substitute on the field and at the end of the season the club terminated the black players contract.
shut out of white leagues players and fans turned to all black professional teams where black men could showcase athletic ability and race pride.
louisianas top team the new orleans pinchbacks pointedly named themselves after the states black reconstruction governor.
by the early 1900s such teams organized into separate negro leagues.
though players suffered from erratic pay and rundown ball fields the leagues thrived until the desegregation of baseball after world war ii.
in an era of stark discrimination they celebrated black manhood and talent.

they showed a style in almost everything they did american football the most controversial sport of the industrializing era was football which began at elite colleges during the 1880s.
the great powerhouse was the yale team whose legendary coach walter camp went on to become a watch manufacturer.
between 1883 and 1891 under camps direction yale scored 4 660 points its opponents scored 92.
drawing on the workplace model of scientific management camp emphasized drill and precision.
he and other coaches argued that football offered perfect training for the competitive world of business.
the game was violent six players deaths in the 1908 college season provoked a public outcry.
eventually new rules protected quarterbacks and required coaches to remove injured players from the game.
but such measures were adopted grudgingly with supporters arguing that they ruined footballs benefits in manly training.
like baseball and the ymca football attracted sponsorship from business leaders hoping to divert workers from labor activism.
the first professional teams emerged in western pennsylvanias steel towns soon after the defeat of the steelworkers union.
carnegie steel executives organized teams in homestead and braddock the first league appeared during the anthracite coal strike of 1902.
other teams arose in the midwestern industrial heartland.
the indian acme packing company sponsored the green bay packers the future chicago bears first known as the decatur staleys were funded by a manufacturer of laundry starch.
like its baseball equivalent professional football encouraged men to buy in as spectators and fans.
football practice chilocco indian school 1911 football became widely popular spreading from ivy league schools and state universities to schools like this one built on cherokee land in oklahoma.
the uniforms of this team typical of the day show very limited padding and protection a factor that contributed to high rates of injury and even death on the field.
as they practiced in 1911 these chilocco students had an inspiring model to look up to in that year jim thorpe a fellow oklahoman and a member of the sac and fox tribe was winning national fame by leading the all indian team at pennsylvanias carlisle school to victory against harvard.

chapter 18 the great outdoors as the rise of sports suggests elite and middle class americans began by the 1880s and 1890s to see victorian culture as stuffy and claustrophobic.
they revolted by heading outdoors.
a craze for bicycling swept the country in 1890 at the height of the mania u s manufacturers sold an astonishing ten million bikes.
women were not far behind men in taking up athletics.
by the 1890s even elite women long confined to corsets and heavy clothes that restricted their movement donned lighter dresses and pursued archery and golf.
artist charles gibson became famous for his portraits of the gibson girl an elite beauty depicted on the tennis court or swimming at the beach.
the gibson girl personified the ideal of new women more educated athletic and independent than their mothers.
those with money and leisure time used railroad networks to get to the national parks of the west which as one senator put it became a breathing place for the national lungs people of more modest means began to take up camping.
as early as 1904 californias coronado beach offered tent rentals for 3 a week.
a decade later campgrounds and cottages in many parts of the country catered to a working class clientele.
in an industrial society the outdoors became associated with leisure and renewal rather than danger and hard work.
one journalist reflecting on urban life from the vantage point of a western vacation wrote how stupid it all seems the mad eagerness of money making men the sham pleasures of conventional society in the wilderness he wrote your blood clarifies your brain becomes active.
you get a new view of life as americans searched for such renewal in remnants of unexploited land the nations first environmental movement arose.
john muir who fell in love with the yosemite valley in 1869 became the most famous voice for wilderness.
raised in a stern scots presbyterian family on a wisconsin farm muir knew much of the bible by heart.
he was a keen observer who developed a deeply spiritual relationship with the natural world.
his contemporary mary austin whose book land of little rain 1905 celebrated the austere beauty of the california desert called him a devout man in cooperation with his editor at century magazine muir founded the sierra club in 1892.
like the earlier appalachian mountain club founded in boston in 1876 the sierra club dedicated itself to preserving and enjoying americas great mountains.
encouraged by such groups national and state governments set aside more public lands for preservation and recreation.
the united states substantially the victorians make the modern 1880 1917 expanded its park system and identify causes during theodore roosevelts what changes in american presidency extended the reach society precipitated the of national forests.
starting in 1872 rise of national parks and with the preservation of yellow monuments.
stone in wyoming congress had begun to set aside land for national parks.
in 1916 president woodrow wilson provided comprehensive oversight of these national parks signing an act creating the national park service map 18 1.
a year later the system numbered thirteen parks including maines acadia the first east of the mississippi river.
environmentalists also worked to protect wildlife.
by the 1890s several state audubon societies named in honor of antebellum naturalist john james audubon banded together to advocate broader protections for wild birds especially herons and egrets that were being slaughtered by the thousands for their plumes.
they succeeded in winning the lacey act 1900 which established federal penalties for selling specified birds animals and plants.
soon afterward state organizations joined together to form the national audubon society.
women played prominent roles in the movement promoting boycotts of hats with plumage.
in 1903 president theodore roosevelt created the first national wildlife refuge at pelican island florida.
roosevelt also expanded preservation under the antiquities act 1906 which enabled the u s president without congressional approval to set aside objects of historic and scientific interest as national monuments.
two years later roosevelt used these powers to preserve 800 000 acres at arizonas magnificent grand canyon.
the act proved a mixed blessing for conservation.
monuments received weaker protection than national parks did many fell under the authority of the u s forest service which permitted logging and grazing.
business interests thus lobbied to have coveted lands designated as monuments rather than national parks so they could more easily exploit resources.
nonetheless the creation of national monuments offered some protection and many monuments such as alaskas katmai later obtained park status.
the expanding network of parks and monuments became popular places to hike camp and contemplate natural beauty.
the great outdoors provided new opportunities for women with the means to travel.
one writer advising women to enjoy mountain hikes hinted at liberating possibilities for those loving freedom and health he recommended short skirts pantlets stout shoes tasty hat and like other leisure venues wilderness did not remain in the hands of elite men and women.

in 1893 the federal government began to intervene to protect national forests.
without theodore roosevelt however the national forest program might have languished during his presidency he added 125 million acres to the forest system plus six national parks in addition to several that had already been created during the 1890s.
americas national forest and park systems remain one of the most visible and beloved legacies of federal policy innovation in the decades between the civil war and world war i.
as early as the late 1880s the lakes and hiking trails of the catskill mountains became so thronged with working class tourists from nearby new york city including many jewish immigrants that elite visitors began to segregate themselves into gated summer communities.
they thus preserved the seclusion and privacy that they snobbishly claimed as the privilege of those who could demonstrate mental and personal worth at the state level meanwhile new game laws triggered conflicts between elite conservationists and the poor.
shifting from year round subsistence hunting to a limited recreational hunting season brought hardship to poor rural families who depended on game for food.
regulation brought undeniable benefits it suppressed such popular practices as songbird hunting and the use of dynamite to kill fish.
looking back on the era before game laws one alabama hunter remembered that the slaughter was terrific but while game laws prevented further extinctions like that of the passenger pigeon which vanished around 1900 they made it harder for rural people to support themselves from the bounty of the land.
women men and the solitude of self speaking to congress in 1892 womens rights advocate elizabeth cady stanton described what she called the solitude of self stanton rejected the claim that women did not need equal rights because they enjoyed mens protection.
the talk of sheltering woman from the fierce storms of life is the sheerest mockery she declared.

at the same time middle class women expected to engage in selfless community service often saw the impact of industrialization more clearly than fathers brothers and husbands did.
in seeking to address alcoholism poverty and other social and economic ills they gained a new sense of their own collective power.

the average american family especially among the middle class decreased in size during the industrial era.
in 1800 white women who survived to menopause had borne an average of 7 0 children by 1900 the average was 3 6.
on farms and in many working class families youngsters counted as assets on the family balance sheet they worked in fields or factories.
but parents who had fewer sons and daughters could concentrate their resources educating and preparing each child for success in the new economy.
among the professional classes education became a necessity while limiting family size became more broadly a key to upward mobility.
several factors limited childbearing.
americans married at older ages and many mothers tried to space pregnancies more widely as their mothers and grandmothers had by nursing children for several years which suppressed fertility.
by the late nineteenth century as vulcanized rubber became available couples also had access to a range of other contraceptive methods such as condoms and diaphragms.
with pressure for family limitation rising these methods were widely used and apparently effective.
but couples rarely wrote about them.
historians evidence comes from the occasional frank diary and from the thriving success of the mailorder contraceptive industry which advertised prominently and shipped products wrapped in discreet brown paper packages to customers nationwide.
reluctance to talk about contraceptives was understandable since information about them was stigmatized and after 1873 illegal to distribute.
during reconstruction anthony comstock crusading secretary of the new york society for the suppression of vice secured a federal law banning obscene materials from the u s mail.
the comstock act 1873 prohibited circulation of almost any information about sex and birth control.
comstock won support for the law in part by appealing to parents fears that young people were receiving sexual information through the mail part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 portrait of a middle class american family this photograph of the hedlund family was taken on july 4 1911 on the front porch of their home in st paul minnesota.

a committee of the new york legislature declared comstocks crusade wholly essential to the safety and decency of the community it appears however that comstock had little success in stopping the lucrative and popular trade in contraceptives.
place events in context education in the industrial economy the watchword for young people who hoped to secure good jobs was education.
a high school diploma now a gateway to a college degree was valuable for boys who hoped to enter professional or managerial work.
daughters attended in even larger numbers than their brothers table 18 1.
parents of the civil war generation who had witnessed the plight of war widows and orphans encouraged girls to prepare themselves for teaching or office jobs work before marriage and gain skills they could fall back on just in case by 1900 71 percent of americans between the ages of five and eighteen attended school.
that figure rose further in the early twentieth century as public officials adopted laws requiring school attendance.
most high schools were coeducational and almost every high school featured athletics.
recruited first as cheerleaders for boys teams girls soon established field hockey and other sports of their own.
boys and girls engaged in friendly and sometimes not sofriendly rivalry in high school.

the rate of americans attending college had long hovered around 2 percent driven by public universities expansion the rate rose in the 1880s reaching 8 percent by 1920.
much larger numbers attended a growing network of business and technical schools.
get a place in the world advertised one minneapolis business college in 1907 where your talents can be used to the best advantage typically such schools offered both day and night classes in subjects such as bookkeeping typewriting and shorthand.
the needs of the new economy also shaped the curriculum at more traditional collegiate institutions.
state universities emphasized technical training and fed the growing professional workforce with graduates trained in fields such as engineering.
many private colleges distanced themselves from such practical pursuits their administrators argued that students who aimed to be leaders needed broad based knowledge.
but they modernized course offerings emphasizing french and german for example rather than latin and greek.
harvard led by dynamic president charles w eliot from 1869 to 1909 pioneered the liberal arts.
students at the all male college chose from a range of electives as eliot called for classes that developed each young mans individual reality and creative power in the south one of the most famous educational projects was booker t washingtons tuskegee institute founded in 1881.
washington both taught and exemplified the goal of self help his autobiography up from slavery 1901 became a best seller.
because of the deep poverty in which most southern african americans lived washington concluded that book education for most would be almost a waste of time he focused instead on industrial education.
students he argued would be sure of knowing how to make a living after they had left us tuskegee sent female graduates into teaching and nursing men more often entered the industrial trades or farmed by the latest scientific methods.
washington gained national fame in 1895 with his atlanta compromise address delivered at the cotton states exposition in atlanta georgia.
for the expositions white organizers the racial compromise was inviting washington to speak at all.
it was a move intended to show racial progress in the south.
washington in turn delivered an address that many interpreted as approving racial segregation.
stating that african americans had in slavery days proved our loyalty to you he assured whites that in our humble way we shall stand by you.

he was remarkable both for his effectiveness in speaking to white americans and for his deep understanding of the aspirations of blacks.

but having befriended several whites in his youth he also believed that african americans could appeal to whites of good will and maneuver around those who were hostile in the struggle for equality.
he hoped most of all that economic achievement would erase white prejudice.
brown brothers.
private influence was well suited to the difficult years after reconstruction.
washington believed that money was color blind that whites would respect economic success.
he represented the ideals of millions of african americans who hoped education and hard work would erase white prejudice.
that hope proved tragically overoptimistic.
as the tide of disenfranchisement and segregation rolled in washington would come under fire from a younger generation of race leaders who argued that he accommodated too much to white racism.
in addition to african american education womens higher education expanded notably.
in the northeast and south women most often attended single sex institutions including teacher training colleges.
for affluent families private colleges offered an education equivalent to mens for an equally high price.
vassar college started the trend when it opened in 1861 smith wellesley and others followed.
anxious doctors warned that these institutions were dangerous intensive brain work would unsex young women and drain energy from their ovaries leading them to bear weak children.
but as thousands of women earned degrees and suffered no apparent harm fears faded.
single sex higher education for women spread from private to public institutions especially in the south where the mississippi state college for women 1885 led the way.
coeducation was more prevalent in the midwest and west where many state universities opened their doors to female students after the civil war.
women were also admitted to most african american colleges founded during reconstruction.
by 1910 58 percent of americas colleges and universities were coeducational.
while students at single sex institutions forged strong bonds with one another women also gained benefits from learning with men.
when male students were friendly they built comfortable working relationships when men were hostile women learned coping skills that served them well in later employment or reform work.
one doctor who studied at the university of iowa remembered later that he and his friends mercilessly harassed the first women who entered the medical school.
but when the women showed they were good students the mens attitudes changed to wholesome respect whether or not they got a college education more and more women recognized in the words of elizabeth cady stanton their solitude of self in the changing economy they could not always count on fathers and husbands.
women who needed to support themselves could choose from dozens of guidebooks such as what girls can do 1880 and how to make money although a woman 1895.
the association for the advancement of women founded in 1873 by womens college graduates defended womens higher education and argued that womens paid employment was a positive good.
today many economists argue that education and high quality jobs for women are keys to reducing poverty in the developing world.
in the united states that process also led to broader gains in womens political rights.
as women began to earn advanced degrees work for wages and salaries and live independently it became harder to argue that women were dependents who did not need to vote.
chapter 18 the victorians make the modern 1880 1917 class of 1896 radcliffe college when harvard university long a bastion of male privilege created an annex for womens instruction in 1879 it was a sure sign of growing support for womens higher education.
the annex became radcliffe college in 1894.
two years later this graduating class of thirty posed for their portrait.
among them was alice sterling of bridgeport connecticut who went on to marry harvard graduate frank cook and devote herself to protestant foreign missions.

from domesticity to womens rights as the united states confronted industrialization middle class women steadily expanded their place beyond the household building reform movements and taking political action.
starting in the 1880s womens clubs sprang up and began to study such problems as pollution unsafe working conditions and urban poverty.
so many formed by 1890 that their leaders created a nationwide umbrella organization the general federation of womens clubs.
women justified such work through the ideal of maternalism appealing to their special role as mothers.
maternalism was an intermediate step between domesticity and modern arguments for womens equality.
womens place is home declared the journalist rheta childe dorr.
but she added home is the community.
the city full of people is the family.
badly do the home and family need their mother the womans christian temperance union one maternalist goal was to curb alcohol abuse by prohibiting liquor sales.
the womans christian temperance union wctu founded in 1874 spread rapidly after 1879 when charismatic frances willard became its leader.
more than any other group of the late nineteenth century the wctu launched women into reform.
willard knew how to frame political demands part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 in the language of feminine selfsacrifice.
womanliness first she advised her followers afterward how did women use widewhat you will wctu members spread beliefs about their vividly described the plight of special role to justify abused wives and children when political activism and for men suffered in the grip of alcowhat goals.
willards motto was home protection and though it placed all the blame on alcohol rather than other factors the wctu became the first organization to identify and combat domestic violence.
the prohibitionist movement drew activists from many backgrounds.
middle class city dwellers worried about the link between alcoholism and crime especially in the growing immigrant wards.
rural citizens equated liquor with big city sins such as prostitution and political corruption.
methodists baptists mormons and members of other denominations condemned understand points of view drinking for religious reasons.
immigrants passionately disagreed however germans and irish catholics enjoyed their sunday beer and saw no harm in it.
saloons were a centerpiece of working class leisure and community life offering free lunches public toilets and a place to share neighborhood news.
thus while some labor unions advocated voluntary temperance attitudes toward prohibition divided along ethnic religious and class lines.
wctu activism led some leaders to raise radical questions about the shape of industrial society.
as she investigated alcohol abuse willard increasingly confronted poverty hunger unemployment and other industrial problems.
do everything she urged her members.
across the united states wctu chapters founded soup kitchens and free libraries.
they introduced a german educational innovation the kindergarten.
they investigated prison conditions.
though she did not persuade most prohibitionists to follow her a plea for temperance 1874 the origins of the womans christian temperance union lay in spontaneous prayer meetings held by women outside local saloons where they appealed for men to stop drinking and liquor sellers to destroy their product.
a string of such meetings in ohio won national attention as in this image from a popular magazine the daily graphic.
who will win asked the artist.
the answers varied.
a few saloon owners struck with remorse over the damage caused by alcohol abuse smashed their beer kegs and poured their liquor into the gutters.
far more refused but in the 1880s temperance women succeeded in organizing the largest grassroots movement of their day to build support for outlawing liquor sales.
the granger collection new york.
chapter 18 lead willard declared herself a christian socialist and urged more attention to workers plight.
she advocated laws establishing an eight hour workday and abolishing child labor.
willard also called for womens voting rights lending powerful support to the independent suffrage movement that had emerged during reconstruction.
controversially the wctu threw its energies behind the prohibition party which exercised considerable clout during the 1880s.
women worked in the party as speakers convention delegates and even local candidates.
liquor was big business and powerful interests mobilized to block antiliquor legislation.
in many areas particularly the cities prohibition simply did not gain majority support.
willard retired to england where she died in 1898 worn and discouraged by many defeats.
but her legacy was powerful.
other groups took up the cause eventually winning national prohibition after world war i.
through its emphasis on human welfare the wctu encouraged women to join the national debate over poverty and inequality of wealth.
some became active in the peoples party of the 1890s which welcomed women as organizers and stump speakers.
others led groups such as the national congress of mothers founded in 1897 which promoted better child rearing techniques in rural and working class families.
the wctu had taught women how to lobby raise money and even run for office.
willard wrote that perhaps the most significant outcome of the movement was womens knowledge of their own power women race and patriotism as in temperance work women played central roles in patriotic movements and african american community activism.
members of the daughters of the american revolution dar founded in 1890 celebrated the memory of revolutionary war heroes.
equally influential was the united daughters of the confederacy udc founded in 1894 to extol the souths lost cause the udcs elite southern members shaped americans memory of the civil war by constructing monuments distributing confederate flags and promoting school textbooks that defended the confederacy and condemned reconstruction.
the udcs work helped build and maintain support for segregation and disenfranchisement chapter 15 thinking like a historian p 502.
african american women did not sit idle in the face of this challenge.
in 1896 they created the national association of colored women.
through its local clubs black women arranged for the care of orphans founded homes for the elderly advocated temperance the victorians make the modern 1880 1917 ida b.
wells in 1887 ida wells wells barnett after she married in 1895 was thrown bodily from a train in tennessee for refusing to vacate her seat in a section reserved for whites launching her into a lifelong crusade for racial justice.
her mission was to expose the evil of lynching in the south.

and undertook public health campaigns.
such women shared with white women a determination to carry domesticity into the public sphere.
journalist victoria earle matthews hailed the american home as the foundation upon which nationality rests the pride of the citizen and the glory of the republic she and other african american women used the language of domesticity and respectability to justify their work.
one of the most radical voices was ida b.
wells who as a young tennessee schoolteacher sued the chesapeake ohio railroad for denying her a seat in the ladies car.
in 1892 a white mob in memphis invaded a grocery store owned by three of wellss part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 friends angry that it competed with a nearby whiteowned store.
when the black store owners defended themselves wounding several of their attackers all three were lynched.
grieving their deaths wells left memphis and urged other african americans to join her in boycotting the citys white businesses.
as a journalist she launched a one woman campaign against lynching.
wellss investigations demolished the myth that lynchers were reacting to the crime of interracial rape she showed that the real cause was more often economic competition a labor dispute or a consensual relationship between a white woman and a black man.
settling in chicago wells became a noted and accomplished reformer but in an era of increasing racial injustice few whites supported her cause.
the largest african american womens organization arose within the national baptist church nbc which by 1906 represented 2 4 million black churchgoers.
founded in 1900 the womens convention of the nbc funded night schools health clinics kindergartens day care centers and prison outreach programs.
adella hunt logan born in alabama exemplified how such work could lead women to demand political rights.
educated at atlanta university logan became a womens club leader teacher and suffrage advocate.
if white american women with all their mutual and acquired advantage need the ballot she declared how much more do black americans male and female need the strong defense of a vote to help secure them their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness womens rights though it had split into two rival organizations during reconstruction the movement for womens suffrage reunited in 1890 in the national american woman suffrage association nawsa.
soon afterward suffragists built on earlier victories in the west winning full ballots for women in colorado 1893 idaho 1896 and utah 1896 reestablished as utah gained statehood.
afterward movement leaders were discouraged by a decade of state level defeats and congresss refusal to consider a constitutional amendment.
but suffrage again picked up momentum after 1911 map 18 2.
by 1913 most women living west of the mississippi river had the ballot.
in other localities women could vote in municipal elections school elections or liquor referenda.
the rising prominence of the womens suffrage movement had an ironic result it prompted some women and men to organize against it in groups such as the national association opposed to woman suffrage 1911.
antisuffragists argued that it was expensive to add so many voters to the rolls wives ballots would just double their husbands votes or worse cancel them out subjecting men to petticoat rule some antisuffragists also argued that voting would undermine womens special roles as disinterested reformers no longer above the fray they would be plunged into the cesspool of politics in short women were better citizens without the ballot such arguments helped delay passage of national womens suffrage until after world war i.
by the 1910s some women moved beyond suffrage to take a public stance for what they called feminism womens full political economic and social equality.
a famous site of sexual rebellion was new yorks greenwich village where radical intellectuals including many gays and lesbians created a vibrant community.
among other political activities women there founded the heterodoxy club 1912 open to any woman who pledged not to be orthodox in her opinions the club brought together intellectuals journalists and labor organizers.
almost all supported suffrage but they had a more ambitious view of what was needed for womens liberation.

feminists argued that women should not simply fulfill expectations of feminine self sacrifice they should work on their own behalf.

darwinism and its critics evolution the idea that species are not fixed but ever changing was not a simple idea on which all scientists agreed.
in his immensely influential 1859 book on the origin of species british naturalist charles darwin argued that all creatures struggle to survive.

many scientists rejected this theory of natural selection.
they followed a line of thinking laid out by french biologist jean baptiste lamarck who argued unlike darwin that individual animals or plants could acquire transmittable traits within a single lifetime.
a rhinoceros that fought fiercely in lamarcks view could build up a stronger horn its offspring would then be born with that trait.
darwin himself disapproved of the word evolution which does not appear in his book because it implied upward progress.
in his view natural selection was blind environments and species changed randomly.
others were less scrupulous about drawing sweeping conclusions from darwins work.

meanwhile though the most dubious applications of evolutionary ideas were codified into new reproductive laws based on eugenics a so called science of human breeding.
eugenicists argued that mentally deficient people should be prevented from reproducing.
they proposed sterilizing those deemed unfit especially residents of state asylums for the insane or mentally disabled.
in early twentieth century america almost half of the states enacted eugenics laws.
by the time eugenics subsided in the 1930s about twenty thousand people had been sterilized with california and virginia taking the lead.
women in puerto rico and other u s imperial possessions chapter 21 also suffered from eugenics policies.
advocates of eugenics had a broad impact.
because they associated mental unfitness with lower races including people of african asian and native american descent their arguments lent support to segregation and racial discrimination.

realism in the arts inspired by the quest for facts american authors rejected nineteenth century romanticism and what they saw as its unfortunate product sentimentality.
instead they took up literary realism.

theodore dreiser the financier theodore dreiser 1871 1945 was an american literary naturalist.
his novel the financier 1912 traces the rise of frank cowperwood a young man who during the last years of the nineteenth century becomes a powerful banker.
dreiser loosely based the character on the life of financier charles yerkes.
in this excerpt the narrator describes a transformative moment in cowperwoods youth.
cowperwood could not figure out how this thing he had come into this life was organized.
how did all these people get into the world.
what were they doing here.
who started things anyhow.
his mother told him the story of adam and eve but he didnt believe it.
one day he saw a squid and a lobster put in a tank and in connection with them was witness to a tragedy which stayed with him all his life and cleared things up considerably intellectually.
the lobster it appeared from the talk of the idle bystanders was offered no food as the squid was considered his rightful prey.
he lay at the bottom of the clear glass tank.
apparently seeing nothing you could not tell in which way his beady black buttons of eyes were looking but apparently they were never off the body of the squid.
the latter pale and waxy in texture looking very much like pork fat or jade moved about in torpedo fashion but his movements were apparently never out of the eyes of his enemy for by degrees small portions of his body began to disappear snapped off by the relentless claws of his pursuer.
one day only a portion of the squid remained.
in the corner of the tank sat the lobster poised apparently for action.
the boy stayed as long as he could the bitter struggle fascinating him.
now maybe or in an hour or a day the squid might die slain by the lobster and the lobster would eat him.
he looked again at the greenishcopperish engine of destruction in the corner and wondered when this would be.
he returned that night and lo.
the expected had happened.
there was a little crowd around the tank.
the lobster was in the corner.
before him was the squid cut in two and partially devoured.
the incident made a great impression on him.
it answered in a rough way that riddle which had been annoying him so much in the past how is life organized things lived on each other that was it.
lobsters lived on squids and other things.
what lived on lobsters.
men of course.
and what lived on men.
he asked himself.
was it other men.
wild animals lived on men.
and there were indians and cannibals.
and some men were killed by storms and accidents.
he wasnt so sure about men living on men but men did kill each other.
how about wars and street fights and mobs.
frank thought of this and of the life he was tossed into for he was already pondering on what he should be in this world and how he should get along.
from seeing his father count money he was sure that he would like banking and third street where his fathers office was seemed to him the cleanest most fascinating street in the world.

lyman abbott the evolution of christianity liberal congregationalist lyman abbott 1835 1922 was a noted advocate of the social gospel.
in the evolution of christianity 1892 abbott sought to reconcile the theory of evolution with the development of christianity.
the doctrine of evolution is not a doctrine of harmonious and uninterrupted progress.
the most common if not the most accurate formula of evolution is struggle for existence survival of the fittest the doctrine of evolution assumes that there are forces in the world seemingly hostile to progress that life is a perpetual battle and progress a perpetual victory.
the christian evolutionist will then expect to find christianity a warfare in church in society in the individual.
he will remember that the divine life is resident in undivine humanity.
he will not be surprised to find the waters of the stream disturbed for he will reflect that the divine purity has come into a turbid stream and that it can purify only by being itself indistinguishably combined with the impure.
when he is told that modern christianity is only a civilized paganism he will reply that is exactly what i supposed it to be and it will continue to be a civilized paganism until civilization has entirely eliminated paganism he will not be surprised to find pagan ceremonies in the ritual ignorance and superstition in the church and even errors and partialisms in the bible.
for he will remember that the divine life which is bringing all life into harmony with itself is a life resident in man.
he will remember that the bible does not claim to be the absolute word of god that on the contrary.
it claims to be the word of god.
as spoken to men and understood and interpreted by men which saw it in part as we still see it and reflected it as from a mirror in enigmas.
he will remember that the church is not yet the bride of christ but the plebeian daughter whom christ is educating to be his bride.
he will remember that christianity is not the absolutely divine but the divine in humanity the divine force resident in man and transforming man into the likeness of the divine.
christianity is the light struggling with the darkness life battling with death the spiritual overcoming the animal.
we judge christianity as the scientist judges the embryo as the gardener the bud as the teacher the pupil not by what it is but by what it promises to be.
all the definitions.
art is the antithesis of nature.
if we call one the natural method we must call the other the artificial method.
if natures process is rightly named natural selection mans process is artificial selection.
the survival of the fittest is simply the survival of the strong which implies and might as well be called the destruction of the weak.
and if nature progresses through the destruction of the weak man progresses through the protection of the weak.
man through his intelligence has labored successfully to resist the law of nature.
his success is conclusively demonstrated by a comparison of his condition with that of other species of animals.
no other cause can be assigned for his superiority.
how can the naturalistic philosophers shut their eyes to such obvious facts.
yet what is their attitude.
they condemn all attempts to protect the weak whether by private or public methods.
they claim that it deteriorates the race by enabling the unfit to survive and transmit their inferiority.
nothing is easier than to show that the unrestricted competition of nature does not secure the survival of the fittest possible but only of the actually fittest and in every attempt man makes to obtain something fitter than this actual fittest he succeeds as witness improved breeds of animals and grafts of fruits.
now the human method of protecting the weak deals in such way with men.
it not only increases the number but improves the quality.

part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 the armory show.
housed in an enormous national guard building in new york the exhibit introduced america to modern art.
some painters whose work appeared at the show were experimenting with cubism characterized by abstract geometric forms.
along with works by henri sloan and bellows organizers featured paintings by european rebels such as pablo picasso.
americas academic art world was shocked.
one critic called cubism the total destruction of the art of painting but as the exhibition went on to boston and chicago more than 250 000 people crowded to see it.
a striking feature of both realism and modernism as they developed was that many leading writers and artists were men.
in making their work strong and modern they also strove to assert their masculinity.
paralleling theodore roosevelts call for manly sports they denounced nineteenth century culture as hopelessly feminized.
stephen crane called for virility in literature.
jack london described himself as a mans man.
lustfully roving and conquering artist robert henri banned small brushes as too feminine in their own ways these writers and artists contributed to a broad movement to masculinize american culture.
religion diversity and innovation by the turn of the twentieth century emerging scientific and cultural paradigms posed a significant challenge to religious faith.
some americans argued that science and modernity would sweep away religion altogether.
contrary to such predictions american religious practice remained vibrant.
protestants developed creative new responses to the challenges of industrialization while millions of newcomers built institutions for worship and religious education.

what happened if they married outside the faith.
among catholic leaders bishop john ireland of minnesota argued that the principles of the church are in harmony with the interests of the republic but traditionalists led by archbishop michael a corrigan of new york disagreed.
they sought to insulate catholics from the pluralistic american environment.
indeed by 1920 almost two million children attended catholic elementary schools nationwide and catholic dioceses operated fifteen hundred high schools.
catholics as well as jews feared some of the same threats that distressed protestants industrial poverty and overwork kept working class people away from worship services while new consumer pleasures enticed many of them to go elsewhere.
faithful immigrant catholics were anxious to preserve familiar traditions from europe and they generally supported the churchs traditional wing.
but they also wanted religious life to express their ethnic identities.
italians poles and other new arrivals wanted separate parishes where they could celebrate their customs speak their languages and establish their own parochial schools.
when they became numerous enough they also demanded their own bishops.
the catholic hierarchy dominated by irishmen felt the integrity of the church was at stake.
the demand for ethnic parishes implied local control of church property.
with some strain the catholic church managed to satisfy the diverse needs of the immigrant faithful.
it met the demand for representation for example by appointing immigrant priests as auxiliary bishops within existing dioceses.

orthodox judaism survived the transition to america but like other immigrant religions it had to renounce its claims to some of the faithful.
protestant innovations one of the eras dramatic religious developments facilitated by global steamship and telegraph lines was the rise of protestant foreign missions.
from a modest start before the civil war this movement peaked around 1915 a year when american religious organizations sponsored more than nine thousand overseas missionaries supported at home by armies of volunteers including more than three million women.
a majority of protestant missionaries served in asia with smaller numbers posted to africa and the middle east.
most saw american style domesticity as a central part of evangelism and missionary societies sent married couples into the field.
many unmarried women also served overseas as missionary part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 teachers doctors and nurses though almost never as minishow did americas reliters.

some missionaries developed deep bonds of respect with the people they served.
others showed considerable condescension toward the poor heathen who in turn bristled at their assumptions america compared p 601.
one presbyterian who found syrians uninterested in his gospel message angrily denounced all muslims as corrupt and immoral by imposing their views of heathen races and attacking those who refused to convert christian missionaries sometimes ended up justifying western imperialism.
chauvinism abroad reflected attitudes that also surfaced at home.
starting in iowa in 1887 militant protestants created a powerful political organization the american protective association apa which for a brief period in the 1890s counted more than two million members.
this virulently nativist group expressed outrage at the existence of separate catholic schools while demanding at the same time that all public school teachers be protestants.
the apa called for a ban on catholic officeholders arguing that they were beholden to an ecclesiastic power that was not created and controlled by american citizens in its virulent anti catholicism and calls for restrictions on immigrants the apa prefigured the revived ku klux klan of the 1920s chapter 22.
the apa arose in part because protestants found their dominance challenged.
millions of americans especially in the industrial working class were now catholics or jews.
overall in 1916 protestants still constituted about 60 percent of americans affiliated with a religious body.
but they faced formidable rivals the number of practicing catholics in 1916 15 7 million was greater than the number of baptists methodists and presbyterians combined.
some protestants responded to the urban immigrant challenge by evangelizing among the unchurched.
they provided reading rooms day nurseries vocational classes and other services.
the goal of renewing religious faith through dedication to justice and social welfare became known as the social gospel.
its goals were epitomized by charles sheldons novel in his steps 1896 which told the story of a congregation identify causes who resolved to live by christs precepts for one year.
if church members were all doing as jesus would do sheldon asked could it remain true that armies of men would walk the streets for jobs and hundreds of them curse the church and thousands of them find in the saloon their best friend the salvation army which arrived from great britain in 1879 also spread a gospel message among the urban poor offering assistance that ranged from soup kitchens to shelters for former prostitutes.

while many americans admired the salvation army others particularly men of working class origins like brodie rejected its appeals.

english speaking protestants dominated the program but several asian representatives included kinzo hirai a lay buddhist from japan.
in his speech hirai reviewed japans experiences with the united states since commodore matthew c perry opened the country in 1853.
i do not understand why the christian lands have ignored the rights and advantages of forty million souls of japan for forty years.
one of the excuses offered by foreign nations is that our country is not yet civilized.
is it the principle of civilized law that the rights and profits of the so called uncivilized or the weaker should be sacrificed.
as i understand it the spirit and necessity of law is to protect the rights and profits of the weaker against the aggression of the stronger.
from the religious source the claim is made that the japanese are idolaters and heathen.
a dmitting for the sake of argument that we are idolaters and heathen is it christian morality to trample upon the rights and advantages of a non christian nation coloring all their natural happiness with the dark stain of injustice.
you send your missionaries to japan and they advise us to be moral and believe christianity.
we like to be moral we know that christianity is good and we are very thankful for this kindness.
but at the same time our people are rather perplexed.
for when we think that the treaty stipulated in the time of feudalism when we were yet in our youth is still clung to by the powerful nations of christendom when we find that every year a good many western vessels of seal fishery are smuggled into our seas when legal cases are always decided by the foreign authorities in japan unfavorably to us when some years ago a japanese was not allowed to enter a university on the pacific coast of america because of his being of a different race when a few months ago the school board in san francisco enacted a regulation that no japanese should be allowed to enter the public school there when all else failed down and outers knew they could count on the salvation army whose bell ringers became a familiar sight on city streets.
the group borrowed upto date marketing techniques and used the latest business slang in urging its christian soldiers to hustle the salvation army succeeded in part because it managed to bridge an emerging divide between social gospel reformers and protestants who were taking a last year the japanese were driven out in wholesale from one of the territories of the united states when our business men in san francisco were compelled by some union not to employ japanese assistants and laborers but the americans when there are some in the same city who speak on the platform against those of us who are already here when there are many who go in procession hoisting lanterns marked japs must go when the japanese in the hawaiian islands were deprived of their suffrage when we see some western people in japan who erect before the entrance to their houses a special post upon which is the notice no japanese is allowed to enter here just like a board upon which is written no dogs allowed when we are in such a situation notwithstanding the kindness of the western nations from one point of view who send their missionaries to us that we unintelligent heathens are embarrassed and hesitate to swallow the sweet and warm liquid of the heaven of christianity will not be unreasonable.

in 1860 the united states was rural less than 20 percent of americans lived in an urban area defined by census takers as a place with more than 2 500 inhabitants.
by 1910 more americans lived in cities 42 1 million than had lived in the entire nation on the eve of the civil war 31 4 million.

the distances are too great but new technologies allowed engineers and planners to reorganize urban geographies.
specialized districts began to include not only areas for finance manufacturing wholesaling and warehousing but also immigrant wards shopping districts and business oriented downtowns.
it was an exciting and bewildering world.
the shape of the industrial city before the civil war cities served the needs of commerce and finance not industry.
early manufacturing sprang up mostly in the countryside where mill owners could draw water power from streams find plentiful fuel and raw materials and recruit workers from farms and villages.
the nations largest cities were seaports urban merchants bought and sold goods for distribution into the interior or to global markets.
as industrialization developed though cities became sites for manufacturing as well as finance and trade.
steam engines played a central role in this change.
with them mill operators no longer had to depend on less reliable water power.
steam power also vastly increased the scale of industry.
a factory employing thousands of workers could instantly create a small city such as aliquippa pennsylvania which belonged body and soul to compare and the jones and laughlin steel contrast company.
older commercial cithow were americas ies also industrialized.
warehouse industrial cities different from the typical city before districts converted to small scale 1860.
manufacturing.
port cities that served as immigrant gateways offered abundant cheap labor an essential element in the industrial economy.
mass transit new technologies helped residents and visitors negotiate the industrial city.
steam driven cable cars appeared in the 1870s.
by 1887 engineer frank sprague designed an electric trolley system for richmond virginia.
electricity from a central generating plant was fed to trolleys through overhead power lines which each trolley touched with a pole mounted on its roof.
trolleys soon became the primary mode of transportation in most american cities.
congestion and frequent accidents however led to demands that trolley lines be moved off streets.
the el or elevated railroad which began operation as early as 1871 in new york city became a safer alternative.
other urban planners built down not up.
boston opened a short underground line in 1897 by 1904 a subway running the length of manhattan demonstrated the full potential of high speed underground trains.
even before the civil war the spread of railroads led to growth of outlying residential districts for the well to do.
the high cost of transportation effectively segregated these wealthy districts.
in the late nineteenth century the trend accelerated.
businessmen and professionals built homes on large beautifully landscaped lots in outlying towns such as riverside illinois and tuxedo park new york.
in such places affluent wives and children enjoyed refuge from the pollution and perceived dangers of the city.
los angeles entrepreneur henry huntington nephew of a wealthy southern pacific railroad magnate helped foster an emerging suburban ideal as he pitched the benefits of southern california sunshine.
huntington invested his family fortune in los angeles real estate and transportation.
along his trolley lines he subdivided property into lots and built rows of bungalows planting the tidy yards with lush trees and tropical fruits.
middle class buyers flocked to purchase huntingtons houses.
one exclaimed i have apparently found a paradise on earth anticipating twentieth century americans love for affordable single family homes near large cities huntington had begun to invent southern california sprawl.
skyscrapers by the 1880s invention of steel girders durable plate glass and passenger elevators began to revolutionize urban building methods.
architects invented the skyscraper a building supported by its steel skeleton.
its walls bore little weight serving instead as curtains to enclose the structure.
although expensive to build skyscrapers allowed downtown landowners to profit from small plots of land.
by investing in a skyscraper a landlord could collect rent for ten or even twenty floors of space.
large corporations commissioned these striking designs as symbols of business prowess.
the first skyscraper was william le baron jenneys ten story home insurance building 1885 in chicago.
though unremarkable in appearance it looked just like other downtown buildings jenneys steel girder construction inspired the creativity of american architects.
a chicago school sprang up dedicated to the design of buildings whose form expressed rather than masked their structure and function.
the presiding.
eighty three labor strikes between 1893 and 1898.
workers frustration centered on corrupt businesses with close ties to municipal officials.
the citys central labor union dissatisfied with democrats failure to address its concerns worked with middle class allies to build a thriving local branch of the peoples party chapter 20.
their demands for stronger government measures especially to curb corporate power culminated in citywide protests in 1899 during a strike against the hated streetcar company.
that year more than eight thousand workers participated in the citys annual labor day parade.
as they passed the mayors reviewing stand the bands fell silent and the unions furled their flags in a solemn protest against the mayors failure to support their cause.
to recapture support from working class clevelanders democrats made a dramatic change in 1901 nominating tom johnson for mayor.
johnson a reform minded businessman advocated municipal ownership of utilities and a tax system in which monopoly and privilege bore the main burdens.
johnson once thanked clevelands city appraisers for raising taxes on his own mansion.
johnsons comfortable victory transformed democrats into clevelands leading reform party.
while the new mayor did not fulfill the whole agenda of the central labor union and its allies he became an advocate of publicly owned utilities and one of the nations most famous and innovative reformers.
like johnson other mayors began to oust machines and launch ambitious programs of reform.
some modeled their municipal governments on those of glasgow scotland dsseldorf germany and other european cities on the cutting edge of innovation.
in boston mayor josiah quincy built public baths gyms swimming pools and playgrounds and provided free public concerts.
like other mayors he battled streetcar companies to bring down fares.
the scope of such projects varied.
in 1912 san francisco managed to open one small municipally owned streetcar line to compete with private companies.
milwaukee wisconsin on the other hand elected socialists who experimented with a sweeping array of measures including publicly subsidized medical care and housing.
republican hazen pingree place events mayor of detroit from 1890 to in context 1897 was a particularly noted how did reformers try reformer who worked for better to address the limits of streets and public transportation.
machine government.
during the depression pingree to what extent did they opened a network of vacant succeed.
city owned lots as community vegetable gardens.
though some people ridiculed pingrees potato patches the gardens helped feed thousands of detroits working people during the harsh depression years.
by 1901 a coalition of reformers who campaigned against new yorks tammany hall began to borrow ideas from pingree and other mayors.
in the wealthier wards of new york they promised to reduce crime and save taxpayer dollars.
in working class neighborhoods they vowed to provide affordable housing and municipal ownership of gas and electricity.
they defeated tammanys candidates and though they did not fulfill all of their promises they did provide more funding for overcrowded public schools.
reformers also experimented with new ways of organizing municipal government itself.
after a devastating hurricane in 1900 killed an estimated six thousand people in galveston texas and destroyed much of the city rebuilders adopted a commission system that became a nationwide model for efficient government.
leaders of the national municipal league advised cities to elect small councils and hire professional city managers who would direct operations like a corporate executive.
the league had difficulty persuading politicians to adopt its business oriented model it won its greatest victories in young small cities like phoenix arizona where the professional classes held political power.
other cities chose instead to enhance democratic participation.
as part of the oregon system which called for direct voting on key political questions portland voters participated in 129 municipal referendum votes between 1905 and 1913.
crucibles of progressive reform the challenges posed by urban life presented rich opportunities for experimentation and reform.
as happened in cleveland with tom johnsons election as mayor working class radicals and middle class reformers often mounted simultaneous challenges to political machines and these combined pressures led to dramatic change.
many reformers pointed to the plight of the urban poor especially children.
thus it is not surprising that progressivism an overlapping set of movements to combat the ills of industrialization chapter 20 had important roots in the city.
in the slums and tenements of the metropolis reformers invented new forms of civic participation that shaped the course of national politics.
chapter 19 civilizations inferno the rise and reform of industrial cities 1880 1917 fighting dirt and vice as early as the 1870s and 1880s news reporters drew attention to corrupt city governments the abuse of power by large corporations and threats to public health.
researcher helen campbell reported on tenement conditions in such exposs as prisoners of poverty 1887.
making innovative use of the invention of flash photography danish born journalist jacob riis included photographs of tenement interiors in his famous 1890 book how the other half lives.
riis had a profound influence on theodore roosevelt when the future president served as new york citys police commissioner.
roosevelt asked riis to lead him on tours around the tenements to help him better understand the problems of poverty disease and crime.
cleaning up urban environments one of the most urgent problems of the big city was disease.
in the late nineteenth century scientists in europe came to understand the role of germs and bacteria.
though a hint to boards of health in 1884 frank leslies illustrated newspaper urged municipal and state boards of health to work harder to protect urban children.

in 1866 when government officials instituted an effective quarantine and prevented large numbers of deaths city and state officials began to champion more public health projects.
with a major clean water initiative for its industrial cities in the late nineteenth century massachusetts demonstrated that it could largely eliminate typhoid fever.
after a horrific yellow fever epidemic in 1878 that killed perhaps 12 percent of its population memphis tennessee invested in state of the art sewage and drainage.
though the new system did not eliminate yellow fever it unexpectedly cut death rates from typhoid and cholera as well as infant deaths from water borne disease.
other cities followed suit.
by 1913 a nationwide survey of 198 cities found that they were spending an average of 1 28 per resident for sanitation and other health measures.
part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 the public health movement became one of the eras most visible and influential reforms.
in cities the impact of pollution was obvious.
children played on piles of garbage breathed toxic air and consumed poisoned food milk and water.
infant mortality rates were shocking in the early 1900s a baby born to a slavic woman in an american city had a 1 in 3 chance of dying in infancy.
outraged reformers mobilized to demand safe water and better garbage collection.
hygiene reformers taught hand washing and other techniques to fight the spread of tuberculosis.
americans worked in other ways to make industrial cities healthier and more beautiful to live in.
many municipalities adopted smoke abatement laws though they had limited success with enforcement until the post world war i adoption of natural gas which burned cleaner than coal.
recreation also received attention.
even before the civil war urban planners had established sanctuaries like new yorks central park where city people could stroll rest and contemplate natural landscapes.
by the turn of the twentieth century the city beautiful movement arose to advocate more and better urban park spaces.
though most parks still featured flower gardens and tree lined paths they also made room for skating rinks tennis courts baseball fields and swimming pools.
many included play areas with swing sets and seesaws promoted by the national playground association as a way to keep urban children safe and healthy.
closing red light districts distressed by the commercialization of sex reformers also launched a campaign against urban prostitution.
they warned in dramatic language of the threat of white slavery alleging in spite of considerable evidence to the contrary that large numbers of young white women were being kidnapped and forced into prostitution.
in the citys perils 1910 author leona prall groetzinger wrote the crusade against white slavery with the growth of large cities prostitution was a major cause of concern in the progressive era.
though the number of sex workers per capita in the united states was probably declining by 1900 the presence of red light districts was obvious thousands of young women as well as a smaller number of young men were exploited in the sex trade.
this image appeared in the great war on white slavery published by the american purity foundation in 1911.
it illustrates how immigrant women could be ensnared in the sex trade by alleged friends who offered them work.
reformers denunciations of white slavery show an overt racial bias while antiprostitution campaigners reported on the exploitation of asian and african american women the victimization of white women received the greatest emphasis and most effectively grabbed the attention of prosperous middle class americans.

chapter 19 civilizations inferno the rise and reform of industrial cities 1880 1917 that young women arrived from the countryside burning with high hope and filled with great resolve but the remorseless city takes them grinds them crushes them and at last deposits them in unknown graves practical investigators found a more complex reality women entered prostitution as a result of many factors including low wage jobs economic desperation abandonment and often sexual and domestic abuse.
women who bore a child out of wedlock were often shunned by their families and forced into prostitution.
some working women and even housewives undertook casual prostitution to make ends meet.
for decades female reformers had tried to rescue such women and retrain them for more respectable employments such as sewing.
results were at best mixed.
efforts to curb demand that is to focus on arresting and punishing men who employed prostitutes proved unpopular with voters.
nonetheless with public concern mounting over white slavery and the payoffs machine bosses exacted from brothel keepers many cities appointed vice commissions in the early twentieth century.
a wave of brothel closings crested between 1909 and 1912 as police shut down red light districts in cities nationwide.
meanwhile congress passed the mann act 1910 to prohibit the transportation of prostitutes across state lines.
hull house playground chicago 1906 when this postcard was made the city of chicagos small parks commission had just taken over management of the playground from settlement workers at hull house who had created it.
in a pattern repeated in many cities social settlements introduced new institutions and ideas such as safe places for urban children to play and inspired municipal authorities to assume responsibility and control.

the crusade against prostitution accomplished its main goal closing brothels but in the long term it worsened the conditions under which many prostitutes worked.
though conditions in some brothels were horrific sex workers who catered to wealthy clients made high wages and were relatively protected by madams many of whom set strict rules for clients and provided medical care for their workers.
in the wake of brothel closings such women lost control of the prostitution business.
instead almost all sex workers became streetwalkers or call girls more vulnerable to violence and often earning lower wages than they had before the antiprostitution crusade began.
the movement for social settlements some urban reformers focused their energies on building a creative new institution the social settlement.
these community welfare centers investigated the plight of the urban poor raised funds to address urgent needs and helped neighborhood residents advocate on their own behalf.
at the movements peak in the early twentieth century dozens of social settlements operated across the united states.
the most famous and one of the first was hull house on chicagos west side founded in 1889 by jane addams and her companion ellen gates starr.
their dilapidated mansion flanked part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 by saloons in a neighborhood of italian and eastern european immigrants served as a spark what were the origins plug for community improveof social settlements and ment and political reform.
how did they develop the idea for hull house came over time.
partly from toynbee hall a london settlement that addams and starr had visited while touring europe.
social settlements also drew inspiration from u s urban missions of the 1870s and 1880s.
some of these like the hampton institute had aided former slaves during reconstruction others like grace baptist in philadelphia arose in northern cities.
to meet the needs of urban residents missions offered employment counseling medical clinics day care centers and sometimes athletic facilities in cooperation with the young mens christian association ymca.
jane addams a daughter of the middle class first expected hull house to offer art classes and other cultural programs for the poor.
but addamss views quickly changed as she got to know her new neighbors and struggled to keep hull house open during the depression of the 1890s.
addamss views were also influenced by conversations with fellow hull house resident florence kelley who had studied in europe and returned a committed socialist.
dr alice hamilton who opened a pediatric clinic at hull house wrote that addams came to see her settlement as a bridge between the classes.
she always held that this bridge was as much of a help to the well to do as to the poor settlements offered idealistic young people a place where they could live as neighbors and give as much as they could of what they had addams and her colleagues believed that workingclass americans already knew what they needed.
what they lacked were resources to fulfill those needs as well as a political voice.
these settlement workers tried to provide.
hull house was typical in offering a bathhouse playground kindergarten and day care center.
some settlements opened libraries and gymnasiums others operated penny savings banks and cooperative kitchens where tired mothers could purchase a meal at the end of the day.
addams humbly closed the hull house kitchen when she found that her bland new england cooking had little appeal for italians her coworker dr alice hamilton soon investigated the health benefits of garlic.
at the henry street settlement in new york lillian wald organized visiting nurses to improve health in tenement wards.
addams meanwhile encouraged local women to inspect the neighborhood and bring back a list of dangers to health and safety.
together they prepared a complaint to city trace change over time council.
the women addams wrote had shown civic enterprise and moral conviction in carrying out the project themselves.
social settlements took many forms.
some attached themselves to preexisting missions and african american colleges.
others were founded by energetic college graduates.
catholics ran st elizabeth center in st louis jews the boston hebrew industrial school.
whatever their origins social settlements were in addamss words an experimental effort to aid in the solution of the social and industrial problems which are engendered by the modern condition of life in a great city settlements served as a springboard for many other projects.
settlement workers often fought city hall to get better schools and lobbied state legislatures for new workplace safety laws.
at hull house hamilton investigated lead poisoning and other health threats at local factories.
her colleague julia lathrop investigated the plight of teenagers caught in the criminal justice system.
she drafted a proposal for separate juvenile courts and persuaded chicago to adopt it.
pressuring the city to experiment with better rehabilitation strategies for juveniles convicted of crime lathrop created a model for juvenile court systems across the united states.
another example of settlements long term impact was the work of margaret sanger a nurse who moved to new york city in 1911 and volunteered with a lower east side settlement.
horrified by womens suffering from constant pregnancies and remembering her devout catholic mother who had died young after bearing eleven children sanger launched a crusade for what she called birth control.
her newspaper column what every girl should know soon garnered an indictment for violating obscenity laws.
the publicity that resulted helped sanger launch a national birth control movement.
settlements were thus a crucial proving ground for many progressive experiments as well as for the emerging profession of social work which transformed the provision of public welfare.
social workers rejected the older model of private christian charity dispensed by well meaning middle class volunteers to those in need.
instead social workers defined themselves as professional caseworkers who served as advocates of social justice.
like many reformers of the era they allied themselves with the new social sciences such as sociology and economics and undertook statistical surveys and other systematic methods for gathering facts.
social work proved to be an excellent opportunity for educated women who sought professional careers.
by 1920 women made up 62 percent of u s social workers.
chapter 19 civilizations inferno the rise and reform of industrial cities 1880 1917 cities and national politics despite reform efforts the problems wrought by industrialization continued to cause suffering in urban workplaces and environments.
in 1906 journalist upton sinclair exposed some of the most extreme forms of labor exploitation in his novel the jungle which described appalling conditions in chicago meatpacking plants.
what caught the nations attention was not sinclairs account of workers plight but his descriptions of rotten meat and filthy packing conditions.
with constituents up in arms congress passed the pure food and drug act 1906 and created the federal food and drug administration to oversee compliance with the new law.
the impact of the jungle showed how urban reformers could affect national politics.
even more significant was the work of josephine shaw lowell a civil war widow from a prominent family.
after years of struggling to aid poverty stricken individuals in new york city lowell concluded that charity was not enough.
in 1890 she helped found the new york consumers league to improve wages and working conditions for female store clerks.
the league encouraged shoppers to patronize only stores where wages and working conditions were known to be fair.
by 1899 the organization had become the national consumers league ncl.
at its head stood the outspoken and skillful florence kelley a hull house worker and former chief factory inspector of illinois.
kelley believed that only government oversight could protect exploited workers.
under her crusading leadership the ncl became one of the most powerful progressive organizations advocating worker protection laws.
many labor organizations also began in a single city and then grew to national stature.
one famous example was the womens trade union league founded in new york in 1903.
financed by wealthy women who supported its work the league trained working class leaders like rose schneiderman who organized unions among garment workers.
although often frustrated by the patronizing attitude of elite sponsors trade union women joined together in the broader struggle for womens rights.
when new york state held referenda on womens suffrage in 1915 and 1917 strong support came from jewish and italian precincts where unionized garment workers lived.
working class voters hoped in turn that enfranchised women would use their ballots to help industrial workers.
residents of industrial cities then sought allies in state and national politics.
the need for broader action was made clear in new york city by a shocking event the jungle this poster advertises a 1914 silent film based on sinclairs reform novel which tells the story of lithuanian immigrants struggling to get by amid the dangerous work starvation wages and abysmal living conditions of chicagos meatpacking district.
the film launched the film careers of actors george nash and gail kane who played the hero jurgis rutkus and his wife ona.
sinclair himself appeared at the start of the film explaining how he conducted research for his story.
socialist clubs often screened the film which ended like the book with a ringing call for workers to organize and create a cooperative commonwealth to take control of their conditions of life and work.

on march 25 1911.
on that saturday afternoon just before quitting time a fire broke out at the triangle shirtwaist company.
it quickly spread through the three floors the company occupied at the top of a tenstory building.
panicked workers discovered that despite fire safety laws employers had locked the emergency doors to prevent theft.
dozens of triangle workers mostly young immigrant women were trapped in the flames.
many leaped to their deaths the rest never reached the windows.
the average age of the 146 people who died was just nineteen american voices p 630.
american voices these dead bodies were the answer the triangle fire entire books have been written about the catastrophic 1911 fire at the triangle shirtwaist company in new york city.
the following excerpts are from documents by four contemporaries who in various ways played a part in the triangle tragedy and its aftermath.
note the different audiences that these speakers and authors were addressing and the lessons that each one draws from this horrific event.
william g shepherd reporter this was not an inevitable disaster which man could neither foresee nor control.
we might have foreseen it and some of us did we might have controlled it but we chose not to do so.
it is not a question of enforcement of law nor of inadequacy of law.
we have the wrong kind of laws and the wrong kind of enforcement.
before insisting upon inspection and enforcement let us lift up the industrial standards so as to make conditions worth inspecting and if inspected certain to afford security to workers.
and when we go before the legislature of the state and demand increased appropriations in order to ensure the possibility of a sufficient number of inspectors we will not forever be put off with the answer we have no money.
the lesson of the hour is that while property is good life is better that while possessions are valuable life is priceless.
the meaning of the hour is that the life of the lowliest worker in the nation is sacred and inviolable and if that sacred human right be violated we shall stand adjudged and condemned before the tribunal of god and history.
william g shepherds eyewitness account appeared in newspapers across the country.
working for the united press shepherd phoned the story to his editor as he watched the unfolding tragedy.
i was walking through washington square when a puff of smoke issuing from a factory building caught my eye.
i reached the building before the alarm was turned in.
i saw every feature of the tragedy visible from outside the building.
i learned a new sound a more horrible sound than description can picture.
it was the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk.
i looked up saw that there were scores of girls at the windows.
the flames from the floor below were beating in their faces.
somehow i knew that they too must come down and something within me something i didnt know was there steeled me.
i even watched one girl falling.
waving her arms trying to keep her body upright until the very instant she struck the sidewalk she was trying to balance herself.
then came the thud then a silent unmoving pile of clothing and twisted broken limbs.
on the sidewalk lay heaps of broken bodies.
a policeman later went about with tags which he fastened with wire to the wrists of the dead girls numbering each with a lead pencil and i saw him fasten tag no.
54 to the wrist of a girl who wore an engagement ring.
the floods of water from the firemens hose that ran into the gutter were actually stained red with blood.
i looked upon the heap of dead bodies and i remembered these girls were the shirtwaist makers.
i remembered their great strike of last year in which these same girls had demanded more sanitary conditions and more safety precautions in the shops.
these dead bodies were the answer.
stephen s wise rabbi a week after the fire on april 2 1911 a memorial meeting was held at the metropolitan opera house.
one of the speakers rabbi stephen s wise a prominent figure in new york reform circles made the following remarks.
rose schneiderman trade unionist rose schneiderman also spoke at the metropolitan opera house meeting.
at age thirteen she had gone to work in a garment factory like triangle shirtwaists and under the tutelage of the womens trade union league had become a labor organizer.
the strike she mentions in her speech was popularly known as the uprising of the 30 000 a nearly spontaneous walkout in 1909 that launched the union movement in the womens garment trades.
i would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if i came here to talk good fellowship.
we have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting.
the old inquisition had its rack and its thumbscrews and its instruments of torture with iron teeth.
we know what these things are today the iron teeth are our necessities the thumbscrews are the high powered and swift machinery close to which we must work and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.
this is not the first time girls have been burned alive in the city.
every year thousands of us are maimed.
the life of men and women is so cheap and property is so sacred.
there are so many of us for one job it matters little if 146 of us are burned to death.
we have tried you citizens we are trying you now and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift.
but every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.
and beats us back when we rise into the conditions that make life unbearable.
i cant talk fellowship to you who are gathered here.
too much blood has been spilled.
i know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves.
the only way they can save themselves is by a strong working class movement.
max d steuer lawyer after finding physical evidence of the locked door that had blocked escape from the fire new yorks district attorney brought manslaughter charges against the triangle proprietors max blanck and isaac harris who hired in their defense the best highest priced trial attorney in town max d steuer.
in this talk delivered some time later to a rapt audience of lawyers steuer described how he undermined the testimony of the key witness for the prosecution by suggesting that she had been coached to recite her answer.
the trial judge instructed the jury that they could only convict blanck and harris if it was certain they had known the emergency exits were locked as steuer notes the jury voted to acquit.
there are many times many times when a witness has given evidence very hurtful to your cause and you say no questions and dismiss him or her in the hope that the jury will dismiss the evidence too.
but can you do that when the jury is weeping and the little girl witness is weeping too.
there is one rule that commands what not to do.
do not attack the witness.
suavely politely genially toy with the story.
in the instant case about half an hour was consumed by the examiner steuer.
very little progress was made but the tears had stopped.
and then the witness was asked now rose in your own words and in your own way will you tell the jury everything you did everything you said and everything you saw from the moment you first saw flames the question was put in precisely the same words that the district attorney had put it and little rose started her answer with exactly the same word that she had started it to the district attorney.
and the only change in her recital was that rose left out one word.
and then rose was asked didnt you leave out a word that you put in when you answered it before.
so rose started to repeat to herself the answer laughter and as she came to the missing word she said oh yes and supplied it and thereupon the examiner went on to an entirely different subject.
w hen again he asked her to repeat her story.
rose started with the same word and finished with the same word her recital being identical with her first reply to the same question.
the jurymen were not weeping.
rose had not hurt the case and the defendants were acquitted there was not a word of reflection at any time during that trial upon poor little rose.

questions for analysis 1.
the hardest task of the historian is to conjure up the reality of the past to say this is what it was really like thats where eyewitness evidence like the reporter shepherds comes in.
what is there in his account that you could only obtain from an eyewitness.
both rabbi wise and rose schneiderman were incensed at the triangle carnage yet their speeches are quite different.
in what ways.
what conclusions do you draw about the different motivations and arguments that led to reform.
max steuer and rose schneiderman came from remarkably similar backgrounds.
they were roughly the same age grew up in poverty on the lower east side and started out as child workers in the garment factories.
the differences in their adult lives speak to the varieties of immigrant experience in america.
does anything in their statements help to account for their differing life paths.
what might have happened if rose schneiderman rather than little rose had faced max steuer on the witness stand.
part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 shocked by this horrific event new yorkers responded with an outpouring of anger and grief that how did urban reform crossed ethnic class and religious movements impact state boundaries.
many remembered and national politics.
that only a year earlier shirtwaist workers had walked off the job to protest abysmal safety and working conditions and that the owners of triangle among other employers had broken the strike.
facing demands for action new york state appointed a factory commission that developed a remarkable program of labor reform fifty six laws dealing with such issues as fire hazards unsafe machines and wages and working hours for women and children.
the chairman and vice chairman of the commission were robert f wagner and alfred e smith both tammany hall politicians then serving in the state legislature.
they established the commission participated fully in its work and marshaled party regulars to pass the proposals into law all with the approval of tammany.
the labor code that resulted was the most advanced in the united states.
tammanys response to the triangle fire showed that it was acknowledging its need for help.
the social and economic problems of the industrial city had outgrown the power of party machines only stronger state and national laws could bar industrial firetraps alleviate sweatshop conditions and improve slums.
politicians like wagner and smith saw that tammany had to change or die.
the fire had unforeseen further consequences.
frances perkins a columbia university student who witnessed the horror of triangle workers leaping from the windows to their deaths decided she would devote her efforts to the cause of labor.
already active in womens reform organizations perkins went to chicago where she volunteered for several years at hull house.
in 1929 she became new york states first commissioner of labor four years later during the new deal chapter 23 franklin d roosevelt appointed her as u s secretary of labor the first woman to hold a cabinet post.
the political aftermath of the triangle fire demonstrated how challenges posed by industrial cities pushed politics in new directions transforming urban government and initiating broader movements for reform.
the nations political and cultural standards had long been set by native born protestant middleclass americans.
by 1900 the people who thronged to the great cities helped build america into a global industrial power and in the process created an electorate explain consequences that was far more ethnically racially and religiously diverse.
in the era of industrialization some rural and native born commentators warned that immigrants were inferior breeds who would mongrelize american culture.
but urban political leaders defended cultural pluralism expressing appreciation even admiration for immigrants including catholics and jews who sought a better life in the united states.
at the same time urban reformers worked to improve conditions of life for the diverse residents of american cities.
cities then and the innovative solutions proposed by urban leaders held a central place in americas consciousness as the nation took on the task of progressive reform.
summary after 1865 american cities grew at an unprecedented rate and urban populations swelled with workers from rural areas and abroad.
to move burgeoning populations around the city cities pioneered innovative forms of mass transit.
skyscrapers came to mark urban skylines and new electric lighting systems encouraged nightlife.
neighborhoods divided along class and ethnic lines with the working class inhabiting crowded shoddily built tenements.
immigrants developed new ethnic cultures in their neighborhoods while racism followed african american migrants from the country to the city.
at the same time new forms of popular urban culture bridged class and ethnic lines challenging traditional sexual norms and gender roles.
popular journalism rose to prominence and helped build rising sympathy for reform.
industrial cities confronted a variety of new political challenges.
despite notable achievements established machine governments could not address urban problems through traditional means.
forward looking politicians took the initiative and implemented a range of political labor and social reforms.
urban reformers also launched campaigns to address public health morals and welfare.
they did so through a variety of innovative institutions most notably social settlements which brought affluent americans into working class neighborhoods to learn cooperate and advocate on behalf of their neighbors.
such projects began to increase americans acceptance of urban diversity and their confidence in governments ability to solve the problems of industrialization.

thematic part 6 chapter review making connections recognize the larger developments and continuities within and across chapters by answering these questions.
across time and place in chapter 17 we explored the activities of agrarian reformers and labor unions who protested the impact of industrialization on their lives.
in chapters 18 and 19 we considered the work of middle class and urban reformers who sought to address some of the same conditions.
chronologically their work overlapped note for example that jane addams founded hull house in 1889 just as the farmers alliance was reaching a peak of activism and workers had organized the knights of labor and american federation of labor.
imagine a conversation among the following individuals a rural man or woman active in the farmers alliance a skilled workman who joined the american federation of labor an urban antiprostitution reformer and a middle class volunteer who worked in a settlement house.
how would each have described the problems caused by industrializa more to explore tion.

problems of the day this movement among the masses she said was based on the words of jesus whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them between the 1880s and the 1910s thousands of reformers like lease confronted the problems of industrialization.
lease herself stumped not only for the peoples party which sought more government regulation of the economy but also for the knights of labor and womans christian temperance union wctu as well as for womens suffrage and public health.
between the end of reconstruction and the start of world war i political reformers focused on four main goals cleaning up politics limiting the power of big business reducing poverty and promoting social justice.
historians call this period of agitation and innovation the progressive era.
in the 1880s and 1890s labor unions and farm groups took the lead in critiquing the industrial order and demanding change.
but over time more and more middle class and elite americans took up the call earning the name progressives.
on the whole they proposed more limited measures than farmerlabor advocates did but since they had more political clout they often had greater success in winning new laws.
thus both radicals and progressives played important roles in advancing reform.
no single group defined the progressive era.
on the contrary reformers took opposite views on such questions as immigration racial justice womens rights and imperialism.
leaders such as theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson initially hostile to the sweeping critiques of capitalism offered by radicals gradually adopted bolder ideas.
dramatic political changes influenced the direction of reform.
close party competition in the 1880s gave way to republican control between 1894 and 1910 followed by a period of democratic leadership during wilsons presidency 1913 1919.
progressives gave the era its name not because they acted as a unified force but because they engaged in diverse energetic movements to improve america.

at the same time groups such as the wctu chapter 18 and urban settlements chapter 19 laid the groundwork for progressivism especially among women.
though they had different goals these groups confronted similar dilemmas upon entering politics.
should they work through existing political parties.
create new ones.
or generate pressure from the outside.
reformers tried all these strategies.
electoral politics after reconstruction the end of reconstruction ushered in a period of fierce partisan conflict.
republicans and democrats traded control of the senate three times between 1880 and 1894 and the house majority five times.
causes of this tight competition included northerners disillusionment with republican policies and the resurgence of southern identify causes democrats who regained a strong what factors led to close party competition in the base in congress.
dizzying popu1880s.
lation growth also changed the size and shape of the house of representatives.
in 1875 it counted 243 seats two decades later that had risen to 356.
between 1889 and 1896 entry of seven new western states montana north and south dakota washington idaho wyoming and utah contributed to political instability.
heated competition and the legacies of the civil war drew americans into politics.
union veterans donned their uniforms to march in republican parades while ex confederate democrats did the same in the south.
when politicians appealed to war loyalties critics ridiculed them for waving the bloody shirt whipping up old animosities that ought to be set aside.
for those who had fought or lost beloved family members in the conflict however as well as those struggling over african american rights in the south war issues remained crucial.
many voters also had strong views on economic policies especially republicans high protective tariffs.
proportionately more voters turned out in presidential elections from 1876 to 1892 than at any other time in american history.
the presidents of this era had limited room to maneuver in a period of narrow victories when the opposing party often held one or both houses of congress.
republicans rutherford b hayes and benjamin harrison both won the electoral college but lost the popular vote.
in 1884 democrat grover cleveland won only 29 214 more votes than his opponent james blaine while almost half a million voters rejected both major candidates map 20 1.
with key states decided by razorthin margins both republicans and democrats engaged in vote buying and other forms of fraud.
the fierce struggle for advantage also prompted innovations in political campaigning thinking like a historian p 640.
some historians have characterized this period as a gilded age when politics was corrupt and stagnant and elections centered on meaningless hoopla the term gilded age borrowed from the title of an 1873 novel cowritten by mark twain suggested that america had achieved a glittery outer coating of prosperity and lofty rhetoric but underneath suffered from moral decay.
economically the term gilded age seems apt as we have seen in previous chapters a handful of men made spectacular fortunes and their gilded triumphs belied a rising crisis of poverty pollution and erosion of workers rights.
but political leaders were not blind to these problems and the political scene was hardly idle or indifferent.
rather americans bitterly disagreed about what to do.
nonetheless as early as the 1880s congress passed important new federal measures to clean up corruption and rein in corporate power.
that decade deserves to be considered an early stage in the emerging progressive era.
new initiatives one of the first reforms resulted from tragedy.
on july 2 1881 only four months after entering the white house james garfield was shot at a train station in washington d c assassination he had told a friend can no more be guarded against than death by lightning and it is best not to worry about either after lingering for several agonizing months garfield died.
most historians now believe the assassin charles guiteau suffered from mental illness.
but reformers then blamed the spoils system arguing that guiteau had murdered garfield out of disappointment in the scramble for patronage the granting of government jobs to party loyalists.
in the wake of garfields death congress passed the pendleton act 1883 establishing a nonpartisan civil service commission to fill federal jobs by examination.
initially civil service applied to only 10 percent of such jobs but the act laid the groundwork for a sweeping transformation of public employment.
by the 1910s congress extended the act to cover most federal positions cities and states across the country enacted similar laws.
chapter 20 whose government.

first note the equal division of the popular vote between republicans and democrats.
second note the persistent pattern of electoral votes as states overwhelmingly went to the same party in all three elections.
here we can identify who determined the outcomes swing states such as new york and indiana whose vote shifted every four years and always in favor of the winning candidate.
civil service laws had their downside.
in the race for government jobs they tilted the balance toward middle class applicants who could perform well on tests.
firemen now must know equations complained a critic and be up on euclid too but the laws put talented professionals in office and discouraged politicians from appointing unqualified party hacks.
the civil service also brought stability and consistency to government since officials did not lose their jobs every time their party lost power.
in the long run civil service laws markedly reduced corruption.
leaders of the civil service movement included many classical liberals chapter 15 former republicans who became disillusioned with reconstruction and advocated smaller more professionalized government.
many had opposed president ulysses s grants reelection in 1872.
in 1884 they again left the republican party because they could not stomach its scandal tainted candidate james blaine.
liberal republicans ridiculed by their enemies as mugwumps fence sitters who had their mugs on one side and their wumps on the other helped elect democrat grover cleveland.
they believed he shared their vision of smaller government.
as president cleveland showed that he largely did share their views.
he vetoed for example thousands of bills providing pensions for individual union veterans.
but in 1887 responding to pressure from farmer labor advocates in the democratic party who demanded action to limit corporate power he signed the interstate commerce act chapter 17.
at the same time municipal and state level initiatives were showing how expanded government could help solve industrial problems.
in the 1870s and early 1880s many states created bureaus of labor statistics to investigate workplace safety and unemployment.
some appointed commissions to oversee key industries from banking to dairy farming.
by later standards such commissions were underfunded but even when they lacked legal thinking like a historian making modern presidents between 1880 and 1917 the stature and powers of the u s president grew in relation to those of congress.
presidential campaign techniques also changed.
the sources below shed light on candidates increasing public visibility and new uses of campaign funds.

account of benjamin harrisons front porch campaign in indianapolis new york tribune october 12 1888.
for much of the nineteenth century presidential candidates left campaigning to their allies.
a man who promoted himself risked appearing vain and greedy for office.
by the 1880s republicans began to run front porch campaigns party leaders arranged for delegations to visit the candidate at home.
this morning general harrisons home was surrounded by visitors who had arrived in the city in the night and on the early morning trains.
there were many relichunters among the early visitors and they swarmed about the house taking without protest from any one whatever they were pleased to seize.
there is no longer a fence about the house to be converted into relics and so the visitors are taking the trees now.
the shrubbery has almost disappeared.
the informal reception began as soon as the general got up from breakfast and continued until afternoon.
the first delegation was composed of representatives of the cincinnati republican clubs.
a delegation from belleville ill which.
had patiently waited for more than four hours were next invited to enter the house and they were accorded the usual handshaking reception.
the parade early in the afternoon was the principal feature of the days demonstration.
two hundred or more clubs participated and they came from all parts of the state representing various classes and interests.
there were mounted men and men on foot women in wagons and women in uniform marching brass bands.
on the balcony beside general harrison stood his wife with several of her lady friends.

short of funds democratic candidate william jennings bryan undertook exhausting nationwide speaking tours.
there is no question which of the great parties represents the house of have and which the house of want.
democrat s are cramped for want of funds.
on the other hand there is practically no end of money at the disposal of the mckinley committees.
as for the banks the great railroad companies and insurance companies who even in ordinary times find it to their interest to help financially one and frequently both sides.
their purse strings are unloosed more freely than ever before but only in one direction.
the danger to a republican form of government of a money interest in politics is so clear that it needs not to be dwelt upon.
the steady tendency of american legislation national and state has not merely been to create great special interests but in the very effort to control them for the benefit of the public to concern them directly in politics.

having watched bryans electrifying tours theodore roosevelt became the first winning candidate to adopt the practice.
in 1904 after a summer front porch campaign he undertook a thirty day speaking tour of the west.
to cover as much ground as possible roosevelt often spoke from the last car of his train.

it is estimated that it costs 25 000 000 to elect a president of the united states.
the annual allowance which the british parliament makes to queen victoria is 1 925 000.
indicat ing that it is much cheaper to maintain a queen permanently than it is to elect a president.
more than half of the money spent by both national and state committees goes for campaign orators.
during the next three months it is estimated that the republican national committee will have 3000 spellbinders traveling out of the chicago headquarters and 2500 who will report to the new york office.
the next largest item on the campaign bill is that for printing.
each of the national committees will spend at least 500 000 in this way.
before the campaign is over it is estimated that both the republican and democratic committees will send out 100 000 000 separate documents.
one more important branch of the work is the two house to house canvasses of the voters.
hundreds of men are employed in each state and the work of tabulating and classifying the results is by no means small.

they pursued an ambitious agenda they believed would meet the needs of a modernizing nation.
in 1890 congress extended pensions to all union veterans and yielded to growing public outrage over trusts by passing a law to regulate interstate corporations.

despite cries of outrage from southern democrats who warned that it meant negro supremacy the house passed the measure.
but it met resistance in the senate.
northern classical liberals who wanted the best men to govern through professional expertise thought it provided too much democracy while machine bosses feared the threat of federal interference in the cities.
unexpectedly many western republicans also opposed the bill and with the entry of ten new states since 1863 the west had gained enormous clout.
senator william stewart of nevada who had southern family ties claimed that federal oversight of elections would bring monarchy or revolution he and his allies killed the bill by a single vote.
the defeat was a devastating blow to those seeking to defend black voting rights.

in 1890 the kansas alliance joined with the knights of labor to create a peoples party.
they then stunned the nation by capturing four fifths of the lower house of the kansas legislature and most of the states congressional seats.
the victory electrified labor and agrarian radicals nationwide.

prohibitionist and womens suffrage leaders attended populist conventions hoping their issues would be taken up but they were disappointed.
the legacies of the civil war also hampered the party.
southern democrats warned that populists were really radical republicans in disguise while northeastern republicans claimed the southern pops were ex confederates plotting another round of treason.
amid these heated debates the political system suddenly confronted an economic crisis.
the political earthquakes of the 1890s in 1893 a severe economic depression hit the united states.
though it was a global shock and the agriculture sector had already lagged for years republicans blamed grover cleveland who had just reentered the white house.
on every hand can be seen evidences of democratic times declared one republican.
the deserted farm the silent factory apparently receptive to such appeals voters outside the south abandoned the democrats in 1894 and 1896.
republicans promising prosperity gained control of the white house and both chambers of congress for the next fifteen years.
this development created both opportunities and challenges for progressive reformers.
a different pattern emerged in the south democrats deployed fraud violence and race based appeals for white solidarity to defeat the populist revolt.
depression and reaction when cleveland took the oath of office in march 1893 hard times were prompting european investors to pull money out of the united states farm foreclosures and railroad bankruptcies signaled economic trouble.

politics populists and progressives 1880 1917 in the summer of 1894 a further protest jolted affluent americans.
radical businessman jacob coxey of ohio proposed that the u s government hire the unemployed to fix americas roads.
in 1894 he organized hundreds of jobless men nicknamed coxeys army to march peacefully to washington and appeal for the program.
though public employment of the kind coxey proposed would become central to the new deal in the 1930s many americans in the 1890s viewed coxey as a dangerous extremist.
public alarm grew when more protesters inspired by coxey started out from los angeles seattle and other cities.
as they marched east these men found warm support and offers of aid in populist leaning cities and towns.
in other places police and property owners drove marchers away at gunpoint.
coxey was stunned by what happened when he reached capitol hill he was jailed for trespassing on the grass.
some of his men arrested for vagrancy ended up in maryland chain gangs.
the rest went home hungry.
as this response suggested president grover clevelands administration was increasingly out of step with rural and working class demands.
any president would have been hard pressed to cope with the depression but cleveland made a particularly bad hash of it.
he steadfastly resisted pressure to loosen the money supply by expanding federal coinage to include silver as well as gold.
advocates of this free silver policy free because under this plan the u s mint would not charge a fee for minting silver coins believed the policy would encourage borrowing and stimulate industry.
but cleveland clung to the gold standard however dire things became he believed the money supply must remain tied to the nations reserves of gold.
even collapsing prices and a hemorrhage of gold to europe did not budge the president.
with gold reserves dwindling in 1895 he made a secret arrangement with a syndicate of bankers led by john pierpont morgan to arrange gold purchases to replenish the treasury.
morgan helped maintain americas gold supply preserving the gold standard and turned a tidy profit by earning interest on the bonds he provided.

the election began sixteen years of republican national dominance.
democrats and the solid south explain consequences how did different groups of americans react to the economic depression of the 1890s and what happened as a result.
in the south the only region where democrats gained strength in the 1890s the peoples party lost ground for distinctive reasons.
after the end of reconstruction african americans in most states had continued to vote in significant numbers.
as long as democrats competed for and sometimes bought black votes the possibility remained that other parties could win them away.
populists proposed new measures to help farmers and wage earners an appealing message for poverty stricken people of both races.
some white populists went out of their way to build cross racial ties.
the accident of color can make no difference in the interest of farmers croppers and laborers argued georgia populist tom watson.
you are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings such appeals threatened the foundations of southern politics.
democrats struck back calling themselves the white mans party and denouncing populists for advocating negro rule from georgia to texas many poor white farmers tenants and wage earners ignored such appeals and continued to support the populists in large numbers.
democrats found they could put down the populist threat only through fraud and violence.
afterward pitchfork ben tillman of south carolina openly bragged that he and other southern whites had done our level best to block every last black vote.

those damned populists would have ruined the country having suppressed the political revolt democrats looked for new ways to enforce white supremacy.
in 1890 a constitutional convention in mississippi had adopted a key innovation an understanding clause that required would be voters to interpret parts of the state constitution with local democratic officials deciding who met the standard.
after the populist uprising such measures spread to other southern states.

all these developments depended on a political solid south in which democrats exercised almost complete control.
the impact of the 1890s counterrevolution was dramatically illustrated in grimes county a cottongrowing area in east texas where blacks comprised more than half of the population.
african american voters kept the local republican party going after reconstruction and regularly sent black representatives to the texas legislature.
many local white populists dismissed democrats taunts of negro supremacy and a populist republican coalition swept the county elections in 1896 and 1898.
but after their 1898 defeat democrats in grimes county organized a secret brotherhood and forcibly prevented blacks from voting in town elections shooting two in cold blood.
the populist sheriff proved unable to bring the murderers to justice.

gunmen then laid siege to the populist sheriff s office killed his brother and a friend and drove the wounded sheriff out of the county.
the white mans party ruled grimes county for the next fifty years.
by 1908 every southern state had adopted such measures.
the impact of disenfranchisehow did politics change ment can hardly be overstated in the south between the map 20 3.
across the south 1880s and the 1910s.
voter turnout plunged from above 70 percent to 34 percent or even lower.
not only blacks but also many poor whites ceased to vote.
since democrats faced virtually no opposition action shifted to the white primaries where democratic candidates competed for nominations.
some former populists joined the democrats in openly advocating white supremacy.
the racial climate hardened.
segregation laws proliferated.
lynchings of african americans increasingly occurred in broad daylight with crowds of thousands gathered to watch.
the convict lease system which had begun to take hold during reconstruction also expanded.
blacks received harsh sentences for crimes such as vagrancy often when they were traveling to find work or if they could not produce a current employment contract.
by the 1890s alabama depended on convict leasing for 6 percent of its total revenue.
prisoners were overwhelmingly black a 1908 report showed that almost 90 percent of georgias leased convicts were black out of a white population of 1 4 million only 322 were in prison.
calling attention to the torture and deaths of prisoners as well as the damaging economic effect of their unpaid labor reformers labor unions and populists protested the situation strenuously.
but reforms simply replaced convict leasing with the chain gang in which prisoners worked directly for the trace change over time nebraska iowa illinois ind.

politics populists and progressives 1880 1917 lynching in texas lynchings peaked between 1890 and 1910 while most common in the south they occurred in almost every state from oregon to minnesota to new york.

what do we learn from the fact that this group of white men some of whom may have been responsible for the lynching felt comfortable having their photographs recorded with the body.

president a young nebraska congressman free silver advocate william jennings bryan who passionately defended farmers and attacked the gold standard.
burn down your cities and leave our farms bryan declared in his famous convention speech and your cities will spring up again as if by magic but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country he ended with a vow you shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold cheering delegates endorsed a platform calling for free silver and a federal income tax on the wealthy that would replace tariffs as a source of revenue.
democrats long defenders of limited government were moving toward a more activist stance.
populists reeling from recent defeats endorsed bryan in the campaign but their power was waning.
populist leader tom watson who wanted a separate program more radical than bryans observed that democrats in 1896 had cast the populists as jonah while they play whale the peoples party never recovered from its electoral losses in 1894 and from democrats ruthless opposition in the south.
by 1900 rural voters pursued reform elsewhere particularly through the new bryan wing of the democratic party.
meanwhile horrified republicans denounced bryans platform as anarchistic.
their nominee the ohio congressman and tariff advocate william mckinley chose a brilliant campaign manager ohio coal and shipping magnate marcus hanna who orchestrated an unprecedented corporate fund raising campaign.
under his guidance the party backed away from moral issues such as prohibition of liquor and reached out to new immigrants.

leaders of both major parties determined to prevent future populiststyle threats made it more difficult for new parties to get candidates listed on the ballot.
in the wake of such laws voter turnout declined and the electorate narrowed in ways that favored the native born and wealthy.
antidemocratic restrictions on voting helped paradoxically to foster certain democratic innovations.

students should compare the 1892 map with map 20 1 p 639 and note especially clevelands breakthrough in the normally republican states of the upper midwest.
in 1896 the pendulum swung in the opposite direction with mckinleys consolidation of republican control over the northeast and midwest far overbalancing the democratic advances in the thinly populated western states.
the 1896 election marked the beginning of sixteen years of republican dominance in national politics.
having excluded or reduced the number of poor african american and immigrant voters elite and middle class reformers felt more comfortable increasing the power of the voters who remained.

politics populists and progressives 1880 1917 parties increasingly turned to the direct primary asking voters in most states registered party members rather than party leaders to choose nominees.
another measure that enhanced democratic participation was the seventeenth amendment to the constitution 1913 requiring that u s senators be chosen not by state legislatures but by popular vote.
though many states had adopted the practice well before 1913 southern states had resisted since democrats feared that it might give more power to their political opponents.
after disenfranchisement such objections faded and the measure passed.
thus disenfranchisement enhanced the power of remaining voters in multiple complicated ways.
at the same time the supreme court proved hostile to many proposed reforms.
in 1895 for example it struck down a recently adopted federal income tax on the wealthy.
the court ruled that unless this tax was calculated on a per state basis rather than by the wealth of individuals it could not be levied without a constitutional amendment.
it took progressives nineteen years to achieve that goal.

in the knight sugar case united states v e c knight co the court ruled that the federal government had limited power over interstate commerce when a company did most of its manufacturing in a single state.

interpreted in this way the fourteenth amendment was a major obstacle to regulation of private business.
farmer and labor advocates along with urban progressives who called for more government regulation disagreed with such rulings.
they believed judges not state legislators were overreaching.
while courts treated employers and employees as equal parties critics dismissed this as a legal fiction.
modern industry has reduced freedom of contract to a paper privilege declared one labor advocate a mere figure of rhetoric supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes jr dissenting in the lochner decision agreed.
if the choice was between working and starving he observed how could bakers choose their hours of work.
holmess view known as legal realism eventually won judicial favor but only after years of progressive and labor activism.
reform reshaped 1901 1912 william mckinley a powerful presence in the white house was no reformer.
his victory was widely understood as a triumph for business and especially for industrial titans who had contributed heavily to his campaign.
but the depression of the 1890s by subjecting millions to severe hardship had dramatically illustrated the problems of industrialization.
at the same time the success of mckinleys campaign managers who spent more than 3 5 million versus bryans 300 000 raised unsettling questions about corporate power.
once the crisis of the 1890s passed many middle class americans proved ready to embrace progressive ideas.
the rise of such ideas was aided by historical chance when a shocking assassination put a reformer in the white house.
theodore roosevelt as president on september 14 1901 only six months after william mckinley won his second face off against democrat william jennings bryan the president was shot as he attended the pan american exposition in buffalo new york.
he died eight days later.
the murderer leon czolgosz was influenced by anarchists who had carried out recent assassinations in europe.
though czolgosz was american born many feared that mckinleys violent death was another warning of the threat posed by radical immigrants.
as the nation mourned its third murdered president in less than four decades vice president theodore roosevelt was sworn into office.
