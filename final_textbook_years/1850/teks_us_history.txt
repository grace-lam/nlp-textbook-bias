building support for imperialism guiding question why did the united states assert itself as a world power.
following the civil war most americans showed little interest ir expanding their nations territory outside the united states.
instead they focused on reconstructing the south settling the w and building up industry.
in the 1880s economic and military competition from europe and a growing feeling of cultural superiority convinced many americans that the united states should become a world power.
a desire for new markets many european nations were expanding overseas a development called the new imperialism.
imperialism is the economic and political domination of a strong nation over weaker ones.
europe nations expanded their power overseas for many reasons.
they needed to import raw materials for manufacturing.
high tariffs ii industrialized nations intended to protect domestic industries reduced trade forcing companies to look for new markets overse investment opportunities had also slowed in western europe so europeans began looking overseas for places to invest their capita to protect their investments european nations began exertin control over territories making some into colonies and others ini protectorates.
in a protectorate the imperial power protected lo rulers against rebellions and invasion.
in return rulers usually ha to accept europeans advice on how to govern their countries.
as the united states industrialized many americans noticed the expansion of european power overseas and took an interest i the new imperialism.
many concluded that the nation needed ne overseas markets to keep its economy strong.
180 a feeling of superiority certain key ideas encouraged americans to support the nations expansion overseas.
historian john fiske argued that english speaking nations had superior character ideas and systems of government.
many americans linked his ideas known as anglo saxonism with the idea of manifest destiny.
these americans believed the nation was destined to expand overseas to spread its civilization to others.
imperialism the actions used by one nation to exercise political or economic control over a smaller or weaker nation primarysource the work which the english race began when it colonized north america is destined to go on until every land that is not already the seat of an old civilization shall become english in its language in its religion in political habits and traditions and to a predominant extent in the blood of its people w john fiske from manifest destiny harper s magazine 1885 protectorate a country that is technically independent but is actually under the control of another country expansion the act or process of increasing or enlarging the extent number volume or scope another influential advocate of anglo saxonism was josiah strong a popular american minister in the late 1800s.

his ideas influenced many americans.
the anglo saxon strong declared is divinely commissioned to be in a peculiar sense his brothers keeper by linking missionary work to anglo saxonism strong convinced many americans to support an expansion of american power overseas.
building a modern navy as these ideas gained support the united states became more assertive in foreign affairs.
in 1888 the country risked war to prevent germany from taking control of samoa.
the crisis ended peacefully.
however it led some americans to believe that the united states would be shut out of foreign markets if it did not build up its navy and acquire bases overseas.

u s naval officer captain alfred t mahan helped build public supp for a navy when he published the influence of sen power upon history ii 1890.
mahan pointed out that many prosperous nations had a large fleet merchant ships to trade with the world and a large navy to defend the nations trade.
mahans book helped build public support for a big navy.
two powerful senators henry cabot lodge and albert j beveridge use their position to convince congress to support a new navy.
in the execu branch benjamin tracy secretary of the navy under president harrison john d long secretary of the navy under president mckinley and his assistant secretary theodore roosevelt all supported mahans ideas.
by the 1890s several different ideas had come together.
business leaders wanted new markets overseas.
anglo saxonism had convinced many americans they were destined to expand into the world while growing european imperialism threatened u s security.
these ideas along with mahans book convinced congress to authorize a large modern navy.

from the earliest days of the republic americans had expanded their nation by moving westward.
when looking overseas for new markets th united states naturally looked to the pacific.
perry opens japan in 1852 president millard fillmore ordered commodore matthew c pei to negotiate a trade treaty with japan.
in 1853 warships under perrys command entered edo bay now tokyo bay.
japans rulers fearing the influence of western ideas had limited contact with the west.
after seei t e warships however the japanese realized they were not powerful enough to resist modern weapons.
in 1854 japan signed the treaty of kanagawa giving the united states trading rights at two japanese ports.
annexing samoa and hawaii as trade with asia grew the united states needed ports for its ships to refuel and resupply as they crossed the pacific.
pago pago in the samoan islands had one of the finest harbors in the south pacific.
in 1878 the united states negotiated permission to open a base there.
an 1899 agreement divided samoa between germany and the united states.
more important was hawaii.
americans found that sugarcane grew well in hawaii and planters established sugar plantations there.
in 1875 the united states signed a treaty exempting hawaiian sugar from tariffs.
this action was taken to aid hawaii during an economic recession and prevent hawaii from turning to britain or france for help.
when the treaty was up for renewal the united states insisted hawaii grant it exclusive rights to a naval base at pearl harbor.
in 1887 wealthy sugar planters led by sanford dole forced the hawaiian king to accept a new constitution that limited the kings authority.
the planters eventually wanted to make hawaii part of the united states.
tensions grew worse when congress passed a new tariff in 1890.
the tariff gave subsidies to american sugar producers making hawaiian sugar more expensive.
the planters knew that if hawaii joined the united states they too would get the subsidies.
the next year queen liliuokalani ascended the hawaiian throne and tried to restore the monarchys authority.
in response the planters overthrew the queen.
backed by the american ambassador and u s marines the planters forced liliuokalani to give up power and asked dole to serve as president of the new hawaiian republic.
dole then requested the united states annex hawaii.
president cleveland who opposed imperialism tried instead to restore the queen to power but hawaiis new leaders refused.
instead they decided to wait until a new president took office.
in 1898 under president mckinley the united states annexed hawaii and mckinley chose dole to be hawaiis first governor.

the coming of war academic vocabulary intervene volunteer guiding question why was the united states willing to go to war with spain overfuba.
cuba was one of spains oldest colonies in the americas.
its sugarcane plantations generated considerable wealth for spain an produced nearly one third of the worlds sugar in the mid 1800s.
until spain abolished slavery in 1886 about one third ot the cut population was enslaved and forced to work for wealthy landowners on the plantations.
in 1868 cuban rebels declared independence and launched a guerrilla war against spanish authorities.
lacking internal suppo the rebellion collapsed a decade later.
many cuban rebels then fl to the united states including their leader jose marti.
by the early 1890s the united states and cuba had become closely linked economically.
cuba exported much ot its sugar to the united states and americans had invested approximately 50 million in cubas sugar plantations mines and railroads.
th economic ties created a crisis in 1894 when the united states imposed a new tariff on sugar that devastated cubas economy.
with cuba in financial distress the cuban rebels launched a nev rebellion in february 1895.
marti died during the fighting buttl rebels seized control of eastern cuba declared independence an formally established the republic of cuba in september 1895.
america supports cuba when the uprising began president cleveland declared the united st neutral.
however stories of spanish atrocities in two major newspape the new york journal and the new york world swayed many america in the rebels favor.
the news reports in which writers exaggerated ot 184 made up stories to attract readers became known as yellow journalism.
although some stories were invented cubans indeed suffered horribly.
the spanish sent nearly 200 000 troops to put down the rebellion.
the rebels destroyed a considerable amount of property some belonging to americans hoping to provoke american intervention in the war.
to prevent villagers from helping the rebels the spanish herded hundreds of thousands of rural men women and children into reconcentration camps where tens of thousands died of starvation and disease.
calls for war in 1897 william mckinley became president of the united states.
in september 1897 he asked spain whether the united states could help negotiate an end to the conflict so that the united states would not have to intervene in the war.
spain removed weyler from office and offered the cubans autonomy but only if cuba remained part of the spanish empire.
the rebels refused to negotiate.
spains concessions enraged many spanish loyalists in cuba.
in january 1898 the loyalists rioted in havana.
mckinley sent the battleship uss maine to havana to protect americans living there.
then on february 15 1898 the maine exploded in havana harbor.
to this day no one is sure why the maine exploded.
many americans believed the spanish did it.
remember the mainel became the rallying cry for war against spain.
mckinley faced tremendous pressure to go to war.
within the republican party jingoism aggressive nationalism was very strong.
on april 11 1898 mckinley asked congress to authorize the use of force.
on april 19 congress proclaimed cuba independent demanded that spain withdraw from the island and authorized the president to use armed force.

the navy blockaded cuba and commodore george dewey commander of the american naval squadron based in hong kong was ordered to attack the spanish fleet based in the philippines then a spanish colony.
american naval planners wanted to prevent the spanish fleet from sailing east to attack the united states.

they quickly destroyed the spanish fleet.
deweys quick victory surprised mckinley.
hastily the army assembled 20 000 troop to sail from san francisco to the philippines.
on the way the americans also seized the island of guam another spanish possession.
while waiting for the american troops to arrive dewey contacted emilio aguinaldo a filipino revolutionary leader who had staged an unsuccessful uprising against the spanish in 1896.
now while aguinaldo and his rebels took control of most of the islands american troops seized the philippine capital of manila.
american forces in cuba the spanish in cuba were not prepared for war.
their soldiers were weak and sick and their warships were old with untrained crews.
if the united states could defeat the spanish fleet spain would not be able to supply its troops in cuba.
eventually spain would have to surrender.
the u s army was not prepared for war either.
the army had recruited volunteers but lacked proper resources to train and equip them.
one volunteer cavalry unit was a rough mix of cowboys miners and law officers known as the rough riders theodore roosevelt was second in command.
between june 22 and 24 some 17 000 u s troops had landed east of santiago cuba.
the spanish fleet well protected by powerful shore based guns occupied santiago harbor.
americans wanted to capture those guns to drive the spanish fleet out of the harbor and into battle with the american fleet waiting nearby.
on july 1 american troops attacked spanish positions near santiago and the san juan heights.
the rough riders and the all african american 9th and 10th cavalry regiments attacked and held kettle hill then assists in the capture of san juan hill.

an american empire guiding question how did the united states develop an overseas empire.
as american and spanish leaders met to discuss the terms for a peace treaty americans debated what to do about their newly acquired lands.
cuba would receive its independence as promised and spain had agreed to the u s annexation of guam and puerto rico.
the big question was what to do with the philippines.
the united states faced a difficult choice remain true to its republican ideals or become an imperial power that ruled a foreign country without the consent of its people.
the issue sparked an intense political debat the debate over annexation many people emphasized the economic and military benefits of taking the philippines.
it would provide another pacific naval base a stopover on the way to china and a large market for american goods.
others believed america had a duty to help less civilized peoples.
surely this spanish has not been a grab for the empire commented one minister but a heroic effort to free the oppressed and to teach millions of ignorant debased human beings thus freed how to live not all americans supported annexation.
an anti imperialist movement quickly formed and many prominent americans voiced their opposition to the united states becoming an imperial power.
andrew carnegie argued that the cost of empire far outweighed the economic benefits.
samuel gompers the head of the american federation of labor worried that competition from cheap filipino labor would drive down american wages.
the social worker and reformer jane addams and the writer samuel clemens both believed imperialism violated american principles and traditions.
many people argued that it was inconsistent for a democratic republic founded on the idea of self government to rule over others who would have no say in who was appointed to rule them.
despite the objections of anti imperialists president mckinley ultimately decided to annex the islands.
he later explained his reasoning as follows primary source when i next realized that the philippines had dropped into our laps i confess i did not know what to do with them.
i sought counsel from all sides democrats as well as republicans but got little help and one night late it came to me this way i don t know how it was but it came 1 that we could not give them back to spain that would be cowardly and dishonorable 2 that we could not turn them over to france and germany our commercial rivals in the orient that would be bad business and discreditable 3 that we could not leave them to themselves they were unfit for self government and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there worse than spain s was and 4 that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all and to educate the filipinos and uplift and civilize and christianize them and by god s grace do the very best we could by them as our fellow men for whom christ also died 99 james rusling interview with president william mckinley the christian advocate january 1903 mckinleys thinking blended the ideas of many military and business leaders with the ideas of anglo saxonism.
on december 10 1898 the united states and spain signed the treaty of paris under which cuba became independent.
also the united states acquired puerto rico and guam and paid spain 20 million for the philippines.
after an intense debate the senate approved the treaty in february 1899.
a turning point the year 1898 was a major turning point in american history.
in just a few short months the united states had defeated a european nation demonstrated that its navy was one of the most powerful in the world and had acquired its own empire.
the reputation of the united states for being a nation that did not involve itself in global affairs was shattered.
increasingly the worlds other great powers had to take american perspectives and policies into account and in the years ahead the united states would find itself drawn into issues and events thousands of miles from its own shores.
after 1898 the united states had become a world power.
the platt amendment although the united states had promised to grant cuba its independence conditions were attached to the new cuban constitution.
the platt amendment submitted by senator orville platt specified the following 1 cuba could not make any treaty with another nation that would weaken its independence 2 cuba had to allow the united states to buy or lease becoming a world power 187 naval stations in cuba 3 cubas debts had to be kept low to prevent foreign countries from landing troops to enforce payment and 4 the united states would have the right to intervene to protect cuban independence and keep order.
the platt amendment which effectively made cuba an american protectorate remained in effect until its repeal in 1934.
governing puerto rico in 1900 congress passed the foraker act establishing a civil government for puerto rico.
the law provided for an elected legislature and a governor and executive council that were appointed by the u s president.
congress gradually allowed puerto ricans greater self government.
in 1917 it granted puerto ricans u s citizenship.
thirty years later puerto ricans were allowed to elect their own governor.
a debate eventually began over whether puerto rico should become a state become independent or continue as a self governing commonwealth of the united states.
the debate over puerto ricos status continues today.
rebellion in the philippines in 1899 emilio aguinaldo ordered his troops to attack the american soldiers who had been sent there.
aguinaldo wanted the philippines to be independent.
to fight the filipino guerrillas the u s military established reconcentration camps to separate filipino guerrillas from civilians.
thousands died from disease and starvation.
many u s soldiers died fighting the guerrillas.
while american troops fought the guerrillas the first u s civilian governor of the islands william howard taft tried to win over the the annexation debate americans were divided over whether the united states should give the filipinos their independence or become an imperial power by annexing the philippines.
the opposition tells us that we ought not to govern a people without their self government.
we govern the indians without their consent we govern our territories without their consent we govern our children without their consent would not the people of the philippines prefer the just humane civilizing government of this republic to the savage bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we only to those who are capable of a harbor and coaling station in the philippines would answer every trade and military necessity and such a concession could have been secured at any time without difficulty.

1 identifying central ideas based on the cartoon what do you think mckinley is trying to accomplish.
35 the economic effects of the war in 1897 the year before the war americans had invested roughly 700 million in business ventures overseas.
by 1904 they had invested over 2 5 billion.
the war made cuba safe again and american investment in sugar plantations and mining surged.
hawaii was now an american territory and companies there no longer had to pay tariffs to ship goods to the united states making it attractive to investors.
puerto rico was in a similar position.
american investors revived the islands sugar industry and expanded its tobacco industry.
american investments in the philippines helped build railroads open mines and expanded its sugar industry as well.
all of these developments came at a cost.
together the war with spain and the battle against the filipino guerrillas had cost some 400 million.
over 5 400 men had died in the war with spain and another 4 200 died fighting filipino guerrillas.
the war also led to a steady increase in naval spending from 64 million in 1899 to 135 million in 1912.
the spending helped stimulate parts of the economy related to shipbuilding though it also diverted money from investment in other areas.
but as a new world power with far flung bases and territories the united states now needed a larger naval force to project its power and safeguard its interests.

operating from those bases the united states navy by then the worlds third largest navy could exert american power anywhere in east asia.
the nations main interest in asia however was not conquest but commerce.
between 1895 and 1900 u s exports to china quadrupled.
although china bought only about two percent of u s exports the vast chinese markets excited american business leaders especially those in the textile oil and steel industries.
the open door policy in 1894 war erupted between china and japan over korea which was client state dependent upon china.
western observers were astonishe when japan easily defeated chinas massive military.
the war showed that japan had mastered western technology and that china was weaker than anyone had thought.
in the peace treaty china recognize koreas independence and gave japan territory in manchuria.
the russians were concerned about japans rising power.
they did not want japan to acquire the territory in manchuria because it bordered russia.
backed by france and germany russia forced japan to return the manchurian territory it had acquired.
then in 1898 russia demanded china lease the territory to russia instead.
leasing meant the territory would still belong to china even though a foreign government would maintain overall control.
soon germany france and britain also demanded leaseholds in chin 190 each leasehold became the center of a countrys sphere of influence an area where a foreign nation controlled economic development.
u s politicians and businessmen worried that china would be divided among the europeans and americans would not be allowed to do business there.
president mckinley and secretary of state john hay both supported what they called an open door policy which would allow all countries to trade with china.
in 1899 hay asked countries with leaseholds in china not to discriminate against other nations wanting to do business in their sphere of influence.
each nation responded by saying it accepted the open door policy but would not follow it unless all the others agreed.
once hay had received assurances from all of the nations with leaseholds he declared that the united states expected the other powers to uphold the policy.
the policy helped the u s economy by ensuring that american companies could continue to trade with china.
the boxer rebellion while foreign countries debated access to chinas market secret chinese societies organized to fight foreign control and influence.
one group the society of righteous and harmonious fists was known to westerners as the boxers.
in 1900 this group decided to destroy both the foreign devils and their chinese christian converts whom they believed were corrupting chinese society.
in what came to be called the boxer rebellion the boxers and some chinese troops attacked foreign embassies in peking now beijing and tientsin now tianjin killing more than 200 foreigners including many christian missionaries.
after the german ambassador to china was killed eight nations germany austria hungary britain france italy japan russia and the united states intervened.
a large multinational force rescued the foreigners and ended the rebellion.
during the crisis secretary of state john hay worked with british diplomats to persuade the other powers not to partition china.

it stated that the united states would intervene in latin american affairs when necessary to maintain economic and political stability in the western hemisphere.
the goal of the roosevelt corollary was to prevent european powers from using the debt problems of latin america to justify intervening in the region.
the united states first applied the roosevelt corollary in the dominican republic which had fallen behind on its debt payments to european nations.
in 1905 the united states began collecting customs tariffs in the dominican republic using the marine corps as its agent.
dollar diplomacy roosevelts successor william howard taft placed less emphasis on military force and more on economic development.
taft believed that supporting latin american industry would increase trade and profits for american businesses and lift latin america countries out of poverty and social disorder.

woodrow wilson s diplomacy in mexico guiding question how did moral diplomacy shape president wilson s foreign policy.
it would be the irony of fate said woodrow wilson just before he was inaugurated in 1913 if my administration had to deal chiefly with foreign affairs wilsons experience and interest were in domestic policy.
he was a university professor before entering politics and was a committed progressive.
foreign affairs however absorbed much of wilsons time and energy as president.
wilson opposed imperialism.
he believed that democracy was essential to a nations stability and prosperity.
he wanted the united states to promote democracy to create a world free of revolution and war.
he hoped the united states would lead by moral example but his first international crisis thwarted that hope.
the mexican revolution for more than 30 years porfirio diaz ruled mexico as a dictator.
during diazs reign mexico became much more industrialized but foreign investors owned the new railroads and factories that were built.
most mexican citizens remained poor and landless.
in 1910 discontent erupted into revolution.
francisco madero a reformer who seemed to support democracy constitutional government and land reform led the revolution.
madero however was an unskilled administrator.
worried about maderos plans for land reform landowners plotted against him.
in 1913 general victoriano huerta seized power and madero was murdered.
94 huertas brutality repulsed wilson who refused to recognize the new government.
instead wilson announced a new policy.
to win u s recognition groups that seized power in latin america would have to establish a government based on law not on force.
wilson believed that without u s support huerta soon would be overthrown.
meanwhile wilson ordered the navy to intercept arms shipments to huertas government.
he also permitted americans to arm huertas opponents.
wilson sends troops into mexico in april 1914 american sailors visiting the mexican city of tampico were arrested after entering a restricted area.
after their release their commander demanded an apology.
the mexicans refused.
wilson saw the refusal as an opportunity to overthrow huerta.
soon after congress authorized the use of force wilson learned that a german ship was unloading weapons at the mexican port of veracruz.
wilson immediately ordered american warships to veracruz where u s marines forcibly seized the city.
although the president expected the mexican people to welcome his action anti american riots broke out.
wilson then accepted international mediation to settle the dispute.
venustiano carranza whose forces had acquired arms from the united states became mexicos president.
mexican forces opposed to carranza conducted raids into the united states hoping to force wilson to intervene.
in march 1916 pancho villa vee yuh and a group of guerrillas armed fighters who carry out surprise attacks burned the town of columbus new mexico killing 17 americans.
wilson responded by sending about 5 800 troops under general john j pershing across the border to find and capture villa.
the expedition ended without success.
wilsons mexican policy damaged u s foreign relations.
the british ridiculed the presidents attempt to shoot the mexicans into self government.
latin americans regarded his moral imperialism as no improvement over theodore roosevelts big stick diplomacy.
in fact wilson followed roosevelts example in the caribbean.
in 1914 he negotiated exclusive rights for naval bases and a canal with nicaragua.
in 1915 he sent marines into haiti to put down a rebellion.
in 1916 he sent troops into the dominican republic to set up a government he hoped would be more stable and democratic than the current regime.

primary source the protection of naval stations must depend either upon direct military force as do gibraltar and malta or upon a surrounding friendly population such as the american colonists once were to england and it may be presumed the australian colonists now are.
such friendly surroundings and backing joined to a reasonable military provision are the best of defenses colonies attached to the mother country afford therefore the surest means of supporting abroad the sea power of a country.
in peace the influence ofthe government should be felt in promoting by all means a warmth of attachment and a unity of interest which will make the welfare of one the welfare of all and the quarrel of one the quarrel of all and in war or rather for war by inducing such measures of organization and defense as shall be felt by all to be a fair distribution of a burden of which each reaps the benefit alfred thayer mahan from the influence of sea power upon history 1890 primary source m many imperialists admit that our trade with the philippines themselves will not nearly be worth its cost but they say that we must have the philippines as a foothold a sort of power station for the expansion of our trade on the asiatic continent especially in china.
