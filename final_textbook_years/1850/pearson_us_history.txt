the last ice age occurred between 100 000 and 10 000 years ago.
during that time thick sheets of ice called glaciers covered almost one third of the earth.
in north america glaciers stretched across canada and reached as far south as present day kentucky.
populations spread glaciers locked up water from the oceans causing sea levels to fall and uncovering land that had been under water.
in the far north a land bridge joined siberia in northeastern asia to present day alaska in north america.
most scientists think that bands of hunters reached north america across this land bridge.
these hunters tracked herds of grazing animals.
other scientists disagree.
they think that the first americans crossed the icy arctic waters by boat reaching north america by sea.
once these early hunters reached the americas they had to keep moving in search of food.
slowly over thousands of years they spread across north america central america and south america.
the physical environments where they settled varied widely.
native americans adapted to the physical environments of mountain plateaus dry deserts fertile plains lush woodlands and thick rain forests.

6 k adapting to and modifying environments about 12 000 years ago the last ice age ended.
as temperatures rose the glaciers melted.
the land bridge between siberia and alaska disappeared under the bering strait.
about the same time some kinds of large animals died out.
this forced hunting bands to adapt to new conditions.
smaller animals wild berries nuts grains and fish became a larger part of their diets.
about 5 000 years ago people in the americas learned to grow crops such as corn beans and squash.
farming modified the environment and brought great changes to those who practiced it.
farmers no longer had to keep moving to find food.
instead they stayed in one place and began to build permanent settlements or small communities.
as farming methods improved people produced more food which in turn allowed the population to grow.
b check understanding how did farming affect communities in central america.
olmecs develop a civilization farming was a key advance for early societies in the americas.
in time some farming communities in the americas grew enough surplus or extra food to support large populations and the first cities emerged.
cities marked the rise of the first civilization in the americas.
a civilization is a society or a people sharing a language territory and economy that has certain basic features.
among these are cities an organized government different social classes a complex religion and some method of record keeping.
the earliest known civilization in the americas was that of the olmecs in present day mexico.
the olmecs lived in the lowlands along the gulf of mexico about 3 500 years ago.
scientists have found huge stone heads carved by the olmecs.
some were ten feet tall and weighed several tons.
smaller figures showed creatures that were part human and part animal.

b identify supporting details what features of olmec society indicate that it was a civilization.
mayan civilization the olmecs influenced many later peoples including the mayas.
the early mayas lived in the rain forests of what are today honduras belize guatemala and southern mexico.
about 3 000 years ago they began clearing the rain forest and draining swamps to create farmland.
maya farmers were able to produce great harvests of corn enough to feed large cities.
as the maya population grew city states began to spring up from central america to southern mexico.
a city state is a political unit that controls a city and its surrounding land.
trade flowed along a network of roads that linked inland city states and the coast.
city states often waged war on one another for land riches and access to trade routes.
mayan social classes nobles also held great power in maya society.
the most powerful nobles were the kings who also served as high priests.
other nobles farming techniques developed in ancient times by the mayas are still used by maya farmers today.
also became priests.
priests held great power in maya society.
only priests the mayas believed could perform the ceremonies needed to bring good harvests or victory in battle.
priests conducted these ceremonies in temples built on top of huge stone pyramids.
still other nobles served as warriors and government officials.
near the bottom of maya society were laborers and farmers who grew corn squash and many other crops.
below them were slaves most of whom were prisoners of war or criminals.
achievements in mathematics and astronomy maya priests had to know exactly when to honor the many gods who were thought to control the natural world.
every day priests anxiously studied the sun moon and stars.
they learned much about the movement of these bodies.
based on their observations priests made great advances in astronomy and mathematics.
they learned to predict eclipses and created a relatively accurate 365 day calendar.
they also developed a system of numbers that included the new concept of zero.
then around a d 900 the mayas abandoned their cities.
historians are not sure why.
perhaps they did so because of warfare a drought or both.
the ram forests swallowed up the great maya temples and palaces.
although maya cities decayed the maya people survived.
today more than 2 million people in guatemala and southern mexico speak mayan languages.
recall what sort of scientific advances did the mayas achieve.
aztec civilization long after the maya cities were abandoned a new civilization arose to the northwest.
its builders were the aztecs.
the early aztecs were nomads people who moved from place to place in search of food.
in the 1300s the aztecs settled around lake texcoco tays koh koh in central mexico.
from there they built a powerful empire.
tenochtitlan on an island in the middle of the lake the aztecs built their capital tenochtitlan tay nawch tee tlahn.
they constructed a system of causeways or raised roads made of packed earth.
the causeways linked the capital to the mainland.
the aztecs learned to farm the shallow swamps of lake texcoco.
in some places they dug canals using the mud they removed to fill in parts of the lake.
in other places they attached floating reed mats to the lake aztecs adapted to life on an island in the middle of a lake with limited land area by using chinampas for agriculture even planting trees to better anchor them to the lake bed.
bottom with long stakes.
then they piled mud onto the mats to create farmland.
aztec farmers harvested several crops a year on these chinampas or floating gardens.
with riches from trade and conquest tenochtitlan prospered.
its markets offered a wide variety of goods.
there are daily more than 60 000 people bartering and selling wrote a spanish visitor in the 1500s.
religion like the mayas aztec priests studied the heavens and developed complex calendars.
such calendars gave them the ability to tell their people when to plant or harvest.
priests also performed rituals designed to please the many aztec gods.
the aztecs paid special attention to the god who controlled the sun.
they believed that each day the sun battled its way across the heavens.
they compared the suns battle to their own calling themselves warriors of the sun they believed that the sun required human sacrifices in order to rise each day.
the aztecs therefore killed thousands of captives each year to please this powerful god.
a powerful empire by 1500 the aztecs ruled a huge empire.
it stretched from the gulf of mexico to the pacific ocean and included millions of people.
the aztecs took great pride in their empire and their capital.
who could conquer tenochtitlan boasted an aztec poet.
who could shake the foundation of heaven the aztec world was far from peaceful however.
heavy taxes and the sacrifice of huge numbers of prisoners of war sparked many revolts.
the aztecs waged war in part to capture more prisoners for sacrifice.
across the empire people conquered by the aztecs were eager for revenge.
enemies of the aztecs would eventually help outsiders from distant lands destroy the aztec empire.
h identify supporting details what is a physical characteristic of lake texcoco and how did the aztecs adapt to it to live there.
inca civilization far to the south of the aztecs the incas built one of the largest empires in the americas.
by 1500 their empire stretched for almost 2 500 miles along the west coast of south america.
an impressive capital the center of the inca empire was the magnificent capital at cuzco koos koh located high in the andes in present day peru.
cuzco was a holy city to the incas.
all nobles in the empire tried to visit it at least once in their lifetimes.
the city had massive palaces and temples made of stone and he early americas and european exploration 8 1 1 the early americas 1 1 the early americas decorated with gold ornaments.
at the center was the palace of the emperor who was known as the sapa inca.
the emperor was regarded as a god who was descended from the sun god.
from cuzco the emperor ruled more than 10 million people.
they lived in varied environments from coastal deserts to lowland jungles to the highlands of the andes.
the incas conquered this land by waging war against surrounding peoples.
the inca empire was very well organized.
the emperor was kept well informed about affairs in all parts of his empire.
he sent high officials out to act as governors of his domain.
the governors made sure that every person worked at least part of the time on projects for the state such as road building mining farming and pottery making.
inca achievements to unite their empire the incas maintained a system of roads that covered more than 10 000 miles.
builders carved roads in rock cliffs and stretched rope bridges across deep gorges.
teams of runners quickly spread royal orders across the empire using these roads.
the runners carried with them a device known as a quipu kee poo.
this was a cord or string with knots that stood for numbers or categories.
the numbers the inca city of machu picchu shows how inca engineering shaped and was shaped by the terrain of the andes mountains.
notice the terraces or stepped strips of land that allowed farming on steep slopes.
might be bags of grain numbers of soldiers or other amounts of goods that the government ordered from different parts of the empire.
the quipu was also used by government officials to keep records.
the incas were skilled engineers.
they built massive stone temples and forts.
with only human labor ropes and wooden rollers they moved stones weighing up to 200 tons.
they used all their engineering skills to farm the dry rugged mountain lands.
they became experts at creating terraces or wide flat steps of land out of the steep mountainsides.
sturdy stone walls kept rain from washing away the soil.
id identify central ideas why was a system of roads so important to the incas.
early north american societies scholars have found evidence of complex societies among some groups of people farther north.
traders and migrating people carried foods goods arts and beliefs from central america and mexico to early peoples of north america.
these peoples developed many distinct cultures in north america.
a culture is the entire way of life of a people.
it includes their homes clothing economy arts and government.
land and people of the southwest at least 3 000 years ago knowledge of farming spread northward.
gradually farming societies emerged in what is today the american southwest.
much of this region is desert with little rainfall and hot summers.
the early societies in this region included the hohokams hoh hoh kahmz and anasazis ah nuh sah zeez.
the hohokams lived in present day southern arizona.
about 2 000 years ago they dug networks of irrigation ditches so that they could farm the desert land.
the ditches carried water from the salt and gila hee luh rivers to fields where farmers produced corn squash and beans.
the anasazis lived in the four corners region where colorado utah new mexico and arizona meet today.
like the hohokams the anasazis irrigated the desert in order to farm.
they also created a network of roads to link dozens of towns.
traders traveled these roads carrying cotton sandals and blankets woven from turkey feathers.
anasazi houses the anasazis built large buildings with walls of stone and adobe or sundried brick.
when the spanish later saw similar buildings in the early 1500s they called them pueblos pwehb lohz the spanish word for villages they also called the descendants of the anasazis the pueblo indians.
about 1 000 years ago some anasazi villages faced attacks from warlike neighbors.
to escape that threat they built new homes along steep cliffs.
toeholds cut into the rock let people climb the cliff walls.
farmers planted their crops on land above the cliffs mound builders far to the east other farming cultures flourished in north america.
among them were the mound builders various cultures that built large earth mounds beginning about 3 000 years ago.
thousands of these mounds dot the landscape from the appalachian mountains to the mississippi valley and from wisconsin to florida.
what is now the eastern half of the united states had a wetter climate than the southwest and the mound builders were able to farm without irrigation.
the first mounds were used for burials.
later mounds were used for religious ceremonies.
they were similar in function to the pyramid temples of the mayas.
the best known groups of mound builders were the hopewells and the mississippians.
the mississippians took advantage of their moist climate to grow enough crops to feed large towns.
betweena d.
700 and 1500 the mississippians built a city at cahokia kah hoh kee ah in present day illinois.
as many as 30 000 people may have lived there at one time.

use what you already know to help answer your partners questions about early north american cultures.
culture and the physical characteristics of north america native americans did not belong to just one group.
instead native americans included many different people with many distinct cultures.
in north america alone there were hundreds of native american languages spoken.
native american cultures too varied greatly much like the cultures of the people of europe.
native american cultures were adapted to the many different physical environments of north america the physical characteristics of the environment in each elps the anasazi made use of their environment by building dwellings along sheer cliffs as protection against intruders.

the early americas and european exploration 11 l ie early americas and european exploration 10 1 1 the early americas 1 1 the early americas region as you will see below influenced population distribution and settlement patterns or where native americans lived right up to modern times.
a culture region is a region in which people share a similar way of life.
most culture regions shared similar physical environments.
each culture region was home to many different tribes.
a tribe is a community of people who share common customs language and rituals.
members of a tribe saw themselves as a distinct people who shared a common origin.
tribal leaders often made decisions for the group.
hunting gathering and fishing native americans developed a variety of ways to meet their basic needs for food clothing and shelter.
in some culture regions tribes hunted animals and gathered nuts fruits and vegetables that grew in the wild.
other tribes depended on the sea for food.
they made boats out of animal skins or carved canoes out of trees.
from their boats and canoes they speared or netted fish or hunted marine animals such as seals walrus and whales.
farming other tribes lived mostly by farming planting corn beans and squash.
native american tribes farmed in many parts of north america from the american southwest to the eastern woodlands.
over time farmers improved their crops.
for example more than 5 000 years ago wild corn was tiny about the size of a human finger.
indian farmers developed dozens of varieties of corn including ones with larger ears.
trade indian tribes traded with one another for goods not found within their own region.
trade networks linked people across large distances.
goods sometimes traveled more than 1 000 miles from where they were made.
in the northwest traders met near the dalles on the columbia river.
local indians caught and dried salmon which they exchanged for goods and produce from other places.
more than goods traveled from indian group to group.
new ideas and skills also spread.
this process of spreading ideas from one culture to another is known as diffusion.
through diffusion skills such as farming spread from one native american group to another.
adapting to and modifying environments native american cultures adapted to the physical characteristics of environments in different regions.
these characteristics influenced the kinds of food people raised collected or caught.
climate determined peoples needs for clothing and shelter.

climate and resources also affected tribal organization.
where climates were harsh and resources limited people struggled to find enough food and shelter.
in such regions people were often nomadic.
they lived in small hunting bands.
each band included a number of families.
in regions with more favorable climates and plentiful resources people tended to live in larger groups and stay in one place for longer periods.
cultures of the arctic and subarctic regions frozen seas and icy treeless plains made up the world of the inuits who lived in the arctic region.
the inuits used all the limited resources of their environment.

this forest is made up mainly of conifers or cone bearing trees such as hemlock and spruce.
people in the subarctic lived where they could find food.
groups like the chipewyan chip uh wy un were nomads following large game like caribou.
physical characteristics of the environment influenced their settlement patterns.
the carrier for example settled near salmon streams although they sometimes moved to other hunting sites.
cultures of the california great basin and plateau regions the california region offered more forgiving climates with mainly hot dry summers and mild wet winters.
the physical features included mountains coastal lowland and interior valleys and deserts.
over 200 different tribes called this region home.
along the colorado river land was irrigated to grow corn pumpkin and beans.
in the northwest the yoruk yawr uk used redwood trees to build houses and canoes and caught the plentiful fish of that region.
in central california salmon and acorns were plentiful.
people there hunted and gathered plant products instead of farming.
with enough food nearby people could spend time producing crafts.
the porno wove watertight baskets out of grasses and reeds.
the great basin culture region consisted of mountains and valleys with a dry climate with hot summers and cold winters.
many of the bands that lived here like the bannock were small and nomadic.
they traveled to find seeds nuts roots and bulbs.
the northern paiute py yoot lived near lakes and marshes.
hunting fishing and farming often provided enough food for them to stay in one place.
the plateau region centered on the columbia plateau has a cool and dry environment but 1 1 the early americas the early americas and european exploration winter snows fed rivers flowing through the region.
surprisingly numbers of hardy plants and animals thrive in the region.
among the people of the plateau region were the utes yootz and shoshones shah shoh neez.
the native americans of the region had few possessions beyond digging sticks baskets and tools and weapons needed for hunting.
cultures of the northwest coastal region elsewhere in north america the climate was kinder which helped more complex cultures emerge.
the people of the mountainous northwest coast enjoyed milder temperatures and abundant rainfall and food supplies.
they gathered rich harvests of fish from the sea.
from nearby forests they cut down tall cedar trees and split the trunks into planks for houses and canoes.
with plenty of food the people of the pacific northwest stayed in one place.
they built permanent villages and prospered from trade with nearby groups.
within a village a family gained status according to how much it owned and could give away.
families sometimes competed with one another.
to improve its standing a family might hold a potlatch or ceremonial dinner to show off its wealth.
the potlatch could last for many days.
the family invited many guests and gave the abundant forests of the pacific northwest provide the cedar trees native americans use to carve totem poles.
the images on the poles often tell stories from native american legends.

the more goods a family gave away the i more respect it earned.
however people who received gifts at a potlatch were then expected to hold their own potlatches and give gifts.
cultures of the southwest region the southwest is a hot and dry region consisting of deserts the southern rocky mountains and the colorado plateau.
people could survive only if they found water.
the pueblo people used irrigation methods such as building dams and tanks to store water.

their months included strawberry little corn mulberry deer turkey and bear.
the ruler of the natchez was known as the great sun and was worshipped as a god.
the great suns feet never touched the ground.
either he was carried on a litter or he walked on mats.
below the great sun were members of his family called little suns.
next came nobles then honored people and finally stinkards or commoners who made up the majority of the people.
marriage laws ensured that membership in each class kept changing.
by law nobles had to marry stinkards.
even the great sun chose a stinkard as a wife.
in this way no one family could hold the position of great sun forever.
in time even descendants of a great sun became stinkards.
cultures of the great plains region the great plains were dry open grasslands in the center of north america with very few trees hot summers and cold winters.
tribes like the sioux soo hunted wild animals to survive.
the sioux were nomads who followed the buffalo.

the iroquois ihr uh kwoi lived near lakes and streams.
they cleared land for farming which was mostly done by women.
their diet was based on the three sisters corn squash and beans.
algonquian al gahn kwee un tribes lived near the ocean and along the great lakes.
many of them farmed as well.
in some places it was too poor to farm.
instead they built boats for fishing.
like the iroquois they also used trees from the forests to make houses and tools.

kings and queens divided their lands among warrior nobles.
in return nobles promised to fight for the ruler when asked.
this system of rule by lords who ruled their lands but owed loyalty and military service to a monarch is called feudalism fyood ul iz um.
at the top of feudal society stood the king and the most powerful lords.
next came the lesser nobles.
most people in feudal society were peasants who farmed the lords lands and could not leave the land without the lords permission.
daily life in feudal society feudal life revolved around the manor which included the lords castle and the lands around it.
manor lands might include several villages.
each manor was self sufficient.
that is people made almost everything they needed.
life for peasants was hard.
peasants were farmers who worked mostly by hand on small plots.
they struggled to produce enough food just to survive.

religion the most powerful force in medieval western europe was the roman catholic church.
the roman catholic church was the main branch of christianity in western europe.
like other branches of christianity it was based on the teachings of jesus who lived centuries earlier.
during ancient and early medieval times the religion spread across europe.
the church ruled more than religious life.
the church owned large amounts of land and offered the only source of education.
the clergy were often the only people who could read and write.
because of their efforts much of the learning from the ancient world was preserved.
while christianity was the main religion in western europe the region also had a strong jewish community.
their religion was judaism a religion centuries older than christianity.
it too had spread across europe in ancient and early medieval times.
while jewish people played an important role in medieval europe they often faced discrimination and persecution or attacks because of their beliefs.
the crusades the pace of change in europe increased between 1100 and 1300 in part because of the crusades.
the crusades were a series of wars fought by christians to control the region then known as the holy land or palestine much of which is now israel.
this region included jerusalem and the other places where jesus had lived and taught.
muslims had controlled this region for centuries.
during the crusades tens of thousands of christians journeyed to the middle east.
fighting between christians and muslims continued for almost 200 years.
christians won some victories and they ruled kingdoms in the region for more than 100 years.
but in the end they failed to keep control of the holy land.
growing trade the crusades had important effects on europe however.
crusaders traveled beyond their villages and came into contact with other civilizations.
in the middle east they tasted new foods such as rice oranges dates and new spices.
they saw beautiful silks and woven rugs.
europe had traded with the middle east for many years before the crusades.
however returning crusaders demanded more asian foods spices silks and rugs.
italian merchants realized that people would pay high prices for such goods.
they outfitted ships and increased trade with the muslim world.

from the muslim world europeans acquired sailing skills and the magnetic compass.
muslims had earlier adopted the magnetic compass from the chinese.
the magnetic needle of the compass always pointed north which helped ships stay on course.
another useful instrument was the astrolabe as troh layb which helped sailors determine their latitude while at sea.
these new instruments let europeans sail far out to sea beyond sight of land.
by 1500 portugal had taken the lead in this new overseas travel.
b identify main ideas how did the crusades affect trade in the middle ages.
the middle east middle eastern merchants played a large role in this growing trade.
linking europe africa and asia the middle east was a major crossroads of the world.
muslim conquests and inventions the growth of trade was also linked to the spread of a new religion.
in the early 600s a new religion islam emerged in arabia.
a people called the arabs lived in arabia in the southern middle east.
islam won many followers among the arabs.
beginning in the 600s islam spread rapidly.
devout trade routes of asia and africa a crrowt h followers conquered north africa and much of spain.
they conquered lands to the east too from persia to india and beyond.
eventually the muslim world spread from south asia to what is now portugal and spain.
in many countries ruled by muslims however there were also communities of christians and jewish people.
islam expanded through trade and conquest by sword.
while some remained faithful to christianity judaism and other religions many people in conquered lands chose to convert to the new religion.
others were converted by force or under the threat of crippling taxes.
elsewhere muslim merchants carried the new faith to people living along the trade routes of asia and africa.
islam united muslims from many lands and fostered the growth of trade.
muslims had a basic duty to make a pilgrimage or journey to the holy city of mecca at least once in their lives.
every year people from across the muslim world traveled to mecca.
muslims from north africa persia afghanistan india spain and west africa crowded meccas dusty streets.
they prayed in arabic the language of islam.
this regular travel encouraged trade among the muslim lands.
people in the mainly muslim middle east developed many of the technologies we use today.

navigating the seas middle eastern merchants traded across a vast area.
they sailed to ports around the indian ocean.
their ships used large triangular sails that allowed captains to sail close to the direction the wind was blowing from.
middle eastern sailors had knowledge of wind and weather conditions in the indian ocean.
as a result merchants in ports around the region knew when the trading ships had to sail and when they would return.
middle easterners made important technological innovations in the astrolabe which as you have learned helped sailors find their way far from shore.
middle eastern merchants sold porcelains perfumes and fabrics from china.
jade and tea were popular too.
the spice islands of indonesia offered nutmeg clove and mace.

goods like textiles and spices traveled well.
they quickly spread across the globe.
silk road some middle eastern traders traveled the overland routes that crossed the grasslands mountains and deserts of central asia and linked china and the middle east.
these routes had become known as the silk road because prized chinese silks had been carried westward along them for more than 1 000 years.
travel on the silk road was dangerous.
desert storms hunger and bandits were a constant threat.
traders formed caravans or groups of people who traveled together for safety.
despite the dangers trade along the silk road prospered.
by the 1400s trade goods were flowing across a huge area.
more than just silk was traded on the silk road.
everything from horses to spices and gems traveled along the route.

sea traders also spread navigation technologies throughout africa and eventually to europe.
the lateen sail believed to have been invented first in egypt was a triangular sail that allowed ships to travel toward the wind.
although historians cannot be certain it is likely that north africans adapted the astrolabe for sea travel too.
it was used by african arab and indian sailors and then adopted by europeans.
city states of east africa trade had long flowed up and down the coast of east africa.
small villages that had good natural harbors grew into busy trading centers.
gold from zimbabwe zim bah bweh a powerful inland state was carried to coastal cities such as kilwa and sofala.
from there ships carried the gold and prized goods such as hardwoods and ivory across the indian ocean to arabia india and china.
wealth from trade helped local east african rulers build strong city states.
east african city states gained wealth and power by trading people as well as goods.
they traded enslaved people from the interior of east africa to arabs and other groups across the indian ocean.

trading kingdoms of west africa a region of grasslands called the savanna covers much of west africa.
several rich trading kingdoms emerged there.
among the best known were mali and songhai sawng hy.
the city of timbuktu was the major trading center for both kingdoms.
these west african empires gained power through warfare.
they conquered neighboring peoples and took control of surrounding lands.
the kingdom of mali rose in about a d 1200 and flourished for about 200 years.
like the rulers of east africas city states many rulers in west african kingdoms adopted the religion of islam.

ways of life in africa ways of life varied greatly across the huge continent of africa.
while powerful trading states flourished in some regions most people lived outside these kingdoms.
many lived in small villages.
they made a living by herding fishing or farming.
family relationships were important in african cultures.
although family patterns varied across africa many people lived within an extended family.
in an extended family several generations live in one household.
an extended family usually included grandparents parents children and sometimes aunts uncles and cousins.
the grandparents or elders received special respect for their wisdom and knowledge.
ties of kinship or sharing a common ancestor linked families.
people related by kinship owed loyalty to one another.
kinship ties encouraged a strong sense of community and cooperation.
religious beliefs varied widely across africa.

v elps chinese trade and technology africa had many different cultures and kingdoms.
by contrast in china power was centered on one emperor.
chinese rulers were often suspicious of outsiders.
china was the most isolated civilization of the ancient world.
long distances and physical barriers separated it from egypt the middle east and india.
this isolation contributed to the chinese belief that china was the center of the earth and the sole source of civilization.
the ancient chinese looked down on outsiders who did not speak chinese or follow chinese ways.
analyze maps what information does the image of mansa musa on his throne holding a golden object add to this medieval map.
china uses technology to increase trade chinese inventions changed shipbuilding around the globe.
the chinese invented the rudder which made it easier to steer large ships.
they created watertight compartments that went in the ship s hull to reduce the risk of sinking.
they also probably invented the magnetic compass which decreased the likelihood of getting lost on the open seas.
a young emperor who came to power in 1402 was eager to use these new technologies to increase trade.
he ordered a huge fleet to be built and named zheng he jung huh to command it.
zheng hes fleet numbered more than 300 ships.
it carried tons of trade goods.
the largest ships were more than 400 feet long.
between 1405 and 1433 zheng he made seven long voyages.
his fleet traded at ports in southeast asia india arabia and east africa.
at every port chinese traders carried on a brisk business.
they expanded chinese trade and influence across a wide region.
the voyages end zheng hes great fleet returned home with exotic goods and animals such as giraffes that the chinese had never seen.
however chinas overseas voyages soon ended.
a new emperor decided that china had nothing to learn from the outside world.
he outlawed most foreign trade.
however traders the early americas and european exploration 22 1 2 early europe africa and asia the early americas and european exploration 23 1 2 early europe africa and asia like zheng he had spread chinese technological innovations around the world.
the chinese first invented paper in a d 105.
they also developed a printing press with movable type.
the chinese made advancements in timekeeping developing several different kinds of clocks.
they also invented gunpowder.
europeans later used gunpowder in handguns and cannons which were based on chinese designs.
b identify supporting details how did new technologies improve chinese ships.
europes renaissance increased trade and travel made europeans eager to learn more about the wider world.
scholars looked in monastery libraries for manuscripts of ancient greek and roman works.
some traveled to the middle east where many ancient works had been preserved.
as scholars studied ancient learning they began to make their own discoveries.
they produced new books on art medicine astronomy and chemistry.
this great burst of learning and technological innovation was called the renaissance ren uh sahns a french word i during the renaissance printing presses with movable type as shown here allowed printers to mass produce books helping to spread new learning.
meaning rebirth.
it lasted from the late 1300s until the 1600s.
the chinese had invented the printing press and movable type or metal letters that could be used to print paper.
however the chinese language required thousands of different letters and movable type had little impact.
during the 1430s a german printer named johannes gutenberg goot un burg is believed to have invented movable type without knowing that it had existed in china.
movable type was much more k useful for printing in european languages which used only 26 letters.
together movable type and the printing press helped to spread renaissance learning.
before movable type and the printing press books were scarce and costly because each was copied by hand.
with these technological innovations large numbers of books could be produced quickly and at a low cost.
soon more people began to read and learning spread more quickly.
europeans search for new trade routes during the renaissance trade brought new prosperity.
european rulers began to increase their power.
in england and france kings and queens worked to bring powerful feudal lords under their control.
in spam and portugal christian monarchs drove out muslim rulers who had governed there for centuries.
rulers in england france spain and portugal were eager to increase their wealth.
they saw the great profits that could be made through trade.
however middle eastern and italian merchants controlled the trade routes across the mediterranean sea.
so western europes leaders began hunting for other routes to asia.
european rulers also looked to africa as a source of riches.
tales of mansa musas wealth had created a stir in europe but no one knew the source of african gold.
portuguese voyages portugal was an early leader in the search for a new trade route to asia and for the source of african gold.
in the early 1400s prince henry known as henry the navigator encouraged sea captains to sail south along the coast of west africa.
realizing that portugal needed better navigators to accomplish the task he set up an informal school to teach sailors techniques of navigation and the art of shipbuilding.
under henrys guidance the portuguese designed a new type of ship the caravel kar uh vel.
with triangular sails and a steering rudder caravels could be sailed closer to the direction the wind was blowing from.
portuguese caravels stopped at many places along the coast of west africa.
they traded cloth silver textiles and grain for gold and ivory.

key terms colony turning point circumnavigate columbian exchange modification european exploration in the americas early contact with the americas unlike other possible early voyagers to the americas the vikings left behind a detailed record of their voyages.
in 1001 viking sailors led by leif ericson reached the eastern tip of north america.
archaeologists have found evidence of the viking settlement of vinland in present day newfoundland canada.
the vikings did not stay in vinland long and no one is sure why they left.
however viking stories describe fierce battles with skraelings the viking name for the inuits.
evidence suggests that asians continued to cross the bering sea into north america after the last ice age ended.
some scholars believe that ancient seafarers from polynesia may have traveled to the americas using their knowledge of the stars and winds.
modern polynesians have sailed canoes thousands of miles in this way.
still others think that fishing boats from china and japan blew off course and landed on the western coast of north or south america.

26 perhaps such voyages occurred.
if so they were long forgotten.
before 1492 the peoples of asia and europe had no knowledge of the americas and their remarkable civilizations.
ki recall why arent we certain whether early people from europe or asia other than the vikings sailed to america.
the voyages of columbus portuguese sailors had pioneered new routes around africa toward asia in the late 1400s.
spain too wanted a share of the riches.
king ferdinand and queen isabella hoped to keep their rival portugal from controlling trade with india china and japan.
they therefore agreed to finance a voyage of exploration by christopher columbus.
columbus an italian sea captain planned to reach the east indies by sailing west across the atlantic.
finding a sea route straight to asia would give the spanish direct access to the silks spices and precious metals of asia.
the spice trade was a major cause for european exploration and a reason the spanish rulers supported columbuss voyage.
however it was not the only reason.
they hoped for wealth from any source.
get gold king ferdinand said to columbus.
humanely if possible but at all hazards get gold sailing across the atlantic in august 1492 columbus set out with three ships and a crew of about 90 sailors.
as captain he commanded the largest vessel the santa maria.
the other ships were the nina and the pinta.
after a brief stop at the canary islands the little fleet continued west into unknown seas.
fair winds sped them along but a month passed without the sight of land.
some sailors began to grumble.
they had never been away from land for so long and feared being lost at sea.
still columbus sailed on.
on october 7 sailors saw flocks of birds flying southwest.
columbus changed course to follow the birds.
a few days later crew members spotted tree branches and flowers floating in the water.
at 2 a m on october 12 the lookout on the pinta spotted white cliffs shining in the moonlight.
tierra he shouted.
land at dawn columbus rowed ashore and planted the banner of spain on the beach.
he was convinced that he had reached the east indies in asia.
he called the people he found there indians in fact he had reached islands off the coasts of north america and south america in the caribbean sea.
these islands later became known as the west indies.
for three months columbus explored the west indies.
to his delight he found signs of gold on the islands.
eager to report his success he returned to spain.
spain seeks colonies in spain columbus presented queen isabella and king ferdinand with gifts of pink pearls and brilliantly colored parrots.
the royal couple listened intently as columbus brought with him several of many things that europeans had never seen before tobacco pineapples and hammocks used for sleeping.
columbus also described the indians he had met the tainos ty nohz.
the tainos he promised could easily be converted to christianity and could also be used as slaves.
the spanish monarchs were impressed.
they gave columbus the title admiral of the ocean sea.
they also agreed to finance future voyages.
the promise of great wealth and the chance to spread christianity gave them a reason to explore further.
columbus made three more voyages across the atlantic.
in 1493 he founded the first spanish colony in the americas santo domingo on an island he called hispaniola present day haiti and the dominican republic.
a colony is an area settled and ruled by the government of a distant land.
columbus also explored this illustration shows columbus meeting the taino people of the west indies.
his voyages benefited spain but brought much misery to the world of the taino.
the early americas and european exploration 27 13 european exploration in the americas present day cuba and jamaica and sailed along the coasts of central america and northern south america.
he claimed all of these lands for spain.
columbus proved to be a better explorer than governor.
during his third expedition settlers on hispaniola complained of his harsh rule.
queen isabella appointed an investigator who sent columbus back to spain in chains.
in the end the queen pardoned columbus but he never regained the honors he had won earlier.
he died in 1506 still convinced that he had reached asia.
the impact of columbuss voyages columbus has long been honored as the bold sea captain who discovered america today we recognize that native americans had discovered and settled these lands long before 1492.
still in at least one sense columbus deserves the honors history has given him.
europeans knew nothing of the americas until columbus told them about this new world his daring voyages marked the beginning of lasting contact among the peoples of europe africa and the americas.
for a great many native americans contact had tragic results.
columbus and those who followed were convinced that european culture was superior to that of the indians.
the spanish claimed taino lands and forced tainos to work in gold mines on ranches or in spanish households.
many tainos died from harsh conditions or european diseases.
within 100 years of columbuss arrival the taino population was virtually wiped out.
the life of christopher columbus analyze timelines how many voyages did columbus make to the americas.
for better or worse the voyages of columbus signaled a turning point for the americas.
a turning point is a moment in history that marks a decisive change.
curious europeans saw the new lands as a place where they could settle trade and grow rich.
i h identify main ideas what reasons did spain have for sending columbus on his voyages.
other spanish exploration after the voyages of columbus the spanish explored and settled other caribbean islands.
they wanted to take advantage of the land columbus had found seeking gold crops slaves and converts to christianity for the spanish crown.
by 1511 they had conquered puerto rico jamaica and cuba.
they also explored the eastern coasts of north america and south america in i search of a western route to asia.
in 1513 vasco nunez de balboa bal boh uh plunged into the jungles of the isthmus of panama.
native americans had told him that a large body of water lay to the west.
with a party of spanish soldiers and indians balboa reached the pacific ocean after about 25 days.
he stood in the crashing surf and claimed the ocean for spain.
the spanish had no idea how wide the pacific was until a sea captain named ferdinand magellan muh jel un sailed across it.
the expedition made up of five ships and about 250 crew members left spain in 1519.
fifteen months later it rounded cape horn the stormy southern tip of south america and entered the pacific ocean.
crossing the vast pacific the sailors ran out of food.
we remained 3 months and 20 days without taking in provisions or other refreshments and ate only old biscuit reduced to powder full of grubs and stinking from the dirt which rats had made on it.
we drank water that was yellow and stinking.
antonio pigafetta the diary of antonio pigafetta magellan himself was killed in a battle with the local people of the philippine islands off the coast of asia.
in 1522 only one ship and 18 sailors returned to spain.
they were the first people to circumnavigate or sail completely around the world.
in doing so they had found an all water western route to asia.
their voyage made europeans aware of the true size of the earth.
el identify identify the significance of magellan voyage.
in 1513 vasco nunez de balboa was the first spaniard to reach the pacific ocean which he claimed for spain.
the columbian exchange the encounter between the peoples of the eastern and western hemispheres sparked a global exchange of goods and ideas.
because it started with the voyages of columbus this transfer is known as the columbian exchange.
the columbian exchange refers to a biological and cultural exchange of animals plants human populations diseases food government technology the arts and languages.
the exchange went in both directions.
europeans learned much from native americans.
at the same time europeans contributed in many ways to the culture of the americas.
this exchange also brought about many modifications or changes to the physical environment of the americas with both positive and negative results.
modifying environments europeans introduced domestic animals such as chickens from europe and africa.
european pigs cattle and horses often escaped into the wild and multiplied rapidly.
forests and grasslands were converted to pastures.
as horses spread through what would become the united states indians learned to ride them and used them to carry heavy loads.
interactive chart horses and other domesticated animals were introduced to the americas by europeans.
horses soon became part of native americans way of life.
he early americas and european exploration 28 1 3 european exploration in the americas the early americas and european exploration 29 1 3 european exploration in the americas plants from europe and africa changed the way native americans lived.
the first bananas came from the canary islands.
by 1520 one spaniard reported that banana trees had spread so greatly that it is marvelous to see the great abundance of them oranges lemons and figs were also new to the americas.
in north america explorers also brought such plants as bluegrass the daisy and the dandelion.
these plants spread quickly in american soil and modified american grasslands.
tragically europeans also brought new diseases such as smallpox and influenza.
native americans had no resistance to these diseases.
historians estimate that within 75 years diseases from europe had killed almost 90 percent of the people in the caribbean islands and in mexico.
native american influences on europe africa and asia for their part native americans introduced europeans africans and asians to new foods customs and ideas.
after 1492 elements of native american ways of life gradually spread around the world.
sadly disease also spread from the americas to europe and other parts of the world.
native americans introduced europeans to valuable food crops such as corn potatoes sweet potatoes beans tomatoes manioc squash peanuts pineapples and blueberries.
today almost half the worlds food crops come from plants that were first grown in the americas.
europeans carried the new foods with them as they sailed around the world.
everywhere peoples diets changed and populations increased.
in south asia people used american hot peppers and chilis to spice stews.
chinese peasants began growing corn and sweet potatoes.
italians made sauces from tomatoes.
people in west africa grew manioc and corn.
european settlers often adopted native american skills.
in the north indians showed europeans how to use snowshoes and trap beavers and other fur bearing animals.
european explorers learned how to paddle indian canoes.
some leaders studied native american political structures.
in the 1700s benjamin franklin admired the iroquois league and urged american colonists to unite in a similar way.
positive and negative consequences through the columbian exchange europeans and native americans modified their environments and gamed new resources and skills.
at the same time warfare and disease killed many on both sides.
europeans viewed expansion positively.
they gained great wealth explored trade routes and spread christianity.
yet their farming mining and diseases took a toll on the physical environment and left many native americans dead.
despite these negatives the columbian exchange shaped the modern world including what would become the united states.

however when california requested admission to the union as a free state in 1850 the balance of power in the senate was once again threatened.
conflict and compromise over california in 1849 there were 15 slave states and 15 free states in the union.
if california entered the union as a free state the balance of power would be broken.
furthermore it seemed quite possible that oregon utah and new mexico might also join the union as free states.
many southerners feared that the south would be hopelessly outvoted in the senate.
some even suggested that southern states might want to secede or remove themselves from the united states.
northern congressmen meanwhile argued that california should enter the union as a free state because most of the territory lay north of the missouri compromise line.
it was clear that the nation faced a crisis.
many in congress looked to senator henry clay for a solution.
conflicts between henry clay and john c calhoun clay had won the nickname the great compromiser for working out the missouri compromise and the compromise tariff of 1833 which resolved the nullification crisis.

calhoun refused to compromise.
he insisted that slavery be allowed in the western territories.
in addition calhoun demanded that fugitives or african americans who had fled slavery be returned to their owners.

they believed that the president and congress were now set against their interests especially slavery.
even before the election south carolinas governor had written to other southern governors.
if lincoln won he wrote it would be their duty to leave the union.
this sentiment revealed the strong currents of sectionalism running through the country.
many in the south felt stronger ties to their region than to the nation.
the nation splits along sectional lines senator john crittenden of kentucky made a last effort to save the union.
in december 1860 he introduced a bill to extend the missouri compromise line to the pacific.
crittenden also proposed an amendment to the constitution that was unamendable one that could not be changed.
such an amendment would guarantee forever the right to hold enslaved african americans in states south of the compromise line.
the compromise bill received little support.
slavery in the west was no longer the issue.
many southerners believed that the north had put an abolitionist in the white house.
they felt that secession was their only choice.

at a convention in montgomery alabama the seven states formed a new nation the confederate states of america.
jefferson davis of mississippi became the first president of the confederacy.
causes leading to war now a new issue emerged whether southern states were allowed to secede under the constitution.
most southerners believed that they had every right to secede.
after all the declaration of independence said that it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish a government that denies the rights of its citizens.
lincoln they believed would deny white southerners the right to own african americans as slaves.
for many southerners secession was an issue of states rights and sovereignty or independent control of an area.
many in the southern states believed that states had the sovereign right to secede.
according to this view states had the authority to make decisions without interference from the federal government and the constitution created a union made up of states that could decide to leave the union at any point.
those states also had the sovereign right to join together to form a new government such as the confederacy.
sectionalism and civil war 392 8 3 division and the outbreak of war lincoln disagreed.
he maintained that the constitution allowed for shared powers between national and state governments but did not give states sovereignty that would allow them to secede.
the causes of the looming civil war thus included sectionalism disagreement over the extension of slavery claims of states rights and disagreement over the constitutionality of those claims.
compare and contrast the views of southerners and president lincoln on the issues of state sovereignty and the right to secede from the union.
war breaks out when lincoln took the oath of office on march 4 1861 he faced a dangerous situation.
seven southern states had seceded from the united states and had joined together to form the confederacy.
lincolns first inaugural address when he took office lincoln delivered an inaugural address.
in his inaugural address lincoln warned that no state.
can lawfully get out of the union.
still he pledged that there would be no war unless the south started it in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war.
we are not enemies but friends.
we must not be enemies.
though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection abiaham lincoln lust.
inaugural adcliess lincolns first inaugural address expressed ideas about union liberty equality and government.
regarding union lincoln emphasized that the constitution set limits on the actions of states and that there was no provision in the constitution for secession.
that is the constitution required that the union be preserved.
on liberty again lincoln emphasized that the states liberty was constrained by their acceptance of the constitution and did not include a right to secede.
lincoln also addressed another aspect of liberty.
he stated his willingness to enforce the fugitive slave act but only if the liberty of free african americans from kidnapping and enslavement could be ensured.
regarding equality lincoln assured americans that he would provide government services and enforce federal just one month after jefferson davis became president of the confederacy abraham lincoln was sworn in as president of the united states at the capitol.
in his speech lincoln said that secession was unconstitutional.
law equally in all states whether they were slave or free states.
finally on government lincoln stated that government required acquiescence or the willingness to accept laws whether or not a person agreed with those laws.
the unwillingness of the south to accept his legal election under the constitution he implied was a threat to government.
the inaugural address of jefferson davis by the time lincoln gave his address the confederate states of america had already sworn in jefferson davis as president.
davis had a role similar to that of the american president being chief executive of the confederate government.
in his inaugural address he said the confederacy would adopt the same constitution as the united states for its government however daviss inaugural speech was very different from lincolns.
whereas lincoln pledged to keep the union together davis explained why the south had decided to secede from the union.
davis said secession was based on the desire to preserve our own rights and promote our own welfare he also said it is joyous in the midst of perilous times to look around upon a people united in heart sectionalism and civil war 393 8 3 division and the outbreak of war where one purpose of high resolve animates and actuates the whole where the sacrifices to be made are not weighed in the balance against honor and right and liberty and equality lincoln in contrast described secession as the essence of anarchy he believed secession countered the principles of liberty and equality on which the nation was founded and its government was based.
for davis liberty and equality existed only between white men.
in a later speech lincoln would extend the idea of equality to all americans.
davis emphasized that government exists only with the consent of the governed.
since southerners could no longer consent to a government they considered opposed to their interests they had to break away and form a government to which they could consent.
this was in contrast to lincolns argument that government sometimes requires citizens to acquiesce to or obey laws with which they disagree.
davis also argued that under the u s constitution states had the right to reclaim powers that they had given to the federal government by seceding.
lincoln took the opposite view that states had no such right.
1861 lincoln faces war lincoln said in his inaugural address that he did not want war but jefferson davis had already ordered confederate forces when confederate troops fired across the charleston harbor at fort sumter one of only four remaining federal forts in the south they started the american civil war.
to begin seizing federal forts in the south.
lincoln faced a difficult decision.
should he let the confederates take over federal property.
if he did he would seem to be admitting that states had the right to leave the union.
on the other hand if he sent troops to hold the forts he might start a civil war.
he might also lose the support of the eight slave states that had not seceded from the union.
in april the confederacy forced lincoln to make up his mind.
by then confederate troops controlled nearly all forts post offices and other federal buildings in the south.
the union held only three forts off the florida coast and fort sumter in south carolina.
fort sumter was important to the confederacy because it guarded charleston harbor.
the attack on fort sumter president lincoln learned that food supplies at fort sumter were running low.
he notified the governor of south carolina that he was going to ship food to the fort.
lincoln promised not to send troops or weapons.
the confederates however felt that they could not leave the fort in union hands.
on april 11 1861 they demanded that fort sumter surrender.
major robert anderson the union commander refused to give in until he had run out of food or was ordered to surrender by the united states government.
confederate guns then opened fire.
the union troops quickly ran out of ammunition.
on april 13 anderson surrendered the fort.
when confederate troops shelled fort sumter people in charleston gathered on their rooftops to watch.
to many it was like a fireworks show.
no one knew that the fireworks marked the start of the civil war which would last four terrible years from 1861 to 1865.
this deadly part of the civil war era would have devastating effects to lives property and national unity.
summarize lincolns dilemma over southern states taking control of federal property.
taking sides when the war began each side was convinced that its cause was just.
southerners believed in states rights so they believed that states had the right to leave the union.
in fact they called the conflict the war for southern independence.
white southerners wanted independence so that they could keep their traditional way of life including the institution of slavery.
they also believed the north had caused the war.

northerners meanwhile believed that they had to fight to save the union.
at the outset of the war abolishing slavery was not an official goal of the north.
in fact many northerners guided by feelings of racism approved of slavery.
racism is the belief that one race is by nature superior to another.
in april 1861 eight slave states were still in the union.
as the war began they had to make the difficult decision of which side to join.
their decision would greatly affect the outcome of the war.
these states had more than half of the souths population and food crops.
in addition many of the souths factories were in these states.
four of these states virginia north carolina tennessee and arkansas quickly joined the confederacy.
however after some wavering between the north and south the four border states kentucky missouri maryland and delaware decided to remain in the union.
maryland was especially critical to the union cause since it bordered the nations capital at washington d c.
still there were some citizens of the border states who supported the south.
in april 1861 pro confederate nobs attacked union troops in baltimore maryland.
in response president lincoln declared martial law or rule by the army instead of the elected government.
many people who sided with the south were arrested.
sectionalism had led americans to feel connected to their region rather than to the country overall.
now they not only identified as northerners or southerners they had also officially split into two governments with military forces.
el check understanding why were both the north and south trying to attract slave states outside the confederacy to join their cause.
strengths and weaknesses of the north and south both sides during the civil war had strengths and weaknesses as the war began.
the south had the strong advantage of fighting a defensive war.
we seek no conquest said confederate president jefferson davis.
all we ask is to be let alone if the north did not move its forces into the south the confederacy would remain a separate country.
the souths strengths at home and economic limitations white southerners believed that they were fighting a war for independence similar to the american revolution.
defending their homeland and their way of life gave them a strong reason to fight.
our sectionalism and civil war 395 8 3 division and the outbreak of war men must prevail in combat one confederate said or they will lose their property country freedom in short everything confederate soldiers also enjoyed an advantage because they knew the southern countryside better.
friendly civilians often guided soldiers along obscure roads that did not appear on maps.
much of the south was wooded too.
confederate forces used the woods for cover as they defended themselves against invading union troops.
the south however had serious economic weaknesses.
these weaknesses were the effects of economic differences between the north and the south.
the south had few factories to produce weapons and other vital supplies.
it also had few railroads to move troops and supplies.
the railroads that it did have often did not connect to one another.
tracks simply ran between two points and then stopped.
the south also had political problems.
the confederate constitution favored states rights and limited the authority of the central government.
as a result the confederate government often found it difficult to get things done.
on one occasion for example the governor of georgia insisted that only georgian officers should command georgian troops.
finally the south had a small population.
only about 9 million people lived in the confederacy compared with 22 million in the union.
more than one third of the southern population were enslaved african americans.
as a result the south did not have enough people to serve as soldiers and to support the war effort.
the norths military disadvantages and financial strengths the north had almost four times as many free citizens as the south.
thus it had a large source of volunteers.
it also had many people to grow food and to work in factories making supplies.
the norths biggest advantages reflected the effects of economic differences with the south.
industry was the north s greatest resource.
before the war northern factories produced more than 90 percent of the nations manufactured goods.
once the war began these factories quickly began making guns bullets cannons boots uniforms and other supplies for the union army.
in addition the north had more than 70 percent of the nations rail lines which it used to transport both troops and supplies.
the north benefited from a strong navy and a large fleet of trading ships.
with few warships and only a small merchant fleet the south was unable to compete with the north at sea.
despite these advantages the north faced a difficult military challenge.
to bring the south back into the union northern soldiers had to conquer a huge area.
instead of defending their homes they were invading economic development population 1860 u s cities largest populations total value of manufactured products tops states xi x lljlllb resources railroads farm acreage manufacturing workers factories thousands analyze data based on the information in the graphs what advantages did the north have over the south at the start of the civil war.

as union armies marched into the south their lines of supply would be much longer than those of the confederates and thus more open to attack.
0 summarize how a weak economy and weak industry can be problematic during wartime.
the leadership roles of lincoln and davis leadership was a crucial factor in the civil war.
president jefferson davis of the confederacy president abraham lincoln of the union and military leaders on both sides played key roles in determining the wars outcome.
jefferson davis leads the south before the war many people thought that davis was a stronger leader than lincoln.
daviss experience prepared him for the position.
however he did not want it.
as one observer stated mr.
daviss military instincts still predominate and his eager wish was to have joined the airny instead of being elected piesident davis had attended the united states military academy at west point.
he had served as an officer in the mexican war.
later he served as secretary of war under president franklin pierce.
furthermore davis was widely respected in the south as president of the confederacy for his honesty and courage.
davis however did not like to turn over to others the details of military planning.
as a result he spent much time worrying about small matters and arguing with his advisers.
the leadership qualities of abraham lincoln at first some northerners had doubts about abraham lincolns ability to lead as president of the united states.
he did not have much experience in national politics or military matters.
however lincoln proved to he a patient but strong leader and a fine war planner.
day by day lincoln gained the respect of those around him.
many liked his sense of humor.
they noted that lincoln even accepted criticism with a smile.
when secretary of war edwin stanton called lincoln a fool lincoln commented did stanton say i was a fool.
then i must be one for stanton is generally right and he always says what he means a graduate of west point and an accomplished military officer with experience in the mexican war jefferson davis wished to serve in the confederate army rather than become the confederacys president.
at the start of his first term president lincoln gained the respect of those around him.
he was admired for his leadership as well as his good nature and sense of humor.
sectionalism and civil war 397 8 3 division and the outbreak of war general robert e lee of virginia rejected lincolns offer to command the union army.
the decision would prove costly for the union because lee was a brilliant military commander.
the role of robert e lee military leader as the war began army officers in the south had to decide whether to stay in the union army and fight against their home states or join the confederate forces.
robert e lee of virginia faced this dilemma when lincoln asked him to command the union army.
he explained in a letter to a friend if virginia stands by the old union so will i.
but if she secedes.
then i will still follow my native state with my sword and if need be with my life e lee quoted in carl sandburgs abraham lincoln virginia did secede and lee refused lincolns offer.
later lee became commander of the confederate army.
many of the prewar united states armys best officers served the confederacy.
as a result president lincoln had trouble finding generals to match those of the south.

hundreds of washingtonians in a festive mood rode out along with them to watch the battle.
many northerners thought the union army would crush the confederates.
the union troops had not gone far when they met up with confederate soldiers.
a battle quickly followed.
it took place near a small virginia stream known as bull run which was also near the town of manassas.
at first union forces succeeded in breaking up confederate battle lines.
the war is over yelled some soldiers from massachusetts.
but general thomas jackson rallied the virginia troops on a nearby hill.

historians consider him one of the most gifted tactical commanders in the civil war and he led many successful military campaigns for the confederate army.
in the end it was the union troops who panicked and ran.
off they went reported one observer across fields toward the woods anywhere everywhere to escape for most of the soldiers the retreat did not stop until they reached washington d c.
the battle of bull run also referred to as the battle of manassas by the confederates showed both the union and the confederacy that their soldiers needed training.
it also showed that the confederate army could stand up to the union meaning the war would be long and bloody.

newspapers reported all quiet along the potomac so often that the phrase became a national joke.
finally president lincoln lost patience.
if general mcclellan does not want to use the army the president snapped i would like to borrow it at last in march 1862 mcclellan and most of his troops left washington and sailed down the potomac river and the chesapeake bay.
after landing south of richmond on the virginia peninsula mcclellan began inching slowly toward the confederate capital.
learning of the union approach general robert e lee launched a series of counterattacks.
at the same time lee sent general stonewall jackson north to threaten washington.
as a result lincoln was prevented from sending the rest of the union army to help mcclellan.
cautious as usual mcclellan abandoned the attack and retreated.
the peninsula campaign as it became known had failed.
the blockade and the ironclads early in the war union ships blockaded southern ports.
at first some small fast ships slipped through the blockade.
these blockade runners brought everything from matches to guns to the confederacy.
in time however the blockade became more effective.
trade through southern ports dropped by more than 90 percent.
the south desperately needed a way to break the union blockade.
one method it tried was the ironclad ship.
clad means clothed or covered.
ironclad ships were covered with iron for protection.
confederates took over an abandoned union warship the uss merrimack.
they covered it with iron plates and renamed it the virginia.
on its first day out in march 1862 the virginia destroyed two union ships and drove three more aground.
union cannonballs bounced harmlessly off the virginia s metal skin.
the union countered with its own ironclad the monitor the two ships clashed in a body of water called hampton roads near the mouth of the chesapeake bay.
despite an exhausting battle neither vessel seriously damaged the other and both withdrew.
two months later confederates had to sink the virginia when the union captured norfolk.
the union eventually built more than 50 ironclads.
ironclad ships changed naval warfare.
however the south was never again able to mount a serious attack gainst the union navy.
the union blockade held throughout the war.
the confederate ship virginia battled the union ship monitor near hampton roads virginia in 1862.
this was the first engagement of ironclad warships in the civil war.
the battle of antietam in september 1862 general lee took the offensive and marched his troops north into maryland.
he believed that a southern victory on northern soil would be a great blow to northern morale.
luck was against lee however.
at an abandoned confederate campsite a union officer found a copy of lees battle plan.
it was wrapped around three cigars left behind by a careless general.
general mcclellan was overjoyed to have the information.
if i cannot whip bobbie lee i will be willing to go home he boasted.
however mcclellan was slow to act.
finally after a few days he attacked lees main force near a creek called antietam an tee tuhm in the town of sharpsburg maryland on september 17.
in the battle that followed more than 23 000 union and confederate soldiers were killed or wounded in one day.
september 17 1862 remains the bloodiest day in american military history.
on the night of september 18 lee ordered his troops to slip back into virginia.
the confederates breathed a sigh of relief when they saw that mcclellan was not pursuing them.
neither side was a clear winner at the battle of antietam also called the battle of sharpsburg by the confederates.
the battle was significant however because the north was able to claim victory since sectionalism and civil war lee had ordered his forces to withdraw.
as a result northern morale improved.
still president lincoln was keenly disappointed.
general mcclellan had failed to follow up his victory by pursuing the confederates.
in november lincoln appointed general ambrose burnside to replace mcclellan as commander of the army of the potomac.
b draw conclusions what conclusions can you draw from the first battles of the civil war.
confederate forces win in the east two stunning victories for the confederacy came in late 1862 and 1863.

et identify how might the confederates have felt after the battles of fredericksburg and chancellorsville.
union forces find success in the west in the west union forces met better results.
as you have read part of the union strategy was to seize control of the mississippi river.
general ulysses s grant began moving toward that goal.
in february 1862 grant attacked and captured fort henry and fort donelson in tennessee.
these confederate forts guarded two important tributaries of the mississippi.
grant now pushed south to shiloh a village on the tennessee river.
there on april 6 he was surprised by confederate forces.
by the end of the day the confederates had driven the union troops back to the banks of the river.
grant now showed the toughness and determination that would enable him to win many battles in the future and made him the unions most successful leading general.
he rushed reinforcements to the battle.
that night one of grants generals approached him.
the officer thought union forces should retreat.
but seeing grants stubborn face the officer only said well grant we ve had the devils own day havent we yes grant replied.
lick em tomorrow though.
and they did.
with the aid of the reinforcements grant beat back the confederates and won the battle of shiloh.
it was however one of the bloodiest encounters of the civil war.
while grant was fighting at shiloh the union navy moved to gain control of the mississippi river.

as you have read four slave states remained in the union.
the president did not want to do anything that might cause these states to shift their loyalty to the confederacy.
the resources of the border states might j allow the south to turn the tide of the war.
by mid 1862 however lincoln came to believe that he could save the union only by broadening the goals of the war.
he decided to emancipate or free enslaved african americans then living in confederate territory.
in the four loyal slave states however enslaved african americans would not be freed.
nor would african americans i pearson 1 realize access your digital lesson.
404 be freed in confederate lands that had already been captured by the union such as the city of new orleans tennessee or parts of virginia.
a cautious introduction lincoln had practical reasons for his emancipation plan.
at the start of the civil war more than 3 million enslaved african americans labored for the confederacy.
they helped grow the food that fed confederate soldiers.
they also worked in iron and lead mines that were vital to the south s war effort.
some served as nurses and cooks for the army.
lincoln knew that emancipation would weaken the confederacys ability to carry on the war.
however lincoln did not want to anger slave owners in the union.
also he knew that many northerners opposed freedom for enslaved african americans.
lincoln hoped to introduce the idea of emancipation slowly by limiting it to territory controlled by the confederacy.
the president had another motive.
lincoln believed that slavery was wrong.
when he felt that he could act to free enslaved african americans without threatening the union he did so.
lincoln was concerned about the timing of his announcement.
the war was not going well for the union.
he did not want americans to think he was freeing enslaved african americans as a desperate effort to save a losing cause.
he waited for a victory to announce his plan.
on september 22 1862 following the union victory at antietam lincoln announced a preliminary proclamation.
he issued the formal emancipation proclamation on january 1 1863.
a significant proclamation because the rebelling states were not under union control no african americans actually gained their freedom on january 1 1863.
still the emancipation proclamation changed the purpose of the war.
now union troops were fighting to end slavery as well as to save the union.
the opponents of slavery greeted the proclamation with joy.
in boston african american abolitionist frederick douglass witnessed one of the many emotional celebrations that took place the effect of this announcement was startling.

the proclamation won the sympathy of europeans especially workers.
as a result it became less likely that britain or any other european country would come to the aid of the south.
b check understanding how did the emancipation proclamation change the purpose of the civil war.
african americans fight heroically for the union when the war began thousands of free blacks volunteered to fight for the union.
at first federal law forbade african americans to serve as soldiers.
when congress repealed that law in 1862 however both free african americans and african americans who had escaped from slavery enlisted in the union army.
nearly half of the 54th massachusetts regiment died in the failed attack on fort wagner south carolina.
yet the regiments bravery and heroism helped earn respect for african american soldiers in the union army.
military service the army assigned african american volunteers to all black units commanded by white officers.
at first the black troops served only as laborers.
they performed noncombat duties such as building roads and guarding supplies.
black troops received only half the pay of white soldiers.
african american soldiers protested against this policy of discrimination which denied them the same treatment as other soldiers.
gradually conditions changed.
by 1863 african american troops were fighting in major battles against the confederates.
in 1864 the united states war department announced that all soldiers would receive equal pay.
by the end of the war about 200 000 african americans had fought for the union.
nearly 40 000 lost their lives.
the story of the 54th regiment one of the most famous african american units in the union army was the 54th massachusetts regiment.
the 54th accepted african americans from all across the north.
frederick douglass helped recruit troops for the regiment and two of his sons served in it.
on july 18 1863 the 54th massachusetts regiment led an attack on fort wagner near charleston south carolina.

soldiers face the horrors of war on both sides most soldiers were under the age of 21.
war however quickly turned gentle boys into tough men.
soldiers drilled and marched for long hours.
they slept on the ground even in rain and snow.
often their nothing was inadequate and uncomfortable.
many soldiers had no shoes especially in the confederacy.
in combat boys of 18 learned to stand firm as cannon masts shook the earth and bullets whizzed past their ears.
as the death toll rose the age restrictions for soldiers were relaxed.
the south drafted boys as young as 17 and men as old as 50.
new technology added to the horror of war.
cone shaped bullets made rifles twice as accurate.
improved cannons hurled exploding shells several miles.
the new weapons had deadly results.
in most battles one fourth or more of the soldiers were killed or wounded.
sick and wounded soldiers faced other horrors.
medical care on the battlefield was crude.
surgeons routinely amputated injured arms and legs.
at the time doctors did not know how germs cause infection and disease.
as a result minor wounds often became infected.
in addition poor sanitary conditions in the army camps allowed disease to spread rapidly.
diseases such as pneumonia and malaria killed more men than guns or cannons did.
improper diet also caused sickness.
on both sides prisoners of war faced horrifying conditions.
at andersonville a prison camp in georgia many union prisoners died of disease or starvation.
the difficult life of soldiers led many to desert.
one out of every seven union soldiers and one out of every nine confederate soldiers deserted.

supporters of the war called these people copperheads after the poisonous snake.
other northerners supported the war but opposed the way lincoln was conducting it.
the draft as the war dragged on public support dwindled.
when the war began the north offered men money to enlist.
however some men abused the system.
they would sign up collect the money and then desert.
soon however there was a shortage of volunteers to serve in the union army.
congress passed a draft law in 1863.
it required all able bodied males between the ages of 20 and 45 to serve in the military if they were called.
under the law a man could avoid the draft by paying the government 300 about as much as an unskilled worker could earn in a year or by hiring someone to serve in his place.
this angered many people who began to see the civil war as a rich mans war and a poor mans fight the draft law of 1863 meant that if men wanted to avoid fighting in the war they either paid the government 300 or hired others to fight in their place.
here bounty brokers offer their services as potential substitutes.
the draft riots opposition to the draft law led to riots in several northern cities.
the law had gone into effect soon after lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation.
some white northerners especially recent immigrants in the cities believed that they were being forced to fight to end slavery.
unlike abolitionists many people in northern cities had little reason for wanting slavery abolished.
freed african americans they thought would compete with them for jobs and drive down their wages.
essentially they feared the draft would force them to fight for something that was against their self interest.
the draft riots showed that urbanization could lead to conflicts resulting from differences in political beliefs.
with so many people gathered in northern cities it was possible for large scale unrest to develop over political issues such as the draft.
the worst riot took place in new york city during july 1863.
for four days white workers attacked free blacks.
rioters also attacked rich new yorkers who had paid to avoid serving in the army.
at least 74 people were killed during the riot.
president lincoln moved to stop the riots and other disloyal practices several times he suspended habeas corpus hay bee uhs kor puhs the right to be charged or have a hearing before being jailed.
lincoln argued that the constitution allowed him to deny people their rights when in the cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it the president also said that those arrested could be tried under the stricter rules of a military court.
eventually nearly 14 000 people were arrested.
however most were never charged with a specific crime or brought to trial.
a draft comes to the south president jefferson davis struggled to create a strong federal government for the confederacy.
many southerners firmly believed in states rights.
they resisted paying taxes to a central government.
at one point georgia even threatened to secede from the confederacy.
like the north the south was forced to pass a draft law to fill its army.
however men who owned or supervised more than 20 slaves did not have to serve.
southern farmers who had few or no slaves resented this law.
near the end of the war the south no longer had enough white men to fill the ranks.

war challenges and fuels the northern economy the civil war cost far more than any previous war.
the union had to use several strategies to raise money.
in some ways however war helped the norths economy.
taxation and inflation to pay for the war congress established the nations first income tax or tax on peoples earnings in 1861.
a new agency the internal revenue bureau oversaw the collection process.
the union also issued bonds worth millions of dollars.
still taxes and bonds did not raise enough money.
to get the funds it needed the north printed more than 400 i million in paper money.
as the money supply increased each dollar was wth less.
in response businesses charged more for their goods.
the north was experiencing inflation a rise in prices and a decrease in the value of money.
uuring the war prices for goods nearly doubled in the north.
wartime economic advantages the war also helped the norths economy in several ways.
since many farmers went off to fight there was a greater need for machines to plant and harvest crops.
the purchase of reapers rose to nearly 165 000 during the war.
as a result farm production actually went up during the war.
the wartime demand for clothing shoes guns and other goods helped many northern industries.
some manufacturers made fortunes by profiteering.
profiteers charged excessive prices for goods that the government desperately needed for the war.
h check understanding how did the civil war strengthen the norths economy.
war devastates the southern economy for the south war brought economic ruin.
the south had to struggle with the cost of the war the loss of the cotton trade and severe shortages brought on by the union blockade.
a weak wartime economy to raise money the confederacy imposed an income tax and a tax in kind.
the tax in kind required farmers to turn over one tenth of their crops to the government.
the government took sectionalism and civil war 409 8 5 emancipation and life in wartime crops because it knew that southern farmers had little money.
like the north the south printed paper money.
it printed so much that wild inflation set in.
by 1865 one confederate dollar was worth only two cents in gold.
prices were especially high in richmond where a barrel of flour was 275 in early 1864 potatoes were 25 a bushel and butter was 15 a pound.
the war did serious damage to the cotton trade the souths main source of income.
early in the war president davis halted cotton shipments to britain.
he hoped to force britain to side with the south in return for renewed shipments of cotton.
the tactic backfired.
britain simply bought more cotton from egypt and india.
davis succeeded only in cutting the souths income.
the union blockade creates shortages the union blockade created severe shortages in the south.
confederate armies sometimes had to wait weeks for supplies of food and clothing.
with few factories of its own the south bought many of its weapons in europe.
however the blockade cut off most deliveries from across the atlantic.
to acquire goods the government began building and running factories.
private manufacturers were offered contracts and draft exemptions for their workers if they started making war goods.
for civilians the blockade brought food shortages.
the production of food became critical to the economy.
many plantations switched from growing cotton to raising grain and livestock or animals raised for food.
in some states cotton production was limited.

the union which had captured new orleans and memphis already controlled both ends of the southern mississippi river.
still the confederates held vicksburg mississippi.
it controlled a crucial mississippi river crossing linking the eastern and western confederate states.
vicksburg sat on a cliff high above the river.
its physical geography made it difficult to attack from the river.
early in 1863 grants forces tried again and again to seize vicksburg.
the confederates held out bravely.
at last grant devised a brilliant plan.
landing at an unguarded spot on the river and arching his troops inland he launched a surprise attack on jackson mississippi.
then he turned west and attacked vicksburg from the rear.
on the side facing away from the river no physical barriers protected vicksburg.
for more than six weeks grant s forces laid siege to vicksburg.
a siege is a military encirclement of an enemy position and blockading or bombarding it in order to force it to surrender.

l the battle of gettysburg meanwhile in the east after his victory at chancellorsville general lee moved his army north into pennsylvania.
he hoped to take the yankees by surprise.
if he succeeded in pennsylvania lee planned to swing south and capture washington d c.
the union army followed the confederates making sure to remain between the confederates and washington.
on june 30 1863 the union army of the potomac now under command of general george c meade met part of lees army at the small town of gettysburg pennsylvania.
both sides quickly sent in reinforcements.
the three day battle of gettysburg that followed was one of the most significant events of the civil wai.
on the first day of battle july 1 the confederates drove the union forces out of gettysburg.
the yankees however took up strong positions on cemetery ridge overlooking the town.
union troops fortified these positions throughout that night.
the next day lee ordered an attack on both ends of the union line much of which was positioned on high ground making the attacks difficult.
southern troops fought hard but the union army was well prepared for lees offensive.
at the end of a day of savage fighting lees forces had suffered heavy casualties but failed to dislodge the union army from its strong position.
general lees disastrous decision despite his losses lee decided to attack again.
he wanted to create a panic and virtually destroy the union army.
on july 3 he ordered general george pickett to lead 15 000 men in a daring charge against the center of the union line.
to reach their target picketts men would have to march about 1 000 yards across sloping open ground all within clear view of the enemy.
this last attack led by pickett is known as picketts charge.
prior to the charge confederate cannons pounded the union position on cemetery ridge but the union lines remained intact.
for more than six weeks general grants forces circled vicksburg cutting off its supplies and used siege cannons like the one shown here to bomb the city until its eventual surrender.

as the confederates marched forward union guns opened fire.
row after row of soldiers fell to the ground dead or wounded.
the battle noise one soldier recalled was strange and terrible a sound that came from thousands of human throats.
like a vast mournful roar picketts charge failed.
the steady barrage of bullets and shells kept all but a handful of confederate soldiers from penetrating the union lines.
the next day a union officer trying to ride over the battlefield could not because the dead and wounded lay too thick to guide a horse through them as the survivors limped back lee rode among them.
its all my fault he admitted humbly.
lee had no choice but to retreat with his weakened army.
after they were defeated at gettysburg the confederates would never invade the north again.
general meade was proud of the victory.
he had protected pennsylvania and washington d c lincoln however was disappointed.
he felt that the union army had once again allowed the confederate troops to get away.
the union victories at vicksburg and gettysburg marked the turning point of the civil war.
it seemed just a matter of time before the confederacy would fall.

the gettysburg address the battle of gettysburg left more than 50 000 dead or wounded.
on november 19 1863 there was a ceremony to dedicate a cemetery to the memory of those soldiers who died at gettysburg.
president lincoln attended the ceremony.
he delivered a speech now known as the gettysburg address.
the speech expressed the purpose of the civil war and exemplified lincoln s leadership at a time of tremendous crisis.
lincoln said that the civil war was a test of whether or not a democratic government could survive.
this claim implied that the nation s survival depended on the integrity of the union.
he also addressed the theme of equality.
he reminded americans that their nation was founded on the belief that all men are created equal lincoln told the audience we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.
abraham lincoln gettysburg address november 19 1863 lincolns words all men are created equal taken from the declaration of independence and his mention of a new birth of freedom both express his ideas about liberty and equality.
coming so soon after the emancipation proclamation made earlier that same year lincolns words implied that a new birth of freedom for millions of african americans had become not just one of the goals of the civil war but one of the nations ideals.
lincolns entire speech was only ten sentences long and took about three minutes to deliver but it is honored as a profound statement of american ideals.

in 1864 lincoln appointed him commander of the union forces.
in this role grant would lead the final union advance against the confederacy.
some questioned the choice but president lincoln felt that unconditional surrender grant as some called him was the general who would end the war in the unions favor.
even back when grant had been criticized for near disaster at the battle of shiloh lincoln had defended grant i cant spare this man lincoln said.

he wanted to destroy the souths ability to fight.
to achieve this grant ordered his generals to wage total war against the south.
he wanted the union army to destroy food equipment and anything else they found that might he useful to the enemy.
in the past most wars had been restricted to soldiers.
total war however did not make any distinctions.
civilians in the south like the confederate army would suffer hardship.
grant sends sheridan to the shenandoah to set his plan in motion grant sent general philip sheridan and his cavalry into the rich farmland of virginia s shenandoah valley.
he instructed sheridan leave nothing to invite the enemy to return.

during the campaign sheridans troops burned 2 000 barns filled with grain.
there was nothing left for lees troops or for southern civilians.
shermans march to the sea grant also ordered general william tecumseh sherman to capture atlanta georgia and then march to the atlantic coast.

he thought that this might cost him the election.
the democrats nominated general george mcclellan to oppose lincoln.
they adopted a resolution demanding the immediate cessation of hostilities against the south.
although he had commanded the general william t sherman using the telescope led a campaign that cut a destructive path through the south.

union army mcclellan was willing to compromise with the confederacy.
if peace could be achieved he was ready to restore slavery.
then in september sherman took atlanta and the north rallied around lincoln.
sheridans smashing victories in the shenandoah valley in october further increased lincolns popular support.
in the election in november the vote was close but lincoln remained president.

again in the gettysburg address he emphasized the importance of maintaining the union of the country especially since the country was based on freedom and equality.
lincolns second inaugural highlighted slavery as a violation of equality and liberty yet emphasized again the preservation of unity by urging people to bind up the nations wounds in contrast confederate president jefferson davis had conveyed different views in his inaugural address given shortly after lincolns inauguration.
in his speech davis explained southerners reasons for withdrawing from the union and seceding.
it was a necessity not a choice he said.
quoting the declaration of independence davis stated this about government our present condition.

the confederacy surrenders at appomattox grant had begun a drive to capture richmond in may 1864.
throughout the spring and summer he and lee fought a series of costly battles.
northerners read with horror that 60 000 men were killed or wounded in a single month at the battles of the wilderness spotsylvania and cold harbor all in virginia.
still grant pressed on.
he knew that the union could replace men and supplies.
the south could not.
lee dug in at petersburg near richmond.
here grant kept lee under siege for nine months.
at last with a fresh supply of troops grant took petersburg on april 2 1865.
the same day richmond fell.
the war ends lee and his army withdrew to a small virginia town called appomattox court house.
there a week later they were trapped by union troops.
lee knew that his men would be slaughtered if he kept fighting.
on april 9 1865 lee surrendered.
at appomattox court house grant offered generous terms of surrender to the defeated confederate army.
richmond virginia shown here was the capital of the confederacy.
it was in richmond that confederate president jefferson davis gave his inaugural address in 1861.
soldiers were required to turn over their rifles but officers were allowed to keep their pistols.
soldiers who had horses could keep them.
grant knew that southerners would need the animals for spring plowing.
finally ordered grant each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home not to be disturbed by the united states authorities as the confederates surrendered union soldiers began to cheer.
grant ordered them to be silent.
the war is over he said.
the rebels are our countrymen again honoring those who served the war was over but for hundreds and thousands of men women and children it would be remembered as the most important event of their lives.
the men who fought on both sides were honored for their services with ceremonies up to 75 years after the war.
during the war president lincoln had signed into law what would become the medal of honor the highest honor in the american military.
over 1 500 soldiers were awarded the medal of honor for their heroic actions during the civil war.

the nation begins a new chapter the effect of the civil war was immense.
the civil war years 1861 1865 were significant on many levels.
more than 360 000 union soldiers and 250 000 confederate soldiers lost their lives.
no war has ever resulted in more american deaths.
in dollars the wars cost was about 20 billion.
that was more than 11 times the entire amount spent by the federal government between 1789 and 1861.
the civil war was a major turning point in american history.
the balance of power was changed.
the democratic party lost its influence and the republicans were in a commanding position.
no longer would americans speak of the nation as a confederation of states.
before the war americans referred to these united states after they began speaking of the united states the idea that each state might secede if it chose was dead.
as a result the power of the federal government grew.

the new government had to abolish slavery.
voters could then elect members of congress and take part in the national government once again.
lincolns plan also offered amnesty or a government pardon to confederates who swore loyalty to the union.
amnesty would not apply to the former leaders of the confederacy however.
lincoln rejects a rival proposal many republicans in congress felt that the ten percent plan was too generous toward the south.
in 1864 they passed the wade davis bill a rival plan for reconstruction.
it required a majority of white men in each southern state to swear loyalty to the union.
it also denied the right to vote or hold office to anyone who had volunteered to fight for the confederacy.
lincoln refused to sign the wade davis bill because he felt it was too harsh.
the freedmens bureau addresses economic and social needs there were many effects of the reconstruction era.
one such effect was congress and the president agreed on a proposal to create a new agency.

the bureau helped poor whites as well.
it provided medical care for more than one million people.
one of the bureaus most important tasks was to set up schools for freedmen.
most of the teachers were volunteers often women from the north.
grandparents and grandchildren sat side by side in the classroom.
charlotte forten an african american volunteer from philadelphia wrote it is wonderful how a people who have been so long crushed to the earth.
can have so great a desire for knowledge and such a capacity for attaining it charlotte forten article in the atlantic monthly the freedmens bureau laid the foundation for the souths public school system.
it also created colleges for african americans including howard morehouse and fisk.
many of the graduates of these schools became teachers themselves.
by the 1870s african americans were teaching in grade schools throughout the south.
h check understanding why did president lincoln want to make it easy for the south to rejoin the union.
the assassination of abraham lincoln president lincoln hoped to persuade congress to accept his reconstruction plan.
however he never got the chance.
on april 14 1865 just five days after lees surrender president lincoln attended a play at fords theatre in washington d c a popular actor who supported the confederate cause john wilkes booth crept into the presidents box and shot lincoln in the head.
lincoln died the next morning.
booth was later caught and killed in a barn outside the city.
the nation was plunged into grief.
the assassination was significant because lincoln was the first american president to be assassinated.
also millions who had been celebrating the wars end now mourned lincolns death.
his body was transported by train for burial in his hometown springfield illinois.
millions of americans came to pay their respects along the route.
b explain the meaning behind secretary of war edwin stantons statement about lincoln.
this present day photo shows the box at fords theatre where john wilkes booth assassinated abraham lincoln on april 14 1865.
now he belongs to the ages commented secretary of war edwin stanton.
booth was part of a group of ten conspirators who had long been plotting to kill lincoln vice president andrew johnson and secretary of state william seward.
none of the other assassinations took place although seward was attacked by one of the conspirators.
four of booths co conspirators were hanged for their crimes including mary surratt the first woman executed by the united states.
president johnsons reconstruction plan vice president andrew johnson was now president.
johnson had represented tennessee in congress.
when his state seceded johnson had remained loyal to the union.
the impact of the thirteenth amendment on life in the united states republicans in congress believed johnson would support a strict reconstruction plan.
but his plan was much milder than expected.
it called for a majority of voters in each southern state to pledge loyalty to the united states.
each state also had to ratify the thirteenth amendment which congress had approved in january 1865.
it banned slavery throughout the nation.
as you read the emancipation proclamation did not free slaves in areas already under union control.
the thirteenth amendment had a significant impact on life in the united states.
without slavery the south developed new social and economic systems.
many newly freed african americans were hired on plantations.
others moved to towns or to the north to tad work.
politically the amendment overturned previous state laws and supreme court decisions upholding slavery.
many people had argued that slavery was a state decision.
the thirteenth amendment gave congress the power to intervene and later to pass additional legislation protecting civil rights.
political problems in congress the southern states quickly met johnson s conditions.
as a result the president approved their new state governments in late 65.
voters in the south then elected representatives to congress.
many of those elected had held office in ihe confederacy.

however southern states still prohibited african americans from voting.
former vice president of the confederacy was elected senator from georgia.
republicans in congress were outraged.
the men who had led the south out of the union were being elected to the house and senate.
also no southern state allowed african americans to vote.
when the new congress met republicans refused to let southern representatives take their seats.
instead they set up a joint committee on reconstruction to form a new plan for the south.
the stage was set for a showdown between congress and the president.

the reconstruction era 1865 1877 438 9 1 early reconstruction v z under johnsons reconstruction plan most southern states promptly ratified the thirteenth amendment.
however southern legislatures also passed black codes laws that severely limited the rights of freedmen.
interactive flipped video radical reconstruction 9 a 16 b reconstruction difficulties persist rights and restrictions in the south the black codes did grant some rights.
for example african americans could marry legally and own some kinds of property.
still the codes were clearly meant to keep freedmen from gaining political or economic power.
black codes forbade freedmen to vote own guns or serve on juries.
in some states african americans were permitted to work only as servants or farm laborers.
in others they had to sign contracts for a years work.
those without contracts could be arrested and sentenced to work on a plantation.
reconstruction turns radical republicans charged that by placing too few restrictions on the south johnsons reconstruction plan had encouraged southern legislatures to pass the black codes.
republicans were also outraged by reports of violence against feedmen.
in 1866 white police officers in memphis tennessee attacked african american union soldiers who fired back at the officers.
a protest against the police ended in violence and rioting broke out.

similar riots broke out in new orleans when freedmen met to support the right to vote.
a report by the joint committee on reconstruction accused the south of trying to preserve slavery.
as long as possible when president johnson ignored the report members of congress called radical republicans vowed to take control of reconstruction.
h check understanding why were radical republicans outraged at president johnsons approach to reconstruction.
reforms of the radical reconstruction congress the radicals were led by thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania in the house and charles sumner of massachusetts in the senate.
radical republicans had two main goals.
first they wanted to break the power of wealthy planters who had long ruled the south.
second they wanted to ensure that freedmen received the right to vote.
they used legislative reforms or changes in laws to achieve their goals.
african americans such as this laborer were granted citizenship with the fourteenth amendment.
yet during reconstruction african americans still struggled to achieve basic rights such as the right to vote.
legislative reform radicals needed the support of moderate republicans the largest group in congress.
moderates and radicals disagreed on many issues but they shared a strong political motive.
most southerners were democrats.
with southerners barred from congress republicans could control both houses.
to combat the black codes congress passed the civil rights act in april 1866.
it gave citizenship to african americans.
when johnson vetoed the bill congress overrode the veto.
the impact of the fourteenth amendment republicans feared that the supreme court might use its power of judicial review to declare the civil rights act unconstitutional.
in the dred scott decision of 1857 the court had ruled that african americans were not citizens.
to avoid a similar ruling republicans proposed the fourteenth amendment.
it defined citizens as all persons born or naturalized in the united states the amendment did not apply to most native americans.
it guaranteed citizens equal protection of the laws and forbade states to deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law thus states could not legally discriminate against a citizen on unreasonable grounds such as race.
the fourteenth amendment was proposed in 1866.
as you will read it was not ratified for another two years.
under the fourteenth amendment any state that denied any male citizen age 21 or older the right to vote would have its representation in congress reduced.
republicans believed that freedmen would be able to defend their rights if they could vote.
republicans hoped the impact of the amendment on life in the united states would be to secure basic political rights for african americans in the south.
that goal would take a century to achieve.
in the 1950s the fourteenth amendment became a powerful tool in the struggle for citizenship rights.
fei explain why republicans believed the fourteenth amendment was necessary.
political and social problems during reconstruction president johnson encouraged former confederate states to reject the fourteenth amendment.
he also decided to make the amendment an issue in the 1866 congressional elections.
the reconstruction era 1865 1877 440 9 2 radical reconstruction a republican majority across the north johnson urged voters to reject the radicals.

radical reforms impact the south in 1867 republicans in congress prepared to take charge of reconstruction.
with huge majorities in both houses congress could easily override vetoes.
the period that followed is often called radical reconstruction.
congress passed the first reconstruction act in march 1867.
it threw out the state governments that had refused to ratify the fourteenth amendment all the former confederate states except tennessee.
the military reconstruction acts of 1867 divided the southern states into five military districts each governed by a military general.
army commanders were given broad permission to enforce reconstruction.
military rulers in these military districts had nearly unlimited power.
they sometimes conducted trials without juries in the south.
many southerners bitterly resented the imposition of military rule.
they argued that the military occupation violated their rights because it was done without their consent or representation.
congress however continued to impose new rules.
to rejoin the union former confederate states had to write new constitutions and ratify the fourteenth amendment.
the reconstruction act also required that southern states allow african americans to vote.
with the new constitutions in place reconstructed states held elections to set up new state governments.
the fourteenth amendment barred former confederate officials from voting.
many other white southerners stayed away from the polls in protest.

however johnson did what he could to limit their effect.
he fired several military commanders who supported radical reconstruction.
republicans in congress decided to try to remove johnson from office.
the president on trial on february 24 1868 the house of representatives voted to impeach or bring formal charges against johnson.
according to the constitution the house may impeach a president for treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors the president is removed from office if found guilty by two thirds of the senate.
during johnsons trial it became clear that he was not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.
even charles sumner johnsons bitter foe admitted that the charges were political in character despite intense pressure seven republican senators refused to vote for conviction.
the constitution they said did not allow congress to remove a president just because they the reconstruction era 1865 1877 441 9 2 radical reconstruction disagreed with him.

grant wins the election of 1868 johnson served out the few remaining months of his term.
in may 1868 republicans nominated the unions greatest war hero ulysses s grant for president.
in july 1868 the fourteenth amendment finally passed granting citizenship to african americans.
former confederate states had to ratify the amendment as if they were in the union even though they had not yet been readmitted.
on the other hand states that had been loyal to the union during the war felt that the confederate states had lost their constitutional rights by rebelling.
this rule did not affect delaware maryland kentucky or missouri slave states that did not secede.
by election day most southern states had ratified the amendment and rejoined the union.
as congress demanded the southern states allowed african american men to vote.
about 500 000 blacks voted nearly all of them for grant.
with support from most northerners as well he easily won the election.
the impact of the fifteenth amendment in 1869 congress proposed the fifteenth amendment.
it forbade any state to deny any citizen the right to vote because of race color or previous condition of servitude republicans had moral and political reasons for supporting the fifteenth amendment.
they remembered the great sacrifices made by african american soldiers in the civil war.
they also felt it was wrong to let african americans vote in the south but not in the north.
in addition republicans knew that if african americans could vote in the north they would help republicans win elections there.
the fifteenth amendment was ratified in 1870.
at last all african american men over age 21 had the right to vote.
the fifteenth amendment was a difficult amendment to enforce.
the south soon found ways around it as you will read.

the state governments created during radical reconstruction were different from any governments the south had known before.
the old leaders had lost much of their influence.
three groups stepped in to replace them.
reconstruction and southern society new political groups in the south white southern republicans one group to emerge consisted of white southerners who supported the new republican governments.
many were businesspeople who had opposed secession in 1860.
they wanted to forget the war and get on with rebuilding the south.
many whites in the south felt that any southerner who helped the republicans was a traitor.
they called the white southern republicans scalawags a word used for small scruffy horses.
northerners in the south northerners who came to the south after the war were another important force.
white southerners accused the new arrivals of hoping to get rich from the souths misery.
southerners jested that these northerners were in such a hurry to move south that they had time only to fling a few clothes into cheap suitcases or carpetbags.
as a result they became known as carpetbaggers.
in fact northerners went south for various reasons.
a few did hope to profit as the south was being rebuilt.
many more however were union soldiers who had grown to love the souths rich land.
others both white and black were teachers ministers and reformers who sincerely wanted to help the freedmen african americans african americans were the third major new group in southern politics.
before the war they had no voice in southern government.
during reconstruction they not only voted in large numbers but they also ran for and were elected to public office in the south.

they wanted the south to change as little as possible.
conservatives were willing to let african americans vote and hold a few offices.
still they were determined that real power would remain in the hands of whites.
this tension caused social problems in the south during reconstruction that impacted free african americans and conservatives.

between 1865 and 1879 the south laid 7 000 miles of railroad track.
however political problems due to controversial government policies and political corruption impacted southerners and hindered progress.
taxation without representation rebuilding cost money.
before the war southerners paid low taxes.
reconstruction governments raised taxes sharply.
this created discontent among many southern whites.
many former confederate officers and officials were denied voting rights during reconstruction and thus were being taxed without representation.
the tax increases also caused some landowners to lose their land.
corruption plagues reconstruction southerners were further angered by widespread corruption in the reconstruction governments.
one state legislature for example voted 1 000 to cover a members bet on a horse race.
other items billed to the state included hams perfume and a coffin.
corruption was not limited to the south.
after the civil war dishonesty plagued northern governments as well.
most southern officeholders however served their states honestly.
attempts at legislative reform state legislative reform programs in the south met with mixed success.
new state constitutions allowed all adult men to vote removed restrictions for holding office and made public officials elected rather than appointed.
executive branches were also given increased power to provide government services.

0 summarize the problems that faced reconstruction governments trying to rebuild the south.
economic problems during reconstruction in the first months after the war freedmen left the plantations on which they had lived and worked.
they found few opportunities however.
limited opportunities for freedmen some radical republicans talked about giving each freedman 40 acres and a mule as a fresh start.
this idea stemmed from a field order given by general william tecumseh sherman in 1865.
thaddeus stevens suggested breaking up big plantations and distributing the land.
most americans opposed the plan however.
in the end former slaves received in the words of a freedman nothing but freedom through hard work or good luck some freedmen were able to become landowners.
most however had little choice but to return to where they had lived in slavery.
at the same time some large planters found themselves with land but nobody to work it.
economic problems confront the south before the civil war southern planters enjoyed prosperity because of strong demand for cotton tobacco and other farm products in the north and in britain.
during the war a union blockade had prevented the south from selling most of its products in those markets.
as a result prices for those products rose and suppliers in latin america india and other parts of the world began producing more tobacco cotton sugarcane and rice.
when the war ended and southern farmers returned to the market they faced much greater competition from foreign producers resulting in lower prices according to the laws of supply and demand.
meanwhile the war had destroyed many of the souths cities and factories.
southern planters had lost their enslaved workers who were often planters main investment.
the south had little money to invest in industry.
as a result it remained dependent on farming st a time when farming brought less income.
a visiting pastor joins an african american family for dinner in the south during reconstruction.
sharecropping was a system in which poor african americans and whites rented land from mostly white landowners in exchange for a portion of the harvest.
predict consequences what impact did sharecropping have on african americans economic status.
poverty in the south during reconstruction many freedmen and poor whites went to work on the large plantations.
these sharecroppers rented and farmed a plot of land.
planters provided seed fertilizer and interactive chart the reconstruction era 1865 1877 447 9 3 reconstruction and southern society tools in return for a share of the crop at harvest time.
to many freedmen sharecropping offered a measure of independence.
many hoped to own their own land one day.
in fact this arrangement had a damaging impact on these groups.
most sharecroppers and small landowners became locked in a cycle of poverty.
each spring they received supplies on credit.
in the fall they had to repay what they had borrowed.
as you have read southern farm products were worth less after the civil war.
if the harvest did not cover what they owed they sank deeper into debt.

these conservatives found new ways to keep african americans from exercising their rights.
many of these were laws that restricted the right to vote.

as a result poor freedmen could rarely afford to vote.

the reconstruction era 1865 1877 450 9 4 the aftermath of reconstruction states also imposed literacy tests that required voters to read and explain a section of the constitution.
since most freedmen had little education such tests kept them away from the polls.
election officials also applied different standards to black and white voters.
blacks who were able to read often had to answer much more difficult questions than whites on literacy tests.
still many poor whites could not pass the literacy test.
to increase the number of white voters states passed grandfather clauses.
these laws stated that if a voters father or grandfather had been eligible to vote on january 1 1867 the voter did not have to take a literacy test.
no african americans in the south could vote before 1868 so grandfather clauses ensured that white men could vote.
conservatives implement jim crow laws after 1877 segregation or legal separation of races became the law of the south.
jim crow laws as they were known separated blacks and whites in schools restaurants theaters trains streetcars playgrounds hospitals and even cemeteries.
louisiana novelist george washington cable described segregation as a system of oppression so rank that nothing could make it seem small except the fact that african americans had already been ground under it for a century and a half gcoige washington cabin the lb eedmans case in e uit y african americans brought lawsuits to challenge segregation.
in 1896 in the case of plessy v ferguson the supreme court ruled that segregation was legal so long as facilities for blacks and whites were equal.
in fact facilities were rarely equal.
for example southern states spent much less on schools for blacks than for whites.
despite such setbacks the constitution now recognized african americans as citizens.
laws passed during reconstruction especially the fourteenth amendment would become the basis of the civil rights movement almost 100 years later.

western agriculture el interactive flipped video a cattle kingdom on the plains before this time the spanish and then the mexicans had set up cattle ranches in the southwest.
over the years strays from these ranches along with american breeds grew into large herds of wild cattle.
these wild cattle were known as longhorns.
they roamed freely across the grassy plains of texas.
after the civil war the demand for beef increased.
people in the towing cities in the east were eating more meat.
miners railroad crews farmers and growing communities in the west added to the demand.
the texas longhorns were perfect for the commercial market.
they could travel far on little water and they required no winter feeding.
in response texas ranchers began rounding up herds of longhorns.
they drove the animals hundreds of miles north to railroad lines in kansas and missouri on trips called cattle drives.
jesse chisholm blazed one of the most famous cattle trails.
jhisholm was half scottish and half cherokee.

they kept the cattle moving and rounded up strays.
after the civil war veterans of the confederate army made up the majority of the cowhands who worked in texas.
however it is estimated that nearly one in three cowhands was either mexican american or african american.
some cowhands dreamed of setting aside enough money to start a herd of their own.
most in the end just worked to earn wages.
spanish influences american cowhands learned much about riding roping and branding from spanish and mexican vaqueros vah kehr ohs.
vaqueros were skilled riders who herded cattle on ranches in mexico california and the southwest.
the gear used by american cowhands was modeled on the tools of the vaquero.
cowhands used the leather lariat to catch cattle and horses.
lariat comes from the spanish word for rope.

the physical environment shaped a cowhands work a cattle drive was hot dirty tiring and often boring work.
a cowboys days could last for nearly 18 hours.
the work was so strenuous that cowhands usually brought a number of horses so that each day a fresh one would be available.
cowhands worked in all kinds of weather and faced many dangers including prairie dog holes rattlesnakes and fierce thunderstorms.
they had to prevent nervous cattle from drowning while crossing fast flowing rivers.
they had to fight raging grass fires.
they also faced attacks from cattle thieves who roamed the countryside.
one of the cowhands worst fears on a cattle drive was a stampede.
a clap of thunder or a gunshot could set thousands of longhorns off at a run.
cowhands had to avoid the crush of hoofs and horns while attempting to turn the stampeding herd in a wide circle.
most cowhands did not work for themselves.
instead they were hired hands for the owners of large ranches.

as more cattle were driven through these areas businesses offering services to the cowhands began to form in towns.
as a result cattle drives ended in cow towns that had sprung up along the railroad lines.
the chisholm trail for example ended in abilene kansas.
other cow towns in kansas were wichita caldwell and dodge city.
in cow towns cattle were held in great pens until they could be loaded into railroad cars and shipped to markets in the east.

the spread of farming in the 1870s ranching spread north from texas and across the grassy plains.
soon cattle grazed from kansas to present day montana.
ranchers had built a cattle kingdom in the west.
they came to expect high profits.
millions of dollars poured into the west from people in the east and in foreign countries who wanted to earn money from the cattle boom.
however the boom did not last.
conflicts over land ranchers let their cattle run wild on the open range.

to protect the range which they saw as their own ranchers sometimes attacked sheepherders and their flocks.
new settlements encroach on cattle land in the 1870s farmers began moving onto the range.
they fenced their fields with barbed wire which kept cattle and sheep from pushing over fences and trampling plowed fields.
as more farmers bought land the open range began to disappear.
large grants of land to the railroads also limited it.
as a result a more organized system began to develop in which ranchers bought and maintained private property.
this protection of property rights further boosted settlement in the west.
nature however imposed limits on the cattle boom.
after a time there just was not enough grass to feed all the cattle that lived on the plains.
the need to buy feed and land pushed up the costs.
diseases such as texas fever sometimes destroyed entire herds.
then the bitterly cold winters of 1886 and 1887 killed entire herds of cattle.
in the summer severe heat and drought dried up water holes and scorched the grasslands.
cattle owners began to buy land and fence it in.

effects of the homestead act congress passed the homestead act in 1862.
it was the centerpiece of the governments land policy.
the law promised 160 acres of free land to anyone who was head of a household who had not fought for the confederacy and who paid a small filing fee and improved the land over five years.
the environment impacts western settlement the main effect of the homestead act was a stream of immigrants and easterners took up the offer of free land.
many planted their 160 acres with wheat and corn.
by 1900 half a million americans had set up farms under the homestead act.
under the homestead act the land was free but setting up a farm required money and hard work.
many people did not have the in exchange for farming the land for five years this pioneer family gained ownership of their homestead in cluster county nebraska.
summarize what were settlers required to do in exchange for the free land on which they settled.
money to move west and start a farm.
also only about 20 percent of the homestead land went directly to small farmers.
land owning companies took large areas of land illegally and resold it to farmers at a high price.
as a result many settlers struggled to make ends meet.
african americans settle in kansas african americans joined the rush for land in the west.
some were able to take advantage of the homestead act.
the largest group of black settlers moved west at the end of reconstruction when the freedoms african americans had gained after the civil war were slipping away.
in 1879 a group of african americans moved to kansas.
they called themselves exodusters after exodus the book of the bible that tells about the jews escaping from slavery in egypt.
the exodusters paid for their land rather than claim it under the homestead act.
between 40 000 and 70 000 african americans had moved to kansas by 1881 though only some of these were exodusters.
settlement patterns of anglos and mexicanos easterners who moved to the southwest found a large established spanish speaking population there.
as you recall the united states had gained much of the southwest through the mexican war.
many of its inhabitants were people of spanish or mexican origin who lived in the region before it became part of the united states.
spanish speaking southwesterners called themselves mexicanos.
white americans who lived in the region were known as anglos.
most mexicanos lived in small villages where they farmed and raised sheep.
a few wealthy mexicanos were large landowners and merchants.
as more anglos settled in the southwest they acquired the best jobs and land.
often mexicanos found themselves working as low paid laborers on anglo farms.
in new mexico in the 1880s angry farmers known as las gorras blancas or white caps demanded fair treatment.
other mexicanos in arizona founded the hispanic american alliance in 1894 to protect and fight for their rights.
settlements on oklahoma farmland as settlers spread across the west free land began to disappear.
the last major land rush took place in oklahoma.
several native american nations lived there but the government forced them to sell their land.
the government then announced that farmers could claim free homesteads in oklahoma.
they could not stake their claims however until noon on april 22 1889.
on the appointed day as many as 100 000 land seekers lined up at the oklahoma border.
at noon the reconstruction era 1865 1877 456 9 5 western agriculture a gunshot rang out.
the boomers charged into oklahoma but they found that others were already there.
sooners had sneaked into oklahoma before the official opening and had staked out much of the best land.
the physical characteristics of the oklahoma environment meant that farmers needed good land in order to succeed.
those who settled on fertile farmland had better chances than those who ended up with less fertile land.
analyze information who worked to get around the rules of the homestead act in order to profit from the land and how did they profit.
effects of the morrill acts agriculture was becoming more of a business as farmers increasingly grew food for the market at the same time as industry was growing.
to train professionals for both agriculture and industry there was a growing call for publicly supported agricultural and mechanical colleges.
the morrill land grant colleges act of 1862 put forth during the civil war by justin smith morrill of vermont offered states a federal land grant to build schools that would teach and promote scientific farming and engineering.
states received 30 000 acres of public land per congressional representative a policy that gave more land to more populous states.
colleges founded on this land had to teach science classics agriculture mechanics and military tactics.
in 1890 a second morrill act was passed to extend the benefits of land grant funding to african american students.
it required states either to admit students of all races to their land grant colleges or to set up separate land grant colleges for african americans.
upholding segregation the south created separate colleges for african american and white students.
many of these agricultural colleges grew into historically black colleges and universities serving african americans in the south.
both of the morrill acts had important effects on the country.
private colleges were expensive.
the new public schools were more affordable.
they made college more available to americans and affirmed that the government would play a role in supporting higher education.
private colleges also did not teach the practical skills that many americans needed to find jobs.
land jrant colleges emphasized the training and skills needed in an agricultural and industrial society.
the first land grant college to open was the university of farmers like these in the oklahoma territory needed schooling and training.
the morrill acts created colleges to support a scientific approach to agriculture.

large universities also formed in the west and midwest.
b draw conclusions why were the morrill acts important for the average american student.
life on the plains farmers on the western plains faced many hardships.
the first problem was shelter.
because wood was scarce on the great plains many farmers built houses of sod soil held together by grass roots.
rain was a serious problem for sod houses.
one pioneer woman complained that her sod roof leaked two days before a rain and for three days after sodbusting the fertile soil of the great plains was covered with a layer of thick sod that could crack wood or iron plows.
a new sodbusting plow made of steel reached the market by 1877.
it enabled sodbusters as plains farmers were called to cut through the sod to the soil below.
technology helped farmers in other ways.
on the great plains water often lay hundreds of feet underground.
farmers built windmills to pump the settlers built the roofs of sod houses using grass roots.
predict consequences how would rain affect people living in sod houses.

new reapers threshing machines and binders helped farmers to harvest crops.
environmental challenges the dry climate was a constant threat.
when too little rain fell the crops shriveled and died.
dry weather also brought the threat of fire.
a grass fire traveled as fast as a horse could run the summers often brought swarms of grasshoppers that ate everything in their path crops food tree bark even clothing.
pioneers dreaded the winters most.
with few trees or hills to block the wind icy gusts built huge snowdrifts.
the deep snow buried farm animals and trapped families inside their homes.
womens roles on the plains women had to be strong to survive the hardships of life on the great plains.
since there were few stores women made clothing soap candles and other goods by hand.
they also cooked and preserved food needed for the long winter.
women served their communities in many ways.
most schoolteachers were women.
when there were no doctors nearby women treated the sick and injured.
pioneer families usually lived miles apart.
they relaxed by visiting with neighbors and gathering for church services.
picnics dances and weddings were eagerly awaited events.
dependence on the physical environment homesteaders depended on the environment for their livelihood.
they needed the right amounts of water sunlight rain and soil for their crops.
this made homesteading risky there were many difficult harvests and lean years.
it also meant that homesteaders put a great deal of care into the land.
those who owned their farms worked hard to keep the land productive.
they wanted to ensure that their property would continue to supply the resources they needed to survive.
reliance on the land and distance from more populous eastern cities meant that homesteaders were extremely self sufficient.
they used resources from the environment to meet their needs.
if something was broken they fixed it themselves.
economic challenges despite the harsh conditions farmers began to thrive in the west.
before long they were selling huge amounts of wheat and corn in the nations growing cities and even in europe.
then farmers faced an unexpected problem.
the more they harvested the less they earned.
in 1881 a bushel of wheat sold for 1 19.
by 1894 the price had plunged to 49 cents.

farming and the economy as early as the 1860s farmers began to work together.
they learned that they could improve their condition through economic cooperation and political action.
the national grange supports cooperation in 1867 farmers formed the national grange.
grangers wanted to boost farm profits and reduce the rates that railroads charged for shipping grain.
grangers helped farmers set up cooperatives.
in a cooperative a group of farmers pooled their money to buy seeds and tools wholesale.
wholesale means buying or selling something in large quantities at lower prices.
grangers built cooperative warehouses so that fanners could store grain cheaply while waiting for tetter selling prices.
leaders of the grange urged farmers to use their vote.
in 1873 western and southern grangers pledged to vote only for candidates who supported their aims.
they elected officials who understood the farmers problems.
as a result several states passed laws limiting what could be charged for grain shipment and storage.
nevertheless crop prices continued to drop.
farmers sank deeper into debt.
the farmers alliance spreads another group the farmers alliance joined the struggle in the 1870s.
like the grange the alliance set up cooperatives and warehouses.
the farmers alliance spread from texas through the south and into the plains states.
alliance leaders also tried to join with factory workers and miners who were angry about their treatment by employers.

jfc elps the reconstruction era 1865 1877 459 9 5 western agriculture analyze political cartoons what does the object on which william mckinley is standing in this image suggest about his political views in the election of 1896.
the rise of the peoples party in the west in 1892 farmers and labor unions joined together to form the peoples party also known as the populists.
at their first national convention the populists demanded that the government help to raise farm prices and to regulate railroad rates.
they also called for an income tax an eight hour workday and limits on immigration.
the key populist party demand was free silver populists wanted all silver mined in the west to be coined into money.
they said that farm prices dropped because there was not enough money in circulation.
free silver would increase the money supply and make it easier for farmers to repay their debts.
eastern bankers and factory owners opposed this.
they argued that increasing the money supply would cause inflation or increased prices.
business people feared that inflation would wreck the economy.
they favored the gold standard with which the government backs every dollar with a certain amount of gold.
since the supply of gold is limited there would be less money in circulation.
prices would drop.
bryan versus mckinley the populist candidate for president in 1892 won one million votes.
the next year a severe depression brought the populists new support.
in 1894 they elected six senators and seven representatives to congress.
the populists looked toward the election of 1896 with high hopes.
their program had been endorsed by one of the great orators of the age democrat william jennings bryan.
a young democratic congressman from nebraska bryan was called the great commoner because he championed the cause of common people.
like the populists he believed that the nation needed to increase the supply of money.
at the democratic convention in 1896 bryan made a powerful speech against the rich and for free silver.
at the end of his speech referring to the rich bryan proclaimed you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold both democrats and populists supported bryan for president.
however bankers and business people feared that bryan would ruin the economy.
they supported william mckinley the republican candidate.
mckinley and the republican party called for keeping the dollar tied to the gold standard.
bryan narrowly lost the election of 1896.
he carried the south and the west but mckinley won the heavily populated states of the north and east.
the populist movement ends with the election of 1896 the peoples party broke up after 1896.
one reason was that with bryan as a candidate the democrats adopted several populist causes.
also prosperity returned in the late 1890s.
people worried less about railroad rates and the gold standard.

at one time most plains indians were farmers who lived in semipermanent villages.
from there they sent out hunting parties that pursued on foot herds of buffalo and other animals.
agriculture however was their main source of food.
the introduction of horses proved useful during the 1600s the plains indians way of life changed as they learned about horses from neighboring tribes.
christopher columbus had brought horses to the americas in the late 1400s and the spanish brought them to the north american mainland in the 1500s.

life on the plains the buffalo served as a living grocery store for plains indians.
after acquiring horses they followed the huge buffalo herds that had roamed their homeland for centuries.
plains indians began to live in tepees tee pees or tents made by stretching buffalo skins on tall poles.
the tepees could easily be carried on a travois truh vol a sled pulled by a dog or a horse.
the migration of the plains indians mirrored the movement of the buffalo.
in winter small groups of buffalo moved to protected valleys and forests.
in summer huge buffalo herds gathered on the plains where the grass was plentiful.
in the same way plains indians spent the winter in small bands and gathered in large groups during the summers.
plains indians developed a culture based on following and hunting buffalo.
the introduction of the horse made this possible.
hunting the buffalo there were different ways to hunt buffalo.
before horses came to the plains a group of hunters would shout and wave colored robes at the buffalo.
the hunters would gradually drive a herd of buffalo into a corral or enclosure.
there they killed the trapped buffalo.
when the hunt was over the women and children joined the hunters in cutting up the buffalo and taking it back to camp.
once they had horses hunters would ride the horses right into the herd and kill the buffalo with bows and arrows.
the buffalo sustained a way of life although the plains indians also hunted deer and elk they depended on the buffalo for food clothing and shelter.
buffalo meat rich in protein was a main item of the plains indians diet.
women cut up and dried the meat on racks.
the dried meat was called jerky.
women also tanned buffalo hides to make sleeping robes and tepee covers.
they wove buffalo fur into coarse warm cloth.
the cloth was used as an outer covering for a tepee.
councils and ceremonies many native american groups met on the plains.
they hunted together and attended special events.
summer gatherings were the time for councils.
at the councils the elders were consulted about the problems that affected an entire plains indian nation.
the most important religious ceremony was the sun dance.

broken promises before europeans and americans began to settle on the plains the plains indians often fought with one another over territory or other resources.
but as american settlers began to encroach on plains indians lands their attention turned toward this new threat.
conflict on the plains began as early as the 1840s when settlers and miners began to cross plains indian hunting grounds.
the settlers and miners asked for government protection from the native americans.
a treaty quickly forgotten the u s government built a string of forts to protect settlers and miners.
in 1851 federal government officials met with plains indian nations near fort laramie in wyoming.
the officials asked each nation to keep to a limited area.
in return they promised money domestic animals agricultural tools and other goods.
officials told the native americans that the lands that were reserved for them would be theirs forever.
native american leaders agreed to the terms of the fort laramie treaty.
however in 1858 gold was discovered at pikes peak in colorado.
a wave of miners rushed to land that the government had promised to the cheyenne and arapaho peoples.

when chivington attacked the native americans raised both a white flag of surrender and the flag of the united states.
chivington had thought the native americans were hostile.
he either ignored or did not see the flags.
he ordered his men to destroy the village and take no prisoners.
in what would become the sand creek massacre the militia slaughtered more than 150 men women and children.
after the massacre soldiers said they found scalps of whites in the camp indicating that there had been some hostile native americans there.
a congressional committee that investigated the massacre condemned chivingtons actions but chivington had already left the army.

they attacked white settlers and u s troops.
u s troops responded by attacking indians.
changing traditional ways of life in 1867 federal officials established a peace commission to end the wars on the plains so that settlers would be safe.
the commission urged native americans to settle down and live as white farmers did.
it also urged them to send their children to white schools to learn american ways.
agreeing to resettle in 1867 the kiowas comanches and other southern plains indians signed a new treaty with the government.
they promised to move to indian territory in present day oklahoma.
the soil there was poor.
also most plains indians were hunters not farmers.
the native americans did not like the treaty but knew they had no choice.
the lakotas and arapahos of the northern plains also signed a second fort laramie treaty in 1868.
they agreed to live on reservations in present day south dakota.
a reservation is a limited area set aside for native americans.
buffalo populations fall dramatically the plains indians suffered from lost battles and broken treaties.
even worse for them however was the destruction of the buffalo.
the decline of the buffalo began before the arrival of white settlers.
herds of buffalo lived in areas west of the mississippi and east of the rockies.
however with disease drought and destruction of the areas in which they lived the herds were slowly growing smaller.
as the market demand for buffalo robes increased during the 1830s and 1840s professional buffalo hunters killed more buffalo.

the native american victory at the little bighorn was short lived.
the army soon defeated the lakotas and cheyennes.
then congress ordered that no food rations be distributed to the native americans until they agreed to the governments demands.
to avoid starvation the lakotas gave up most claims to the black hills and other territory.
in this way they surrendered about one third of the lands that the united states government had guaranteed them with the fort laramie treaty of 1868.

remembering a lost way of life many native americans longed for their lost way of life.
on the reservations the lakotas and other plains indians turned to a religious ceremony called the ghost dance.
it celebrated the time when native americans lived freely on the plains.
the ghost dance in 1889 word spread that a prophet named wovoka woh voh kuh had appeared among the paiute people of the southern plains.
wovoka said that the great spirit would make a new world for his people free from whites and filled with plenty.
to bring about this new world all the native americans had to do was dance to the ghost dance.

the dawes act calls for reform led congress to pass the dawes act in 1887.
the act encouraged native americans to become farmers.
some reservations were divided up and given to individual native american families.
the dawes act was a major change in the governments policy toward native americans.
before the act native americans had been removed from their land and placed on reservations.
there they were poorly provided for by the government.
with the dawes act the government hoped that native americans would adopt white ways and become farmers.
the dawes act did not have the desired effect however.
to native americans land was an open space for riding and hunting.
moreover much of the land they were given was not suitable for farming.

from then on comstock boasted about his mine.
the strike became known as the comstock lode.
a lode is a rich vein of gold or silver.
comstock and his partners often complained about the heavy blue sand that was mixed in with the gold.
it clogged the devices used for separating out the gold and made the gold hard to reach.
when mexican miners took the danged blue stuff to an expert in california tests showed that it was loaded with silver.
comstock had stumbled onto one of the richest silver mines in the world.
miners moved into many other areas of the west.
some found valuable ore in montana and idaho.
others struck it rich in colorado.
in the 1870s miners discovered gold in the black hills of south dakota.
in the late 1890s thousands rushed north to alaska after major gold strikes were made there.

468 boomtowns and ghost towns gold and silver strikes attracted thousands of prospectors.
towns sprang up almost overnight near all the major mining sites.
first miners built a tent city near the diggings.
then people came to supply the miners needs.
traders brought mule teams loaded with tools food and clothing.
merchants hauled in wagon loads of supplies and set up stores.
soon wood frame houses hotels restaurants and stores replaced the tents.
for example it took less than a year for the mining camp at the comstock lode to become the boomtown of virginia city nevada.
most settlers in the boomtowns of the mining frontier were men.
however enterprising women also found ways to profit.
some women ran boardinghouses and laundries.
others opened restaurants where miners gladly paid high prices for home cooked meals.
many boomtowns lasted for only a few years.
when the gold or silver ore was gone the miners moved away.
without the miners for customers businesses often had to close.
in this way a boomtown could quickly go bust and turn into a ghost town.
still some boomtowns survived and prospered even after the mines shut down.
in these towns miners stayed and found new ways to make a living.
the comstock lode mine in nevada was originally a gold mine.
then during the mid 1800s prospectors discovered a large deposit of silver there as well which fueled a silver rush to the west.
identify main ideas why did boomtowns spring up throughout the west.
the costs of mining the surge of miners in the west created problems as did the arrival of cattle ranchers and homesteaders.
mines and towns polluted clear mountain streams.
miners cut down forests to get wood for buildings.
they also forced native americans from the land.
foreign miners were often treated unfairly.
in many camps mobs drove mexicans from their claims.
chinese miners were heavily taxed or forced to work claims abandoned by others.
few miners ever got rich.
much of the gold and silver lay deep underground.
it could be reached only with costly machinery.
eventually most mining in the west was taken over by large companies that could afford to buy this equipment.
furthermore independent prospectors like henry comstock largely disappeared.
they were replaced by paid laborers who worked for toe large companies.
keeping the law in small towns lawlessness disorder often accompanied the rapid growth to a town.
stories have exaggerated the number of virginia city nevada became a boomtown due to nining activities from the comstock lode.

interactive gallery the reconstruction era 1865 1877 469 9 7 mining railroads and the economy fights and killings that took place in these towns but some towns actually were violent places.
in response miners sometimes resorted to organizing groups of vigilantes or self appointed law enforcers.
vigilantes tracked down outlaws and punished them usually without trials.
a common punishment was lynching.
occasionally vigilante groups did not form to fight crime.
at least one san francisco group organized to take political control of the city.
informal methods of governing gradually gave way to more formal arrangements.
in 1861 colorado dakota and nevada were organized into territories.
idaho and arizona followed in 1863 and montana in 1864.
the process of permanent settlement and government had begun.
h recall how did informal methods of governance gradually become more formal.
the railroad encourages economic growth to many native americans the railroad was a terrifying monster an iron horse belching black smoke and moving at stunning speeds.
however for the people of prospectors shown here with their equipment prepare to head out for the gold and silver fields in hopes of striking it rich.
mining towns railroads meant supplies new townsfolk and a rapid means of transporting their gold and silver.
the west needed a transportation system that could carry heavy loads over great distances at a cost low enough to guarantee a profit.
it is no wonder then that railroad companies raced to lay track to the mines and boomtowns.
in time the technological innovations that made the expansion of railroads possible opened the west and fostered economic growth for the nation.
the transcontinental railroad in 1863 two companies began a race to build the first transcontinental railroad.
a transcontinental railroad is one that stretches across a continent from coast to coast.
the union pacific railroad started building a rail line westward from omaha nebraska.
the central pacific railroad began in sacramento california and built eastward.
a local paper reported with rites appropriate to the occasion.
ground was formally broken at noon for the commencement of the central pacific railroad the california link of the continental chain that is to unite american communities now divided by thousands of miles of trackless wilderness sacramento union january 8 1863 the federal government helped the railroad companies because it felt that rail lines in the west would benefit the entire nation.
the government s aid came in the form of subsidies.
a subsidy is financial aid or a land grant from the government.
congress lent money to the railroad companies and gave them land.
for every mile of track completed the railroad companies received twenty sections of land in the states along the route and forty sections per mile in the territories.
by the time the central pacific and union pacific railroads were completed they had received about 45 million acres of land.
often both business and government ignored the fact that native americans lived on the land.
building the transcontinental railroad both companies had trouble getting workers.
labor was scarce during the civil war.
also the work was backbreaking and dangerous and the pay was low.
the railroad companies hired immigrant workers who accepted low wages.
the central pacific brought in thousands of workers from china.

pacific ocean hired newcomers from ireland.
african americans and mexican americans also worked for each line.
the railroad workers faced a daunting task.
the central pacific had to carve a path across the rugged sierra nevada.
the union pacific had to cut through the towering rocky mountains.
snowstorms and avalanches killed workers and slowed progress.
at times crews cutting tunnels through rock advanced only a few inches a day.
building the railroad forced workers to adapt to or modify environments as varied as forests deserts and mountains.
in some places the railroad was built around mountains.
in other places however workers blasted tunnels through mountains with technological innovations such as specialized tools and explosives to achieve their goals.
railroads encourage urban and rural growth the central pacific and union pacific met at promontory utah on may 10 1869.
leland stanford president of the central pacific dropped a solid gold spike into a pm drilled hole in the rail.
in doing so he joined the two tracks and united the country.
the nations first transcontinental railroad was complete.
with the civil war fresh in their minds people cheered this new symbol of unity.
the words that were engraved on the golden spike expressed their feelings may god continue the unity of our country as the railroad unites the two great oceans of the world engraved on the golden spike before long other major rail lines linked the west and the east.
the railroads brought economic growth and new settlement all across the west.
they enabled people supplies and mail to move quickly and cheaply across the plains and mountains.
wherever rail lines went settlements railroad towns sprang up along the tracks.
the largest towns and cities developed where major railroad lines met.
cities where sea and land transportation met such as seattle san francisco and los angeles experienced huge population growth with the coming of the railroads.
western cities such as denver cheyenne and wichita grew when railroads were joined to the great cattle trails.
thus the railroad the most advanced transportation system of its day had a major impact on the urbanization of the united states.
because of their rapid growth western territories began to apply for statehood.
nevada became a state in 1864 colorado in 1876 north dakota south the reconstruction era 1865 1877 471 9 7 mining railroads and the economy dakota montana and washington in 1889 idaho and wyoming in 1890.

building a national network of rails the civil war showed the importance of railroads.
railroads carried troops and supplies to the battlefields.
they also moved raw materials to factories.
after the war railroad companies began to build new lines all over the country.
a race to construct new lines railroad builders raced to create thousands of miles of new tracks.
in the years after completion of the first transcontinental rail line in 1869 americans built three more.
james hill a canadian born owner finished the last major cross workers constructed what would become part of the great northern railway in the 1880s.
during this time use of a standard line gauge helped link railroad lines.
interactive map country line in 1893.
his great northern railway wound from duluth minnesota to everett washington.
unlike other rail lines the great northern was built without financial aid from congress.
to make his railroad succeed hill had to turn a profit from the start.
he encouraged farmers and ranchers to move to the northwest and settle near his railroad.
he gave seed to farmers and helped them buy equipment.
he imported special bulls in order to breed hardier cattle.
not only was hills policy generous it also made good business sense.
in the end hills railroad proved very successful even without government assistance and it was a key to the development of the northwest.
a national transportation system early railroads were short lines that served local communities.
many lines ran for no more than 50 miles.
when passengers and freight reached the end of one line they had to move to a train on a different line to continue their journey.
even if the lines had been connected the problem would not have been eliminated.
different lines used tracks of different gauges or widths.
as a result the trains from one line could not run on the tracks of another line.
in general the tracks of northern lines used different gauges from those of southern lines.
in 1886 railroads in the south decided to adopt the northern gauge.
on may 30 southern railroads stopped running so that work could begin.
using crowbars and sledgehammers crews worked from dawn to dusk to move the rails a few inches farther apart.
when they had finished some 13 000 miles of track had been changed.
once the track was standardized american railroads formed a network or system of connected lines.
the creation of a rail network brought benefits to shippers.
often rail companies arranged for freight cars on one line to use the tracks of another.
for example goods loaded in chicago could stay on the same car all the way to new york instead of being transferred from one car to another.
as a result the shipper had to pay only one fare for the whole distance.
new rails knit the sprawling nation together.
by 1900 there were more miles of tracks in the united states than in europe and russia combined.
westinghouse brakes and pullman cars new inventions helped make railway travel safer and faster.
on early trains each railroad car had its own brakes and its own brake operator.
if different cars stopped at different times serious accidents could result.
in 1869 george westinghouse began selling his new air brake.
westinghouses air brake allowed a locomotive engineer to stop all the the reconstruction era 1865 1877 472 9 7 mining railroads and the economy railroad cars at once.
the air brake increased safety and allowed for longer faster trains.
long distance travel also became more comfortable.
in 1864 george pullman designed a railroad sleeping car.
pullman cars had convertible berths for sleeping as well as lavatories.
rail lines also added dining cars.
porters who carried baggage conductors and waiters attended to the needs of passengers.
the railroads and economic growth the growth of the railroads in the 1800s shows the benefits of the u s free enterprise system.
as william vanderbilt pointed out the railroads are built for men who invest their money that is the railroads were built to make money for the people who invested in them.
yet the railroads benefited many other people the workers who laid the tracks the employees who ran the trains the passengers who rode the rails and the businesses that filled cars with cargo.
people who lived in the towns that sprouted up along the rail lines also benefited.
ultimately the railroads benefited the country as a whole.
the expansion of the railroads brought significant changes in ways of producing distributing and consuming goods.
businesses brought raw materials on railroads to factories.
finished goods from those factories could be shipped far and wide for a reasonable price.
consumers especially those far from cities could now have access to more goods than ever before.
the same held true for farm goods farmers had wider markets and consumers had more food choices.
consolidation brings efficiency as railroads grew they looked for ways to operate more efficiently.
small lines were often costly to run so many companies began to consolidate or combine.
larger companies bought up smaller ones or forced them out of business.
the pennsylvania railroad for example consolidated 73 companies into its system.
tough minded business people led the drive for consolidation.
cornelius vanderbilt was among the most powerful of these leaders.
the son of a poor farmer vanderbilt earned one fortune in steamship lines.
he then began to buy up railroad lines in new york state.
vanderbilt sometimes used ruthless tactics to force smaller owners to sell to him.
in the early 1860s he decided to buy the new york central railroad.
the owners refused to sell.
vanderbilt then announced that new york central passengers would not be allowed to transfer to his trains.
with their passengers stranded and business dropping sharply the new york central owners gave in and sold their line to vanderbilt.
vanderbilt then bought up most of the lines between chicago and buffalo.
by the time of his death in 1877 after making a fortune in the steamship business cornelius vanderbilt turned his attention to railroads.
he bought up most of the rail lines between buffalo new york and chicago illinois.
his companies controlled 4 500 miles of track and linked new york city to the great lakes region.
other consolidations were soon underway.
before long the major railroads of the united states were organized into a number of systems directed by a handful of wealthy and powerful men.
b identify supporting details what was significant about the way in which the great northern line was financed.
railroads and competition with builders rushing to share in the profits of the railroad boom overbuilding occurred.
soon there were too many rail lines in some parts of the country.
between atlanta and st louis for example 20 different lines competed for business.
there was not nearly enough rail traffic to keep all these lines busy.
owners look for new ways to make profits especially in the west there were too few people and therefore not enough paying customers for the railroads to make a profit.
competition was fierce.
rate wars broke out as rival railroads slashed their fares to the reconstruction era 1865 1877 473 9 7 mining railroads and the economy win customers.
usually all the companies lost money as a result.
often railroads were forced to grant secret rebates or discounts to their biggest customers.
the railroads preferred big customers for two reasons.
first big customers were more likely to pay their bills and keep being customers in the future.
second it was less expensive to deal with a few big customers than many small customers.
fewer customers meant less paperwork and simpler loading and unloading.
unfortunately the practice of giving rebates hurt small shippers such as farmers who still had to pay the full price.
it even drove many small companies out of business.
railroad owners soon realized that cutthroat competition was hurting even their large lines.
they looked for ways to end the competition.
one method was pooling.
in a pool several railroad companies agreed to divide up the business in an area.
they then fixed their prices at a high level.
farmers react to high railroad prices railroad rebates and pools angered small farmers in the south and the west.
both practices kept shipping prices high for them.
indeed rates were so high that at times this cartoon shows congressmen looking like train engines.
analyze political cartoons what does this image suggest about the influence of the railroad industry in congress.
farmers burned their crops for fuel rather than ship them to market.
many farmers joined the populist movement.
populists called for government regulation of rail rates.
some populists even called for a government takeover of the railroads.
congress and several states passed laws regulating railroad companies.
however the laws did not end abuses.
railroad owners sometimes bribed officials to keep the laws from being enforced.
the panic of 1893 in 1893 an economic panic hit the united states.
the economy went through a drastic downsizing.
about 15 000 businesses and 500 banks closed leaving many american workers unemployed.
the railroads were both a cause and a victim of the economic downturn.
overbuilding in the 1860s meant that many railroad companies finances were fragile they were barely making money.
in 1893 the philadelphia and reading railroad went bankrupt helping to start the panic.
many other leading railroads followed including the erie the northern pacific the union pacific the atchison topeka and santa fe.
industries like steel and a wide variety of businesses that had come to depend on the railroad were hurt as were businesses that depended on those businesses.
through a ripple effect the whole economy suffered.
the economy would not recover for about four years.
when it did it was the railroad that once again provided the transportation the economy needed.
fcl describe how did railroad owners try to make profits in a competitive business environment.
railroads build a nation although railroads caused certain problems they also made possible the rapid growth of industry after 1865.
building rail lines created thousands of jobs.
steelworkers turned millions of tons of iron into steel for tracks and engines.
lumberjacks cut down whole forests to supply wood for railroad ties.
miners sweated in dusty mine shafts digging coal to fuel railroad engines.
the railroad companies themselves employed thousands of workers.
they laid tracks built trestles across rivers carved tunnels through mountains and built countless railroad stations.
the large railroads also pioneered new ways of managing business.
rail companies created special departments for shipping and accounting and for servicing equipment.
expert managers headed each department while chains of command ensured that the organization ran smoothly.
other big businesses soon copied these management techniques.

political traditions from england as english citizens the colonists believed that they were entitled to the same rights as english citizens in britain.
many of these rights were contained in two important documents the magna carta and the english bill of rights.
the magna carta signed by king john in 1215 limited the power of the english monarch.
it protected the right of people to own private property and guaranteed the right to trial by jury.
the english bill of rights signed by king william and queen mary in 1688 was a written list of freedoms that the government promised to protect.

the enlightenment was a european intellectual movement.
enlightenment philosophers believed that all problems could be solved by human reason.

enlightenment philosophy affected religious beliefs in the colonies.
colonists who admired these ideas wanted a religion that was less emotional and more rational.
at the same time attendance at church services was in decline.
during the 1740s concern about these trends led to a religious movement called the great awakening.
evangelical preachers such as jonathan edwards and george whitefield toured the colonies promoting revivals where people felt a direct and transforming contact with an overwhelming holy spirit.
the great awakening led to the birth of new churches.

they cited the magna carta and the english bill of rights which blocked the king from levying taxes without the permission of parliament.
during the 1760s their problem was with parliament rather than with king george iii.
professing loyalty to the king the colonists hoped to be free from parliaments efforts to tax them.
they would pay taxes levied only by their own elected assemblies in the colonies.
pressuring parliament valuing the prosperity and protection of the empire the colonists did not immediately seek independence.
instead they wanted to remain part of the empire that for so long had produced so many benefits at so little cost to them.
they also wanted to enjoy the traditional rights of englishmen.
to pressure parliament colonists boycotted british goods.
local committees enforced this boycott which threatened the british economy.

colonists who refused to honor the boycotts or who spoke out in favor of the taxes were considered loyalists.
representing a large minority the loyalists preferred to pay the taxes and honor parliament and the king.
they also feared that the resistance would lead to a war that britain seemed certain to win.
h explain why did many american colonists oppose an increase in taxes.
the american revolution in 1774 leading colonists held a convention called the first continental congress.
delegates from 12 of the colonies all except georgia met in philadelphia to discuss what to do next.
the delegates sent a list of complaints to the british government.
the letter was ignored.
americans declare their independence in 1775 war began when british troops tried to seize arms and ammunition stored at concord massachusetts.
new englanders quickly organized an army which the continental congress adopted as the army for all the colonies.
that year the second continental congress assembled.
another letter of complaint was sent to the british government.
when this letter was also ignored congress decided to declare the colonies independence from britain.
a committee made up of benjamin franklin john adams roger sherman robert livingston and thomas jefferson was given the task of drafting an official declaration.
the declaration of independence was mainly written by thomas jefferson with help from adams and franklin.
after it was approved by the delegates at the continental congress the first person to sign the document was john hancock a wealthy merchant and leader of the patriots in massachusetts who later served nine terms as governor of the commonwealth of massachusetts.
other signers included the well known doctor benjamin rush of philadelphia who later served as treasurer of the u s mint.
the intent and meaning of the declaration the intent of the declaration of independence was to state that the 13 american colonies were now independent from britain and to give reasons why the patriots felt this step was necessary.
but it had more meaning than a statement of independence.
it expressed enlightenment ideas about the natural rights of people and the purposes of government.

we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
declaration of independence july 4 1776 jefferson made the argument that the purpose of the government is to secure these rights a position influenced by enlightenment thinkers.
he asserted that when a government fails to respect or protect the rights of its people the people have the right to replace that government with a new government of their own making.
the importance of the declaration of independence lay in both how it captured the ideals of the revolution inspiring the struggle and how it laid the groundwork for the creation of the united states constitution.
in addition revolutionary movements in other countries drew inspiration from the document and its enduring ideals.
the declaration went on to list the reasons why the colonists felt that they had no other choice but rebellion.
the colonists had not come to the decision to rebel lightly.
once they did they fought hard for victory.
patriot leaders during the war the british made many military mistakes because they underestimated the patriots who were highly motivated by their cause.
colonists of all kinds gave up their lives to fight for the cause of independence.
john peter muhlenberg a virginia minister gave up preaching to recruit and lead a troop of 300 men.
he proclaimed there is a time to pray and a time to fight and that time has now come another minister john witherspoon of new jersey was elected to the continental congress and was the only clergyman to sign the declaration of independence.
the patriots greatly benefited from the leadership of george washington who had gained valuable military experience during the french and indian war.
they also owed much to the resourcefulness of leaders such as jonathan trumbull sr who was a close friend and advisor to washington.
trumbull a former merchant was the colonial governor of connecticut.
he made a key contribution to the revolution s success by helping to organize the supply of food clothing shoes guns and ammunition for the continental army.
french assistance in 1776 the colonists sent a small delegation led by maryland planter charles carroll to seek the assistance of french canadians in the fight against the british.
carroll was the only catholic signer of the declaration of independence and was the last survivor of the 56 signers dying in 1832.
the mission failed but by 1778 the patriots began receiving military assistance from france itself.

each of the 13 new states wrote a constitution that created a republican government or a government in which officials are representatives elected by the people.

many of them guaranteed freedom of religion freedom of the press and the right to trial by jury.

13 all 13 states did not occur until march 1781 six months before the british surrender at yorktown that ended the war.
under the articles of confederation most power remained with the states.
the articles created a national government without a president or a judicial branch.
the legislative branch had only very limited powers.
congress could declare and conduct war.
it could also regulate trade with foreign countries and with indian nations.
but it could not raise troops or levy taxes and there was no way to enforce trade regulations.
the united states government could only collect money and muster an army with voluntary contributions from the states.
weaknesses of the articles under the articles the national government had no say over the rules of interstate commerce.
each state set its own trade policy.
most states tried to protect their industries and agriculture from competition by taxing goods imported from other states.
this practice discouraged trade among the states and led to competition that had the potential to become destructive.
the national debt was also a problem.
because the continental congress had borrowed money and issued paper currency during the revolutionary war the new government was deeply in debt.
however it had no way to raise the money to pay off this debt.
the states were all paying off their own war debts and were largely unwilling or unable to contribute money to the national government.
the national government also suffered from structural weaknesses.
there was no president.
each state no matter how large or small had a single vote in a unicameral or one house congress.
on the major issues including declaring war and making treaties two thirds of the states 9 out of 13 had to approve.
amending the articles was almost impossible because every single one of the states had to endorse any change.
managing the northwest territory despite its weaknesses under the articles of confederation the national government took up the task of fulfilling its duties as best it could.
the articles gave congress authority over the vast northwest territory which lay north of the ohio river and stretched west from pennsylvania to the mississippi river.
in 1785 and 1787 congress passed two laws to manage this land.
the first the land ordinance created a system for surveying and selling the land to settlers.
the second the northwest ordinance described how territories should be governed and how they could become full fledged states.

domestic troubles also began plaguing the young republic.
during the mid 1780s an economic depression reduced the prices paid to farmers for their produce.
unable to pay their debts farmers faced losing their crops livestock and even their homes.
in massachusetts matters worsened when the courts seized farms from farmers who did not pay taxes to the state or their loans.
in rural massachusetts in 1786 armed farmers led by daniel shays shut down the courts blocking foreclosures.
the state of massachusetts sent troops to suppress this revolt known as shays rebellion.
the rebellion highlighted the weaknesses of the national government set up by the articles of confederation.
b recall what were the main weaknesses of the articles of confederation.
the constitutional convention by 1787 many americans agreed that the articles of confederation were flawed.
in may 1787 the states sent delegates to a special convention in philadelphia to draft proposed amendments to the articles.
however once there the delegates decided not to revise the articles of confederation.
instead they agreed to undertake a complete restructuring of the national government.
the convention came to be known as the constitutional convention.
the convention would go on to produce a completely new much stronger plan of government.
that plan the united states constitution has endured to this day with relatively few significant changes.
two opposing plans while the delegates agreed that the articles of confederation were deeply flawed it was much harder for them to reach an agreement on the best solution.
the first proposal put forth was the virginia plan designed by james madison.
the virginia plan advocated a national union that was both strong and republican.
madison insisted that a large republic could be more stable than a small one because in a large republic the diverse interests would provide checks shays rebellion resulted in bloodshed when state militia attacked angry rioters led by daniel shays.

in addition to securing the power to tax and to regulate commerce this plan proposed major structural changes.
the nation would have a bicameral legislature a house of representatives and a senate.
in both houses the states with larger populations would have more members.
the virginia plan also featured a president to command the armed forces and to manage foreign relations.
william paterson offered a counterproposal called the new jersey plan.
this plan favored by the small states would give congress the power to regulate commerce and to tax while keeping the basic structure of the confederation.
the plan retained a unicameral legislature representing the states as equals no matter how large or small.
the states remained sovereign except for those few powers specifically granted to the national government.
under the new jersey plan the united states would stay a loose confederation of states rather than become a unified nation.
the great compromise the delegates worked throughout the hot philadelphia summer to resolve their differences.
roger sherman proposed what has come to be called the great compromise.

in a concession to the smaller states the senate would equally represent every state by allowing just two senators per state.
in keeping with the virginia plan the house of representatives in which representation was based on population granted more power to the larger states.
the slavery issue another major compromise appeased the southern states.
their delegates feared domination by the northern states which had a larger white population.
to reassure the south the delegates adopted the three fifths clause.
it counted each enslaved person as three fifths of a person to be added to a states free population which boosted the number of the souths seats in congress.

they wanted the united states to have a strong central government.
three leading federalists james madison alexander hamilton and john jay wrote a series of letters to newspapers in support of the constitution.
these letters collectively called the federalist papers explained why they believed the constitution was vital to the survival of the new nation.

they included some leading americans such as patrick henry and samuel adams.
the antifederalists objected to the constitution because they thought it gave the national government far too much power at the expense of the states.
they believed that the president had too much power that congress was too small and could not represent voters connecting with past learnings 16 0 2 founding a new nation and that a federal court system interfered with local courts.
a bill of rights leads to ratification one of the most powerful arguments of the antifederalists was that the proposed constitution lacked a bill of rights.
most of the states already had bills of rights protecting individual liberty.
the antifederalists were concerned that the federal government would become a threat to americans prized freedoms without a similar set of protections.
to help secure ratification the federalists promised to add a bill of rights once the new government was established.
by june 1788 the nine states required to ratify the constitution had voted to make it the law of the land with two other important states virginia and new york quickly following.
in 1789 congress approved the 10 constitutional amendments that became the federal bill of rights.
the states ratified these amendments in 1791.
importance of the bill of rights the bill of rights protects a wide range of personal freedoms including freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of the press and of assembly the right to bear arms as part of a well regulated militia and protections against arbitrary intrusions and arrests unfair trials and cruel and unusual punishments.

congress lifted the embargo in 1809.
the next president james madison was unable to end the problems with britain and in 1812 congress declared war.
some americans hoped for a quick victory and the capture of british canada.
during the two and a half years of war little progress was made by either side.
in 1815 both sides agreed to end the fighting and sign a peace treaty.

the age of jackson the rise of war hero general andrew jackson in the 1820s shifted the politics of the nation.
while the age of jacksonian democracy expanded the concept of democracy some policies of the jackson era resulted in long term political strife.
the end of an era the conclusion of the war of 1812 brought on a period of relative political unity in the united states.
some historians call this the era of good feeling however during the early 1820s internal differences among democratic republicans began emerging.
these differences resulted in a fourway presidential race in 1824.
jackson was the clear winner of the popular vote but in a four way race no candidate was able to win a majority of electoral votes.
therefore under the constitution the election was decided by the house of representatives.
fourth place finisher henry clay threw his support to john quincy adams who became president.
aided by his partys organization jackson triumphed over adams in 1828.
jacksons victory split the democratic party when democrats who opposed jackson founded a new political party known as the whigs.
the era of good feelings was at an end.
jacksonian democracy jackson rose to prominence at a time when national politics was becoming increasingly democratic.
more states chose presidential electors by popular vote rather than by state legislatures and many states abolished property requirements for voting.
participation in elections grew from less than 30 percent of white men in the early 1800s to almost 80 percent in 1840.
jacksonian democracy had serious limits.
most state constitutions took the vote away from free blacks even those with property.
native americans who were not citizens and women could not vote in any state.
the nullification crisis jackson was at the center of conflicts over economic policy that shaped the tone of american politics for decades.
the federal governments use of protective tariffs had long been a source of sectional debate.
the industrial north favored tariffs while the agrarian south opposed them.
connecting with past learnings 0 3 america in the early 1800s in 1828 congress adopted an especially high tariff which southerners called the tariff of abominations south carolina relying on the doctrine of nullification claimed that it could void or nullify unconstitutional laws within its borders.
jackson signed into law a new tariff that was not as harsh as the 1828 tariff but it was still unacceptable to many southerners.
the south carolina state government voted to nullify the tariff law and threatened to secede from the union.
jackson threatened to use troops to enforce federal law in south carolina.
although south carolina eventually backed down after congress passed a compromise tariff this showdown between proponents of the states rights view and the federal government hinted at thorny future conflicts.
jackson pushes indian removal despite his stand against nullification jacksons political base was in the south and those voters expected him to help them remove the 60 000 native americans living in the region.
in 1830 congress passed the indian removal act.
this law sought to negotiate the peaceful exchange of indian lands in the south for new lands in indian territory present day oklahoma.

the young republic the united states in the early 1800s had its share of political disputes and economic hiccups but these problems only served to prove the stability and strength of the united states.
once a young nation engaged in an experiment with the republican form of government by the 1830s the united states was a rising economic power and a model of democratic stability.
beginning in 1831 french aristocrat alexis de tocqueville undertook a study of american society and politics.
his findings were published in a now classic work of political science democracy in america.
tocqueville was impressed with the young nations commitment to the ideals of liberty and individualism expressed in the declaration of independence and constitution.
according to tocqueville there were five crucial ingredients to the success of representative democracy in the united states liberty egalitarianism individualism populism and laissez faire.
liberty and egalitarianism or the view that people are equal and should be treated equally were rallying cries of the many revolutions that followed the american revolution including the one in france.
but in the 1830s these values had little or no reality for most people living outside the united states.
in the united states individual rights were explicitly protected in the federal constitution and in many of its state counterparts if only for white men.
the declaration of independence stated that all men are created equal tocqueville was particularly astonished by american individualism and populism or the widespread participation of regular citizens in the political process.
these traits were largely absent in the older social systems of europe where class systems determined an individuals place in society and the upper classes dominated politics to the exclusion of nearly everyone else.
in some ways jackson was the symbol of both individualism and populism.

the american government also had a hands off or laissez faire approach to the national economy.

because of the importance of slavery to the southern economy southerners grew stronger in their defense of slavery.
resistance to slavery many enslaved people did whatever they could to fight back against their oppressors.
resistance often took the form of sabotage such as breaking tools or outwitting overseers.
sometimes resistance became violent.
historians estimate that nearly 200 significant slave revolts took place in the first half of the 1800s.
terrified by the idea of a successful slave revolt southerners passed harsher laws and controls regarding slavery.
enslaved people were forbidden to gather in groups unless an overseer was present.

frederick douglass speech at rochester 1852 slavery divides the nation in cities across the northeast and the midwest abolitionist societies sprang up yet most americans did not support the abolition of slavery.
white workers in the north feared that free african americans would take their jobs and wealthy industrialists worried that the end of slavery would cut off the supply of southern cotton and reduce the demand for ships and shipyards.
defenders of slavery maintained that slave labor was superior to the wage labor of the north.
they argued that northern employers and laborers were inevitably at odds since employers wanted workers to work more for less money while workers wanted to work less for more money.

to ease southern concerns congress debated and then passed the compromise of 1850.
according to this measure california was admitted as a free state but in the other territory acquired from mexico voters would decide the slavery issue for themselves.
this approach became known as popular sovereignty an application of that founding principle enshrined in the constitution.
but by permitting slavery north of 3630n latitude the compromise of 1850 undid the missouri compromise.
the compromise of 1850 included a fugitive slave act.
this law allowed officials to arrest any person accused of being a runaway slave denied fugitives the right to a jury trial and required all citizens to help capture runaway slaves.
the fugitive slave act outraged many northerners who resented being legally forced to support the slave system.
some northern states fought back by passing personal liberty laws.
these laws nullified the fugitive slave act allowing the states to arrest slave catchers for kidnapping.
northern opponents of the law also mounted an intense resistance.

local white bystanders refused to help the slave hunting party.
then after the slave owner died in the scuffle a white jury refused to convict the killers.

the road to disunion resentment against the fugitive slave act spurred harriet beecher stowe to write the novel uncle toms cabin a powerful condemnation of slavery.
stowes sympathetic main character uncle tom put a human face on slavery for readers who had never witnessed slavery firsthand.
uncle toms cabin sold 300 000 copies in its first year increasing antislavery sentiment in the north.
but it angered southerners who argued that stowe s book presented a false picture of slavery and the south.

when senator stephen douglas introduced a bill to establish a government for the nebraska territory his proposal was defeated by southern senators who objected to allowing nebraska to enter the union as a free state.
to accommodate southerners douglas rewrote the bill.
after much debate congress passed the kansas nebraska act which divided the nebraska territory into kansas and nebraska.
voters in each territory would decide the issue of slavery by popular sovereignty.
many northerners complained that this plan allowed slavery in areas where it had been banned by the missouri compromise.
soon both proslavery and antislavery settlers were flocking to kansas each hoping to outnumber the other when the time came to vote on slavery.
in 1855 proslavery supporters set up a territorial government at shawnee mission.
free state settlers responded by establishing an antislavery government in topeka.

a few days after the sack of lawrence brown along with his sons and a few friends conducted a midnight raid on the proslavery settlement at nearby pottawatomie creek.
during the raid they brutally murdered five proslavery settlers.
these killings led to even more violence.
throughout the fall of 1856 there was so much violence perpetrated by both sides that the territory became known as bleeding kansas finally in 1861 kansas entered the union as a free state.
the formation of the republican party opposition to slavery led to the creation of the new republican party in 1854.
republicans included abolitionists antislavery business leaders and northerners who argued that the fugitive slave act intruded into state politics.
the republican party quickly became a powerful political force winning 105 seats in the house of representatives in the 1854 congressional elections.
the presidential election of 1856 pitted democrat james buchanan against john c fremont the candidate of the new republican party.
buchanan who promised that as president he would stop the agitation of the slavery issue was supported by a large majority of southerners.
he won the election but fremont who opposed the spread of slavery made a strong showing.
fremont won one third of the popular vote and 11 northern states.
a controversial supreme court ruling in 1857 a controversial supreme court ruling widened the growing divisions over slavery.
the ruling concerned the case of dred scott an enslaved african american from missouri who had sued for his freedom in 1846.
scotts lawyers argued that he should be considered free because he had lived with his master in the free state of illinois between 1834 and 1838.
after a series of appeals scotts case reached the supreme court.
in dred scott v sandford the court ruled against scott.
but the courts sweeping ruling went far beyond the particulars of scotts case.
the court declared that african americans were not citizens and therefore were not entitled to sue in the courts.
chief justice roger taney stated that since african americans had not been part of the political community when the constitution was adopted they did not have the same rights as groups that were included in that community.
he wrote that slaves are not included and were not intended to be included under the word citizens in the constitution and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which connecting with past learnings 32 0 4 the union in crisis that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the united states the court went beyond the question of slaves citizenship and stated that congress did not have the power to ban slavery in any territory.
taney pointed out that such a ban deprived citizens of their property without due process of law a violation of the fifth amendment.
this meant that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional as would be any future attempt by congress to decide the slavery status of a new state.
reaction to the dred scott decision the language of the courts ruling seemed to indicate that the constitution itself settled the issue slaves were not citizens and states had the right to decide on the issue of slavery themselves.
however the dred scott decision only intensified the slavery debate rather than helping settle it and public reactions drove the north and the south further apart than ever.
southerners were delighted with the court s ruling while northerners viewed it with alarm.
some abolitionists however felt that such an unfair decision would bring the crisis to a head more quickly actually hastening the end of slavery.

others claimed that douglas was eager for kansas and nebraska to achieve statehood because railroad lines built through the new states would benefit chicago the largest city in douglass state by making it a hub for economic development of the west.
thousands of americans attended the lincoln douglas debates and listened intently as the candidates presented opposing views of slavery and its role in america.
lincoln did not call for the immediate abolition of slavery or for political equality for african americans.

abraham lincoln march 4 1861 lincoln makes the first of many difficult decisions when the southern states seceded they seized the federal forts and arsenals within their borders.
only four forts remained in union hands.
the most important of these was fort sumter which guarded the harbor at charleston south carolina.
in januaryl861 president buchanan tried to send troops and supplies to the fort but the unarmed supply ship sailed away when confederate guns fired on it.
upon taking office lincoln had to decide whether to take the risk required to hold on to these forts or yield to confederate demands that they be surrendered.
by april the troops at the fort desperately needed food and supplies.
lincoln who still hoped to bring back the south without bloodshed faced a dilemma.
should he try to resupply the fort.
or should he let the confederates take it.
lincoln struggled to make a decision.
during his inaugural address he had promised southerners that the government will not assail you but as president he was sworn to defend the property of the united states.
a wrong move could touch off a war.
at last trying to steer a middle course lincoln notified south carolina that he was sending supplies food only no arms to the fort.
the surrender of fort sumter south carolinians were suspicious of lincoln s motives and ordered the fort sumter garrison to surrender to the confederacy.
when the union troops refused the confederates fired on the fort.
the union troops eventually ran out of ammunition forcing the commander to surrender.
president lincoln called for 75 000 volunteers to fight against the confederacy.
the south responded just as strongly.
as in the north the south raised troops quickly and struggled to equip and train them before sending them into battle.
both sides predicted a short skirmish with victory only a few days or months away.
these predictions were unfounded.
americans faced years of terrible suffering before the fighting that had begun at fort sumter would finally end.
northerners responded to the attack on fort sumter with shock and anger.
a few days later on april 15 president lincoln declared that insurrection existed.
the civil war had officially begun.
the slave states that had remained in the union now had to choose sides.
within two months of the surrender at fort sumter virginia arkansas tennessee and north carolina joined the confederacy.
delaware kentucky maryland and missouri remained in the union.
e3 sequence events what event marked the beginning of the civil war.
resources strategies and early battles with the election of lincoln the slavery issue that had long divided north from south finally split the nation in two.
from april 1861 to april 1865 the united states of america and the confederate states of america faced each other in the bloody civil war.
at stake was the future not only of slavery but of the union itself.
as the civil war began each side had a clear goal.
the north was determined to preserve the union arguing that no state had the right to secede.
the southern states that formed the confederacy aimed to gain their independence from a union that they felt had become hostile to their interests.
advantages enjoyed by the north although each side faced challenges a variety of factors favored the union.
in the northeast growing urban populations when confederate troops fired across the charleston harbor at fort sumter one of only three remaining federal forts in the south it sparked the beginning of the american civil war.
interactive chart connecting with past learnings 39 0 5 the civil war supported a wide range of manufacturing.
replenished by a continuing influx of immigrant workers from europe northern factories were able to increase production of the supplies needed to wage war ammunition arms uniforms medical supplies food ships and railroad cars.
across the north the railroad network was well developed as were systems for farming mining and processing raw materials.
banking insurance and financing industries were also clustered in the urbanized north.
the federal government had a well organized navy.
by the end of 1861 the union navy had outfitted and launched more than 250 warships and was constructing dozens more.
naval superiority allowed the union to blockade the souths few vital ports.
advantages enjoyed by the south given such advantages northerners anticipated a quick victory.
but the south had distinct disadvantages as well.
when the war began the union army consisted of only about 16 000 men.
although the south had an even smaller army its troops at the outset of the war were more highly motivated and they were led by some of the nations finest and most experienced officers.
the experienced and inspiring robert e lee had originally been general robert e lee of virginia rejected lincolns offer to command the union army.
the decision would prove costly for the union due to lees exceptional military skills.
offered command of union forces but chose instead to remain loyal to his native virginia.
throughout the war general lee provided the confederacy with expert military leadership.
the north struggled for much of the war to find a commander of comparable skill and daring.
perhaps the biggest advantage the confederates enjoyed was the fact that they were fighting a defensive war on their own territory.
all they had to do was outlast the union to achieve victory.
the union had the much more difficult task of conquering the south.
they had to do this fighting in unfamiliar territory against an enemy that had a lot more at stake.
early strategies each side had a clear military goal.
the confederacy simply had to survive keeping their armies in the field until northerners became tired of fighting.
the union however had to crush and conquer the confederacy.
the north adopted a strategy designed to starve the south into submission.
it was called the anaconda plan after the snake that slowly squeezes its prey to death.
the plan involved seizing the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico so that the south could not send or receive shipments.
by the middle of 1862 with victories in mississippi and new orleans the north had captured the mississippi valley.
union soldiers also seized the strategic railroad juncture at chattanooga tennessee and scored victories in battles as far west as new mexico.
stalemate on the east coast though both sides won battles neither side could gain a clear and decisive victory in the early part of the war.
union armies hoped to capture the confederate capital of richmond virginia.
but troops outside washington d c could not seem to make progress toward that goal.
confederate troops were equally unsuccessful in pushing the war north toward washington d c.
thanks to efficient new weapons especially more accurate rifles and deadlier bullets a single days battle might produce more than 10 000 casualties.
this new lethal warfare stung the public consciousness.
battle sites such as bull run july 1861 shiloh april 1862 antietam september 1862 and fredericksburg december 1862 are still remembered as the scenes of some of the deadliest encounters in american history.
limited medical care ensured that many of the wounded died of infection rather than of the wounds themselves.
fcl describe which side had more advantages when the war began.
connecting with past learnings 40 0 5 the civil war the emancipation proclamation early in the war president lincoln insisted that he did not have the authority to end slavery.
in his public statements he emphasized the fact that his chief goal was to preserve the union not end slavery.
although lincoln personally opposed slavery he did not want to lose the support of the four slave states maryland delaware kentucky and missouri that had remained loyal to the union.
however by the autumn of 1862 with the military situation beginning to look better for the union lincoln decided to take a first step toward the end of slavery.
in january 1863 he issued the emancipation proclamation.
this presidential decree declared that all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free the emancipation proclamation did not apply to the loyal slave states or to those areas of the south already under union control.
as a result it did not immediately free a single slave.
nevertheless it was an important turning point because it encouraged enslaved african americans in the south to run away to union army encampments and to aid the union cause.
it also symbolically redefined the war as being about slavery african americans had always believed that the war should be about slavery and they had volunteered to fight as soon as the war began.
but at first they were turned away and told this is a white mans war after the emancipation proclamation however the union began to actively recruit both free blacks from the north and newly freed african americans from the south.
eventually some 180 000 african american men served in the union army.
h describe what were the effects of the emancipation proclamation.
war affects daily life the civil war not only engaged the nation in a prolonged and violent conflict it also transformed the nations civilian life.
in the north mines and factories stepped up production to supply military needs such as ships railroads weapons uniforms provisions and fuel.
to pay for the war the federal government raised tariffs imposed income taxes and printed money.
congress also encouraged western settlement and offered free land to soldiers who would give two years of military service.
such land grants sparked agricultural growth which helped feed union troops.
the south had claimed that the war was being fought over states rights.
the emancipation proclamation focused the war on the ending of slavery.
african americans celebrated the emancipation proclamation.
however freedom for african americans in the south would only become a reality if the union defeated the confederacy.

during the civil war women helped by caring for the sick and wounded.
they were so successful that nursing became an accepted profession for women following the war.
the union takes extraordinary measures as the war dragged on the union army experienced a shortage of volunteers.
when congress passed a draft law in 1863 requiring all able bodied men between the ages of 20 and 45 to serve in the military if called riots broke out in several northern cities.
the most severe rioting took place in new york city in july 1863.
white workers attacked free african americans as well as wealthy new yorkers who were able to pay a fee to avoid military service.
some northerners opposed lincolns conduct of the war and demanded immediate peace.
to deal with dissent lincoln suspended the constitutional right of habeas corpus which guarantees that no one can be held in prison without specific charges being filed.
union troops arrested many people suspected of disloyalty.
although lincoln felt such measures were necessary to preserve the union others criticized his actions as unconstitutional.
hardships in the south almost all of the battles took place on southern soil.
the fighting destroyed some of the souths traditional strengths such as large scale agriculture and stripped the confederacy of the resources it might have used to rebuild.
by 1863 the union plan to starve the south into submission seemed to be on the verge of succeeding.
the south seized every opportunity to ease its economic problems.
as lincoln had done confederate president jefferson davis authorized the confederacy to issue paper money backed only by the governments promise to pay.
doubts about the true value of confederate money led to severe inflation or price increases.
the combination of rising prices and food shortages sparked food riots in some parts of the south.
a time of social change on both sides the war gave women new tasks.
women set up field hospitals and nursed wounded soldiers.
many confederate women took to the fields to harvest crops.
white and black teachers from the north went south to become teachers of newly freed slaves.

the anaconda plan had achieved one of its major goals confederate territory was split apart.
the battle of gettysburg meanwhile in the east general lee marched into pennsylvania.
he hoped to win a surprise victory then swing south to washington d c.
but in july 1863 union troops defeated lee at the town of gettysburg.
the battle of gettysburg destroyed one third of lees forces and marked the last major confederate attempt to invade the north.
a few months later the president went to gettysburg to help dedicate a battle cemetery by giving a speech that would come to be known as the gettysburg address.
in the speech lincoln referred to the declaration of independence and its founding principles of liberty and equality.
he applied these principles to the current struggle and asked that the union remember the men who died at gettysburg as they fought for a new birth of freedom four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
abraham lincoln gettysburg address november 19 1863 the confederacy surrenders in the fall of 1864 union general william t sherman led more than 60 000 troops on a 400 mile march of destruction through georgia and south carolina.
the march was part of a strategy of total war which targeted not only troops but all of the resources needed to feed clothe and support an army.
shermans troops burned crops in fields tore up railroad tracks and destroyed homes plantations and public buildings.
by spring 1865 the confederacy was exhausted.
union troops captured the confederate capital of richmond virginia.
on april 9 in the small virginia town of appomattox court house lee surrendered to grant.

after three days of confederate attacks the union army forced their retreat.
interactive map than one third of northern and southern soldiers were killed or disabled.
the southern landscape and economy were in shambles.
millions of dislocated southerners drifted north in search of new lives in illinois indiana missouri or other points north.
others joined the increasing migration to the west becoming cowboys or farmers.
the war ended an era in american political life.
although debates about states rights and federal authority continue to this day never again would states attempt to secede.
more and more americans would see themselves not just as citizens of a state but of a united nation.
full emancipation the emancipation proclamation had only applied to the states that left the union and it only freed slaves in confederate territory that the union was able to control.
with the final union victory congress and the president were ready to abolish slavery throughout the nation.
even before the civil war ended congress passed the thirteenth amendment making slavery unconstitutional.
however this amendment had to be ratified by three fourths of the states to go into effect.
this process took until december 1865 over six months after the fighting ended.
the southern states that had seceded were now connecting with past learnings 43 0 5 the civil war occupied by the union army.
they now had to accept the thirteenth amendment even though they had fought the war to preserve slavery.
for african americans in the south emancipation promised them new opportunities including a chance to work for wages and to control their own lives.
some joined the migration to the north and west while others remained in the south hoping to work as freedmen the land they had worked as slaves.
the thirteenth amendment was a victory for the abolitionist movement and a milestone in the development of the civil rights movement in the nineteenth century.

as he said in his second inaugural address let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan although lincoln was seen by many republicans as a heroic leader who had prevented the union from coming apart not all republicans had the same ideas about reconstruction as the president.
some congressional leaders wanted to punish the south.
they favored a harsh reconstruction plan designed to make the south pay for the devastation of the war.
the next several years would bring sharp differences between congressional leaders bent on imposing their will on the south and two presidents who wanted to make reconstruction as painless as possible.

the black and white agents of the bureau delivered food and healthcare and began to develop a public school system for both black and white southerners.
it also helped to reunite families separated by slavery and to negotiate fair labor contracts between formerly enslaved african americans and white landowners.
a new president meanwhile debate over reconstruction continued.
before he could gain support for his moderate plan of reconstruction abraham lincoln was assassinated on april 14 1865.
as the nation mourned vice president andrew johnson became president.
as a southerner who had remained loyal to the union johnson was similarly in favor of a relatively forgiving approach to reconstruction.
he put forth a plan that restored political power to southerners if they swore allegiance to the united states and ratified the thirteenth amendment.
in return the new president promised to uphold states rights with the laws of individual states taking precedence over federal regulations.
many members of congress disapproved of this plan.
arguing that southerners had caused the war these radical republicans favored punishment and a harsh reorganization for the south.
radicals also advocated full citizens rights for african americans and wanted states authority to be subordinate to federal power.
when southern legislatures passed laws to restrict the activities of african americans radicals became even more determined to impose a harsh reconstruction policy on the south.
johnson and the radicals in congress clashed repeatedly.
in 1868 congress voted to impeach johnson.
johnson won his impeachment trial by a single vote in the senate but this victory did him little good.

perhaps most important radicals passed the fourteenth amendment which guaranteed full citizenship status and rights to every man born in the united states including african americans.
the bill of rights would now apply to all americans no matter their race.
the amendment was ratified in 1868.
voting rights for african americans under radical reconstruction many white southerners were not eligible to vote or chose to stay away from the polls.
african american men on the other hand eagerly signed up to exercise their new right of suffrage.
most new african american voters voted for the republican party.
thus by 1868 many southern states had black elected officials and were dominated by a strong republican party.
south carolina the first state to secede became the only state where for a short time an african american majority dominated the legislature.
at this time no laws guaranteed the vote to african americans in the north.
to remedy this imbalance congress passed the fifteenth amendment which guaranteed that no male citizen could be denied the right to vote on the basis of race color or previous condition of servitude it was ratified in 1870.
new lives for freedmen in the south formerly enslaved african americans worked to carve out new lives.
some struck out for the north or west.
but many more stayed in the south.
they assembled their scattered families and built strong churches that also served as community centers employment agencies schoolhouses and in later years centers of protest.
for the first time many african american men and women could legalize and celebrate their marriages set up housekeeping with their families and make choices about where they would reside.
some freed women could leave field labor and care for their families at home.
freed people also realized the importance of learning to read and do basic math.
so the freedmens bureau schools quickly filled.
by 1869 as many as 300 000 african american adults and children were acquiring basic literacy.

reconstruction comes to an end after a decade of reconstruction northerners began to lose interest in remaking the south.
they turned their focus on other social political and economic issues.
in the fall of 1873 a series of bank failures sparked a severe economic downturn.
at the same time a series of political scandals in the grant administration damaged the radical republicans.
under these circumstances reconstruction began to fade.
gradually and quietly beginning in 1871 troops were withdrawn from the south.
in 1872 congress dissolved the freedmens bureau.

they argued that republican programs for public schools and road building resulted in higher taxes.
most white southerners shunned anyone who supported radical republicans.
southern democrats grasped every opportunity to paint african american politicians as corrupt and incompetent.
at the same time the everpresent threat of violence kept african americans from voting thus depriving the republicans of a large segment of their political base.
one by one southern states reinstated wealthy white southern men as governors and sent former confederate leaders to the u s congress.
in the 1874 elections the republicans lost control of the house of representatives.
by 1876 only south carolina florida and louisiana three states with large african american populations still had reconstruction governments and remained under military occupation.
the disputed election of 1876 the presidential election of 1876 brought a final end to reconstruction.
democratic candidate samuel tilden won more popular votes than republican candidate rutherford b hayes but the electoral vote was in dispute.
the disputed votes were those of florida south carolina and louisiana the three southern states still controlled by republican reconstruction governments.
in an informal compromise intended to end the dispute a congressional committee declared the republican candidate the winner.

in effect the election of hayes ended reconstruction.
evaluating reconstruction was reconstruction a success or a failure.
southerners and northerners black and white then and now would give different connecting with past learnings 0 6 the reconstruction era answers.
all will agree however that some things were changed forever by those dozen years during which the victorious north tried to remake the vanquished south.
certainly radical reconstruction failed in most of its aims.
it had violated the constitution in several ways for years at a time.
by the end of the century the political rights of african americans in the south had eroded.
southern states slowly took away the voting rights of african americans.
all of the former confederate states created systems of de jure segregation that made african americans second class citizens.
support for african americans was not abundant in the north either.
still reconstruction did mark the beginning of the physical and economic rebuilding of the south.
despite continuing conflicts and resentments the nation was permanently reunited.
and the constitutional amendments passed during reconstruction especially the fourteenth amendment would eventually form the basis for a revived civil rights movement that sought political equality for all citizens in the twentieth century.

african americans in the late 1800s after reconstruction ended many white politicians in the north and south turned their attention from racial issues allowing racist laws and segregation to spread in the south and to a lesser extent in the north.
this turn away from equality for all had a lasting impact on society in the united states.
during the gilded age 1877 to 1900 southern state governments enacted various measures intended to disenfranchise african americans and enacted jim crow laws to keep blacks and whites apart as much as possible.
methods of restricting voting rights the fifteenth amendment prohibited state governments from denying someone the right to vote because of race color or previous condition of servitude after reconstruction southern states got around this amendment by passing a number of other restrictive measures.
they enacted a poll tax requiring voters to pay a tax to vote.
poor african americans could scarcely afford such a fee.
the states also required voters to pass literacy tests and understanding tests.
because african americans had been exploited economically and denied an education these restrictions disqualified many of them as voters.

i interactive timeline southern states got around the fifteenth amendments restriction on the use of previous condition of servitude with grandfather clauses that allowed a person to vote as long as his ancestors had voted prior to 1866.
some southern states also established all white primaries meaning only whites had a voice in selecting who got to run in general elections.
in addition whites resorted to violence to keep african americans from participating in the political process.
as a result of these actions throughout the deep south black participation in politics fell dramatically.
in louisiana for example the number of blacks registered to vote plummeted from 130 000 in 1894 to just over 1 300 in 1904.
similarly in northern states including those that had civil rights laws that outlawed legal segregation black migrants found many examples of de facto segregation limiting where they could live work and socialize.
during the 1870s the supreme court issued rulings that accepted many of these methods of making african americans into second class citizens.
in plessy v ferguson 1896 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of jim crow laws.
it did so by arguing that as long as states maintained separate but equal facilities they did not violate the fourteenth amendment.
yet in reality separate facilities were rarely equal.
african americans oppose injustice even during the darkest days of jim crow african americans refused to accept this inferior legal and social status.
they established black newspapers womens clubs fraternal organizations schools and colleges and political associations with the goal of securing their freedom.
they did not always agree on the best strategies for achieving their goals but they were united in their determination to never turn back until they had achieved equality.
one of the most famous black leaders of the late nineteenth century was booker t washington.
born a slave in 1856 washington argued that african americans needed to accommodate themselves to segregation meaning they should not focus their energies on seeking to overturn jim crow.
instead he called for blacks to pull themselves up from their own bootstraps by building up their economic resources and establishing their reputations as hardworking and honest citizens.

cities grew quickly as a result of industrialization and immigration.
new technology urbanization and industrialization created new ways of life and mass cultural movements in the united states.
pearson 1 nbc learn essential question how do science and technology affect society.
i i to hear the story of an immigrant thomas edison one of historys most prolific inventors poses with one of his many creations.
by the age of 22 edison had already produced his first major invention a machine to report stock prices.
the industrial revolution began in the british textile industry in the 1700s.
within a few decades it spread to other european countries and the new country of the united states which had the greatest number of resources to expand the revolution.
the first industrial revolution was marked by the introduction of steam power and the factory system.
coal and iron became key resources.
around the 1850s the industrial revolution entered a new phase dominated by steel oil and a major new power source electricity.
these new energy sources significantly improved the standard of living throughout the country.
this second industrial revolution also had a distinctly american character.
interactive flipped video 3 b 15 b 27 a 28 c objectives analyze the factors that encouraged industrialization in the united states in the late 1800s.
explain how new inventions scientific discoveries and technological innovations fueled growth and improved the standard of living.
explain the challenges faced by the south in industry and agriculture in the late 1800s.
describe the impact of industrialization in the late 1800s.
key terms entrepreneurs laissez faire protective tariffs patent thomas edison bessemer process suspension bridges time zones mass production cash crop free enterprise innovation boosts growth american industry grows the civil war challenged industries to make goods more quickly and efficiently especially in the north which already had an industrial base.
using new tools and methods factories stepped up production of guns ammunition medical supplies and uniforms.
the food industry developed ways to process foods so they could be shipped long distances.
railroads expanded and more efficient methods of creating power were developed.
meanwhile the government encouraged immigration to meet the increasing demand for labor in the nation s factories.
natural resources fuel economic development the countrys growth was fueled in part by its vast supply of natural resources.
numerous coal mines along the eastern seaboard provided fuel to power steam locomotives and factories.
thick forests were cut into lumber for construction.
iron ore was converted into iron and later into steel to build bridges railroad tracks and machines.
the nations many navigable riverways transported these and other resources to cities and factories.
pearson 1 bi realize access your digital lesson.
64 many technological innovations expanded the countrys natural resource base even further.
in 1859 edwin drake used a steam engine to drill the worlds first successful oil well near titusville pennsylvania.
before drakes innovation oil which was used for light and fuel was mainly obtained from boiling down whale blubber.
but whale hunting was time consuming and whales were becoming scarce.
drilled oil was relatively cheap to produce and easy to transport.
the oil industry grew quickly after 1859 and encouraged the growth of related industries such as kerosene and gasoline.
another technological innovation of the 1850s made it easier to process iron ore into steel.
steel production soon skyrocketed as boatloads of iron ore moved across the great lakes from cities in minnesota to pittsburgh pennsylvania and other cities that became steelmaking centers.
the steel rails produced by these new steel making cities encouraged economic development by allowing railroads to bring distant natural resources to eastern cities and factories.
the workforce grows population changes also promoted the growth of industry.
after the civil war large numbers of europeans and some asians immigrated to the united states.
they were pushed from their homelands by factors such as political upheaval religious discrimination and crop failures.
in 1881 alone nearly three quarters of a million immigrants arrived in america.
that number climbed steadily reaching almost one million per year by 1905.
immigrants were willing to work for low wages because competition for jobs was fierce.
and they were prepared to move frequently in pursuit of economic opportunity.
all of these factors meant that industries had a huge and willing workforce to fuel growth.
the potential workforce grew even larger in the 1890s when droughts and competition from foreign farmers drove american farmers in large numbers to seek jobs in the cities.
free enterprise encourages the rise of entrepreneurship in 1868 horatio alger published his first novel ragged dick or street life in new york.
this wildly successful novel told the story of a poor boy who rose to wealth and fame by working hard.
alger s novels stressed the possibility that anyone could vault from poverty and obscurity to wealth and fame.
in this excerpt he describes how ragged dick starts his climb to success.
ten dollars a week was to him a fortune.
indeed he would have been glad only the day before to get a place at three dollars a week.
then source historical statistics of the united states technological innovation prompted the countrys production of natural resources to increase significantly.
analyze graphs what relationship do you see between natural resources and economic growth.
industry and immigration 65 1 1 innovation boosts growth he was to be advanced if he deserved it.
it was indeed a bright prospect for a boy who only a year before could neither read nor write.
dicks great ambition to grow up spectable seemed likely to be accomplished after all.
horatio alger 1888 the rags to riches idea depended on the system of capitalism in which individuals own most businesses.
the heroes of this system were entrepreneurs or people who build and manage businesses or enterprises in order to make a profit.
entrepreneurs invest time money or both in a product or service often risking their own livelihoods on the chance of success.
the rise of entrepreneurship fueled industrialization and economic growth in the late 1800s.
entrepreneurs thrived under the idea of free enterprise or the freedom to run a business for profit with minimal regulation beyond what is necessary to protect the public interest.
entrepreneurs competed among themselves for consumers dollars.
if one business priced a certain product too high consumers might buy andrew carnegie was an entrepreneur who thrived in the american free enterprise system.
he built successful businesses and contributed much of his wealth to philanthropic causes.
a similar product from a competitor.
so entrepreneurs found innovative ways to increase efficiency cut costs and lower prices which enabled them to compete and survive in the free enterprise system.
the factories railroads and mines they established created jobs and also attracted foreign investment.
laissez faire policies encourage growth the government encouraged laissez faire policies which allowed businesses to operate under minimal government regulation.
without government regulation workplace conditions were sometimes challenging.
however laissez faire policies along with a strong legal system that enforced private property rights provided the predictability and security that businesses and industries desired and encouraged investment and growth.
these factors created an economic environment in which entrepreneurs could flourish.
to promote the buying of american goods congress enacted protective tariffs or taxes that made imported goods cost more than those made in the united states.
the government also gave innovative railroad builders millions of acres of land in return for their promise to quickly link the east and west coasts.
b identify main ideas what factors help explain the growth of industry in the late 1800s.
elps 1 a 1 take turns reading the section laissez faire policies encourage growth.
discuss how what you already know helps you understand this section.
innovation drives economic development fueled by entrepreneurship competition and the free enterprise system the drive for innovation and efficiency seemed to touch every sphere of life in the united states by the late 1800s.
the number of patents increased rapidly during this time.
a patent is a grant by the federal government giving an inventor the exclusive right to develop use and sell an invention for a set period of time.
business leaders invested heavily in these new scientific discoveries and innovations hoping to create new industries and expand old ones.
eager consumers welcomed new inventions to the market helping to spur the nations economic development.
electricity improves standards of living with support from wealthy industrialists like j p morgan inventor thomas edison established a research laboratory at menlo park new jersey in 1876.
edison 1 1 innovation boosts growth elps industry and immigration 66 the birth of modern telecommunication sending a letter missouri california 1844 1866 1851 1867 the telegraph could send a message exponentially faster than standard mail.
infer how did telecommunication innovations improve the standard of living in the united states.
interactive gallery a creative genius who had only a few months of formal education would receive more than 1 000 patents for new inventions and scientific discoveries.
in 1880 for example with the goal of developing affordable lighting for homes edison and his team invented the light bulb experimenting with thousands of different types of materials to find one that worked.
within a few years they had also developed plans for central power plants to light entire sections of cities.
other inventors later improved upon edisons work and other applications for electricity quickly improved the standard of living throughout the country.
george westinghouse for example developed technology to send electricity over long distances.
electricity lit city streets and powered homes and factories extending the number of hours in the day when americans could work and play.
innovation in communications in 1844 inventor samuel morse perfected telegraph technology or the process of sending messages over wire.
in 1876 alexander graham bell patented the telephone.
the two inventions attracted investors.
within a few years 148 telephone companies had strung more than 34 000 miles of wire and long distance lines linked several cities in the northeast and midwest.
by 1900 there were more than one million telephones in the united states and more than 100 000 miles of telegraph wire linked users across the land.
in 1896 guglielmo marconi invented the wireless telegraph.
innovative entrepreneurs later built on marconis achievement and developed the radio.
all of these inventions improved communication between americans.
instead of waiting days for a letter to arrive americans could receive telegraphs in a matter of minutes or hear loved ones voices immediately on the telephone.
improved communication also meant that news of public events spread quickly steel innovation and economic development in the 1850s in england a man named henry bessemer developed a process for purifying iron to make strong but lightweight steel.
american industries quickly adopted the bessemer process and by 1890 the united states was outproducing british steel manufacturers.
strong steel made possible a host of innovations including skyscrapers and the elevators to service them.
one of its most dramatic uses was in the construction of suspension bridges bridges in which the roadway is suspended by steel cables.
the first suspension bridge was the brooklyn bridge spanning the east river in new york city.
completed in 1883 it was at the time of its construction the longest bridge in the world.
industry and immigration 67 1 1 innovation boosts growth technology affects travel as railroads expanded they made other use of new technologies and also encouraged innovation.
george westinghouse patented air brakes for trains in 1869 while granville woods patented a telegraph system for trains in 1887.
woods was one of many african americans who used what they had learned from manual labor to get in on the national passion for developing and patenting new inventions.
meanwhile meatpacker gustavus swift developed refrigerated cars for transporting food.
by 1883 there were three transcontinental railroad lines in the united states.
the expanding transportation network caused some problems however.
throughout most of the 1800s most towns set their clocks independently.
when trains started regular passenger service between towns time differences made it hard to set schedules.
in 1884 delegates from 27 countries divided the globe into 24 time zones one for each hour of the day.
the railroads adopted this system which is still used today.
technology also affected how americans traveled and where they lived.
electric streetcars commuter trains and subways appeared in major cities.
as a result americans could live in neighborhoods outside the city and commute to work.
factory production of automobiles with gas powered engines began in 1902.
experiments in manned flight in a heavier than air craft by orville and wilbur wright among others in the early 1900s marked the birth of aeronautics another new industry.
an upward spiral of growth railroads played a key role in transforming american industries and businesses.
they could transport large amounts of goods long distances quickly cheaply and efficiently because they linked the nation they allowed businesses to obtain raw materials easily and to sell finished goods to larger numbers of people.
they encouraged new methods for management and administration which were soon adopted by the rest of the business community.
in addition the expanding railroad network stimulated innovation in many other industries.
an abundance of natural resources and an efficient transportation system to carry raw materials and finished goods set up a spiral of related growth.
for example factories turned out plate glass for windows of passenger rail cars.
the factories needed freight cars to carry the windows to their destinations.
those freight cars were created in factories that used railroads to transport fuel to supply the furnaces that turned out more railroad cars.
in this way factory production generated more factory production.
to meet the growing demand factory owners and other innovators developed systems for turning out large numbers of products quickly and inexpensively.

key 1318 eastern time i i central time i i mountain time i i pacific time interactive map industry and immigration 68 1 1 innovation boosts growth known as mass production these systems depended upon machinery to carry out tasks that were once done with hand tools.
in addition frederick taylor and others studied the flow of work and workers places in it to develop a system of industrial management that found the most efficient ways for workers to use new machinery.
these technological and management innovations improved the standard of living for some americans by increasing the development of an economic middle class.
middle class americans especially those that lived in the industrialized north could afford less expensive products produced by companies utilizing new technology.
b check understanding how did new technologies influence industrialization.
industrialization and the new south while industry boomed in the north after the civil war and reconstruction the south fell behind.
the south struggled to develop its industry and there were some pockets of success especially in tobacco processing stone quarrying and furniture making.
in the 1890s altanta georgia for example was one of the earliest cities to develop an electric trolley system.
but even though cities like atlanta and knoxville tennessee grew strongly the south struggled to overcome economic and social obstacles to broad industrial and urban development.
as a result the south remained largely agricultural and developed a smaller middle class than the north.
however some post reconstruction industrial growth was led by many southern white leaders who envisioned a modernized economy that included not only agriculture but also mills and factories.
atlanta newspaper editor henry grady was among those who called for a new south a gifted orator grady thought the south should use its resources to develop industry there was a south of slavery and secession that south is dead.
there is a south of union and freedom that south thank god is living breathing growing every hour.
the old south rested everything on slavery and agriculture unconscious that these could neither give nor maintain healthy growth.
the new south presents a perfect democracy.
a social system industry and immigration 69 a worker does her job in a typical alabama textile mill in the early 1900s.
interpret in what way is this worker a symbol of the new south.
compact and closely knitted less splendid on the surface but stronger at the core.
and a diversified industry that meets the complex needs of this complex age.
henry grady 1886 new industries develop before the civil war the south had shipped its raw materials including cotton wood and iron ore abroad or to the north for processing into finished goods.
in the 1880s northern investors and entrepreneurs backed textile factories in north carolina south carolina and georgia as well as cigar and lumber production especially in north carolina and virginia.
other private investment in coal iron and steel processing created urban centers in nashville tennessee and birmingham alabama.
during this time farming also became somewhat more diversified with an increase in grain tobacco and fruit crops.
even the landscape of farming changed as smaller farms replaced large plantations.
railroads connect cities and towns the south needed reliable transportation to aid its industrial growth.
to meet this need southern rail lines 1 1 innovation boosts growth expanded joining rural areas with urban hubs such as mobile and montgomery in alabama and the bustling ports of new orleans louisiana and charleston south carolina.
yet by the 1880s only two rail lines from texas to chicago and from tennessee to washington d c linked southern freight to northern markets.
to combat economic isolation southerners lobbied the federal government for economic help and used prison labor to keep railroad construction costs down.
gradually rail connections supported the expansion of small hubs such as meridian mississippi and americus georgia.
the newer cities of atlanta dallas and nashville developed rapidly and began rivaling older cities.
the southern economy lags behind despite these changes the southern economy continued to lag behind the rest of the country.
while the north was able to build on its strong industrial base the south first had to repair the damages of war.
moreover industry rests on a three legged stool natural resources labor and capital investment or money invested to start or improve the business.
the south had plenty of the first but not enough of the second and third.
sustained economic development also requires workers who are well trained and productive as well as consumers who can spend.
public education in the south was limited.
in fact the south spent less than any other part of the country on education and it lacked the technical and engineering schools that could have trained the people needed by industry.
at the same time low wages discouraged skilled workers from coming to the south and the lure of higher wages or better conditions elsewhere siphoned off southern workers.
additionally very few southern banks had survived the war and those that were functioning had fewer assets than their northern competitors.
most of the souths wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few people.
poor tenant farmers and low paid factory workers did not have cash to deposit.
with few strong banks southern financiers were often dependent on northern banks to start or expand businesses or farms.
the southern economy suffered from this lack of labor and capital.
farm issues in the south before the civil war most southern planters had concentrated on such crops as cotton and tobacco which were grown not for their own use but to be sold for cash.
the lure of the cash crop continued after the war despite efforts to diversify.
one farm magazine recommended that instead of cotton fields and patches of grain let us have fields of grain and patches of cotton but cotton remained the centerpiece of the southern agricultural economy.
although at the end of the civil war cotton production had dropped to about one third of its prewar levels by the late 1880s it had rebounded.
however during the price of cotton fell dramatically following the civil war.
analyze graphs what factors contributed to cottons declining value.
industry and immigration 70 1 1 1 innovation boosts growth the war many european textile factories had found suppliers outside the south and the price of cotton had fallen.
now the souths abundance of cotton simply depressed the price further.
dependence on one major crop was extremely risky.
in the case of southern cotton it was the boll weevil that heralded disaster.
the boll weevil a beetle which could destroy an entire crop of cotton appeared in texas in the early 1890s.
over the next decade the yield from cotton cultivation in some states dropped by more than 50 percent.
by 1900 cottons appeal and its problems dominated the southern economy much as they had before the civil war.
h identify supporting details what factors inhibited southern economic recovery.
the effects of industrialization free enterprise and industrialization touched every aspect of american life in the late 1800s from the way businesses and farms operated to the kinds of products americans used.
they also affected the countrys relationship with the world and with its own environment.
dominating world markets by the 1880s american exports of grain steel and textiles dominated international markets.
although britain was building railroads to gain access to natural resources in africa asia and many other places across the world by 1900 the united states had almost as many miles of railroad track as the rest of the world combined.
the united states could easily transport goods from where they were made or grown to ports where they could be shipped around the world.
exports of food and goods greatly expanded the american economy.
as the united states grew as a world economic power it often clashed with the economic views and political policies of other countries.
daily life changes massive changes in industry altered how americans lived and worked.
even farms became mechanized meaning that fewer farm laborers were needed to feed the nation.
out of work farmers and their families moved to urban areas to find work especially in the increasingly industrial north.
many moved to manufacturing centers that had sprung up around growing factories or industries.
the mass production of goods meant that these new urban dwellers had easy access to clothing and supplies that they would have had to make by hand in the past.
yet a manager on a late nineteenth century cotton plantation weighs the amount of cotton picked by laborers.
from freight yards such as this massive complex in new york city american industry transported food and other goods nationwide greatly increasing americans access to consumer products.
industry and immigration 71 1 1 innovation boosts growth factories with their multitude of smoke stacks created a great deal of air pollution.
industrial waste was a byproduct of the industrial revolution.
they faced higher costs of living were dependent upon cash wages to buy food and performed repetitive work in factories.
concerns about the environment in the early 1800s few worried about how industry might affect the environment.
however by the late 1800s industrial waste had risen dramatically and mining had begun to damage the land.
in the midwest increasing agricultural production had led to soil erosion and dust storms.
people began to raise concerns about protecting natural resources.
congress responded by setting aside protected lands that would eventually become part of the national park service.
its creation of yellowstone park in 1872 was one of the first federal responses to concerns about the environment and yellowstone was the first such national park established anywhere in the world.
over the next decades many more square miles of american land would be set aside to be protected.

the rise of big business characterized by the investment of huge amounts of private financial resources helped the united states push aside strong economies like britains to become one of the most economically powerful countries in the modern world.
big business rises corporations find new ways of doing business until the mid nineteenth century most businesses were run by one person or family.
this meant that no business could grow bigger than one familys ability to invest in it or run it.
businesses were also local buying and selling to customers who lived nearby.
industrialization changed all this.
railroads provided businesses with access to raw materials and customers from farther and farther away.
business leaders desiring the profits offered by these larger markets responded by combining funds and resources.
the corporation meets new needs to take advantage of expanding markets investors developed a form of group ownership known as a corporation.
in a corporation a number of people share the ownership of a business.
if a corporation experiences economic problems the investors lose no more than they had originally invested in the business.
the corporation was the perfect solution to the challenge of expanding business especially for risky industries such as railroads or mining.
a corporation had the same rights as an individual it could buy and sell property and it could sue in the courts.
if one person chose to leave the group others could buy his interests.

73 corporations were perfectly suited to expanding markets.
they had access to huge amounts of capital or invested money allowing them to fund new technology enter new industries or run large plants across the country.
aided by railroads and the telegraph corporations had the ability to operate in several different regions.
after 1870 the number of corporations in america increased dramatically.
they were an important part of industrial capitalism.
the economic free market system centered around industries.
finding new ways to gain advantage corporations worked to maximize profits in several ways.
they advertised their products widely which enabled them to reach more potential customers.
they paid low wages to workers and tried to obtain raw materials as cheaply as possible.
they adopted forms of business organization such as horizontal or vertical integration and applied other innovations in production management to seek out efficiencies that would in turn decrease their cost of producing goods or services.
like j p morgan the heads of some corporations supported research laboratories where inventors could experiment with new processes that could lower production costs or new products that could bring future profits.
others thought of new ways to make their businesses profitable.
cornelius vanderbilt an entrepreneur in the railroad industry got his start in the steamboat business.
he succeeded in getting his competitors to pay him to relocate because his low fares were driving them out of business.
some corporations worked to eliminate competition by forming a cartel.
in this arrangement businesses making the same product agree to limit their production and thus keep prices high.
john d rockefeller an ohio oil tycoon made agreements with railroads that made it difficult for his competitors to ship their products rockefellers company killed its rivals in brief by getting the great trunk lines to refuse to give them transportation.
vanderbilt is reported to have said that there was but one man rockefeller who could dictate to him.
d lloyd iw 1881 business management innovations business leaders continued to develop ever more effective ways to decrease costs and increase profits.
one way was to merge competing firms into a giant company whose size would lead to lower production costs.
this system of consolidating many firms in the same business is called horizontal integration.
some corporations used horizontal integration to gain a monopoly or complete control of a product or service.
to do this a company either bought its competitors or drove them out of business.

contrast what differences do you see between horizontal and vertical integration.
and an efficient production process the company was free to set its own prices based on demand for its products.
this power did not always mean higher prices for consumers but the potential for setting high prices was there.
the management innovation of horizontal integration made business more efficient but occasionally had a negative impact on labor because workers at smaller companies driven out of business would need to find employment elsewhere.
production management a management innovation designed to maximize the efficiency of a production process also impacted labor.
business owners were understandably interested in controlling labor costs and continually looked for ways to improve worker productivity in conjunction with new machines.
as a result business owners could often meet production goals with fewer skilled workers.
those without the required skills to work with the new technologies and those unable to maintain the pace of a regimented workflow on factory floors oftentimes found themselves without work.
rockefeller was one of the first businessmen to use horizontal integration.
however ohio state law prevented one company from owning the stock of another.
this meant that rockefeller could not buy out his competitors.
instead he found a way to get around the law by forming a new type of business organization called a trust.
in a trust companies assigned their stock to a board of trustees who combined them into a new organization that the trustees ran.
by the early 1880s rockefeller and his standard oil trust controlled most of the oil refined in the united states.
in ohio and elsewhere trusts arose in part because state laws governing corporations were inadequate.
in many states in the mid 1800s corporations could only be chartered by the state legislature passing an act.
business leaders looked for more flexible ways to build their businesses.
for some business leaders trusts were also a way to bring efficiency and stability to a free market where competition could be fierce and unpredictable.
as state laws changed trusts were replaced by other types of business mergers.
however the public continued to apply the term trust to any form of monopolistic business association.
rockefeller steel tycoon andrew carnegie and other business leaders also strengthened their companies and made the workplace more efficient by gaining control of the different businesses that were involved in all stages of manufacturing their products.
carnegie for example owned the coal mines and iron ore fields that provided the raw materials for his steel as well as the ships and railroads that brought them to his industry and immigration 1 2 big business rises ap elps steel mills.
this process called vertical integration allowed companies to reduce their costs of production.

analyze political cartoons what point of view about these leaders does this cartoon express.
interactive gallery found that they received few profits.
some consumers were alarmed by the high prices that monopolies and cartels sometimes set on their products.
gradually many consumers workers and the federal government came to believe that systems like trusts cartels and monopolies gave powerful business leaders unfair advantages.
they believed that perhaps the governments laissez faire policies had been too hands off and costly in terms of hurting workers and consumers.
people who held these views began to refer to these leaders as robber barons at the same time other people believed that these industrialists served the nation positively.
they believed that laissez faire policies had benefited the nation by allowing business to flourish and regulate itself according to free enterprise principles.
they recognized that the spread of factories steel mills and railroads provided jobs for an ever growing labor force.
large efficient corporations often lowered prices for consumers.
business supporters also noted that the industrialists efficient business practices and support for developing technology benefited the nations economy stimulating innovation and shaping the united states into a strong international leader.
furthermore many business leaders like carnegie rockefeller and vanderbilt were important philanthropists.
they established universities museums and libraries believing that such institutions made it possible for the disadvantaged to rise to wealth.
for these reasons people who took this point of view thought of business leaders as captains of industry the causes and effects of social darwinism in 1859 biologist charles darwin published on the origin of species arguing that animals evolved by a process of natural selection and that only the fittest survived to reproduce.
yale professor william graham sumner soon applied this theory to the rough and tumble world of american capitalism calling it social darwinism.
he declared that wealth was a measure of ones inherent value and those who had it were the most fit.
the theory of social darwinism caused by this modification of darwins scientific findings became a social issue when it was used to justify a wide variety of beliefs and conditions.
supporters of the laissez faire economic system argued that the government should stay out of private business because interference would disrupt natural selection.
many social darwinists believed that the nation would grow strong by allowing its most vigorous members to rise to the top and that it was wrong to use public funds to assist the poor.
social darwinism was often used to fuel discrimination.

the changing relationship between government and business the great industrialists methods and their influence on the nations economy worried some americans.
competing railroads took part in practices such as fixing rates and pooling or entering into secret agreements to divide up the nations freight.
many americans felt that price fixing and pooling drove up rates and were unfair to consumers.
they also thought that unfair business practices and poor wages and working conditions for the labor force had made the costs of the governments laissez faire policies too high.
they wanted the federal government to take action.
attempts to regulate business finally in 1887 congress responded by creating the interstate commerce commission icc to monitor railroad shipping rates.
however it could only keep watch on railroads that crossed state lines.
also it could not make laws or control the railroads transactions.
although court rulings favoring states and railroads weakened even these few powers the icc was the first federal agency to monitor business practices.
over the next several decades the government would create many other federal bodies to regulate american businesses.
similarly the federal government slowly became involved in regulating trusts.
in 1890 the senate passed the sherman antitrust act which outlawed any trust that operated in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states the government claimed that it had a constitutional right to regulate such commerce.
but for more than a decade the law was seldom enforced because court rulings generally favored business owners.
in fact it was often used in businesses favor because they successfully argued in court that labor unions restrained trade.
however the icc and the sherman antitrust act began a trend toward federal limitations on corporations power.

analyze charts why might some businesses disagree with the sherman antitrust act.
1 interactive chart a difficult balance between business government and consumer these limits on corporations power were made in an attempt to create a fair environment for competition.
they sought to prevent any one company from undercutting market forces by driving its competition out of the market which would allow the company rather than the market to determine the best price for its products.
to this end the federal government tried many kinds of legislation and regulation with a mixture of costs and benefits.
often neither businesses nor consumers felt that their interests were well served by government policies and actions.
the costs and benefits of anti trust acts continued to be debated.
over the course of 50 years corporations federal regulatory agencies consumers unions and the courts struggled to find an acceptable balance between fair prices and wages as well as workers safety and dignity and the corporations legitimate quest for efficiencies that would provide a fair return on the investment and risk involved in doing business in a free market system.
historians continue to assess the ways in which and the degree to which that attempt at balance was met.
historians and economists also debate the question of who should have the responsibility for developing the policies to achieve that balance.

industry and immigration 78 1 2 big business rises as industrialization intensified the success of the booming american economy relied heavily on its workers.

to keep the economy thriving americans had to find ways to ease the tensions between business owners and workers.
the organized labor movement workers endure difficulties the industrial expansion in the united states produced great wealth for the owners of factories mines railroads and large farms.
it also brought general improvements to american society in the form of a higher standard of living wider availability of cheap goods and increased access to public institutions like museums and schools.
however the economic growth of the late 1800s caused domestic issues.

the hardships of factory work in the 1880s and 1890s factory owners seeking to keep down production costs employed people who would work for low wages.
immigrants made up a large percentage of the workforce.
far from home lacking good english speaking skills and often very poor immigrants would generally take almost any job.
factory workers toiled long hours 12 hours a day 6 days a week.
countless thousands of others worked similar hours in small hot dark and dirty workhouses known as sweatshops.

79 work in the textile mills could be very dangerous and it was not unheard of for an inexperienced young worker some as young as eight years old to lose a finger in an accident.
a surplus of immigrant labor made it difficult for sweatshop workers such as these women to demand fair wages and safe working conditions.
mainly women labored long hours at machines making mass produced items.
owners ensured productivity by strictly regulating workers days.
they clocked work and break hours and fined workers for breaking rules or working slowly.
factory work was often dangerous.
workspaces were poorly lit often overheated and badly ventilated.
some workers lost their hearing from the noisy machines.
accidents were common both from faulty equipment and from lack of proper training.
despite the harsh conditions employers suffered no shortage of labor.
there were always more people than jobs.
children in the workplace as industrialization advanced more jobs opened up for women.
they worked as laundresses telegraph operators and typists.
but most women and their families worked in the factories.
since low wages meant that both parents needed jobs bringing children to work kept them off the streets and close to their parents.
it also meant that the children could earn a wage which helped the family to survive.
by the end of the 1800s nearly one in five children between the ages of 10 and 16 worked rather than attending school.
harsh conditions affected these children deeply.
many suffered stunted physical and mental growth.
by the 1890s social workers began to recognize the social issues caused by child labor.
they lobbied to get children out of factories and into child care or schools.
eventually the efforts of social workers and other reformers prompted states to pass legislation to stop child labor.
company towns and wage slavery many laborers especially those who worked in mines were forced to live in isolated communities near their workplaces.
the housing in these communities known as company towns was owned by the business and rented out to employees.
the employer also controlled the company store where workers were forced to buy goods.
the company store sold goods on credit but charged high interest.
as a result by the time the worker was paid most of the wages were owed back to the employer.
since workers could be arrested if they left their jobs before they completely repaid these debts employers could hold onto workers through a system that workers advocates called wage slavery through management of their company towns employers could also reinforce ethnic competition and distrust.

the growth of labor unions industrialization and free enterprise lowered the prices of consumer goods but helped business investors gain large profits.
workers usually did not object to their employer making a profit from their work.
after all if the business was not profitable it could close and leave workers jobless.
keeping companies profitable was in the best interest of the workers as well.
however workers were understandably frustrated that their wages did not earn enough to buy many consumer goods even at lower prices.
they also resented working in unsafe conditions that in some cases ruined their health and therefore their ability to earn a living.
increasingly workers organized to take complaints about wages and working conditions to their employers.
employers usually opposed the growing labor movement which they saw as a threat to their businesses and profits.
employers tended to view efforts to improve wages or working conditions as a violation of their property rights their right to run their businesses as they saw fit.
early labor protests as early as the 1820s factory workers tried to gain more power by using the technique of collective bargaining or negotiating as a group with their employer for higher wages or better working conditions.
a related tool to collective bargaining was the strike in which workers refused to work until certain demands were met.
most strikes were local but sometimes they involved workers in a whole industry across a state a region or the country.
the first national labor union founded in 1834 was the national trades union open to workers from all trades.
it lasted only a few years and no new unions formed in the wake of the depressions of the late 1830s.
however strikes succeeded in reducing the length of the workday in some regions.
by the mid 1800s a six day work week with a 10 hour workday became the standard in most new england factories.
gradually national unions began to reappear.
many working class families struggled to get by on low wages.
socialism influences labor in the 1830s a movement called socialism spread throughout europe.
socialism is an economic and political philosophy that favors public instead of private control of property and income.
socialists believe that society at large not just private individuals should take charge of a nations wealth.
that wealth they argue should be distributed equally to everyone.
in 1848 the german philosophers karl marx and friedrich engels expanded on the ideas of socialism in a treatise titled the communist manifesto.
this pamphlet denounced capitalism and predicted that workers would overturn it.
most americans rejected these ideas believing that they threatened the american ideals of free enterprise private property and individual liberty.
the wealthy in particular opposed socialism because it threatened their fortunes.
but many labor activists borrowed ideas from socialism to support their goals for social reform.
the knights of labor in 1869 uriah stephens founded a labor union called the knights of labor.
stephens a tailor who had lived and worked around the country included all workers of any trade skilled or unskilled in his union.
the knights also actively recruited women and african americans.
under stephens the union functioned largely as a secret society devoted to industry and immigration 81 1 3 the organized labor movement broad social reform such as replacing capitalism with workers cooperatives.
the preamble to the knights constitution written in 1878 read the recent alarming development and aggression of aggregated wealth which unless checked will inevitably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses render it imperative if we desire to enjoy the blessings of life that a check should be placed upon its power.
and a system adopted which will secure to the laborer the fruits of his toil.
preamble to the knights constitution 1878 in 1879 terence v powderly took on the leadership of the knights.
the son of irish immigrants he had worked as a machinist on the railroad before rising to become mayor of scranton pennsylvania in the 1870s.
powderly abandoned the secretive nature of the knights.
under his leadership the union used collective bargaining boycotts and the threat of strikes to win gains for workers.
but like stephens powderly puck.
kmiq8x of the r1mbtr8kth cxmtoky.
the knights of labor were sometimes portrayed in a comical fashion in the media.
also pursued reforms intended to free workers from wage labor.
he planned large scale manufacturing cooperatives which members workers would operate and take a share in the profits.
by 1885 the knights had grown to include some 700 000 men and women nationwide of every race and ethnicity.
by the 1890s however after a series of failed strikes the knights had largely disappeared.
many knights who worked in skilled crafts or trades abandoned the union for a new rival labor organization the american federation of labor.
a new organization for workers samuel gompers was a poor jewish immigrant from england who had worked his way up to head the cigarmakers union in new york.
in 1886 gompers helped found the american federation of labor afl and served as its president for nearly 40 years.
while the knights of labor was open to nearly all workers the afl was a loose organization of some 100 unions of skilled workers devoted to specific crafts.
these trade unions retained their individuality but gained strength in bargaining through their affiliation with the afl.
gompers set high dues for membership in the afl pooling the money to create a strike and pension fund to assist workers in need.
unlike the knights of labor the afl did not aim for larger social gains for workers.
instead it focused on specific workers issues such as wages working hours and working conditions.
in testimony before a government labor commission gompers argued in fact that unions and strikes were the only way workers issues such as these could be addressed we recognize that peaceful industry is necessary to successful civilized life but the right to strike and the preparation to strike is the greatest preventive to strikes.
if the workmen were to make up their minds tomorrow that they would under no circumstances strike the employers would do all the striking for them in the way of lesser wages and longer hours of labor.

analyze tables how were all of these labor unions similar.
what were some ways in which they differed.
focus on workers issues the afl was often called a bread and butter union.
the afl was not as successful as the knights in rapidly gaining the widespread support of workers partly because of its own policies.
it opposed union membership for women because gompers believed their presence in the workplace drove wages down.
while it was theoretically open to african americans member unions usually found ways to exclude them.
nevertheless by 1910 afl membership had reached two million workers.
h identify what similarities and differences existed in the goals of various labor unions.
labor unions lead protests as membership in labor unions rose and labor activists became more skilled in organizing large scale protests a wave of bitter confrontations between labor and management hit the nation.
the first major strike occurred in the railroad industry in 1877.
striking workers responding to wage cuts caused massive property destruction in several cities.
state militias were called in to protect strikebreakers or temporary workers hired to perform the jobs of striking workers.
finally the federal government sent in troops to restore order.
in the decades to follow similar labor disputes would affect businesses the government and the organization of labor unions themselves.
workers protest in chicago in may 1886 thousands of workers mounted a national demonstration for an eight hour workday.
strikes erupted in several cities and fights broke out between strikers and strikebreakers.
conflict then escalated between strikers and police who were brought in to halt the violence.
on may 4 protesters gathered at haymarket square in chicago.
the diverse crowd included anarchists or radicals opposed to all government.
a protester threw a bomb killing a policeman.
in the subsequent frenzy dozens of people both protesters and policemen were killed.
eight anarchists were tried for murder and four were executed.
the governor of illinois deciding that evidence for the convictions had been scanty pardoned three of the others.
the fourth had already committed suicide in jail.
the haymarket riot left an unfortunate legacy the knights of labor fizzled out as people shied away from radicalism.
employers became even more suspicious of union activities associating them with violence.
in general much of the american public at that time came to share that view.
steelworkers clash with the pinkertons in the summer of 1892 a carnegie steel plant in homestead pennsylvania cut workers wages.

the pinkertons killed several strikers and wounded many others in a standoff that lasted some two weeks.
then on july 23 an anarchist who had joined the protesters tried to assassinate frick.
the union had not backed his plan but the public associated the two.
recognizing that public opinion was turning against unions the union called off the strike in november.
the homestead strike was part of an epidemic of steelworkers and miners strikes that took place as economic depression spread across america.
in each case troops and local militia were called in to suppress the unrest.
a union addresses social issues in a pullman town in 1893 inventor george pullman whose pullman palace car company produced luxury railroad passenger cars laid off many of his workers and cut wages by 25 percent.
although the economic slowdown plaguing the nation at the time justified this action to some degree pullman did not reduce the rents in his company town near chicago where his workers lived.
in may 1894 workers sent a delegation to discuss their desperate situation with pullman.
he refused to negotiate and fired three workers.
his other workers responded by going on strike.
when pullman brought in strikebreakers the workers turned to the newly organized american railway union aru for help.
founded by former railroad worker eugene v debs the aru was organized as an industrial union grouping all railroad workers together rather than into separate trade unions according to the job they held.
debs believed that industrial unions allowed workers to exert united pressure on employers.
the aru ordered a nationwide strike against pullman.
by june 1894 nearly 300 000 railworkers were refusing to work on handle or move any trains that had pullman cars on them.
as the pullman strike escalated the nations railroad traffic came to a halt.
railroad owners cited the sherman antitrust act to argue that the union was illegally disrupting free trade.
since the nations mail moved by train the federal government took action to end the strike.
a federal court ordered a halt to the strike.
when debs defied the court order president grover cleveland sent in federal troops to force the strikers back to work.
debs was jailed for conspiring against interstate commerce.
debs appealed his conviction claiming that the government had no authority to halt the strike.
however the supreme court upheld debs conviction in the case in re debs in 1895 ruling that protecting interstate commerce and the private property rights of the railroads was a lawful exercise of government power.

employers hoping to maintain profitability and thus create more jobs appealed frequently for court orders against unions citing legislation like the sherman antitrust act.
the federal courts and other federal officials routinely supported these appeals denying unions recognition as legally protected organizations and limiting union gains for more than 30 years.
as the twentieth century opened industrialists workers and government continued to battle over numerous labor issues.
collective bargaining strikes and legislation would become the way of life for american industry.
in the decades after pullman the labor movement split into different factions some increasingly influenced by socialism.
by the end of the 1800s debs had become a socialist.
he helped organize the american socialist party in 1897 running for president in 1900.
in 1905 he helped found the industrial workers of the world iww or wobblies.
the iww was a radical union of unskilled workers with many socialists among its leaders.

many german and irish catholics had immigrated in the 1840s and 1850s and more arrived after the civil war.
some americans had prejudices against catholics but the irish spoke english and the german catholics benefited from the good reputation of their protestant countrymen.
although many lacked skills and money the children of these immigrants were often able to blend into american society.

many native born americans felt threatened by these newcomers with different cultures and languages.
causes of immigration the legal immigration of these immigrants changed demographic patterns in the united states.
two types of factors caused this immigration as they have caused people to immigrate before and after the rush at the turn of the twentieth century.
push factors are those that compel people to leave their homes such as famine war or persecution.
for example in the 1880s farmers had a difficult time in many parts of the world.
in mexico poland and china land reform and low prices for crops forced many farmers off their land.
some chose to come to america to make a new start.
beginning in the 1840s china and eastern europe experienced repeated wars and political revolutions.
these events disrupted economies and created political refugees.
one of the largest groups to settle in america were russian and eastern european jews.
beginning in the 1880s they fled religious persecution and came to the united states to live in safety and hopefully achieve a better life.
another type of factor that leads to immigration is a pull factor.
pull factors are those that draw people to a new place such as economic opportunity or religious freedom.
in addition to a vague hope for opportunity the united states offered special attractions including plentiful land and employment.
the 1862 homestead act and aid from railroad companies made western farmland inexpensive.
the railroads even offered reduced fares to get there because they needed customers in the west for their own businesses to succeed.
until 1885 immigrants were recruited from their homelands to build railroads dig in mines work in oil fields harvest produce or toil in factories.
others hoped to strike it rich by finding gold in the west.
many others were chain immigrants joining family or friends who had already settled in america.
the immigrants who had arrived earlier promised to help the newcomers find work and housing and sometimes they even sent them tickets for the journey.
immigrants may have lured their families and friends to america with the promise of religious and political freedom.

optimism and the immigrant experience immigrant experiences varied greatly.
however there were common themes a tough decision to leave home and family a hard and costly journey with an uncertain end and the difficulties of learning a new language and adjusting to a foreign culture.
in spite of the difficult road in front of them many immigrants were optimismic that moving to america would lead to better lives.
as one young russian jewish woman explained america means for an immigrant a fairy promised land that came out true a land that gives all they need for their work a land which gives morality through her churches and education through her free schools and libraries millions of people decided that such possibilities outweighed the risks and set out for the united states.
passenger manifests such as this tracked the vital information of immigrants who entered u s ports to begin their lives as americans.
the long journey to america coming to america was a big task.
travelers needed money for passage and to make a new start although some had only enough for a ticket.
the immigrants first task was to pack the items that would help them start a new life.
usually they brought only what they could carry clothes maybe a photograph of loved ones a cherished musical instrument or the tools of their trade.
next they made their way to a port of departure hoping that a ship would be leaving soon.
in war torn areas just getting to the ship could be dangerous.
by the 1870s steamships made the trip across the atlantic safer and faster than ever before.
however it could be an awful voyage.
most immigrants traveled in steerage the worst accommodations on the ship.
located on the lower decks with no private cabins steerage was crowded and dirty.
illness spread quickly while rough weather could force seasick passengers to stay in cramped quarters for days at a time.
under these conditions even healthy immigrants fell ill while frail passengers sometimes died.
on other voyages passengers were fortunate to have beautiful weather and no illness onboard.
immigrants arrive at ellis and angel islands the first stop for ships at american ports was a processing station where immigration officials decided who could or could not stay in the united states.
to enter immigrants had to be healthy and show that they had money a skill or a sponsor to provide for them.
often the sponsor was an industrialist who needed workers.
most european immigrants arrived in new york harbor.
beginning in 1892 they were processed at the busy new york harbor immigration station ellis island.
first and second class passengers were inspected on the ship and released unless they had obvious medical problems.
all third class or steerage passengers were sent to ellis island.
there immigration officers conducted legal and medical inspections.
since the shipowners did a preliminary screening before passengers boarded only about 2 percent of immigrants were denied entry the rest took a ferry to new york city.
in 1907 10 year old edward corsi arrived with his family from italy.
years later when he had become an immigration official he remembered his first impressions i realized that ellis island could inspire both hope and fear.

if ellis island was welcoming to some angel island was always formidable.
it was designed to filter out chinese immigrants.
officials often assumed that chinese newcomers would misrepresent themselves in order to gain entry.
while most immigrants left ellis island within hours chinese immigrants at angel island were often held for weeks or even months in poor conditions waiting to find out if they would be allowed to stay in the united states.
to pass the time and express their frustrations many carved poems into the walls at angel island.

the experience of asian immigrants like these ones on the west coast was often less welcoming than that of european immigrants in the east.
social issues affecting immigrants passing immigration inspections was just the first step.
once in america immigrants immediately faced tough decisions such as where to settle and how to find work.
on top of that most had to learn a new language and new customs.
sometimes immigrants worked with an agent who spoke their language for help finding work and housing but many agents took advantage of the newcomers to make money.
lucky immigrants had contacts through family and friends who could help them navigate a new and strange world.
americanization movement most new immigrants stayed in cities close to industrial jobs in factories.
there they often lived in ethnic neighborhoods with people who shared their native language religion and culture.
neighbors might have come from the same country region or even village.
by 1890 many cities had huge immigrant populations.
in san francisco and chicago immigrants made up more than 40 percent of the population.
four out of five inhabitants of new york city were foreign born or had foreign born parents.
while exclusionist policies forced some people to live in ghettoes these neighborhoods also provided familiarity.
specialty industry and immigration 89 1 4 the new immigrants shops grocers and clothing stores provided a taste of the food and culture that immigrants had left behind.
in many cities volunteer institutions known as settlement houses ran americanization programs helping newcomers learn english and adopt american dress and diet.
at the same time immigrants helped one another through fraternal associations such as the polish national alliance and the ancient order of hibernians an irish catholic organization.
these organizations based on ethnic or religious identity provided social services and financial assistance to encourage people to pursue economic opportunity while making them feel more at home in the united states.
many settlement workers and immigrants alike believed that american society was a melting pot in which white people of all different nationalities blended to create a single culture.
the term came from the name of a play that opened in 1908.
this model excluded asian immigrants who became targets of social and legal discrimination.
despite the hopes of settlement workers immigrants often held on to their traditions.

in many cities irish catholic churches stood side by side with italian catholic churches each built to serve the needs of its own community.
the immigrants churches schools and institutions reminded native born americans that new cultures were changing american society.
new immigrants face hostility accepting immigrants into american society was not always easy.
newcomers often faced nativism which was a tendency towards preferring native born white americans over new immigrants.
during the economic recessions of the late nineteenth century competition for jobs and housing fueled resentment.
many native born workers worried that immigrants would work for lower pay.
nativist intellectuals backed up their beliefs with dubious scientific rhetoric that linked immigrants physical characteristics to criminal tendencies or lesser intellectual abilities.
social darwinism also played a role in nativism.
religious and cultural differences sparked suspicion between native born americans and immigrants as well as between different immigrant ethnic groups.
many irish german italian and polish immigrants practiced roman catholicism and some protestants feared that catholics first loyalty was to the pope rather than to american ideals.
anti semitism in the united states was nothing new the u s army had briefly expelled all jews from grants military department in 1862 and the arrival of jews fleeing persecution in eastern europe only complicated the issue.
some native born jews worried that these eastern european immigrants who were culturally quite different than american or german jews would fuel anti jewish attitudes and that the newcomers would not be able to americanize.
some native born white protestants would not hire vote for or work with catholics or jews.
some americans even signed restrictive contracts agreeing not to rent or sell property to catholics jews african americans or other groups they considered non native policies restrict some immigration extreme hostility toward chinese laborers had led congress to pass the chinese exclusion act in 1882.
the act prohibited immigration by chinese laborers limited the civil rights of chinese immigrants already in the united states and forbade the naturalization of chinese residents.
the act had unintended negative consequences on the economy especially in states industry and immigration 90 1 4 the new immigrants such as california that relied on cheap chinese labor.
restricting the immigration of chinese laborers made it difficult for large single crop ranches to be profitable.
the act also prevented many chinese in the united states from visiting their families in china fearing they would not be permitted to return.
in 1898 a court case established that chinese people born in america were united states citizens and could therefore come and go freely.
however many immigration officials ignored this ruling.
in the same year congress passed another act that prohibited the entry of anyone who was a criminal immoral a pauper or likely to need public assistance.
in practice the law was used to bar many poor or handicapped immigrants.
these acts marked the beginning of legislation restricting immigration in the united states.

industry and immigration 92 1 4 the new immigrants as one historian has noted america was bom on the farm and moved to the city.
in 1860 most americans lived in rural areas with only 16 percent living in towns or cities with a population of 8 000 or more.
by 1900 that percentage had doubled and nearly 15 million americans lived in cities with populations of more than 50 000.
migration to urban areas dining this time changed the demographics or statistical characteristics of the population of the united states.
this period was the beginning of an upsurge in urbanization that both reflected and fueled massive changes in the way americans lived.

americans migrate to cities in the late nineteenth century america experienced a period of urbanization in which the number of cities and people living in them increased dramatically.
still numbers and statistics do not tell the whole story of how americans became city folk.
urban people lived differently from rural people.
people in the country lived and worked on farms either owned by their family or rented from a larger landowner.
their work was driven by the growing cycle.
they did a lot of their work outside when weather permitted.
in contrast many people in cities worked for large companies inside factory buildings or sweatshops rode trolley cars or walked to work and lived in apartment buildings.
unlike farming factory work was a year round daily grind and workers had no control over their schedules.
over time this structured scheduling combined with the urban way of life became part of american culture.

womens opportunities in particular were dramatically expanded in urban areas.
in addition to factory work they could take in boarders do piecework or become domestic servants.
educated women found work as teachers or in offices as secretaries and typists.
while many city jobs offered only hard work for little reward cities offered variety promise and even a bit of glamour.
by saving part of their wages city workers might attain some comforts or perhaps even move into the growing middle class.
at the least they could increase their children s opportunities by sending them to school.
while some laborers were trapped in an endless cycle of poverty only the very poorest were unable to enjoy a somewhat higher standard of living in the late nineteenth century.
life was hard in the city but many americans still loved it.
horace greeley a politician and new york city newspaper editor wrote in the 1860s we cannot all live in cities yet nearly all seem determined to do so city churches theaters social clubs and museums offered companionship and entertainment.
transportation out of the city and to other cities was easily accessible.
in this period of growth and city streets became crowded as more and more people of various incomes and classes sought their fortunes in big cities.
expansion some migrants moved from city to city trying to improve their fortunes.
cities attract immigrants the demographics of many cities changed very quickly as legal immigrants came to the country.
by 1900 some urban areas had a population that was more than 40 percent foreign born.
some immigrants found their way to a city through happenstance while others joined family members or were recruited by companies needing labor.
in this way neighborhoods cities regions and industries often acquired a majority of workers from a particular locale.
for example employees at the steel mills of western pennsylvania were predominantly polish while the textile factories of new york became a center for eastern european jewish people.
domestic servants in the northeast were primarily irish women while scandinavians worked in the fish packing industry of the pacific northwest.
farmers migrate to urban areas demographic patterns also changed in response to the many rural to urban migrants who moved to cities in the 1890s.
for many rural americans making a living on a farm had become increasingly difficult.
in addition to unpredictable weather conditions isolation and limited opportunities farmers faced economic struggles that hindered their livelihoods.
new technologies enabled farmers to produce more crops but the greater supply caused prices to drop.
these factors combined with the excitement and variety of city life sparked widespread rural to urban migration.
however the move from farm to factory could be wrenching.
former agricultural workers often found themselves working in dim light and narrow confines.
the pace of work was controlled by rigid schedules with no slow seasons.
however factory work paid wages in cash which was sometimes scarce on family farms.
midwestern cities such as minneapolis st paul and chicago exploded in the decade between 1880 and 1890.
many of the newcomers were immigrants or migrants from the rural west.
they were attracted by land but also by economic opportunities.
african americans moving out of the rural south were also part of the migration although on a smaller scale.

american innovators stepped up to the task by developing new technologies to improve living conditions.
the middle and upper classes benefited most from the innovations but every city dweller was affected.
electric trolleys and subways building codes and other innovations increased the pace of urbanization and economic development in cities across the country.
engineers build skyward with steel the cities of the late nineteenth century began to take their modern form.
for the first time skylines became recognizable by their skyscrapers.
steel was first mass produced to create railroad rails but architects and engineers realized the possibilities of using this strong and resilient metal for the construction of buildings.
skyscrapers of ten stories and taller had steel frames and used artistic designs to magnify their imposing height.
inside they provided office space in cities that had no room left on the ground.
increased office space in turn allowed more businesses to establish themselves and more people to live in closer proximity to each other which further stimulated economic development in urban areas.
but tall buildings were only realistic because of other new technology.
in the 1850s elisha otis developed a safety elevator that would not fall if the lifting rope broke.
central heating systems were also improved in the 1870s.
technological innovations like these dramatically improved the standard of living in the united states.
in these years architecture emerged as a specialized career.
the american institute of architecture was established in 1857 to professionalize the practice.
its members encouraged specific education and official licensing in order to become an architect.
these professionals designed the buildings that were quickly becoming hallmarks of urban life public schools libraries train stations financial institutions office buildings and residences.

it was the beginning of a transportation revolution.
new industries revolving around mass transit public systems that could carry large numbers of people fairly inexpensively reshaped the nations cities.
commuter rail lines had carried people to areas in and around cities since the 1870s.
however they were powered by coal driven steam engines making them slow unreliable and dirty.

electricity on the other hand was quiet clean and efficient.
electric cars also ran on a reliable schedule and could carry many more people than horse drawn carts.
these advances in transportation were all made possible by the free enterprise system which applied technological innovation to the needs of daily life.
electric cable cars were not practical in every city however.
cables strung in narrow streets could block fire trucks and traffic congestion often prevented streetcars from running on schedule.
in 1897 boston solved this problem by running the cars underground in the nations first subway system.
new york city followed in 1904.
electric cable cars and subways allowed urban economies to expand even faster.
these new industries efficiently moved people in and around cities making it possible for urban populations to grow at an increasingly rapid pace.
middle and upper class people who could afford transit fares moved away from the noise and dirt of the industrial city.
they built housing in the cleaner quieter perimeter known as streetcar suburbs.
from there they rode mass transit into the center of the city to work shop or be entertained returning to their homes in the evening.
poorer people remained in city centers so that they could walk to work.
city planners lay out cities as cities grew larger and more complex architectural firms expanded to offer city planning services designed to make cities more functional and beautiful even as their populations skyrocketed.

mass transit allowed city planners to segregate parts of the city by zoning or designating certain areas for particular functions.
through the 1890s cities embraced designs that had separate zones for heavy industry financial institutions and residences.
they also built public spaces such as public libraries government buildings and universities.
parks and recreational spaces were one of the most important aspects of city planning.
since the 1850s cities had built parks as a solution to some of the problems of urban growth.
philadelphia purchased areas along the schuylkill river to protect the citys water supply from industrial pollution.

as immigrants and rural migrants arrived they crowded into neighborhoods that already seemed to be overflowing.
housing conditions worsen as newcomers moved into urban areas those who could not afford to ride mass transit had to live within walking distance of the industrial plants and factories where they worked.
housing in densely populated neighborhoods was often aging and usually overcrowded.
most urban workers lived in tenements low cost multifamily housing designed to squeeze in as many families as possible.
sometimes several families lived in one apartment or even one room.
they used the space for sewing clothes or doing other piecework to earn money.
for those who had moved from rural areas adapting to city life could be difficult.
typical rural areas had a small town or village with several small family farms located in the surrounding few miles.
people had little contact with others from outside the community but had daily access to acres of land and open air.
tenement owners usually lived in the suburbs or in fashionable downtown areas away from the industrial grime.
however they built apartments for desperate people who had little choice about where they lived.

unpaved streets were snarled with ruts and littered with trash and even dead horses that were left to rot.
alleys between tenements were clogged with food waste and trash.
only the newest urban dwellings had indoor toilets and the shared toilets in tenements often overflowed.
these conditions were perfect for breeding epidemics posing danger to everyone.
for example cholera a particularly dangerous illness reached epidemic proportions several times in the united states in the 1800s killing thousands.
cholera spreads when people drink contaminated water.
fresh water supplies and less burdened sanitary systems in rural areas often prevented these epidemics from happening.

the treaty included the black hills in the sioux reservation and it also promised a school and other communal buildings.
the sioux and other indians who signed the treaty agreed to live on a reservation under federal supervision with support from the federal government.

the americanization movement in 1871 congress had passed a law stating that no indian nation or tribe within the united states would be recognized as an independent nation tribe or power with whom the united states may contract by treaty indians were now to be dealt with as individuals.
one reason for this change was to weaken native americans tribal cultures.
reformers believed that indians had to give up tribal loyalties and behaviors before they could adopt mainstream american values and assimilate into american society.
the americanization movement aimed at native americans was also aimed at new immigrants from other countries.
one way reformers thought assimilation and americanization could be accomplished was with the passage of the dawes general allotment act sometimes known as the dawes severalty act by congress in 1887 which encouraged indians to become private challenges in the late 1800s 124 2 1 american indians under pressure property owners and farmers.
the dawes act ended the reservations tribal landholding system.
each indian family was allotted or assigned 160 acres of the tribe s reservation to own as a farmstead.
the size of these allotments was based on the eastern experience of how much land was needed to support a family.
in the arid west however the allotment was often not big enough.
to protect indian landowners from unscrupulous land speculators the dawes act specified that the land could not be sold or transferred from its original family for 25 years.
congress hoped that by the end of that time younger indians would embrace the values of farming and individual land ownership.
traditional tribal feasts dances and even funeral practices were outlawed and native american religions were discouraged.
to further speed assimilation missionaries and other reformers established boarding schools to which indian parents were pressured to send their children.
there indian children were to learn and live by the rules dress customs and culture of white america.
ultimately the struggle to retain their homelands freedom and culture proved tragic.
although many indian peoples faced these challenges with courage and determination tens of thousands died in war or on poverty stricken reservations.

even if a town had developed churches and schools it might become a ghost town abandoned when the precious metal disappeared.
in contrast denver colorado boise idaho and helena montana were among the cities that diversified and grew.
mining becomes big business the first western mining was done by individuals who extracted the minerals from the surface soil or a stream bed.
by the 1870s the remaining mineral wealth was located deep underground.
big companies with the capital to buy mining equipment took over the industry.
machines drilled deep mine shafts.
tracks lined miles of underground tunnels.
crews often recruited from mexico and china worked in dangerous conditions underground.
the arrival of the big mining companies highlighted an issue that would relentlessly plague the west water and its uses.
large scale mining required lots of water pumped under high pressure to help separate the precious metals from silt.
as the silt washed down the mountains it fouled water being used by farmers and their livestock.
despite these concerns the federal government continued to support large mining companies by providing inexpensive land and approving patents for new inventions.
mining wealth helped fuel the nations industrial development.
the transcontinental railroad impacts the frontier as industry in the west grew the need for a railroad to transport goods increased as well.
the idea of a transcontinental railroad a rail link between the east and the west was not new.
arguments over the route it should take however had delayed implementation.
while the civil war kept the south out of the running congress finally took action.
unlike europe where railroads were built and owned by governments in the united states not all railroads were built with government support they were built by private enterprise.
however congress encouraged construction of the transcontinental railroad in two ways it provided money in the form of loans and made land grants giving builders wide stretches of land alternating on each side of the track route.

railroads spur settlement and growth the completion of the transcontinental railroad inspired a flurry of similar railroad building.
by 1883 the northen pacific railroad had connected st paul minnesota with seattle in washington territory.
ten years later james j hill completed a competing railroad line between st paul and everett washington.
hill and his business partners built the great northern railway without any government support.
his low fares drew thousands of immigrants and other americans to migrate west and settle along his tracks.
his success allowed him to eventually gain control of the northern pacific too.
the effects of the railroads were far reaching.
they tied the nation together moved products and people and spurred industrial development.
they brought western meat and farm products to the tables of eastern consumers.
in turn goods manufactured in eastern factories moved west by train and improved the lives of settlers on the frontier.
once again the application of technological innovation by the free enterprise system was clearly raising the standard of living in the united states.
the growth of railroads also stimulated the growth of towns and cities.
speculators vied for land in places where a new railroad might be built and towns already in existence petitioned to become a stop on the western rail route.
railroads intensified the demand for indians land and brought white settlers who overwhelmed mexican american communities in the southwest.

analyze maps how might the physical geography of the west have affected where ranching most flourished.
longhorns and vaqueros long before the arrival of eastern settlers in the west mexicans in texas had developed an efficient system for raising livestock.
the texas longhorn which originated in mexico roamed freely and foraged for its own feed.
each owner marked or branded the cattle so they could be identified.
under this open range system property was not fenced in.
though ranchers claimed ownership and knew the boundaries of their property cattle from any ranch grazed freely across those boundaries.
when spring came the ranchers would hire cowboys to comb thousands of acres of open range rounding up cattle that had roamed all winter.
the culture of the cowboy owed its very existence to the mexican vaqueros who had learned to train horses to work with cattle and had developed the roping skills saddle lariat and chaps needed to do the job.
cowboys and cattle drives once the cattle were rounded up cowboys began the long cattle drive to take the animals to a railroad that would transport them to eastern markets.
the trek from texas colorado or montana to the nearest junction on the transcontinental railroad could take weeks or even months.
the cowboys work was hard dangerous low paying and lonely often involving months of chasing cattle over the countryside.
a band of cowboys often included a mix of white mexican and african american men.
cow towns cattle drives concluded in such railroad towns as dodge city kansas where the cattle were sold and the cowboys were paid.
these cow towns gave rise to stories about colorful characters often outlaws such as wild bill hickok doc holliday wyatt earp and jesse james.
they were also the site of rodeos competitions based on the cowboys skills of riding roping and wrestling cattle.
bill pickett an african american cowboy is credited with inventing bulldogging in which a cowboy leaps from his horse onto a steers horns and wrestles the steer to the ground.
the open range comes to a close open range ranching flourished for more than a decade after the civil war.
during that time several million cattle were driven from texas north to railroad stops in wyoming nebraska and kansas.
however by the mid 1880s the heyday of open range ranching came to an end.
several factors contributed to the demise of the open range.
the invention of barbed wire made it possible to fence in huge tracts of land on the treeless plains.
the supply of beef exceeded demand and the price of beef dropped sharply.

b check understanding how did the railroad affect the cattle industry.
farmers settle the plains the great plains were the last part of the country to be heavily settled by white people.
the region was originally set aside for indians because it was viewed as too dry for agriculture.
yet with the coming of the transcontinental railroad millions of farmers moved into the west in the last huge westward migration of european americans in the mid to late 1800s.
the push and pull factors that encouraged settlement were varied.
like the miners and cattle ranchers farmers were looking for a better life.
railroads advertised land for sale even sending agents to europe to lure new immigrants especially from scandinavia.
other immigrants fled political upheavals in their native lands.
westward migration and settlement throughout its history the nations westward expansion had been marked by migrants settling on public land they did not own.
these settlers called squatters pressured the government to allow them to gain ownership of this land.
in 1841 congress passed the preemption act giving squatters the right to buy up to 160 acres for 1 25 per acre before the land was offered for sale to other buyers.
this law set the stage for the homestead act passed in 1862.
under the homestead act the government offered farm plots of 160 acres to anyone willing to live on the land for five years dig a well and build a road.
these two laws encouraged further settlement and farming in the west eventually leading to the close of the frontier.
opportunities in the west such as mining and cattle herding were generally male occupations so much of the western migration was led by men.
but as farming expanded more women arrived too.
they all had a job to do such as tending the family and farm or working as an entrepreneur running a boardinghouse laundry or bakery.
some of the new settlers were former slaves who fled the south after the end of reconstruction.

the development of a plow that could tackle the sod covered land the grain drill that opened furrows and planted seed the windmill that tapped underground water and dryfarming techniques were some of the innovations that enabled farmers to succeed.
to spur development of better ways to farm congress passed the morrill act in elps 1862 which made land grants to states for the purpose of establishing agricultural colleges.
nothing however prepared farmers for a series of blizzards and droughts in the 1880s and 1890s that killed animals and ruined harvests.

the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo signed at the end of the mexican american war guaranteed the property rights of mexicans who lived in the southwest prior to the war.
still four out of five mexican americans who lived in new mexico lost their land as did mexican americans in other southwestern states.
this land loss resulted from several factors.
when anglo americans and mexican americans laid claim to the same land u s courts put the burden of proof on mexican americans to show that they really owned the land.
differences in legal customs and the fact that much of the land was held communally not individually made it difficult for many mexican americans to do so.

struggles and change across the west there is a sharp contrast between the picture of the west depicted in novels and movies and the reality of life on the plains.
the west was a place of rugged beauty but it was also a place of diversity and conflict.
tension over economic resources the various ways that settlers sought to use western land were sometimes at odds with one another.
conflicts between miners ranchers sheepherders and farmers led to violence and acts of sabotage.
grazing cattle ruined farmers crops and sheep gnawed grass so close to the ground that cattle could not graze the same land.
although miners did not compete for vast stretches of grassland runoff from large scale mining polluted water that ran onto the plains and everyone needed water.
and no matter who won native americans lost.
miners used a great deal of water in their mining operations often with negative consequences for farmers and ranchers.
early on geologist john wesley powell recognized water as an important but limited resource.
he promoted community control and distribution of water for the common good.
despite his efforts water usage remained largely unregulated a system that benefited some but disadvantaged others.
prejudices and discrimination conflict came in many guises.
for example ranchers often belittled homesteaders labeling them sodbusters to mock their work in the soil and their modest houses.
conflict also arose because the view of the ownership of natural resources varied.
for many generations mexicans had mined salt from the salt beds of the el paso valley.
mexicans viewed these areas as public property open to all.
however when americans arrived in the 1870s they laid claim to the salt beds and aimed to sell the salt for profit.
in 1877 in what became known as the el paso salt war americans and mexicans clashed over access to this crucial commodity.
when the battles ended the salt beds were no longer communal property.
now users would have to buy this natural product.

the following year the 1890 national census revealed the extent of population growth in the west when it concluded that there was no longer a square mile of the united states that did not have at least a few white residents.
the great american frontier was closed.
this was in part due to completion of transcontinental railroads which made it easier for people to migrate across the country.
the country the report said no longer had a frontier which at the time was considered an uninhabited wilderness where no white person lived.
the era of free western land had come to an end.
however the challenges and tensions were far from over.
controversies over indians land rights were still to come.
so too were more battles over water and over the mistreatment of minority citizens especially chinese and mexican americans.

why or why not.
workers with little regard for their qualifications.
parties held elaborate rallies and parades to get out the vote.
however candidates for the presidency did not take part in the campaign.
they felt it lowered the reputation of the presidency.
parties developed sophisticated political machines that reached virtually into every ward in every precinct in many cities in the nation.
in large cities political machines were often run by bosses or a small group of people.
these groups like tammany hall in new york city or the pendergast machine in kansas city controlled cities for decades.
the political machines worked by winning the loyalty of large immigrant groups by promising and in some cases delivering solutions to problems like poor sanitation or transportation.
the spoils system also played a role with political machines rewarding loyal organizers with city jobs.
with voter loyalty secured the political machine was assured of its political power and often became very corrupt.
the spoils system served as the glue that helped make the parties so powerful.
the postmaster general who headed the u s.
postal service for example could reward thousands of supporters with jobs.
likewise other officials could and did use federal contracts to convince people to vote for their candidates.
ironically political participation probably got a boost from the spoils system and the fierce partisanship of the era.
about 75 to 80 percent of all those who could vote did vote in presidential elections during the gilded age.
political cartoons alert the public though many americans saw nothing wrong with politicians rewarding their friends writers such as mark twain political cartoonists and others who thought about american politics expressed their concern about the damaging effects of corruption.
the bosses of the senate one of the most famous political cartoons of the time drawn by joseph keppler showed a cluster of businessmen representing various trusts glaring down on the chambers of the senate.
thomas nast created a series of cartoons which exposed the illegal activities of boss tweed and the tammany hall political machine in new york city.
eventually tweed was arrested.
he escaped and fled to spain.
while there tweed was identified through one of nasts cartoons.
the tammany hall machine however lived on.
civil service reform efforts the feeling that the spoils system corrupted government or at least made it terribly inefficient prompted a number of prominent figures to promote civil service reform.
the civil service is a system that includes federal jobs in the executive branch.
in a reformed system most government workers would get their jobs due to their challenges in the late 1800s 137 2 3 corruption plagues the nation expertise and maintain them regardless of which political party won the election.
reforming the spoils system did cause controversy.
without the spoils system politicians felt they would not attract the people needed to run their parties.
independent attempts by politicians to change the system failed.
for example when rutherford b hayes became president in 1877 he worked for civil service reform.
he even placed well known reformers in high offices.
however the republican party did not support his reform efforts.
it took the 1881 assassination of president james garfield by charles j guiteau to make civil service reform a reality.
guiteau shot garfield because he believed that the republican party had not fulfilled its promise to give him a government job.
the pendleton civil service act chester a arthur became president after the assassination of garfield.
while arthur defended the spoils system he supported the movement for civil service reform which had been strengthened because of public indignation over garfields assassination.
arthur signed the pendleton civil service act in 1883.
this act established a civil service commission which wrote a civil service exam.
individuals who wanted to work for the government had to take the exam and getting a job depended on doing charles j guiteau an unstable individual who felt he was owed a government position assassinated president garfield in 1881.

economic policy challenges continue the publics discontent was worsened by economic turmoil and uncertainty.
in the fall of 1873 one of the nations most influential banks failed apparently as a result of overextended loans to the expanding railroad industry.
a wave of fear known as the panic of 1873 spread through the financial industry and across the nation.
bank failures job losses and the uncertain economy added to the array of the nations concerns.
events such as this prompted political leaders to debate the best ways to keep the economy moving forward.
the tariff and monetary policy were critical economic issues during this time.
leaders looked to these two areas for ways to stabilize the economy but both issues were divisive.
the tariff issue sharply split the democrats and republicans.
monetary policy gave rise to independent political parties or movements that disagreed with the major parties commitment to the gold standard.
using the gold standard meant that the government would use gold as the basis of the nations currency.
paper money was backed by the governments gold reserves and could in theory be redeemed for actual gold americans continue to discuss tariffs the debate over the tariff had deep roots in american history.
the tariff or the tax on imports of manufactured goods and some agricultural products was created as early as 1810 to protect newly developed industries.
since then the debate to lower or increase tariffs continued.
differences over the tariff had divided the federalists and jeffersonians and the democrats and whigs.
during the gilded age it divided the republicans and democrats.
the tariff question became a major issue during the presidential election of 1888.
the republicans favored a high tariff arguing that it would allow american industries to grow and promote jobs in manufacturing.
democrats countered that high tariffs challenges in the late 1800s 138 2 3 corruption plagues the nation increased the costs of goods to consumers and made it harder for american farmers to sell their goods abroad.
different ideas about monetary policy two related factors turned monetary policy into a bitter issue during the gilded age.
during the civil war the federal government issued paper money known as greenbacks.
the greenbacks were fiat money or currency not backed by gold or silver.
after the war because the fiat money had contributed to wartime inflation a rise in prices the government retired or got rid of the greenbacks.
over the next century the united states and other major world economies would edge towards going off a metallic standard and onto fiat money gradually making the final move in the 1970s.
however in the 1870s the debate centered on whether to use gold or gold and silver to back the paper money.
in 1873 congress passed the coinage act of 1873.
this law reversed the government policy of backing money with both gold and silver.
using only gold meant that the money supply was smaller and each dollar would be worth more.
bankers and others involved in international trade favored the gold standard because it discouraged inflation and made dollars worth more overseas.
in contrast most farmers favored keeping silver to create inflation.
already struggling they hoped the rise in prices would increase their income.
those who favored the minting of silver in other words considering silver as money protested against what they termed the crime of 1873 and prompted congress to mint silver dollars.
the bland allison act passed in 1878 specified that the u s treasury make a certain amount of silver backed dollars each month but not as many as the free silver advocates would have liked.
the debate over whether to consider silver as money alongside gold continued until the passage of the gold standard act in 1900 which set gold as the only metal backing paper dollars.

southern farmers especially black sharecroppers faced the added problem of having to deal with dishonest merchants and landlords who paid less for crops and charged more for supplies than promised.

calling for the regulation of railroad and grain elevator rates.
in the mid 1870s the states of illinois wisconsin and minnesota enacted laws that set maximum rates for shipping freight and for grain storage.
the railroad companies challenged these grange laws in the courts.
the supreme court upheld some decisions and overturned others depending on the context of individual cases.
in one of the significant granger cases munn v illinois the court ruled against a chicago grain storage facility that challenged the constitutionality of an 1871 illinois law setting maximum rates for shipping freight.
this decision upheld the right of states to regulate private industries in some circumstances.
however in wabash v illinois 1886 the court ruled against state regulation.
in this decision the court overturned an illinois law by declaring that individual states did not have the power to regulate interstate commerce.
eventually the grangers helped to prompt the federal government to establish the interstate commerce commission icc to oversee interstate transportation.
farmers and the railroads disagree although the grange declined in the late 1870s farm protest remained strong.
faced with serious difficulties texas farmers in the 1870s began to organize and to negotiate as a group for lower prices for supplies.
the idea spread.
local organizations linked together in what became known as the farmers alliance.
these organizations soon connected farmers not only in the south but also in the west and for a brief period farmers of all races and ethnicities banded together for their common cause.
because of regularly rising rates the alliances wanted the government to regulate the interest that banks could charge for loans.
farmers alliance members also tried to convince the government to force railroads to lower freight prices so members could get their crops to markets outside the south at reduced rates.
the railroads however argued that their prices were justified by the expense of building the railroads to begin with and by intense competition between rail companies.
they had to charge high prices to earn profits and create more jobs.
often railroads would offer rebates or other incentives to larger shippers who used their rails.
in addition they would charge more to ship freight short distances than they would for long trips because they had competitors for long hauls but not for short hauls.
this was known as the short haul and long haul practice.
the interstate commerce act passed in 1887 prohibited several of these practices although it proved hard to enforce.

settlement house workers gave mothers classes in child care and taught english to immigrants.
they ran nursery schools and kindergartens.
they also provided theater art and dance programs for adults.

while visiting europe she was inspired by the work at toynbee hall a settlement house in london.
in 1889 addams opened hull house a settlement house in chicago.
over the years hull house grew to include 13 buildings.
through hull houses programs addams made significant social and economic contributions to the lives of the people living in its poor chicago neighborhood.
by educating poor children and adults these programs increased their earning power.
furthermore the success of hull house inspired other college educated middle class women to become social workers.
by 1911 the country had more than 400 settlement houses.
addams was also politically active.
she supported the progressive party candidacy of theodore roosevelt in 1912 and later helped found the american civil liberties union.

in 1902 kelley helped form the national child labor committee which successfully lobbied the federal government to create the u s childrens bureau in 1912.

in 1916 congress passed the keating owens act which banned child labor in all states.
however two years later the supreme court ruled the law unconstitutional.
it was not until 1938 that congress would end child labor for good.
progressives also tried to better childrens lives by improving education.
a number of states passed laws that required children to attend school until a certain age.
however there were heated debates about what children should learn and how they should learn.
some argued that they should be taught only work skills.
others said they should learn to appreciate literature and music.
most educators agreed that girls should learn different things from boys.
educator john dewey criticized american schools for teaching children to memorize facts but not to think creatively.

interactive gallery america comes of age 165 3 1 progressives drive reform against many labor laws but progressives continued to work towards the goal of protecting workers.
kj recall how did progressives work to help the urban poor.
progressive reforms impact government progressive reformers sought to reform the political process in order to reform society.
they wanted to free government from the control of political bosses and powerful business interests.
they wanted to give people more control over their government and make government more effective and efficient in serving the public.
reformers change city government just as the triangle shirtwaist factory fire spurred reformers to action so did another disaster.
in 1900 a massive hurricane left the city of galveston texas in ruins.
one of the greatest national calamities in american history the hurricane killed more than 8 000 people.
as an emergency measure galveston replaced its mayor and board of aldermen with a five person commission.
each commissioner was an expert in a different area of the galveston hurricane of 1900 destroyed countless structures such as this public school.
city affairs such as public safety or streets and sewers and headed the departments responsible for that area.
the commission form of government proved very efficient as the city carried out a tremendous rebuilding effort.
the following year galveston decided to permanently adopt the commission form of government.
known as the galveston plan many other cities decided to take up the commission form of government.
by 1918 nearly 500 cities had adopted some form of the galveston plan.
dayton ohio and other cities modified the plan by empowering the city council or commission to hire a professional city manager to oversee all of city government.
the new city governments curbed the power of bosses and their political machines.
the reform governments purchased public utilities so that electric gas and water companies could not charge city residents unfairly high rates.
progressive reforms impact political process progressives also pushed for election reforms taking up some populist ideas.
traditionally party leaders picked candidates for state and local offices.
but in wisconsin reform governor robert m la follette established a direct primary an election in which citizens themselves vote to select nominees for upcoming elections.
by 1916 all but four states had direct primaries.
progressives also wanted to make sure that elected officials would follow citizens wishes.
to achieve this goal they worked for three other political reforms the initiative the referendum and the recall.
the initiative gave people the power to put a proposed new law directly on the ballot in the next election by collecting citizens signatures on a petition.
this meant that voters themselves could suggest laws instead of waiting for elected officials to act.

x2 3 2 in the early 1900s a growing number of women were no longer content to have a limited role in society.
women activists helped bring about progressive reforms and won the right to vote.
in the years ahead women would continue the struggle to expand their roles and rights.
women gain rights expanding opportunities for women in the early 1900s more and more middle class women wanted to do more than fulfill their roles as wives and mothers.
they were ready to do other tasks besides the important ones of raising children cooking meals keeping the home clean and caring for family members.
they wanted to expand their role in the community education helped many women achieve their goals.
by the 1890s a rising number of womens colleges prepared them for careers as teachers or nurses.
some such as bryn mawr college in pennsylvania and the school of social work in new york trained them to lead the new organizations working for social reform.
the number of women attending college jumped.
by 1900 one third of all college students nationwide were women.
by attending college women expanded their own economic opportunities.
armed with education and modern ideas many middle class white women began to tackle problems they saw in society.
economic and social issues for women working class women had worked outside of the home for decades.
for these women working outside the home meant difficult jobs with long hours and dangerous conditions.
and they were usually expected to hand over their wages 168 to their husbands fathers or brothers.
many women labored in factories that made cigars or clothing.
others toiled as laundresses or servants.
immigrants african americans and women from rural areas filled these jobs and most of them had little or no education.
as a result they could easily be cheated or bullied by their employers.
without being able to vote women had little influence on the politicians who could expand their rights and look after their interests.
addressing economic issues a key goal of women reformers was to limit the number of work hours.
they succeeded in several states.
for example a 1903 oregon law capped womens workdays at ten hours.
five years later in muller v oregon the supreme court reviewed that law.
lawyer louis d brandeis argued that long working hours harmed working women and their families.
the supreme court agreed with brandeis.
based on their role as mothers it said women could be properly placed in a class by themselves.
as a result laws could limit their work hours even if similar laws would not be allowed for men.
at the time progressives viewed this decision as a victory for women workers.
in later years however this ruling was used to justify paying women less than men for the same job.
florence kelley believed that women were hurt by unfair prices for goods they had to buy to run their homes.
in 1899 she helped found the national consumers league ncl which is still active today.
the ncl gave special labels to goods produced under fair safe and healthy working conditions and urged women to buy them and avoid products that did not have these labels.
the ncl pushed for other reforms as well.
it backed laws calling for the government to inspect meatpacking plants to make workplaces safer and to make payments to the unemployed.
florence kelley also helped form the womens trade union league wtul another group that tried to improve conditions for female factory workers.
it was one of the few groups in which upper class and working class women served together as leaders.
the wtul pushed for federal laws that set a minimum wage and an eight hour workday.
it also created the first workers strike fund which could be used to help support families who refused to work in unsafe or unfair conditions.
women address social issues a main goal of progressive women was to improve family life.
they pushed for laws that could help mothers keep families healthy and safe.
one focus of this effort was the temperance movement led by the womens christian temperance union wctu.
the wctu like their male counterparts women workers like these women in a cigar factory near pittsburgh pennsylvania struggled with unpleasant and sometimes unhealthy working conditions.
women protested the production and sale of alcohol to generate support for the eighteenth amendment.
america comes of age 169 3 2 women gain rights along with other groups such as the anti saloon league promoted temperance the practice of never drinking alcohol.
members felt that alcohol often led men to squander their earnings on liquor and neglect or abuse their families.
formed in the 1870s the wctu gained strength during the progressive era.
the wctu was led by the influential speaker frances willard from 1879 until her death in 1898.
her work contributed to the passage of the eighteenth amendment in 1919 which outlawed the production and sale of alcohol.
temperance was willards primary goal but she also supported womens suffrage the right to vote.
she argued that women needed the vote to prohibit the sale of alcohol.
like many wctu members willard also promoted other social causes such as public health and welfare reform.
nurse margaret sanger thought that family life and womens health would improve if mothers had fewer children.
in 1916 sanger herself one of 11 children opened the country s first birth control clinic.

with money raised from educated black women the nacw set up daycare centers to protect and educate black children while their parents went to work.
bt recall what steps did women take to win workers rights.
women seek equal political rights one of the boldest goals of progressive women was suffrage.
they argued that women participating in the democratic process through voting was the only way to make sure that the government would protect children foster education and support family life.

although anthony and other women s right activists had favored ending slavery they felt betrayed when radical republicans did not include women in the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
in 1869 anthony and stanton formed the national woman suffrage association to fight for a constitutional amendment that would grant women the right to vote.
they argued that just as the constitution had been amended to extend the vote to african americans it should be amended to extend the vote to women.

while awaiting trial she toured the nation delivering a speech titled is it a crime for a citizen of the united states to vote anthony declared our.

in 1900 catt became the president of the nawsa.
she promoted what became known as her winning plan which called for action on two fronts to expand womens right to participate in the democratic process.
some teams of women lobbied congress to pass a constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote.
meanwhile other teams used the new referendum process to try to pass state suffrage laws.
the strategy at the state level eventually helped women win the right to vote in new york michigan and oklahoma.
catt introduced a society plan to recruit wealthy well educated women.
she and her army of workers signed on women from all levels of society including african americans mexican americans and jewish immigrants.

some went on hunger strikes stating that they would not eat until they could vote.
while in jail some women including paul were force fed to end their hunger strikes.

alice paul and her activists saw a golden opportunity.
the russians had just overthrown their czar established a republic and granted women the right to vote.

many reformers who hoped that indians could be assimilated into american society like immigrants found this position troubling.
the dawes act barred native americans from selling their plots of land for 25 years.
the law provided that they would then get the title to the land and become citizens.
this policy was intended to speed native americans assimilation into white society.

roosevelts path to the presidency roosevelt had graduated with honors from harvard university in 1880.
he spent only a few months studying law at columbia university before being elected to the new york state assembly.
after three years service there and after the deaths of both his mother and his wife alice roosevelt retired to a ranch in the west.
there he developed a love of the wilderness.

180 theodore roosevelt could not remain long out of the spotlight however.
by 1889 he had returned to politics.
as president of new york citys board of police commissioners he gained fame by fighting corruption.
president william mckinley noticed him and named him assistant secretary of the navy.
when the spanish american war broke out in 1898 roosevelt resigned the post to form the rough riders a volunteer cavalry unit that became famous during the war.
after the end of the conflict the young war hero was elected governor of new york where he pushed for progressive reforms.
his reform efforts annoyed republican leaders in the state however.
they convinced mckinley to choose roosevelt as his running mate so roosevelt would leave new york and them alone.
mckinley was reelected president in 1900 but within a few months he was assassinated and roosevelt became president.
he soon dominated public attention.
journalists vied for interviews with him and children begged their parents for a teddy bear the new stuffed animal named for him.
progressive reformers were pleased to see the benefits of the icc spreading namely that the powerful railroads were finally under control.
this pleased farmers as well who had long sought such regulation.
but the elkins act and the icc in general had costs.
he called his program the square deal.
its goals were to keep the wealthy and powerful from taking advantage of small business owners and the poor.
roosevelts idea of fair government did not mean that everyone would get rich or that the government should take care of the lazy.
he compared his square deal to a hand of cards.
when i say i believe in a square deal i do not mean to give every man the best hand.
if good cards do not come to any man or if they do come and he has not got the power to play them that is his affair.
all i mean is that there shall be no crookedness in the dealing.
theodore roosevelt 1905 intervening between owners and workers roosevelt often stepped in to labor disputes with the authority and power of the federal government.
one example was in 1902 when pennsylvania coal miners went on strike.
the miners wanted a pay raise and a shorter workday roosevelt sympathized with the overworked miners but he knew that a steady supply of coal was needed to keep factories running and homes warm.
he wanted the strike ended quickly.
first roosevelt tried to get mine owners to listen to workers concerns.
when this failed he threatened to send federal troops to take control of the mines and to run them with federal employees.
his threat forced the mine owners to give the miners a small pay raise and a nine hour workday.
for the first time the federal government had stepped in to help workers in a labor dispute.
this coal strike intervention was one of many steps roosevelt took to control the power of corporations.
within a year roosevelt convinced congress to establish the department of commerce and labor to monitor businesses engaged in interstate commerce.
the icc takes on the railroads the cost of shipping freight on railroads had been an issue since the 1870s.
railroad companies often could charge whatever they wanted.
the railroads power was especially troublesome for western farmers.
they had no other way to move their products to eastern markets.
in 1887 congress had created the interstate commerce commission icc to oversee rail charges for shipments that passed through more than one state.
people seize coal from a stalled train during the 1902 coal strike.
analyze images how does this image reinforce roosevelt s belief that it was important for the coal strike to end quickly.
america comes of age 3 4 reformers in the white house the icc was supposed to make sure that all shippers were charged the same amounts.
by 1900 though the supreme court had stripped away most of the iccs power.
so roosevelt pushed congress to pass the elkins act in 1903 which imposed fines on railroads that gave special rates to favored shippers.
in 1906 he got congress to pass the hepburn act which gave the icc even greater powers.
this law allowed icc for the first time to set maximum shipping rates.
the act also set maximum rates for ferries toll bridges and oil pipelines.
finally it gave any ruling by the icc the legal force of a court order.
progressive reformers were pleased to see the powerful railroads finally brought under control.
farmers who had long sought such regulation especially felts its benefits.
but the elkins act and the icc in general had costs as its critics pointed out.
the iccs five commissioners were not elected to their positions.
once appointed by the president and approved by the senate they could not be removed during their term.
some americans found the iccs independence from the public will and from all three branches of government to be troubling.
in addition when the icc exercised its new power and limited railroad rates its action harmed the economy.
the value of railroad stocks plummeted which helped to bring on the financial panic that swept the nation in 1907.
a trustbuster enforces legislation it did not take long for the president and his administration to earn a reputation as trustbusters in response to an antitrust suit filed by roosevelts attorney general the supreme court ruled in 1904 that the northern securities company a big railroad company was an illegal trust.
the decision forced the company to split into smaller companies.
the next year the court found that a beef trust and several powerful agricultural companies had broken antitrust laws.
roosevelt was not interested in bringing down all large companies.
he saw a difference between good trusts and bad trusts big businesses could often be more efficient than small ones he believed.
big business was bad he said only if it bullied smaller companies or cheated consumers.
so he supported powerful corporations as long as they did business fairly.
his supporters called him a trust tamer but some wealthy progressives criticized his trustbusting.
other critics claimed that his good trust bad trust distinction meant that antitrust laws were being applied unevenly and thus unfairly.
this practice may even have been unconstitutional a violation of the private property protections in the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
despite such criticisms most americans were pleased with the antitrust prosecutions.
however they were also conflicted.
they deeply distrusted and feared the big corporations huge concentrations of wealth and power.
but at the same time they treasured the consumer benefits the companies size often provided.
regulating the food and drug industries in 1906 muckraker upton sinclair published his novel early progressive legislation legislation sherman antitrust act 1890 national reclamation act 1902 jl l elkins act 1903 outlawed monopolies and practices that restrained trade such as price fixing provided for federal irrigation projects by using money from the sale of public lands imposed fines on railroads that gave special rates to favored shippers hepburn act 1906 authorized the federal government to regulate railroad rates and set maximum prices for ferries bridge tolls and oil pipelines meat inspection act 1906 allowed the federal government to inspect meat sold across state lines and required inspections of meat processing plants pure food and drug act 1906 allowed federal inspection of food and medicine and banned the shipment and sale of impure food and the mislabeling of food and medicine analyze charts which of these acts do you believe was the most important.
america comes of age 182 3 4 reformers in the white house the jungle.
his descriptions of the filthy unhealthy conditions in meatpacking plants revolted the public and infuriated the president having an immediate impact.
roosevelt urged congress to pass the meat inspection act that same year.
it provided federal agents with the power to inspect any meat sold across state lines and required federal inspection of meat processing plants.
today when we eat lunchmeat or grilled chicken we trust that federal inspectors have monitored the plant where it is produced.
if there is a serious problem the government can force the meatpacker to pull the product off the shelves before many people become sick.
this regulation is one lasting result of progressives insistence that the government take responsibility for food safety.
the pure food and drug act benefited the public by placing the same controls on other foods and on medicines.
although there was some concern that here again the federal government was taking on too much of the states constitutional police power most americans felt like the benefits outweighed the costs.
the act also banned the interstate shipment of impure food and the mislabeling of food and drugs.
today the food and drug administration fda still enforces this law and others.
the fda monitors companies to make sure people are not hurt by dangerous substances or dishonest labels.
for example before a drug can be sold it must be tested and approved by the fda.
b recall what was the purpose of such legislation as the hepburn act and the meat inspection act.
managing the environment roosevelts deep reverence for nature also shaped his policies.
the books he published on hunting and the rugged west reflected his fascination with the competition between humans and the wilderness.
he was pleased that the federal government had established yellowstone national park in 1872 to protect wildlife and he admired california naturalist john muir whose efforts had led congress to create yosemite national park in 1890.
conservation or preservation.
in 1891 congress had given the president the power to protect timberlands by setting aside land as federal forests.
following muirs advice roosevelt closed off more than 100 million acres of forestland.
however the president did not agree with muir that all wild areas should be preserved or left untouched.
some wild lands held analyze political cartoons what does this cartoon suggest about roosevelts differing approaches to regulating trusts.
president roosevelt met with john muir in yosemite national park california in 1903.
contrast how did roosevelts views on preserving wilderness areas differ from muirs.
interactive gallery america comes of age 183 3 4 reformers in the white house valuable resources and roosevelt thought those resources were meant to be used.
this view became clear in his forest policy.
in typical progressive style he called on experts to draw up plans for both conserving and using the forests.
roosevelt drew on the rational use ideas of gifford pinchot who led the division of forestry in the u s department of agriculture.
pinchot recommended a different approach that forests be preserved for public use.
by this he meant that forests should be protected so that trees would have time to mature into good lumber.
then the protected areas should be logged for wood to build houses and new areas placed under protection.
the object of our forest policy explained pinchot is not to preserve the forests because they are refuges for the wild creatures of the wilderness but rather they are the making of prosperous homes pinchots views came to dominate american policies toward natural resources.
conservation or the planned management of natural resources became government policy for managing public lands.
but private ownership inspired conservation too.
in some cases private ownership gave people the incentive to handle the natural resources on their land wisely so they would not damage the long term value of their property.
in all roosevelt worked with congress to establish five national parks and established 18 national monuments or historical landmarks under the antiquities act of 1906.
together these unique places formed the core of the national park service which was established in 1916 and still works today to conserve and share many natural and historic landmarks in the united states.
roosevelts views on land use went beyond the belief that public lands should in some cases be preserved or put to use for wider societal benefit.
in 1908 the supreme court of the state of maine handed down a decision saying essentially that the government could restrict the cutting of trees on private land in order to prevent erosion.
roosevelt backed up this governmental action publicly stating his view that the needs of the community outweighed the private property rights of individuals or industries.
this was a controversial stance.
the idea that private property whether a persons own personal property or that of his or her business is protected by the fifth amendment to the constitution is one of the bedrock ideals of american society and industry.
the fifth amendment states that no private property shall be taken for public use without just compensation many individuals and busines owners felt that restrictions on the use of their property such as those imposed by antitrust regulation or environmental protection regulation violated this right.

changes in population affect water policy another highly controversial natural resource issue was water.
over centuries native americans had used various irrigation methods to bring water to the arid southwest.
the situation changed in the late 1800s when newcomers began mining and farming in utah new mexico colorado nevada and california.
mining machinery required a great deal of water and watersharing systems long used by those states mexican american residents were challenged by the new people and businesses who arrived.
private irrigation companies came to the area staked claims to sections of riverbeds and redirected the water so farmers could revive or reclaim dried up fields.
as increases in population strained environmental resources bitter fights developed over who should own water rights and how the water should be shared.
roosevelt sprang into action on this issue.
he listened to nevada representative francis newlands who wanted the federal government to help western states build huge reservoirs to hold and to conserve water.
roosevelt pushed congress for a law that would allow it.
in 1902 congress passed the national reclamation act which gave the federal government the power to decide where and how water would be distributed.
the government would build and manage dams that would create reservoirs generate power and direct water flow.
this would make water from one states rivers and streams available to farmers in other states.
the full effect of the reclamation act was felt over the next few decades as water management projects created huge reservoirs and lakes where there had been dry canyons.
examples include the salt valley project in arizona and the roosevelt dam and hoover dam on the colorado river.
recall what was the purpose of the national reclamation act.
a new direction in presidential politics roosevelt left the presidency after two terms in office saying he wished to enjoy private life.
he was still a powerful force in the republican party however and he used that power to help his secretary of war william howard taft win the presidency in 1908.
roosevelt expected taft to continue his programs of managing business and natural resources.
political cartoonists analyze political cartoons what clues in this cartoon reveal what type of policies the author believes taft will enact as president.
made caricatures of roosevelt handing over what he called my policies to taft who seemed to have no ideas of his own.
tafts agenda differs but taft soon set his own agenda.
he approved the payne aldrich act 1909 which did not lower tariffs as much as roosevelt had wanted.
he also pushed congress to pass the mann elkins act 1910 which gave the government control over telephone and telegraph rates.
he encouraged congress to propose an income tax.
perhaps most importantly he dropped roosevelts distinction between good trusts and bad trusts.
tafts justice department brought lawsuits against twice as many corporations as roosevelts had done.
one result was that in 1911 the supreme court busted the trust built by the standard oil company.
but taft also supported what the court called its rule of reason which relaxed the hard line set by the sherman antitrust act.
the rule of reason allowed big monopolies so long as they did not unreasonably squeeze out smaller companies.
roosevelt publicly criticized these decisions.
then tafts attorney general sued to force u s steel to sell a coal company it had bought.
roosevelt who had earlier approved the purchase of the company fumed.
america comes of 185 3 4 reformers in the white house taft further infuriated roosevelt and other progressives in the republican party when he fired gifford pinchot for publicly criticizing secretary of the interior richard ballinger.
pinchot charged that ballinger who opposed roosevelts conservation policies had worked with business interests to sell federal land rich in coal deposits in alaska.
although a congressional investigation later cleared ballinger of these charges the damage had been done.
roosevelts response roosevelt began traveling the country speaking about what he called the new nationalism a program to restore the governments trustbusting power.
declaring himself as strong as a bull moose roosevelt vowed to tackle the trusts in a third presidential term.
the taft roosevelt battle split the republican party as an election neared.
progressives bolted from the republican party and set up the progressive party.
reformer jane addams nominated roosevelt as the progressive partys candidate for the 1912 presidential election.
the republicans nominated taft.
the question was whether a third party like the progressive party could have an impact in a national election.
a bitter election loomed.
wilson takes advantage of republican discord the split created an opportunity for the democrats and their candidate woodrow wilson to win the white house.
wilsons ideas had caught the attention of william jennings bryan who helped wilson win the democratic nomination.
as a student and later as a professor wilson had thought a great deal about good government.
his doctoral thesis congressional government had launched him on a career teaching in college before he became the reforming governor of new jersey.
wilson shaped his ideas into a program he called the new freedom.
his plan looked much like roosevelts new nationalism.
it too would place strict government controls on corporations.
in a speech on the new freedom wilson outlined his aim to provide more opportunities more freedom for small businesses.
the man with only a little capital is finding it harder and harder to get into the field more and more impossible to compete with the big fellow.

wilson endorses further regulation republicans theodore roosevelt and william howard taft introduced the country to forceful progressive presidents.
democrat woodrow wilson used the expanded power of the presidency to promote a far reaching reform agenda.
some of wilsons economic and antitrust measures are still important in american life today.
president wilson attacked what he called the triple wall of privilege the tariffs the banks and the trusts that blocked businesses from being free.
early in his first term he pushed for new laws that would bring down those three walls and give the government more control over the economy.
a new tax on income first wilson aimed to prevent big manufacturers from possibly charging unfairly high prices to their customers.
one way to do this was to lower the tariffs on goods imported from foreign countries so consumers could buy foreign goods if american companies prices were too high.
wilson called a special session of congress and convinced its members to pass the underwood tariff bill which cut tariffs.
tariffs had been one of the main sources of revenue or money coming in for the federal government.
to make up for the loss of tariff revenue the underwood tariff act of 1913 included a provision to create a graduated income tax.
the recently passed sixteenth amendment gave congress the power to collect an income tax without restrictions.
a graduated income tax means that wealthy people pay a higher percentage of their income than do poor people.
the revenue from the income tax more than made up for the money the government lost by lowering tariffs on imports.
taxing incomes proved to be a very controversial reform.
both republicans and conservative democrats strongly opposed ratification of the sixteenth amendment as did prominent business leaders.
the graduated tax became and continues to be the battleground between those who favor lower rates to stimulate economic growth and those who view it as a means to further public investment.
america comes of age 187 3 4 reformers in the white house regulation of commercial banks next wilson tried to change the banking system.
at the time the country had no central authority to supervise banks and establish monetary policy which is control of the supply of money in circulation at any given time.
monetary policy carried out by a central authority helps to influence and control interest rates with the goal of promoting economic growth and stability and controlling inflation and deflation.
without such a central authority interest rates for loans could fluctuate wildly and a few wealthy bankers had a great deal of control over national state and local banks reserve funds.
this meant that a bank might not have full access to its reserves when customers needed to withdraw or borrow money.
wilson pushed congress to pass the federal reserve act 1913.
this law placed commercial banks under the control of a federal reserve board which set up regional banks to hold the reserve funds from those commercial banks.
this system still in place today helps protect the american economy from having too much money end up in the hands of one person bank or region.
the federal reserve board also sets the interest rate that banks pay to borrow money from other banks and it supervises banks to make sure they are well run.
the financial community bitterly opposed passage of the federal reserve act.
critics claimed that it gave the federal government too much control over the nations economy and banking system a point of view that some americans still hold today.
however some historians have called the federal reserve act the most important piece of economic legislation before the 1930s.
wilson and congress strengthen antitrust regulation like presidents before him wilson focused on trusts.
he agreed with roosevelt that trusts were not dangerous as long as they did not engage in unfair practices.
in 1914 wilson persuaded congress to create the federal trade commission ftc.
members of this group were named by the president to monitor business practices that might lead to monopoly.
the ftc was also charged with watching out for false advertising or dishonest labeling.
congress also passed the clayton antitrust act 1914 which strengthened earlier antitrust laws by spelling out those activities in which businesses could not engage.
these laws are still in effect today protecting both businesses and consumers from abusive business activities.
in recent years the ftc has prosecuted companies that traded stocks dishonestly and fined companies that published false ads.
the ftc also regulates buying on the internet.

workers gain rights the clayton antitrust act also ushered in a new era for workers by protecting labor unions from being attacked as trusts.
now workers could organize more freely.
samuel gompers of the american federation of labor afl praised the new law as the magna carta of labor.
on the heels of these protections came the workingmans compensation act 1916 which gave wages to temporarily disabled civil service employees.
that same year wilson pushed for the adamson act to prevent a nationwide railroad strike which would have stopped the movement of coal and food leaving millions of americans cold and hungry.
railroad union leaders insisted on the eight hour day but railroad managers would not accept it.
wilson called many company leaders to the white house pleading with them to change their minds and avert a strike.
when those efforts failed he worked with congress to pass the adamson act which limited railroad employees workdays to eight hours.
however wilson did not always support organized labor as a tragic incident known as the ludlow massacre showed.
in the fall of 1913 coal miners in ludlow colorado demanded safer conditions higher pay and the right to form a union.
when the coal company refused they walked off the job.
evicted from company housing the miners and their families set up in a tent city near the mines.
the strike continued through the winter.
then on april 20 1914 the colorado national guard opened fire on the tent city and set fire to the tents killing some 26 men women and children.
in the end wilson sent federal troops to restore order and break up the strike.

the progressives legacy the political reforms of the progressives had a lasting effect on the american political system.
the initiative referendum and recall and the seventeenth and nineteenth amendments expanded voters influence.
progressive reforms also paved the way for future trends.
starting in this period the federal government grew to offer more protection to americans but at the same time gaining more control over peoples lives.
the american economy today showcases the progressives legacy.
antitrust laws the federal reserve board and the other federal agencies watch closely over the economy.
controls that roosevelt and wilson put in place continue to provide consumer protections.
in later years the government for better or worse built on those actions to extend regulation over other aspects of business.
the progressive years also greatly expanded the governments role in managing natural resources.
however federal action on dams national parks and resource use remain major areas of debate especially in the west.
those debates and decisions affect people in other regions as well.
for example while farmers america comes of age 189 3 4 reformers in the white house in california arizona or new mexico worry about getting enough water to grow crops the rest of the nation awaits the delivery of the food they grow.
it is true that many of the problems identified by the progressives still plague us today.

america comes of age 190 3 4 reformers in the white house for most of its early history america played a small role in world affairs mostly by choice.
but in the late 1800s this began to change.
with leading spokesmen calling for the united states to join the ranks of the worlds major powers the united states began to acquire influence and territories outside its continental borders.
the united states was abandoning isolationism and emerging as a new power on the global stage.
american influence grows america on the world stage during the age of imperialism from the mid 1800s through the early 1900s powerful nations engaged in a mad dash to extend their influence across much of the world.
european nations added to colonies they had established during the age of exploration by acquiring new colonies in africa and asia.
following european success japan and the united states also began to consider the benefits of imperialism the policy by which strong nations extend their political military and economic control over weaker territories.
although imperialism would prove an awkward fit for the united states the nations desire to take its place on the world stage spurred some territorial expansion and a larger increase in influence.
economic causes of imperialism one reason why europeannations and japan rushed to grab colonies was the desire for raw materials and natural resources.
they sought colonies to provide tea rubber iron petroleum and other materials for their industries at home.
these colonial economies were examples of extractive economies.

191 and shipped them to the home country.
possession of colonies gave nations an edge in the competition for global resources.
in contrast to those other world powers however the resource rich united states had fewer concerns about shortages of raw materials in the nineteenth century.
for americans the problem was not a shortage of materials but a surplus of goods.
the booming u s economy of the late 1800s was producing more goods than americans could consume.
farmers complained that excess production resulted in declining crop prices and profits.
industrialists urged expanding trade into new overseas markets where american commodities could be sold.
otherwise they warned american factories would close and unemployment would rise.
senator albert j beveridge a progressive and friend of theodore roosevelt explained why the united states needed to become a world power today we are raising more crops than we can consume.
today we are making more than we can use.
therefore we must find new markets the uss brooklyn played a substantial role in american naval operations in the caribbean sea and in asia.

senator albert j beveridge the march of the flag 1898 alfred t mahan stresses u s military strength to expand and protect their interests around the world nations built up their military strength.
alfred t mahan a military historian and an officer in the united states navy played a key role in transforming america into a naval power.
in the influence of sea power upon history mahan asserted that since ancient times many great nations had owed their greatness to powerful navies.
mahan believed strongly that control of the seas during wartime was crucial to a nations success.
he called upon america to build a modern fleet.
mahan also argued that the united states would need to acquire foreign bases where american ships could refuel and gather fresh supplies.
influenced by the ideas of mahan and others the united states expanded and modernized its navy by building new steel plated steampowered battleships such as the uss maine.
by 1900 the united states had the third largest navy in the world.
leaders such as u s.
senator henry cabot lodge a strong supporter of american expansionism continued to encourage a naval build up into the early twentieth century.
lodge and others believed that the a strong navy was vital to the protection of u s interests both at home and abroad.
social darwinism missionaries and national superiority european and japanese imperialists used ideas of racial national and cultural superiority to justify taking over colonies.
one of these ideas was social darwinism the belief that life consists of competitive struggles in which only the fittest survive.
social darwinists felt that certain nations and races were superior to others and therefore were destined to rule over inferior peoples and cultures.
some prominent americans embraced these ideas and began to worry that if the united states remained isolated while european nations gobbled up the rest of the world america would not survive.
one reason that these americans embraced social darwinism was that they had long believed that god had granted them the right and responsibility to settle the frontier.
they spoke of americas manifest destiny to expand all the way to the pacific ocean.
in a best selling work titled our country josiah strong picked up on this theme.
a religious missionary strong argued that americans had a responsibility to spread their western values.
god is training the interactive chart america comes of age 192 3 5 american influence grows anglo saxon race he asserted for its mission to civilize weaker races influenced by strong many american missionaries journeyed to foreign lands to gain converts to christianity.
although missionaries were often motivated by a sincere desire to spread their faith the linking of missionary work to the concept of u s expansionism strengthened american presence in these territories.
in the significance of the frontier in american history historian frederick jackson turner noted that the frontier had been closed by gradual settlement in the nineteenth century.
throughout american history he continued the frontier had traditionally supplied an arena where ambitious americans could pursue their fortunes and secure a fresh start.
it had thus served as a safety valve siphoning off potential discontent.
now that america had spanned the continent advocates of turner s thesis urged overseas expansion as a way to keep the safety valve open and avoid internal conflict.

america begins to expand beginning in the mid 1800s with little fanfare america focused more and more on expanding its trade and acquiring new territories.
one of americas first moves toward world power came before the civil war.
american expansionism in the pacific begins in 1853 commodore matthew perry sailed a fleet of american warships into present day tokyo bay japan.
prior to perrys arrival japan had denied the rest of the world access to its ports.
in fact because most japanese people had never seen steamships before they thought the ships in perrys fleet were giant dragons puffing smoke perry cleverly won the japanese emperor s favor by showering him with lavish gifts.
japanese leaders also realized that by closing off their nation to the outside world they had fallen behind in military technology.

the klondike gold rush in 1867 secretary of state william seward bought alaska from russia for 7 2 million.
journalists scoffed at the purchase and referred to alaska as sewards folly and sewards icebox they wondered why the united states would want a vast tundra of snow and ice 1 000 miles north of its border.
but sewards purchase almost doubled the countrys size and the icebox turned out to be rich in timber oil and other natural resources.
alaska also greatly expanded americas reach across the pacific.
scholars today see sewards purchase as a key milestone on americas road to power.
by the mid 1880s gold had been discovered in several locations near alaska sparking the klondike gold rush.
the stampede to the klondike goldfields in british columbia and yukon territory led to the development of new towns in alaska.

americans had also established sugar cane plantations there.
in 1887 american planters convinced king kalakaua kah lah kah oo ah to amend hawaiis constitution so that voting rights were limited to only wealthy landowners who were of course the white planters.
influence of dole and other americans in hawaii in the early 1890s american planters in hawaii faced two crises.
first a new u s tariff law imposed duties on previously duty free hawaiian sugar.
this made hawaiian sugar more expensive than sugar produced in the united states.
the sugar growers in hawaii therefore feared that they would suffer decreasing sales and profits.
the other problem was that in 1891 kalakaua died and his sister liliuokalani lih lee oo oh kah lah nee was his successor.

president william mckinley warned the spanish to quickly establish peace or the united states would take whatever steps it should deem necessary to procure this result spain recalled general weyler and offered the cuban rebels some reforms.
but the rebels insisted on independence which spain refused to grant.
mckinley ordered the battleship maine to havana harbor to protect american citizens in cuba.

u s marines captured guantanamo bay and a force of 17 000 soldiers under u s army general william shafter stormed ashore east of santiago.
in spite of their excitement for the war the troops faced deplorable conditions.
they were poorly trained and supplied.
as they assembled for duty around tampa florida the soldiers were issued obsolete weapons and heavy wool uniforms that were unsuitable for cuba s tropical climate.
corrupt and inefficient officials provided the men with rotting and contaminated food.
general shafters army consisted of state national guard units and regular army units including the african american ninth and tenth cavalry regiments from the western frontier.
another cavalry unit was organized and commanded by the future president theodore roosevelt.
his rough riders consisted of rugged westerners and upper class easterners who relished what roosevelt called the strenuous life the rough riders and roosevelt gained fame for the role they played in the battles for kettle and san juan hills outside santiago cuba.

spain gave up control of cuba puerto rico and the pacific island of guam.

the teller amendment passed by congress when it declared war on spain prevented the united states from taking possession of cuba.
the amendment did not however apply to the philippines.
americans disagreed over whether to grant the philippines independence or take full control of the pacific nation.
guam with its excellent harbor and mid pacific location was desired as a coaling station to fuel u s navy and merchant ships traveling to the far east.
between 1898 and 1950 aside from the period of its occupation by japan during world war ii guams governor was an american naval officer appointed from washington d c.

they argued that the united states had a responsibility to govern the filipinos.
they reasoned that the islands represented a valuable stepping stone to trade in china.
they warned that if the united states gave up the philippines other nations would take control of them.
anti imperialists including william jennings bryan and mark twain rejected these arguments.
in 1899 a large group of anti imperialists formed the american anti imperialist league.
the league condemned imperialism as a crime and attacked it as open disloyalty to the distinctive principles of our government the debate reached its climax in the u s senate where senators had to consider ratifying the treaty of paris.
in february 1899 the senate voted 57 to 27 in favor of the treaty.
by a single yes ballot the vote met the two thirds majority necessary to ratify the treaty.
although the military conflict had been expensive its economic effects on the united states were mainly positive.

his forces had fought side by side with the americans against the spanish.
however after the united states decided to maintain possession of the philippines aguinaldo grew disillusioned with america.
he helped organize an insurrection or rebellion against u s rule.
the rebels believed they were fighting for the same principle of self rule that had inspired america s colonial patriots during the american revolution.
guerrilla war erupts in the philippines outgunned by american troops filipino insurgents relied on guerrilla warfare a form of nontraditional warfare generally involving small bands of fighters attacking behind enemy lines.
in turn the american military used extraordinary measures to crush the rebellion.

americas new acquisition of puerto rico remained under direct u s military rule.
in 1900 congress passed the foraker act which established a civil government in puerto rico.
the act authorized the president of the united states to appoint a governor and part of the puerto rican legislature.
puerto ricans could fill the rest of the legislature in a general election.
whether puerto ricans could enjoy citizenship rights in the united states however remained unclear.
this unusual situation led to a series of court cases known as insular cases in which the supreme court determined the rights of puerto ricans.
one case examined whether the u s government could assess taxes on puerto rican goods sold in the united states.
the supreme court ruled the taxes legal and determined that puerto ricans did not enjoy the same rights as u s citizens.
in 1917 president woodrow wilson signed the jones shafroth act.
it granted puerto ricans more citizenship rights and gave the islanders greater control over their own legislature.
still many puerto ricans expressed their discontent because they did not enjoy all of the same rights as americans.
relations with cuba although the treaty of paris granted cuban independence the united states army did not withdraw from the island until 1902.
but before the u s military left congress obliged cuba to add to its constitution the platt amendment.
the amendment restricted the rights of newly independent cubans and effectively brought the island within the u s sphere.
it prevented cuba from signing a treaty with another nation without american approval.
it also required cuba to lease naval stations to the united states.
additionally the platt amendment granted the united states the right to intervene to preserve order in cuba.
many cubans strongly disliked the platt amendment but soon realized that america would not otherwise end its military government of the island.
the united states for its part was unwilling to risk cubas becoming a base for a potentially hostile great power.
cuba thus added the platt amendment to its constitution as part of a treaty with the united states.
the treaty made cuba a protectorate of the united states and governed their relationship for decades.

america comes of age 207 3 7 the united states emerges as a world power big stick diplomacy upon assuming the presidency after mckinleys assassination theodore roosevelt promoted a new kind of diplomacy based on americas success in the spanish american war.
beyond determining what would happen to puerto rico and cuba roosevelt developed a broader policy for u s action in latin america.
historians have called this roosevelts big stick diplomacy since it depended on a strong military to achieve americas goals.
big stick stemmed from the presidents admiration for an old african saying speak softly and carry a big stick you will go far roosevelts view that america needed to carry a big stick during the age of imperialism flowed from his adherence to balance of power principles and from his view of the united states as a special nation with a moral responsibility to civilize or uplift weaker nations.
in this sense the new president held beliefs similar to those of imperial powers in europe and asia.
roosevelt also felt that americas elite its statesmen and captains of industry had to accept the challenge of international leadership.
physical and human geographic factors impact the panama canal one of roosevelts biggest dreams was to create a passage from the caribbean ocean to the pacific ocean through central america.
he did not originate the plan but he played a crucial role in making it happen.
but first roosevelt and the american team of engineers worked to overcome a number of human and physical geographic challenges.
in the late 1800s a french company had tried to link the atlantic to the pacific across the isthmus of panama but failed.
afterwards some suggested building a canal through nicaragua.
however those plans came to nothing.
eventually an agent from the french company that had abandoned its canal attempt convinced the united states to buy the companys claim.
in 1903 the u s government bought the panama route for 40 million.
before it could build a canal through panama however the united states needed the consent of the colombian government.
at the time panama was part of independent colombia.
american efforts to negotiate a purchase of land across the isthmus stalled when colombia demanded more than the united states was willing to provide.
so roosevelt stepped in.
the president dispatched u s warships to the water off panama to support a panamanian rebellion against colombia.
the appearance of the united states navy convinced the colombians not to suppress the uprising.
panama soon declared its independence from colombia.
the new nation immediately granted america control over the canal zone to secure this land for its vital trade link n 2 000 mi 0 2 000 km miller cylindrical projection the panama canal san francisco atlantic ocean pacific ocean key route before panama canal route after panama canal analyze maps how did the construction of the panama canal benefit longdistance shippers.

interactive map america agreed to pay panama 10 million and an annual rent of 250 000.
more than 35 000 workers helped dig the panama canal.
the physical geography and climate of the region were both factors that impacted the enormous project.
workers built a series of locks to raise ships to the level of gatun lake 85 feet above sea level to cross the isthmus.
completion of the canal depended on scientific breakthroughs by doctors as they learned how to combat tropical diseases.
still more than 5 000 canal workers died from disease or accidents while building the canal.
when the finished waterway opened in 1914 it cut some 8 000 nautical miles off the trip from the west coast to the east coast of the united states.
american expansionism requires an updated monroe doctrine in the early 1900s the inability of latin american nations to pay their debts to foreign investors raised the possibility of european intervention.
in 1903 for example germany and britain blockaded venezuelan ports to ensure that debts to european bankers were repaid.
roosevelt concluded if we intend to say hands off to the powers of europe then sooner or later we must keep order ourselves so in a 1904 message to congress he announced a new latin american policy.
the presidents roosevelt corollary updated the monroe doctrine for an age of expansionism and economic influence.
in the case of chronic wrongdoing by a latin american nation the kind that europeans might use to justify military intervention the united states would assume the role of police power restoring order and depriving other creditors of the excuse to intervene.
this change roosevelt argued merely reasserted america s long standing policy of keeping the western hemisphere free from european intervention.
the latin american response many latin americans resented americas role as the hemispheres police force.
they disagreed with roosevelts belief that latin americans could not police themselves.
francisco garcia calderon a peruvian diplomat contended that the monroe doctrine had taken on an aggressive form with mr roosevelt like calderon nicaraguan spokesman augusto sandino felt that the united states threatened the sovereignty and liberty of his people.
sandino eventually led an army of guerrillas against u s marines in nicaragua in the 1920s.
tafts foreign policies lead to dollar diplomacy roosevelt handpicked william howard taft to succeed him as the republican candidate for president in 1908.
taft shared roosevelts basic foreign policy objectives.
after defeating william jennings bryan in the general election taft wanted to maintain the open door policy america comes of age 209 3 7 the united states emerges as a world power in asia and ensure ongoing stability in latin america.
the new president pursued both goals with the aim of affecting economic issues such as expanding american trade through foreign policy.
taft hoped to achieve these ends by relying less on the big stick and more on dollar diplomacy as taft commented in 1912 he looked to substitute dollars for bullets the policy aimed to increase american investments in businesses and banks throughout central america and the caribbean.
americans busily invested in plantations mines oil wells railways and other ventures in those regions.
of course dollar diplomacy sometimes required a return to the big stick and military intervention.
such was the case when president taft dispatched troops to nicaragua in 1909 and again in 1912 to protect the formation of a pro american government there.
identify main ideas how did dollar diplomacy affect american foreign policy.
wilsons moral diplomacy during the 1912 presidential election campaign democratic candidate woodrow wilson criticized the foreign policies of his republican predecessors theodore roosevelt and william howard taft.
after his election victory wilson appointed the anti imperialist william jennings bryan as secretary of state which sent a strong message to the american people.
a new emphasis on foreign policy the new president intended to take u s foreign policy in a different direction.
he promised that the united states would never again seek one additional foot of territory by conquest but would instead work to promote human rights national integrity and opportunity wilson spelled out his new moral diplomacy in a message to the american people we must prove ourselves latin americas friends and champions upon terms of equality and honor.
we must show ourselves friends by comprehending their interest whether it squares with our own interest or not.
comprehension must be the soil in which shall grow all the fruits of friendship.
i mean the development of constitutional liberty in the world.
woodrow wilson october 27 1913 contrast how did roosevelt and wilson differ in their approach to governing colonial territories.
america comes of age 210 3 7 the united states emerges as a world power in spite of his stated preference for moral diplomacy over big stick or dollar diplomacy wilson used the military on a number of occasions to guide latin americans in the directions that he thought proper.
in 1915 wilson sent marines to haiti to protect american investments and to guard against the potential of german or french aggression in the nation.
wilson prodded the government of haiti to sign an agreement that essentially gave the united states the right to control its financial and foreign affairs.
the marines did not leave until 1934.
under wilson u s soldiers and sailors also intervened in the dominican republic and in mexico.
revolution grips mexico for decades mexican dictator porfirio diaz had followed policies that benefited his countrys small upper class of wealthy landowners clerics and military men.
with diazs encouragement foreign investments in mexico grew.
as a result american business leaders owned large portions of mexicos industries.
while foreign investors and mexicos artistocracy grew rich mexicos large population of farmers struggled in poverty.
in 1911 francisco madero led the mexican revolution that toppled diaz.
madero was committed to reforms but was a weak administrator.
in 1913 general victoriano huerta seized power and executed madero.
under dollar diplomacy taft likely would have recognized huerta as the leader of mexico because huerta pledged to protect american investments.
but under moral diplomacy wilson refused to do so declaring that he would not accept a government of butchers instead wilson favored venustiano carranza another reformer who had organized anti huerta forces.
intervention in mexico in 1914 the president used the mexican arrest of american sailors as an opportunity to help carranza attain power.
wilson sent marines to occupy the mexican port of veracruz.
the action caused huertas government to collapse and carranza assumed the presidency.
huertas fall from power cheered many mexicans and appeared to validate wilsons moral diplomacy however wilson soon discovered that he faced more trouble in mexico.
the new carranza government was slow in bringing about reforms and rebels again rose up this time under the leadership of francisco pancho villa.
for a while wilson courted villa.
after american support disappeared in 1916 villas forces crossed into new mexico and raided the town of columbus leaving 18 americans dead.
president the united states supported mexican rebel leader pancho villas insurrection against the mexican government until his forces conducted an attack in the united states in 1916.
wilson responded by sending general john j pershing and more than 10 000 troops on a punitive expedition to mexico.
pershings forces chased villa for several months but failed to capture the rebel leader.
wilson eventually withdrew american troops from mexico in 1917 mostly because of his concerns about world war i raging in europe.
not long afterward the united states declared war on germany.
free from hunting villa pershing took command of the american expeditionary force in france.
a generation earlier few would have believed it possible that more than one million american troops would engage in a large scale war in europe.
but the triumph over spain and u s actions in asia and latin america demonstrated that america had emerged as a world power.
now world war i would test that new global strength.

europe was sitting on a powder keg of nationalism regional tensions economic rivalries imperial ambitions and militarism.
key terms alsace lorraine militarism francis ferdinand william ii western front casualty contraband u boats lusitania zimmermann note nationalism escalates tension in europe nationalism or devotion to ones nation kick started international and domestic tension.
in the late 1800s many europeans began to reject the earlier idea of a nation as a collection of different ethnic groups.
instead they believed that a nation should express the nationalism of a single ethnic group.
this belief evolved into an intense form of nationalism that heightened international rivalries.
for example france longed to avenge its humiliating defeat by a collection of german states in 1871 and regain alsace lorraine the territory it lost during that conflict.
nationalism also threatened minority groups within nation states.
if a country existed as the expression of its people the majority ethnic group where did ethnic minorities fit in.

226 the spread of the theory of social darwinism did not help soothe the competitive instinct.
social darwinism applied biologist charles darwins ideas of natural selection and survival of the fittest to human society.
social darwinists believed that the fittest nation would come out ahead in the constant competition among countries.
nationalism also destabilized old multinational empires such as austria hungary and the ottoman empire.
this was particularly true in the balkan region of southeastern europe.
for example when serbia emerged as an independent nation in 1878 it challenged the nearby empire of austria hungary in two ways by trying to gain territory controlled by the empire where serbs lived and by the example it offered to austria hungarys diverse peoples.
the nationalist sentiments of the period sometimes spilled over into the economic goals of each nation.
industrial output trade and the possession of an overseas empire were the yardsticks of wealth and greatness.
the leading industrial nations competed for lands rich in raw materials as well as for places to build military bases to protect their empires.
britain already had a large empire and france commanded a smaller one.
but germany italy belgium japan and the united states also rushed to join the race to expand.
together industrialized nations jostled among themselves as they carved colonies out of africa claimed islands in the pacific and began to nibble away at china.
militarism increases arms production for some european leaders the question was not so much if a great war would start but when to prepare leaders increased the size of their armies and stockpiles of weapons.
no nation readied its war machinery more than germany.
by 1914 it had a huge standing army and the largest deadliest collection of guns in the world.
it also built up its navy enough to rival britains the worlds strongest at that time.
to keep up britain too increased the size of its navy.
a spirit of militarism or glorification of the military grew in the competing countries and fueled this arms race even more.
the contest between germany and britain at sea and between germany france and russia on land guaranteed one important thing the next major war would involve more troops and more technologically advanced weapons than ever before.
machine guns mobile artillery tanks submarines and airplanes would change the nature of warfare.
alliances between nations increase the potential for war european leaders also prepared for war by forming alliances.

world war i and the 1920s 227 4 1 america enters world war i germany austria hungary and italy joined together in the triple alliance although italy never fought with it.
opposed to the triple alliance was the triple entente made up of france russia and great britain.
alliances emboldened leaders to act recklessly.
they knew that if they did declare war powerful allies were obligated to fight along with them.
no country wanted to be seen as an unreliable partner.
as years passed european leaders thought less of the advantages of peace and more of the possible benefits of war.
some also hoped that a foreign war would help to smooth over domestic problems.
a significant assassination on june 28 1914 archduke francis ferdinand heir to the throne of austria hungary and his wife sophie left for what they thought would be a routine visit to sarajevo sar uh yay voh the capital city of the austro hungarian province of bosnia.
but a handful of young bosnians had other plans for the archduke and his wife.
these men were ethnic serbs who believed that bosnia rightfully belonged to serbia and they saw francis ferdinand as a tyrant.
after the archdukes driver made a wrong turn gavrilo princip one of the conspirators noticed the couple in the car pulled a pistol from his pocket and fired it twice.
first sophie and then francis ferdinand died.
people around the world were shocked by the senseless murders.
but no one expected that they would lead to a great world war.
b recall what countries formed the triple entente.
the great war begins everything was in place for a great conflict nationalist ambitions large armies stockpiles of weapons alliances and military plans.
the nations of europe were hurtling like giant trains toward a great collision.
archduke francis ferdinands assassination was the incident that triggered this conflict.
alliances cause a chain reaction soon after the assassination kaiser william ii the german emperor assured austria hungary that germany would stand by its ally if war came.
confident in germanys support austria hungary then sent a harsh ultimatum to serbia demanding serbias total cooperation in an investigation into the assassination.
when serbia did not agree to all of the demands austria hungary declared war on july 28 1914.
because of the alliance system what otherwise might have been a localized quarrel quickly spread.
in early august russia mobilized for war to help its ally serbia against austria.
this caused germany to declare war against russia.
france russias ally promptly declared war against germany.
the very next day germany declared war major players in world war i neutral powers source britannica encyclopedia switzerland spain the netherlands denmark sweden norway albania analyze charts why was one alliance called the central powers.
consulting a map may help you answer.
world war i and the 1920s 228 4 1 america enters world war i analyze maps what challenge did germanys location present to its pursuit of victory in the war.
against neutral belgium so that it could launch an invasion of france through that small country.
great britain which had treaties with france and belgium immediately declared war against germany.
in less than one week the central powers of germany austria hungary and bulgaria were at war against the allied powers of britain france russia and serbia.
the ottoman empire later joined the central powers.
german soldiers fought through belgium and moved southwest into france toward paris.
then in september with the german advance only 30 miles from paris the french and the british counterattacked and stopped the german forces near the marne river.
technological innovations lead to stalemate after the battle of the marne the germans settled onto high ground dug trenches and fortified their position.
when the french and british attacked the german troops used machine guns and artillery to kill thousands of them.
the french and british then dug their own trenches and used the same weapons to kill thousands of counterattacking germans.
soon 450 miles of trenches stretched like a huge scar from the coast of belgium to the border of switzerland.
although fighting went on in eastern europe the middle east and in other parts of the world this western front in france became the critical battle front.
the side that won there would win the war.
the war dragged on for years and it was hideously deadly much more so than anyone had expected.
the primary reason for the length of the war and its deadly nature was the simple fact that the defensive weapons of the time were better and more devastating than the offensive ones.
generals on each side threw their soldiers into assaults against the enemy without fully considering the new technology.
charging toward trenches that were defended by artillery machine guns and rifles was futile.
in virtually every battle on the western front the attacking force suffered terribly.
even the use of poison gas did nothing to benefit the offense despite its horrifying effects.
airplanes and tanks were both first used during world war i but neither broke the stalemate.
airplanes were mostly used for reconnaissance or observing an area for military purposes.
the torn up ground caused by endless shelling created a need for a new military technology the tank.
military leaders hoped tanks could plow through devastated battlefield areas but the first tanks werent able to ride over such uneven terrain and often broke down during crucial battles.
ineffective offensives and effective defenses produced only a deadly stalemate.
the reality of trench warfare the stalemate led to gruesome conditions for the men in the trenches of the western front.
the soldiers battled the harsh world war i and the 1920s 229 4 1 america enters world war i conditions of life often as fiercely as they attacked the enemy.
they developed trench foot from standing for hours in wet muddy trenches.
they contracted lice from the millions of rats that infested the trenches.
dug into the ground the soldiers lived in constant fear afraid to pop their heads out of their holes and always aware that the next offensive might be their last.
even on a quiet day soldiers could be killed by snipers or a surprise gas attack like the one described by french officer paul truffaut at verdun the special shells the men call shells on wheels shells filled with poison gas are whizzing by continuously they explode silently and have no smell but can be deadly.
they killed several men yesterday.
one of my men refused to put his mask on because he couldnt smell anything.
all of a sudden he was dizzy foaming at the mouth and his skin went black then he went rigid and died paul truffaut.
1917 in between enemy lines was an area known as no mans land artillery barrages had blasted no mans land until any fields trees or homes that had once existed there were charred beyond recognition.
soldiers went over the top of their trenches into this muddy nearly impassable wasteland when they attempted to attack the entrenched enemy.
casualties or soldiers killed wounded or missing mounted first in thousands then hundreds of thousands and finally in millions.
almost one million french soldiers were killed or wounded in just the first three months of the war.
the germans lost only slightly fewer.
in two battles in 1916 verdun ver duhn and the somme suhm the british french and germans sustained more than 2 million casualties.
the british suffered 60 000 casualties on the first day alone at the somme and achieved virtually nothing.
and still the stalemate dragged on.
b identify supporting details what technologies encouraged a stalemate between opposing armies.
the united states remains neutral as the war spread in europe president woodrow wilson called for americans to be impartial in thought as well as action in a melting pot nation that tried deadly technology of world war i technology i application poison gas gases such as chlorine phosgene and mustard gas could kill blind or burn their victims.

tanks and armored cars both sides tried to develop vehicles that could go over rough ground and barbed wire no with limited success.
airplanes planes were used for reconnaissance bombing and fighting but did not prove decisive.
submarines german u boats or submarines used torpedoes as well as on deck 1 guns to sink ships.
analyze charts based on the types of weapons listed in the chart what can you conclude about either sides ability to inflict casualties on the other side.
world war i and the 1920s 230 4 1 america enters world war i to make americans of peoples from diverse origins wilson did not want to see the war set americans against one another.
at first most americans viewed the conflict as a distant european quarrel for land and influence.
unless the nations interests were directly threatened americans wanted no part of it.
they preferred to maintain what they viewed as traditional american isolation from european disputes.
still many americans felt the war s effects and few were truly impartial in thought.
most held a preference for one or another combatant and many businesses benefited from the increased demand by warring nations for american goods.
many americans choose sides in 1914 one third of americans were foreign born.
many still thought of themselves in terms of their former homelands as german americans irish americans polish americans and so on.
with relatives in europe many people supported the nation in which they were born.
some german americans in the midwest and some irish americans along the east coast felt strongly that the central powers were justified in their actions.
many americans had emigrated from germany or austria hungary.
millions of irish americans harbored intense grudges over the centuries of great britains domination of their homeland.
they hoped that ireland would gain its independence as britain became entangled in the war.
many jewish americans who had fled russia to escape the czarist regimes murderous pogroms against jews hoped for russias defeat.
most americans however sided with britain and france both of which had strong historic ties with the united states.
americas national language was english its cultural heritage was largely british and its leading trading partner was britain.
france had aided the american cause during the revolutionary war.
u s opinion solidifies no event at the beginning of the war swayed american opinion more than the vicious german invasion of neutral belgium.
german soldiers marching through belgium committed numerous atrocities killing unarmed civilians and destroying entire towns.
british journalists and propagandists stressed and sometimes exaggerated the brutality of the germans actions.
americans might have only dimly understood the causes of the war but they clearly perceived the human cost of the war for belgium.
eventually three distinct positions on the war crystallized among americans.
one group the isolationists believed that the war was none of americas business and that the nation should isolate itself from the hostilities.
a second group the soldiers took cover in trenches during gas attacks.
hypothesize why do you think many people consider poisonous gas attacks to be morally wrong while accepting attacks by machines guns artillery and tanks.
analyze political cartoons based on the cartoon what can you infer about president wilsons attitude toward the war.
interactive chart world war i and the 1920s 231 4 1 america enters world war i the british navy was the strongest in the world.
draw conclusions why was naval superiority so important to great britains war effort.
after german u boats sank the british passenger ship lusitania near the irish coast it became clear to many americans that even ships carrying civilians were potential targets.
interventionists felt that the war did affect american interests and that the united states should intervene in the conflict on the side of the allies.
a third group the internationalists occupied the middle ground.
internationalists believed that the united states should play an active role in world affairs and work toward achieving a just peace but not enter the war.
q check understanding into what three positions did u s opinion generally fall.
reasons for u s.
entry into the war an internationalist president wilson sincerely desired peace in his country and around the world.
between the start of the war in 1914 and americas entry into it in 1917 wilson attempted to use his influence to end the conflict among the warring countries.
he failed in this great effort.
ultimately he also failed to keep the united states out of the war.
britain blockades german ports early in the war british leaders decided to use their navy to blockade germany to keep essential goods from reaching the other country.
international law generally allowed contraband goods usually defined as weapons and other articles used to fight a war to be confiscated legally by any belligerent nation.
noncontraband goods such as food medical supplies and other nonmilitary items could not be confiscated.
britain however contested the definition of noncontraband articles.
as the war continued britain expanded its definition of contraband until it encompassed virtually every product including gasoline cotton and even food in spite of international law.
passenger ships fall victim to the war at sea germany responded by attempting to blockade britain even though it lacked the conventional naval forces to do so.
instead in february 1915 germany began sinking allied ships using its u boats or submarines.
the reality of the german blockade struck america on may 7 1915 when a german u boat sank the british passenger liner lusitania off the coast of ireland.
nearly 1 200 people perished.
german officials correctly claimed that the ship was carrying ammunition and other contraband.
americans protested that an unarmed and unresisting ship should not be sunk without first being warned and provided with safety for its passengers.
president wilson was stunned but still wanted peace.
there is such a thing world war i and the 1920s 232 4 1 america enters world war i 0 100 mi 0 100 km lambert conformal conic projection ships sunk by u boats may 1917 january 1918 atlantic ocean i brest.
a 5 s german u boats destroyed more than 11 million tons of allied shipping and killed nearly 14 000 people.
analyze maps why were u boat attacks clustered in particular areas.
as a man being too proud to fight he told his fellow citizens.
there is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right germany helped to keep the united states out of the war by eventually promising not to sink any more passenger ships.
but in 1916 germany violated that promise by sinking the unarmed french passenger ship sussex.
another storm of protest erupted in america.
again germany pledged not to sink unarmed ships.
this promise called the sussex pledge would not last long.
preparations for war president wilson wanted to remain at peace but even he must have realized the futility of that hope.
at the end of 1915 wilson began to prepare the nation for war.
many believed that preparedness was a dangerous course that could actually provoke war.
even so congress passed two pieces of legislation in 1916 to prepare for the possibility of u s involvement.
the national defense act expanded the size of the army and the naval construction act ordered the building of more warships.
still wilson hoped to avoid conflict.
in 1916 he ran for reelection with the slogan he kept us out of war it was a close election but wilson won a narrow victory over republican charles evans hughes.
the united states is neutral no longer wilson did not have much time to enjoy his victory.
in early 1917 two events occurred that helped to push the united states into the war.
both events showed germanys increasing aggression the main reason why the united states ultimately entered the war.
american trade with the allies had sustained britain and france in the war while the british blockade of germany had stopped the flow of american goods to the central powers.
as far as germany was concerned desperate times demanded desperate measures.
in january 1917 suffering severe supply shortages due to the blockade germany took action.
first german foreign minister arthur zimmermann sent a telegram to mexico.
the zimmermann note proposed an alliance with mexico stating that if the united states declared war on germany mexico should declare war on the united states.
in return after a german victory mexico would get back the states of texas new mexico and arizona which it had lost in 1848 after its defeat in the mexico american war.
the telegram was intercepted by the british who gave it to american authorities.

expanding the army when the united states entered world war i the u s army was only a small fraction of the size of european armies.
to build the army president wilson encouraged americans to volunteer for service and pushed congress to pass the selective service act.
the act which congress passed in may 1917 authorized a draft of young men for military service in europe.
on the first day of its enactment june 5 1917 more than 9 6 million americans registered for the draft and were assigned a number.
the government held a great national lottery in july to decide the order in which the first draftees would be called into service.

235 over the course of the war more than 24 million americans registered for the draft.
of these about 2 8 million were actually drafted into the armed forces.
including volunteers the total number of american men in uniform during world war i reached nearly 4 8 million.
more than 4 million of these were sent to help the allies in france.
managing economic effects the economic effects of the international military conflict of world war i on the united states were significant.
while the selective service commission raised an army president wilson worked to shift the national economy from peacetime to wartime production.
this process proved slow and frustrating.
first the council of national defense which was formed in august 1916 created an array of new federal administrative agencies to oversee different phases of the war effort.
individual agencies regulated food production coal and petroleum distribution and railway use.
in practical terms this meant that the government determined what crops farmers grew what products industries produced and how supplies moved around on the nations trains.
problems and administrative overlap soon led to the creation of the war industries board wib.
the wib eventually became independent of the council of national defense.
headed by bernard baruch buh rook an influential wall street investment broker who reported directly to the president the wib regulated all industries engaged in the war effort.
baruchs agency determined what products industries would make where those products went and how much they would cost.
the system of free enterprise was curtailed to fulfill the nations acute need for war materials.
americans decided to cooperate rather than compete in order to defeat the central powers.
what baruch did for industry future u s president herbert hoover achieved for agriculture.
as head of the food administration he set prices high for wheat and other foodstuffs to encourage farmers to increase production.
he also asked americans to conserve food as a patriotic gesture.
if the american people ate less then more food could be shipped to american and other allied soldiers fighting the war overseas.
to this end hoover instituted wheatless mondays and wednesdays meatless tuesdays and porkless thursdays and saturdays.
convincing the american people hoover s efforts would have been fruitless if the american people did not believe in supporting the war.
most americans did not understand the reasons for the war in 1914 and many questioned why the united states became involved in 1917.

a former journalist and a passionate admirer of american institutions creel combined education and a widespread advertising campaign to sell america the cpi distributed 75 million pamphlets and 6 000 press releases and it assembled an army of 75 000 speakers who gave lectures and brief speeches on america s war aims and the nature of the enemy.
in addition the cpi designed printed and distributed millions of posters that dramatized the needs of america and its allies.
the cpi also stressed the cruelty and wickedness of the enemy particularly germany which in some cases aggravated resentment toward german americans.

where have you heard or used the phrase to play a role.
opposition to the war the cpis work was important because americans did not always peacefully agree with one another about the war.
members of two large ethnic groups german americans and irish americans tended to oppose the allies for different reasons.
swept up in patriotic fervor some people treated german americans with prejudice or intolerance.
other americans were pacifists who opposed war for any reason.
one major issue raised by u s involvement in world war i was that the government acted in ways that sometimes trespassed on individual liberties to quiet dissent or differing opinions.
opposition to the draft without a doubt the draft created controversy.
some americans believed it was an illegal intrusion of the federal government into their private lives.
some men refused to cooperate with the selective service process.
they were often court martialed and imprisoned.
others simply tried to avoid the draft.
perhaps as many as 12 percent of men who received draft notices never responded to them.
many americans were conscientious objectors people whose moral or religious beliefs forbid them some citizens showed their opposition to the war and the draft by staging protests.
to fight in wars.
in theory the selective service act exempted from combat service members of any well recognized religious sect or organization whose existing creed or principles forbid its members to participate in war in practice this policy was widely ignored.
this was a constitutional issue because the first amendment guarantees freedom of religion.
in addition some conscientious objectors were treated badly by their local draft boards and others were humiliated in training camps.
as americas participation in the war increased however the government improved its treatment of conscientious objectors.
women oppose the war some american women also opposed the war.
before the war a number of leading american feminists including reformer jane addams formed the womens peace party and with pacifist women from other countries the women s international league for peace and freedom.
jeannette rankin the first woman to serve in the u s house of representatives voted against the declaration of war.
after america joined the allies some women continued to oppose the war but most supported american war efforts.
for example the influential national american woman suffrage association nawsa dropped its initial peace initiatives and supported americas war world war i and the 1920s 237 4 2 the home front during world war i objectives.
after adopting this new policy nawsa doubled in size.
the federal government stifles dissent constitutional issues raised by federal government policy during world war i also centered on the first amendment rights of free speech.
the work of the cpi created a mood in america that did not welcome open debate.
some felt the cpi stifled the free expression of controversial opinions and worried about the impact of a rigorous military campaign on democracy.
they did not want the freedoms that americans held most dear to become victims of the conflict.
americans treasured their constitution and the bill of rights.
and were not u s soldiers fighting for freedom.
at the same time since so much depended on individuals doing their part in the military or on the home front retaining national unity was vital to americas success in the war.
as in previous and future wars the government navigated a difficult path between respecting and restricting individual rights.
authorities tended to treat harshly individuals who worked against u s participation in the war.
in june 1917 congress passed the espionage act allowing postal authorities to ban treasonable or seditious newspapers magazines or printed materials from the mail.
thus another first amendment freedom the freedom of the press was compromised.
it also enacted severe penalties for anyone engaged in disloyal or treasonable activities.
anyone found obstructing army recruiters aiding the enemy or generally interfering with the war effort could be punished with up to a 10 000 fine and 20 years of imprisonment.
in 1918 congress limited freedom of speech even further with the passage of the sedition act.
the act made it unlawful to use disloyal profane scurrilous or abusive language about the american form of government the constitution or the military forces.
the government employed the sedition act to prosecute socialists political radicals and pacifists.
eugene v debs the leader of the socialist party in america was imprisoned under the act.
for his crime giving a mildly antiwar speech to a convention of socialists in canton ohio he was sentenced to a 10 year term in a federal prison.
the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the sedition act in the case of schenck v united states 1919.
the court ruled that there are times when the need for public order is so pressing that first amendment protections of speech do not apply.
the debs case and others like it show that the war did lead the federal government to follow policies that raised important constitutional issues about the suppression of personal freedoms and individual rights.

interactive gallery world war i and the 1920s 238 4 2 the home front during world war i prejudice against german americans sometimes the war enthusiasm created by the cpi and other groups took an ugly turn.
some german americans were treated harshly during the war.
largely because of cpi efforts americans regarded germanys kaiser as arrogant its generals as ruthless and its soldiers as spike helmeted brutes.
germany was seen as the primary foe among the central powers.
popular movies such as the kaiser the beast of berlin as well as some cpi posters and speeches intensified this feeling by portraying germany as a cruel enemy.
some americans wrongly generalized that if germany was cruel then all german people were cruel.
as a result americans stopped teaching german in public schools and discontinued playing the music of beethoven and brahms.
they renamed german measles liberty measles cooked liberty steaks instead of hamburgers and walked their liberty pups instead of dachshunds.
german americans were pressured to prove their loyalty to america by condemning the german government giving up speaking german and reading german language newspapers and participating enthusiastically in any patriotic drive.
occasionally hatred of the german enemy boiled over into violence against german americans.
some german americans were harassed others were beaten and a few were killed for no other reason than they were born in germany or spoke with a german accent.
et generate explanations why was the status of conscientious objectors a constitutional issue.
the war changes american society the war was not only a turning point in the economic and political lives of americans but it also brought substantial social changes.
new opportunities opened up for women african americans and mexican americans.
some left their homes to seek new ones where they could take advantage of these opportunities.
women welcome new opportunities before the war some american women campaigned for womens suffrage.
they won the vote in several western states and still hoped to gain the franchise nationally.
many feared that the war would draw attention away from their efforts.
in fact the war gave women new chances and won them more support for the right to vote.
as men entered the armed forces many women moved into the workforce for the first time.

they worked as doctors nurses ambulance drivers and clerks.
thousands enlisted when the army corps of nurses was created in 1918.
women proved that they could succeed in any type of job regardless of difficulty or risk.
by their efforts and sacrifices during the war women convinced president wilson to support their suffrage demands.
he contended that granting the vote to women was vital to winning the war if women could do the work of men they certainly deserved the same voting privileges as men.
finally in 1919 congress passed the nineteenth amendment giving the vote to women.
the required two thirds of states ratified the amendment in the summer of 1920 a victory more than 70 years in the making.
african americans and the great migration the war similarly presented new opportunities to african americans.
4 2 the home front during world war i world war i and the 1920s from the outset most african american leaders supported the war.
if this is our country then this is our war wrote african american leader w e b.
he viewed the struggle as an excellent opportunity to show all americans the loyalty and patriotism of african americans.
thousands of them enlisted or were drafted into the army and sailed for the battlefields of france.
on the battlefield they fought in segregated units under the command of white officers.
altogether 367 000 african americans served in the military.
hundreds died for their country.
meanwhile a great movement of african americans from the rural south to the industrial north was taking place.
this movement to the land of hope as many african americans referred to the north at that time is called the great migration.
a migration is a movement of a group people to a new place.
migrations are often described as being caused by push pull factors people migrate because some factors push them away from where they have been living while other factors pull them toward their destination.
for african americans during the great migration factors that pushed them out of the south included jim crow segregation laws lynching and other racial violence and few economic opportunities other than as servants sharecroppers or tenant farmers.
many raised cotton and the arrival in 1910 of an insect pest called the boll weevil ruined their crops providing yet another push out of the south.
at the same time the north pulled them with the chance of economic opportunities to be found in prosperous cities and wartime factories.
as more african americans moved north they themselves became pull factors for family and friends back in the south.
newspapers in the north such as the chicago defender an african american newspaper that was widely read in the south encouraged the migration i beg you my brother to leave the benighted land.
get out of the south.
come north then all you folks both good and bad.
the defender says come.
chu a to defended african americans moved to chicago as the defenderencouraged where they found work in meatpacking plants.
they migrated to detroit where they obtained jobs in auto factories.
they traveled to smaller industrial towns in the midwest and to the giant cities of the northeast.
between 1910 and 1930 more than 1 2 million african americans moved to the north.
millions more eventually made the journey.
although they did not entirely escape discrimination in the north many did find more opportunity.
the great migration was one of the most dramatic demographic or population shifts in american history.
the great migration analyze maps how did world war i help create this demographic shift.

for example in 1910 about one percent of detroits population was african american.
in 2010 83 percent of the residents were african american.
similarly other large cities across the north chicago philadelphia new york have high concentrations of african americans as a direct result of the great migration.
mexicans move north some of the same factors that pushed african americans out of the south and pulled them to the north caused mexicans to cross the border into the united states.
because of the ongoing mexican revolution many mexicans faced violence and desperate poverty they also wanted better economic opportunities.
most immigrated to the american west where they sought work on large ranches and farms in texas and along the pacific coast.
increased wartime demands for food and a decrease in american farmworkers since many were serving in the army created jobs that mexican migrants filled.
some of the mexican migration was seasonal.
many workers crossed the border to harvest fruits or grains or to pick cotton while each crop was in season then crossed back into mexico.
but others stayed and made the united states their home.
some mexican workers migrated first to the southwest and then to the northern states in search of factory jobs but a large population stayed in california.
they formed barn os bahr ee ohz or hispanic neighborhoods in los angeles and in smaller cities in california s imperial valley a farming region just north of the mexican border.
california had always had a rich hispanic heritage but these new immigrants added an important economic dimension to that heritage.

a series of five offensives threatened to break through allied defenses and open a path to paris.
the hard pressed allies organized a joint command under french general ferdinand foch fawsh.

the forces under pershings command were called the american expeditionary forces aef.
by the end of the war more than two million men would serve overseas in the aef.

on october 8 1918 york was one of thousands of americans fighting in the meuse argonne region of northeastern france.
trapped behind enemy lines york and 16 other americans took cover from blistering machine gun fire.
as half of the american force fell to german bullets york took aim with his rifle and silenced a nearby german machine gun nest.
he then dodged a flurry of bullets to attack several other machine gunners and even charged one german position with only a pistol.
when the firefight died down york and the surviving americans had taken the german position against amazing odds.
yorks battlefield heroics earned him a congressional medal of honor.
alvin york was only one of thousands of heroes many of whom died and most of whom were never recognized for their deeds.
they followed orders fought bravely and made great sacrifices.
although african american soldiers often faced discrimination in the united states army they demonstrated their patriotism in dozens of engagements.
for example an entire african american unit the 369th infantry regiment received the croix de guerre a french award for bravery for its members actions in the meuse argonne region.
the fighting in the meuse argonne region is also called the meuse argonne campaign.
the campaign was a widespread attack along the western front launched in september of 1918.

wilson wants peace without victory vladimir lenin leader of the communist revolution in russia maintained that the entire war was nothing more than an imperialistic land grab.
once in power he exposed secret treaties that russia had made with the other allies in which they agreed to divide among themselves the empires of their enemies.
these revelations undercut the morality of the allied cause in the war.
for president woodrow wilson however the war was not about acquisitions and imperialism it was about peace and freedom.
in january 1917 wilson had introduced the idea of a peace without victory in an address to congress only a tranquil europe can be a stable europe.
there must be a peace without victory.
victory would mean peace forced upon the loser a victors terms imposed upon the vanquished.
it would be accepted in humiliation and would leave a alvin york a conscientious objector before the war earned the medal of honor after helping allied forces defeat the germans at the battle of argonne forest.

v u tip t b dtol hi tag the fourteen points in another address to congress in january 1918 wilson answered lenins charges about the nature of the conflict by outlining americas war aims in what became known as the fourteen points.
at the heart of the fourteen points was his idea of peace without victory wilson proposed a peace inspired by noble ideals not greed and vengeance.
the fourteen points raised some major issues.
they sought to fundamentally change the world by promoting openness encouraging independence and supporting freedom.
critical of all secret treaties wilson called for open diplomacy.
he insisted on freedom of the seas free trade a move toward ending colonialism and a general reduction of armaments.
he also championed national self determination or the right of people to choose their own form of government.
this would lead to the creation of several new independent states but also raised many questions of which populations would achieve statehood and under what circumstances.
finally he asked for a league of nations to secure mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike wilson travels to paris in early 1919 the victorious allies held a peace conference in versailles ver si a suburb of paris in the former palace of louis xiv.
president wilson believed that the peace conference was too important to be left to career diplomats and lesser politicians so he crossed the atlantic ocean himself to represent the united states at the conference something no president had ever done.
wilson did not invite any leading republicans to join him in his peace delegation.
wilsons decision angered republicans who had won control of congress in the 1918 elections.
senator henry cabot lodge a leading republican foreign policy expert was especially angry.
wilson left lodge behind because wilson disliked him intensely but the feeling was mutual.
lodge and wilson had fundamentally different views about americas place on the world stage.
lodge was suspicious of wilsons progressivism and idealism which he viewed as dangerously naive.
whereas wilson spoke of peace without victory and mutual guarantees lodge keen to move the united states into the position of a world power spoke unabashedly about putting american interests first wilson s fourteen points 1918 1.

they blamed germany for starting the war reminded wilson that they had suffered more in the war than the united states and insisted that germany make reparations or payment for war damages.
they wanted to weaken germany so that it would never threaten europe again.
allied leaders reject wilsons ideas british prime minister david lloyd george and french premier georges clemenceau klay mahn soh knew that the citizens of their countries expected both peace and victory.
lloyd george insisted on protecting the existing colonial status quo and punishing germany.
clemenceau wanted to make germany pay dearly for what it had done to france.
in addition to reparations he demanded the return of alsace lorraine and several key german colonies.
besides britain and france other allies also had goals of their own and were skeptical of wilsons grand vision.
once the versailles conference began clemenceau lloyd george italian premier vittorio orlando and other allied leaders started to chip away at wilsons fourteen points.
onto the scrap heap of failed proposals they piled freedom of the seas free trade the liberation of colonial empires a general disarmament and several other ideas.
woodrow wilson joined french prime minister georges clemenceau on the left and british prime minister david lloyd george on the right at versailles in 1919.

the league of nations wilson lost a number of battles but kept fighting to salvage a league of nations a world organization where countries could gather and peacefully resolve their quarrels.
on this point wilson refused to compromise.
the other delegates finally voted to make the league of nations part of the treaty.
problems with the peace in the end the various peace treaties created almost as many major issues as they solved.
the changes in political boundaries that resulted from the international conflict were not always driven by self determination or the best interests of the people living there.
in the new map that emerged from the paris peace conference national self determination was violated almost as often as it was confirmed.
in europe several populations of germans found themselves attached to non german nations.
the same was true of several austrian populations.
furthermore in the middle east the breakup of the ottoman empire led to new political boundaries in which ethnic groups were clustered together randomly.
to form iraq for example the versailles peacemakers threw together three provinces of the defeated ottoman empire basra baghdad and mosul.
but basra had natural links to the persian gulf and india baghdad to persia and mosul to turkey and syria.
the various regions had no sense of iraqi nationalism.
in addition iraq like other holdings in the middle east asia and africa was not allowed to practice self determination.
it was attached to britain as a mandate or territory overseen by another nation.

the great influenza pandemic also called the great pandemic or the flu pandemic of 1918 coming on the heels of the great war gave a sense of doom and dread to people around the globe.
the pandemic may have even reached wilson at the paris peace conference.
he fell seriously ill and his temperature reached 103 degrees.
wilsons physician diagnosed the president as suffering from the flu.
although there is some doubt that it was actually the flu there is no doubt that wilsons sickness kept him from participating in many meetings.
his illness may have been factor in wilson not achieving all he had hoped to.
wilson faces opposition at home much as wilson faced opposition to his ideas at the paris peace conference he faced opposition in the united states to the treaty of versailles he had negotiated but for different reasons.
german americans thought the treaty was too harsh toward germany especially the war guilt clause that suggested that germany had caused the war.
irish americans criticized the failure to create an independent ireland.
most important however the treaty would need to be submitted to the republican controlled senate foreign relations committee and then ratified or approved by the republic controlled senate.
in both bodies as well as in his own democratic party wilson faced stiff opposition.
a handful of senators believed that the united states should not get entangled in world politics or involved in world organizations at all.
known as irreconcilables these isolationist senators opposed any treaty that had a league of nations folded into it.
they particularly disliked article 10 of the league covenant.
article 10 called for mutual defense by the signers of the treaty a pledge that each nation would respect and preserve.
the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all the members of the league a larger group of senators led by henry cabot lodge and known as reservationists were opposed to the treaty as it was written.
some wanted only small changes while others demanded larger ones.
for example many felt article 10 could lead the united states into a war without the consent of congress which was unconstitutional.
reservationists believed that the language of the article was too vague and demanded that it not contradict the power of congress to declare war.
but with some changes the reservationists were prepared to vote for the treaty of versailles.
they knew that polls indicated that the american people favored the league of nations.
wilson had compromised in versailles but he was not ready to compromise in washington d c.
when the senate delayed its ratification vote wilson took his case directly to the people.

wilson would not compromise and told his democratic supporters to vote with the irreconcilables against it.
they did and it was defeated.

251 world war i and the 1920s 250 4 3 the end of world war i return to normalcy meaning a return to normal life as it was in prewar times.
yet the election itself was not normal for the first time women voted in a presidential election.
for the first time election returns were reported by radio.
a return to normalcy in a rapidly changing world would prove elusive.
women and african americans confront new realities women and african americans had made significant advances during the war.
however the end of the war also spelled the end of wartime economic opportunities for both groups.
a postwar recession or economic slowdown created a competitive job market.
by 1920 there were fewer women in the workforce than there had been in 1910.
in northern industrial cities african american workers vied with returning soldiers for jobs and housing causing tense race relations.
during the hot summer of 1919 race riots erupted in cities throughout the country.
the worst in chicago was triggered by the drowning of a young african american man by whites and went on for 13 days.
in 1921 violence erupted in tulsa oklahoma when armed african american men many of them returning veterans tried to protect a young african american man from lynching.
by the time the tulsa race riots were over at least 10 whites and 26 african americans were dead.
rioters burned the homes of african americans in tulsa oklahoma during race riots in 1921.
in one african american neighborhood white rioters burned 35 city blocks to the ground.
inflation and labor unrest during the war inflation or rising prices had been held in check.
after the conflict americans rushed to buy consumer goods rather than war bonds.
the scarcity of these goods coupled with widespread demand caused inflation.
on the other hand during the war the price of corn wheat cotton cattle and other agricultural goods had risen with help from hoovers policies.
after the war prices fell sharply making it difficult for farmers to pay their mortgages or buy what they needed for the next growing season.
this began a long period of tough times for farmers.
another economic effect of the postwar inflation was felt by industrial workers when their wages did not buy as much as they had during the war.
in 1919 more than 4 million workers or 20 percent of the workforce went on strike at one time or another.
demanding rewards for their wartime patriotism workers struck for higher wages and shorter workdays.
in boston even the police force struck.
the workers won some of the strikes but they lost far more.
when some strikes turned violent the promanagement press blamed the presence of radicals among the strike leaders.
the united states grows as a world power despite hardings election and some americans desire to return to what life was like before the war the united states did not plan to totally withdraw from world affairs.
by 1920 even with postwar economic problems the united states was an economic giant.
it was the richest most industrialized country in the world.
even before the war america led all other nations in industrial output.
the war was a turning point for the nation economically.
now british and french demands for american goods created an immense trade imbalance.
europeans had to borrow money from american bankers and obtain lines of credit with american business firms to pay for the goods.
this situation fundamentally changed americas economic standing in the world.
the united states was now the largest creditor nation in the world meaning that other countries owed the united states more money than the united states owed them.
world war i shifted the economic center of the world from london to new york city.
the united states embraced its new role as a quiet giant.
a world without america playing world war i and the 1920s 252 44 the postwar economy booms i.
a major economic role had become simply impossible to conceive.
b recall what was a significant cause of inflation after the war.
the impact of henry ford and the automobile in the decade after world war i the american economy experienced tremendous growth.
using revolutionary mass production techniques american workers produced more goods in less time than ever before.
the boom fundamentally changed the lives of millions of people and helped create the modern consumer economy.
the decade got off to a rocky start however.
there was a mild recession in 1918 to 1919 and a more serious one in 1920 to 1921.
these were partly due to converting wartime production back to domestic production and the return of soldiers into the workforce.
once the economy did take off the prosperity was not shared by everyone.
still there is no doubt that the u s economy in the 1920s roared.
rarely if ever has the nation enjoyed such an economic boom as it did during this decade.
the recession that had followed world war i quickly ended.
all signs pointed to economic growth.
stock prices rose rapidly.
factories produced more and more goods and with wages on the rise more and more people could afford to buy them.
much of this explosive growth was sparked by a single business the automobile industry.
carmaker henry ford introduced a series of technological and management innvoations to his fledgling automobile business.
fords methods and ideas revolutionized production wages working conditions and daily life.
ford mass production and the model t ford did not originate the idea of mass production the rapid manufacture of large numbers of identical products.
it had been used for example to make sewing machines and typewriters.
but such products involved only hundreds of parts not the thousands that go into the production of cars.
ford brought mass production to new heights.
early in the century only wealthy city dwellers could afford cars.
the automobile was often seen as a symbol of the class divisions in the country.
city drivers who ventured out onto country roads frightened horses and cows coated crops with dust and rutted dirt roads.
to the countryman said woodrow wilson in 1906 cars are a picture of the arrogance of wealth entrepreneurs like henry ford pictured with his son edsel ushered in the age of the automobile and helped create an economic boom after the war.
interactive illustration ransom olds had introduced a less expensive car the oldsmobile in 1901.
but it was henry ford who truly brought the automobile to the people.
in 1908 he introduced the model t a reliable car the average american could afford.
the first model t sold for 850.
soon after ford opened a new plant on the detroit river.
the detroit location gave ford easy access to steel glass oil and rubber manufactured in pennsylvania ohio indiana and illinois.
ford hired scientific management experts to improve his mass production techniques.
scientific management was a relatively new method of improving efficiency in which experts looked at every step of a manufacturing process to find ways to reduce time effort and expense.
studying a process to minimize the time it takes to do a task is called time study analysis.
studying a process to minimize the motion it takes to do a task is called motion study analysis.
together they are often known as time and motion study the idea was pioneered by frederick winslow taylor in his book the principles of scientific management.
scientific management is sometimes called taylorism.
ford also studied the techniques of chicago meatpacking houses where beef carcasses were moved on chains past a series of meat cutters each of whom cut off a specific part of the carcass.
ford reversed the process.
he put his cars on moving world war i and the 1920s 253 4 4 the postwar economy booms assembly lines.
at each step a worker added something to construct the automobile.
in two years the application of assembly line techniques showed huge productivity enhancements reducing the time it took to manufacture a model t from more than 12 hours to just 90 minutes.
the efficiency of the assembly line allowed ford to keep dropping the sale price.
the cost of a model t fell to 350 by 1916 and to 290 by 1927.
it was slow dull and available only in black.
but the model t was the first car that ordinary people could afford.
in 1919 only 10 percent of american families owned an automobile.
by 1927 56 percent did.
when it came to managing the men who made up his labor force ford also proved that he was not afraid of innovation.
in 1914 he more than doubled the wages of a large number of his workers from 2 35 to 5 a day.
he also reduced their workday from 9 hours to 8 hours.
in 1926 he became the first major industrialist to give his workers saturday and sunday off.
before ford the idea of a weekend hardly existed.
ford shrewdly realized that if workers made more money and had more leisure time they would become potential customers for his automobiles.
the combination of the model t and the five dollar day forty hour week made ford not only a very rich man but also one of the shapers of the modern world.
the automobile changes america the boom in the automotive industry caused in part by fords production efficiencies caused economic growth in other industries related to car manufacture or use.
the steel glass rubber asphalt wood petroleum insurance and road construction industries all benefited.
for example one seventh of all steel output was used to make automobiles.
the need for gasoline prompted a nationwide search for petroleum deposits.
oil discoveries in california texas new mexico and oklahoma brought vast numbers workers and money to the southwest.
petroleum based industries boomed increasing employment and tax revenues.
thus energy in the form of gasoline had a major impact on the american way of life.
road construction also boomed especially when the federal government introduced the system of numbered highways in 1926.
the millions of cars on american roads led to the rapid appearance of thousands of service stations diners and motor hotels a term later shortened to motels.
the growth in all these industries created new and often better paying jobs spurring national prosperity.
the automobile caused additional economic effects.
other forms of ground transportation such as railroads and trolleys suffered a decline in use.
with cars people could go where they wanted when they wanted.
they did not have to travel along set tracks on set schedules.
analyze maps how did the creation of an affordable car affect the development of roads in the united states.
world war i and the 1920s 254 4 4 the postwar economy booms the automobile prompted a new sense of freedom and prosperity.
never had americans been so mobile.
entire families crowded into their cars for cross country vacations or sunday drives to the country.
ownership of an automobile came to symbolize participation in the american dream of success and high standard of living.
finally automobiles altered residential patterns.
the ability to drive to work permitted people to live farther from their places of employment.
this led to the development of suburban communities linked to cities by arteries of highways and roads.
los angeles one of the first cities whose growth was influenced by the automobile developed in a sprawling haphazard fashion.
it became according to one observer a series of suburbs in search of a city h identify supporting details what effect did increased automobile production have on other industries.
economic growth in the 1920s the 1920s saw what has been called a consumer revolution in which a flood of new affordable goods became available to the public.
the widespread availability of electrical power supported the consumer revolution.
electric washing machines vacuum cleaners and irons made housekeeping easier and less time consuming.
accessible electricity also contributed to radio and refrigerator sales.
advertising and installment buying the growing advertising industry also played its part.
using new scientific techniques and psychological research advertisers were able to sell more products to more americans than ever before.
magazine and newspaper ads often focused on the desires and fears of americans more than on what people really needed.
advertisers celebrated consumption as an end in itself convincing people that they could be the person they wanted to be just by buying the right products.
from kleenex to listerine americans bought products that years earlier they could never have imagined they needed.
finally new ways of buying fueled the consumer revolution.
people who did not have enough ready cash could buy what they wanted on credit.
installment buying in which a consumer would make a small down payment and then pay off the rest of the debt in regular monthly payments allowed americans to own there s golden goodness in these crisp crunchy comflafees so tempting those golden kelloggs corn flakes bobbing in cold milk or cream or served with bananas or other fruits.

the bull market consumers were not the only americans buying and selling in a big way.
during the 1920s the stock market enjoyed a dizzying bull market a period of rising stock prices.
more and more americans put their money into stocks in an effort to get rich quick.
by 1929 around 4 million americans owned stocks.
the desire to strike it rich often led investors to ignore financial risks.
as the market soared people began buying on margin another form of buying on credit.
by purchasing stock on margin a buyer paid as little as 10 percent of the stock price upfront to a broker.
the buyer then paid the broker for the rest of the stock over a period of months.
the stock served as collateral or security for the brokers loan.
as long as the price of the stock rose the buyer had no trouble paying off the loan and making a profit.
but if the price fell the buyer still had to pay off the loan.
buyers gambled that they would be able to sell the stock at a profit long before the loan came due.
buying stocks on the hope that their price will rise is called stock market speculation.
in truth this big bull market stood on very shaky ground.
but most people ignored the dangers.
by the world war i and the 1920s 255 4 4 the postwar economy booms the economic prosperity americans experienced during the 1920s prompted large investments in urban construction.
here riveters worked on new york citys empire state building in 1931.
rapidly rising stock prices created a daily frenzy of activity in the new york stock exchange where the majority of u s stocks were traded.
middle of 1929 economic authorities proclaimed that america and the stock market had entered a new era.
stock prices would continue their march upward they said while boom and bust economics would become a thing of the past.
science technology and the free enterprise system science technology and the free enterprise system combined to boost the economic development of the united states in the 1920s.
the science was not just in scientific management but in the growing knowledge of many aspects of the world.
scientists conducted research on everything from rubber plants to electronics.
this scientific knowledge enabled engineers to create the technologies automobiles for example or radios that were useful to people.
these new technologies would not have been widespread without the free enterprise system.
the profit motive gave business owners a reason to turn technology into products to sell.
competitive markets encouraged innovation.
the free enterprise system also created the jobs that provided workers with the money to purchase the many new products that came to market.
thus the prosperity of the 1920s was boosted by a mix scientific advances inventive technologies and the free enterprise system.

immigrants settled in cities.
farmers left their fields for cities.
the direction of the african american great migration was toward northern cities.
many mexicans crossing the border relocated to southwestern cities.
as in the late nineteenth century cities grew and changed shape.
in addition the adoption of skyscraper technology caused cities to stretch skyward.
steelframed skyscrapers with light coverings of masonry and glass began to dominate the skylines of the nations cities.
new yorks empire state building finished in 1931 symbolized the power and majesty of the united states.
suburbs expand improved mass transportation and the widespread use of automobiles caused cities to world war i and the 1920s 256 4 4 the postwar economy booms expand outward.
more urban workers moved to the suburbs.
western and southern cities developed after the automobile revolution encompassed suburban areas as well as inner cities.
suburbs mushroomed growing much faster than inner cities.
slowly at first but more rapidly as the century progressed suburbs drained people and resources from the cities causing the demographic patterns of both types of places to change.
catering to middle and upper class residents suburbs tended to be more conservative and republican.
meanwhile one effect of this migration was that the inner cities at the heart of older urban areas began a slow but steady decline.
many americans face challenges in the cities and suburbs americans enjoyed prosperity and the fruits of growth.
they participated in the consumer economy and in the joys of automobile ownership.
the wealthiest urban residents owners and managers of businesses reaped fabulous rewards which they often pumped back into the bull market.
but there were problems looming ahead.
americas wealth was poorly distributed.
industrial wages rose at a much slower rate than corporate salaries.
even worse farm incomes declined during the decade.
many people living in the country did not participate in the consumer benefits and economic gains of the decade.
they formed part of another america poorer and outside the economic boom.
in particular farmers suffered from growing debt and falling farm prices.
a protest song of 1928 expressed their frustration as more families could afford automobiles they moved away from the city to nearby suburbs.

tol interactive flipped video b woodrow wilson hoped that the presidential election of 1920 would prove that americans supported both the league of nations and his vision of the role the united states should play in the world.
he suggested that electing democratic presidential candidate james m cox of ohio would show support for the league.
however the election of republican candidate warren g harding of ohio would serve as a final rejection of u s support for the league.

key terms andrew mellon herbert hoover teapot dome scandal calvin coolidge washington naval disarmament conference kellogg briand pact dawes plan warren g harding government in the 1920s the harding administration harding had a different view of the presidential race.
he knew that national elections seldom turned on a single issue.
harding campaigned for a rejection of wilsonian idealism.
he was tired of progressive reforms and foreign crusades and he was betting the american public was too.
harding won in a landslide and republicans won control of congress as well.
americans had decisively rejected wilsons ideas.
what exactly did hardings election signal.
some interpret it as americans desire to retreat from involvement in world affairs others as a rejection of progressive reform efforts or a swing back to laissez faire economics.
no matter how it was interpreted however it was clear that harding and his successor calvin coolidge favored conservative policies that aided the growth of business rather than pursuing reform as the progressives had done.
this pattern a period of activism followed by a more laissez faire approach would repeat itself in the 1950s and 1980s.
hardings economic policies encourage growth harding signaled the economic direction of his administration by naming wealthy banker andrew mellon secretary of the treasury.
mellon pearson 1 bai realize access your digital lesson.
258 believed that prudent economic policy meant supporting legislation that advanced business interests.
he disliked the relatively new income tax favoring instead low taxes on individuals and corporations.
mellon also cut the fat from the budget.
by 1925 congress had reduced spending from a wartime high of 18 billion to 3 billion.
instead of sinking deeper into debt the treasury actually showed a surplus.
harding signed a bill raising protective tariff rates by about 25 percent.
the tax on imports made it easier for american producers to sell goods at home.
however in retaliation european nations also hiked tariffs making american goods harder to sell overseas.
this tariff war weakened the world economy and would have ramifications in the 1930s.
under the progressive leadership of roosevelt and wilson the federal government had passed laws to break up monopolies protect workers and restrict the absolute freedom of business leaders.
by contrast harding favored a return to a more traditional laissez faire approach.
he and mellon worked to reduce government regulation of business.
hardings return to normalcy including reducing taxes and reducing government regulation helped to cause the economic growth and prosperity of the 1920s.
still the harding administration did not abandon social goals.
hardings thoughtful and energetic secretary of commerce herbert hoover worked with business and labor leaders to achieve voluntary advancements.
what the progressives hoped to achieve through legislation hoover attempted to attain with the cooperation of interest groups.
he enjoyed great successes at getting people to work together instead of battling one another.
some officials betray the public trust harding was a kind likable man but he was not especially intelligent.
perhaps no president was friendlier and few had less sense of what was expected of a president.

in 1921 fall arranged to transfer oil reserves in elk hills california and teapot dome wyoming from the navy department to the interior department.
the oil reserves were intended for the navys use in times of emergency.
harding signed the transfer.
once fall had control of the oil he forgot about the needs of the navy he leased the properties to private oilmen in return for loans which were actually bribes.
rumors of the deal led to a senate investigation and by 1924 the entire sordid affair was revealed to the public.
later the oil reserves were returned to the government.
fall was sentenced to a year in prison but those accused of bribing him were acquitted.
harding himself never saw the full extent of the teapot dome scandal.
in fact he only had a growing suspicion that his friends were up to no good.
but that was enough as he said to keep him walking the floor nights in july 1923 he visited alaska during a speaking tour.
on his return voyage he suffered a heart attack and died on august 2.
americans mourned harding as they had mourned no other president since lincoln.

known as silent cal he was quiet honest and frugal a man who measured his words carefully.
he placed his trust in business and put his administration in the hands of men who held to the simple virtues of an older america.

how did the share of taxes paid by the top income earners change.
coolidges statement of values and principles has often been oversimplified as the business of america is business however in his approach to the economy coolidge continued to follow the goals of secretary of the treasury mellon by reducing the national debt trimming the federal budget and lowering taxes to give incentives for businesses.
collectively referred to as the mellon income tax cuts the revenue acts of 1921 1924 and 1926 successively lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and corporations.
although tax rates on high income earners were significantly reduced the total amount paid by those earners increased as incomes rose.
in response to the revenue acts as well as other factors the unemployment rate fell from over 6 percent to approximately 3 percent between 1922 and 1929 benefiting workers in all income brackets.
coolidge thus oversaw increasing tax revenues and a spectacular boom in the national economy.
for almost six years the economy soared generating industrial profits spectacular growth in the stock market and general prosperity especially for urban americans.
some problems remain yet there were grave problems breeding in the nation.
farmers struggled to keep their land as the prices of their goods fell.
labor unions demanded higher wages and better working conditions.
african americans faced severe discrimination especially in the south where jim crow laws made enforced segregation a way of life.
african american leaders urged congress to pass an antilynching law.
in the southwest mexican americans confronted shamefully low wages and efforts to force them to return to mexico.
to all of these concerns silent cal remained silent.
like harding he mistrusted the use of legislation to achieve social change.
unlike progressive presidents he believed that it was beyond the federal governments role to help create an ideal nation.

americas place in a changed world world war i had caused sweeping changes around the globe.
an old order five hundred years in the making had collapsed in just a few years.
it was as if the worlds compass was out of whack and no one knew where to turn for directions.
german and russian monarchies toppled and new forms of government were created.
the austro hungarian and ottoman empires ceased to exist.
britain and france emerged from the war victorious but economically and politically weakened.
in contrast the victorious united states came out of the war strong confident and prosperous.
world war i and the 1920s 261 4 5 government in the 1920s seeking stability after world war i while world war i was a turning point for the united states in the realm of foreign affairs the nation was still unsure of the requirements of its new status.
could america retreat from the political affairs of other countries yet continue to expand its economic reach across the globe.
under both harding and coolidge america continued to play an increasingly important role in world business and trade.
beyond economic interests u s foreign policy was largely shaped by reaction to world war i.
no previous war had been as deadly.
citizens of all nations agreed it must never happen again.
but how could this goal be achieved.
one solution was to avoid another arms race such as the naval rivalry between germany and britain that had contributed to the outbreak of the war.
in 1921 and 1922 diplomats gathered in washington d c to halt another naval arms race before it got out of control.
world leaders agreed to limit construction of large warships and hammered out a settlement on several problems between japan and the west.
this washington naval disarmament conference did not end the worlds naval problems but it raised hopes that nations could solve disagreements without resorting to war.
a later attempt to prevent war was the kellogg briand pact of 1928.
secretary of state frank b kellogg and french foreign minister aristide briand bree ahn drew up a treaty to outlaw war as an instrument of national policy eventually 62 nations ratified the pact.
but in reality the pact was unenforceable.
kellogg knew it briand knew it and so did the rest of the diplomats.
no sooner was the ink dry than everyone involved forgot about it.
although congress applauded the useless kellogg briand pact it refused to join the world court an international body which at least promised to help mediate international disputes.
as much as possible most american leaders in the 1920s hoped to avoid another war by keeping the rest of the world at arms length.
collecting reparations after the war money issues were another matter.
the united states insisted that britain and france repay their huge war debts to the united states.
for this to happen though germany had to make the reparation payments to britain and france imposed by the treaty of versailles.
the complex financial issue threatened to undermine the international economy.
some statesmen suggested reducing or even canceling both war debts and reparations.
but the frugal coolidge insisted that a debt was a debt and had to be paid.
in 1924 an agreement known as the dawes plan arranged u s loans to germany.
by enabling germany to make reparation payments to britain and france the dawes plan helped britain and france to repay their debts to the united states.
of course the entire scheme was financed by u s money.
after the stock market crash of 1929 however the well of u s money went dry.
germany stopped reparation payments and britain and france ended war debt payments to the united states.
in the end the war debt situation damaged americas reputation in the eyes of the world.
people from britain and france thought that it was heartless for american bankers and politicians to insist on repayment of debts and not to take into account the washington naval disarmament conference 1921 four power pact five power naval limitation treaty nine power pact united states britain france and japan any disagreement between two countries regarding territorial possessions in the pacific would be discussed by all four countries before any action was to be taken.
united states britain france japan and italy these countries hoped to reduce the number of warships in their possession by placing tonnage limits on ships.
united states china britain france japan italy belgium the netherlands and portugal china was to open its doors equally to all countries wishing to do business there and all other countries were to recognize china s independence and territorial integrity.

this simple fact had profound consequences.
the nation had been divided before but usually along north south or east west lines.
in the 1920s however the split was between urban america and rural america.
on virtually every important social and cultural issue the two groups differed.
urban americans enjoyed new consumer products and a wide array of leisure activities.
they generally showed an openness toward social change and the new discoveries of science.
the growing trend to emphasize science and secular values over traditional religious beliefs became known as modernism.
by contrast rural americans did not participate fully in the consumer bonanzas and they missed out on many of the new forms of leisure.
people in the country generally embraced a more traditional view of religion science and culture.
an evolving job market emphasizes education rural and urban americans differed in their attitudes toward formal education.
in rural america prolonged formal education had not seemed vital.
farmers expected their children to master the three rs reading writing pearsonl realize i access your digital lesson.
264 and arithmetic.
but beyond that having a formal education was not vital to the many farm tasks that needed to be done.
muscle endurance and knowledge of crops and animals seemed more important to farmers than abstract knowledge learned from books.
formal education took on more importance in urban america.
mental ability not muscular fitness was seen as the essential ingredient for success.
mastery of mathematics and language could spell the difference between a low paying unskilled job and a higherpaying position as an office worker.
by 1930 more american teens were graduating from high school and more americans than ever before went to college.
some embrace religious fundamentalism in the 1920s many devout americans believed that christianity was under siege throughout the world.
they pointed to soviet communist attacks on the orthodox church in russia and to the mexican revolutionary assaults on the roman catholic church in mexico.
at home a growing number of christians were upset by what they saw as secular trends in religion and culture.
they reaffirmed their belief in the fundamental or basic truths of their religion.
this approach often called fundamentalism emphasized protestant teachings and the belief that every word in the christian bible was literal truth.
fundamentalists believed that the answer to every important moral and scientific question could be found in the bible.
their ideas took root all over the country but were especially strong in rural america.
bryan and darrow clash over evolution fundamentalism and modernism clashed head on in the scopes trial of 1925.
at issue was the theory of evolution developed by english scientist charles darwin.
darwin believed that complex forms of life such as human beings had developed gradually from simpler forms of life.
according to fundamentalists this theory clashed with the description of creation in their bible.
in 1925 tennessee passed a law making it illegal to teach darwins theory in the states public schools.
the american civil liberties union convinced john scopes a high school biology teacher in dayton tennessee to challenge the law.
when scopes taught evolution in his classroom he was promptly arrested.
the scopes trial drew nationwide attention.
journalists flocked to dayton to cover the emotionally charged event which many dubbed the monkey trial because of the mistaken belief that darwin claimed that human beings descended from monkeys.
the rise of modernism with its emphasis on urbanism intellectualism and individualism threatened traditionalists who believed americas social foundations were deteriorating.
clarence darrow left and william jennings bryan have a conversation during the scopes trial.
world war i and the 1920s 265 4 6 an unsettled society clarence darrow the most celebrated defense attorney in america traveled from his home in chicago to defend scopes.
darrow was well known for defending labor union leaders like eugene v debs and william haywood in addition to other famous cases.
a talented speaker he did not always win his cases but he often revealed key issues to the public during the well publicized trials.
three time presidential candidate william jennings bryan a long time defender of rural values served as an expert for the prosecution.
bryan considered one of the greatest orators of his day was charged with defending what many fundamentalists thought of as the literal truth of divine creation found in their bible.
both men had a significant impact on the trial by drawing national attention to it.
the highlight of the trial came when darrow called bryan to the stand as an expert on the bible.
bryan affirmed that the bible stated the literal truth.
he testified that he believed that god created adam and eve and that joshua made the sun stand still.
darrow tried to use science to cast doubt on such beliefs but bryan firmly stated i accept the bible absolutely scopes was found guilty of breaking the law a fact that was never in question and fined 100.
the public however was paying closer attention to a more essential issue.
the trial was a public confrontation between fundamentalism and modernity between a literal and a liberal interpretation of scripture.
while the scopes trial showcased a major cultural and religious division it did not heal the conflict or answer its central questions.
when the trial was over each side still believed in the truth of its position.
the conflict over evolution continues today.
h rfcall how does modernism contrast with more traditional ideas about religion.
the red scare as americans continued to grapple with the ideas of modernity the emergence of the soviet union as a communist nation challenged other essential u s ideals.
in contrast to capitalism and the free enterprise systems which emphasized the right to own private property communist ideology called for public ownership of property and an international workers revolution as a prelude to the death of capitalism.
to this end soviet leader vladimir lenin encouraged and supported revolutions outside of his country.
in central and eastern europe a series of communist revolts did break out making it seem like the worldwide revolution was starting.
fear of a potential revolution this revolutionary activity abroad coupled with labor strikes across the united states following the end of world war i caused the first american red scare a wave of widespread fear of suspected communists and radicals thought to be plotting revolution within the united states.

as the leading law enforcement official palmer mounted a broad offensive against radicals in the united states in 1919 and 1920.
in a series of raids in early 1920 known as the palmer raids police arrested thousands of people some who were radicals and some who were simply immigrants from southern or eastern europe.
most were never charged or tried for a crime.
the government then deported hundreds of radicals or suspected radicals.
to many these actions seemed to have the effect of attacking the liberties that americans held most dear.
a group of people in new york city formed the american civil liberties union aclu in 1920 to protect these liberties.
the aclu tried to do this by becoming involved in important court cases.
to this end the aclu became involved in one of americas most controversial court cases the trial of nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti.
a questionable conviction nicola sacco sah koh and bartolomeo vanzetti van zeht ee were italian immigrants and known anarchists.
they were charged with shooting and killing two men during a holdup at a shoe factory in a town near boston.
eyewitnesses of the event said the robbers looked italian sacco and vanzetti were arrested and charged with the crime.
even though the aclu provided defense counsel the two men were found guilty in a swift and decisive trial despite the fact that there was little hard evidence against them.
some prominent legal scholars intellectuals and liberal politicians charged that the convictions were based more on sacco and vanzettis ethnicity and political beliefs than on the facts of the crime.
nevertheless on august 23 1927 the two men were put to death in the electric chair.
at its worst hysteria accompanied by violence characterized the red scare.
mobs attacked suspected radicals abused immigrants and committed crimes in the name of justice.
by the summer of 1920 the height of the red scare had ended.
americans saw that democracy and capitalism were more powerful in the united states than lenins call for worldwide revolution.

then share your thoughts.
immigration in the 1920s as the trial of italian immigrants sacco and vanzetti came to a close another social issue involved the ongoing boom in immigration continued.
as in the past nativists or those who preferred native born americans to immigrants argued that the new arrivals took jobs away from native born workers and threatened american religious political and cultural traditions.
eugenics and social darwinism influence the perception of immigrants although nativist politicians had been able to restrict immigration from china in 1882 they had failed to push through laws to restrict immigration from southern and eastern europe.
on the eve of u s entry into world war i however congress did pass a law requiring immigrants to take a literacy test.
immigrants who could not read or write their own language were prohibited from entering the united states.
president wilson vetoed the law but congress overrode wilsons veto.
immigration dropped during the rise of nativism within the united states led to increased restrictions on immigration such as the rejection of immigrants who could not read and write in their own language.
the war worsening labor shortage problems during the war.
during the postwar red scare fear that communists and socialists from eastern europe were traveling to the united states with their revolutionary doctrines caused the debate to heat up once again.
on one side were nativists who disagreed with traditional immigration policy.
on the other side were many americans who viewed the immigration experience as part of what made an american an american.
nearly all americans who could trace their ancestry back far enough discovered foreign origins.
nativists were concerned that immigrants would diminish americas political and economic power.
they believed that many immigrants had undesirable physical and social traits and would therefore be unproductive members of society.
these views were partly based on eugenics the since discredited idea that intelligence and other favorable social traits were inheritable characteristics passed on by ones parents and more frequently found in some races than others.
eugenics was related to social darwinism the idea that life was a competition in which only the fittest survive.
the rise of both social darwinism and eugenics was caused in part by charles darwins theory of natural selection.
both were also motivated by ethnic or racial prejudice to some degree.
those who believed in both theories wanted the united states to be that fittest nation that survived and to ensure that it was sought to exclude those they thought of as weaker and undesirable.
many nativists who believed in eugenics thought the human race could be improved by controlling which people had children.
therefore they thought it best to restrict immigration to those whom they deemed to have desirable traits that would in turn be passed on to future generations of americans.
congressional legislation restricts immigration in addition to eugenics and social darwinism other events such as world war i the russian revolution and the red scare strengthened the nativist position and affected congressional legislation.
two subsequent laws the emergency quota act of 1921 and the national origins act of 1924 established a quota system to govern immigration from specific countries.
the national origins act set up a simple formula the number of immigrants of a given nationality each year could not exceed 2 percent of the number of people of that nationality living in the united states in 1890.
the year 1890 was chosen because it was before the great wave of immigration from southern and eastern europe.

the act also continued to exclude most asian immigrants.
the effect of eugenics social darwinism and nativist sentiment in general was that america closed its golden door to many of the people trying to enter.
more mexicans arrive for economic opportunity the quota system did not apply to mexico which was still reeling from the 1910 revolution.
settling in sparsely populated regions of the southwest mexican immigrants made significant contributions to local economies.
many found work harvesting crops in california and texas.
a smaller number sought jobs in the factories and farms of the north or midwest.
many mexican immigrants faced discrimination and hostility in their new homes.
they often competed with native born americans for jobs and were frequently subjected to brutality and violence.
id recall what was the purpose of the national origins act.
the ku klux kian in the early 1900s immigration restriction was an attempt to turn back the clock to what many saw as a simpler better time.
many lashed out against symbols of change.
some even turned to organizations that supported doctrines of hate and employed violence and terror to achieve their ends.
the kian reorganizes in 1915 on stone mountain in georgia a revived ku klux kian was formally organized.
the original kian had been formed in the south during reconstruction largely to terrorize african americans who sought to vote.
although the new kian continued to promote hatred of african americans it was also aimed at the new america taking shape in the cities.
it targeted jews catholics and immigrants.
in the wake of postwar labor unrest the kian opposed labor unions especially because many union members were immigrants or political radicals.
the kian also claimed to stand against lawbreaking and immorality.
at its height the kians invisible empire had perhaps 4 to 5 million members.
most were in the south but there were also branches in the midwest northeast and west in both rural areas and in small industrial cities.
one center of kian strength was indiana where kian leader david stephenson ruled world war i and the 1920s 269 t 4 6 an unsettled society with an iron fist and controlled numerous politicians.
there were special womens branches of the kian as well.
however some male kian leaders were strongly opposed to women taking an active role in politics.
kian members boycotted businesses owned by anyone who was jewish catholic or african american.
the kian terrorized citizens in the night often by burning crosses outside their homes.
klansmen usually wore masks to conceal their identities met to wave flags and preach hate and followed leaders with such titles as grand dragon and imperial wizard.
but behind the kians confident facade were americans fearful of change.
many americans oppose the kians values organizations such as the naacp and the jewish anti defamation league battled against the kian and its values.
the naacp continued its anti lynching crusade supporting legislation in 1922 that passed in the house of representatives but not in the senate.
the anti defamation league worked to reduce anti semitic slurs in newspapers and break down barriers in higher education and the job market.
individuals also embraced the idea of racial ethnic religious and cultural diversity.
for them the notion of the melting pot was as old as america itself and they drew strength from american traditions and saw hope in the american future.
journalist william allen white noted a group photo of the twentieth annual session of the naacp in cleveland ohio in 1929.
to make a case against a birthplace a religion or a race is wickedly un american and cowardly.
the whole trouble with the ku klux kian is that it is based upon such deep foolishness that it is bound to be a menace to good government in any community.
william allen white letter to the editor of the new york yvorlck 1921 the kian itself became thoroughly corrupt.
its leaders bribed politicians stole from its members dues and lied to its members.
stephenson ended up going to prison for assault and second degree murder.
by the late 1920s the kian stood exposed.
although the organization never disappeared it became less significant.
h what actions did kian members take to accomplish their goals.
prohibition divides americans another divisive issue was prohibition the banning of alcohol use.
since the early 1800s temperance reformers had crusaded against alcohol.
temperance was a cause held dear by many progressives.
by 1917 some 75 percent of americans lived in dry counties that had banned liquor.
world war i increased support for temperance.
it seemed unpatriotic to use corn wheat and barley to make alcohol when soldiers overseas needed bread.
the eighteenth amendment bans alcohol in 1919 the states ratified the eighteenth amendment to the constitution.
it forbade the manufacture distribution and sale of alcohol anywhere in the united states.
the amendment had been passed largely on the strength of rural votes.
many progressives felt that its passage was one of the greatest impacts of the whole progressive reform movement.
congress then passed the volstead act a law that officially enforced the amendment.
advocates of prohibition known as drys called it a noble experiment they argued that the impact of prohibition would be improved individuals strengthened families and better societies.
in fact drinking as well as alcoholism and liver disease caused by drinking did decline during the first years of prohibition but soon rose again to near pre prohibition levels.

instead they argued prohibitions impact was to help create an atmosphere of hypocrisy and increased organized crime.
many americans ignore the volstead act as the wets noted the volstead act did not stop americans from drinking but it did prevent them from purchasing drinks legally.
the gap between the law and individual desires was filled by a large illegal network.
people made alcohol in homemade stills or smuggled it in from other countries.
bootleggers sold illegal alcohol to consumers.
in cities secret drinking establishments known as speakeasies attracted eager customers.
government agents worked tirelessly to stop the flow of illegal liquor.
however they were short handed and the demand for alcohol was too great.
there were millions of dollars to be made by both organized and unorganized criminals.
particularly in cities policemen and politicians tended to look the other way when liquor was involved.
they rationalized their actions by saying that if people wanted to drink they would drink.
a1 capone a chicago gang leader was the most famous criminal of the prohibition era.
he defended his illegal actions i make my money from supplying a public demand.
if i break the law my customers who number hundreds of the best people in chicago are as guilty as i am.
the only difference between us is that i sell and they buy.
everybody calls me a racketeer.
i call myself a businessman.
a1 capone quoted in era of excess sinclair the problem was that under the guise of providing a glass of beer or scotch organized crime spread into other areas of society.
capones other businesses included prostitution drugs robbery and murder.
thus one effect of prohibition was to contribute to the growth of organized crime in america.
the constitution is amended again by the mid 1920s most city politicians clamored for the repeal of the eighteenth amendment.
but to many rural americans liquor and crime were tied to other divisive cultural issues of the day.
thus like immigration and evolution the debate over prohibition became part of a battle over the future of america.

nowhere is this more evident than in the leisure interests of the american people.
americans enjoy more leisure time the growth of cities changed leisure patterns.
on farms people worked from dawn to dusk with little time to spare.
in the evenings a farm family might play games read or sing together around the piano.
occasionally they joined other farm families and townsfolk for picnics or a game of baseball.
they did not have the time or the money for more extensive leisure pursuits.
city life was different.
the average workweek in all industries fell from 70 hours in 1850 to 55 in 1910 to 45 by 1930.
the workweek itself also changed from seven days a week to six and at last to five.
at the same time salaries and wages were on the rise.

273 innovation in the motion picture industry with more free time and disposable income urban and suburban americans looked to new sources of entertainment.
motion pictures helped supply that demand.
the technology to make motion pictures had been around for a generation but the movie industry rose to new heights in the 1920s.
a handful of huge studios in hollywood california established monopolies that controlled the production distribution and exhibition of movies.
during the 1920s from 60 to 100 million americans went to the movies each week.
ornate movie palaces or small local theaters became americas cultural classrooms.
for most of the decade the studios made silent pictures.
they were an ideal entertainment at a time when millions of immigrants spoke little english.
motion pictures transcended languages and even literacy treating universal themes in familiar ways that allowed any viewer to follow the stories.
motion pictures became americas democratic art.
unlike theatrical productions or classical concerts movies were available to anyone with a few cents to spare.
in addition the fact that movies were silent made it easier for them to cut across geographical boundaries.
hollywoods biggest movies and stars became nearly as popular in far corners of the globe as they were at home.
by 1926 hollywood movies accounted for a majority of the british and french film markets.
film was one of the first mediums to diffuse popular american culture to the rest of the world.
many stars of the silent era portrayed ordinary folks and films often portrayed the social issues and characteristics of the time in which they were made.
comedian charlie chaplin the most popular silent film star played the little tramp in many films.
in the immigrant chaplin played a penniless immigrant on a voyage across the atlantic to the united states.
although the film belonged to the genre of comedy it depicted some of the challenges and uncertainties that many immigrants of the time faced as they made their own way to americas shores.
chaplins character was equal parts hobo dreamer and poet but an eternal optimist in his ability to charm his audience and continually reinvent himself.
other stars played more romantic types.
adorable mary pickford was known as americas sweetheart for her girlish roles in light romances.
douglas fairbanks played handsome athletic adventurers.
in the western genre william s hart was a steely eyed cowboy who came into town to restore law and order.
in 1927 film history changed suddenly and forever with the release of the jazz singer the first movie with sound synchronized to the action.
audiences were amazed when a1 jolson said not pantomimed you aint heard nothin yet and then launched into a song.

the radio impacts american society like the movies the phonograph and the radio also became powerful instruments of mass popular culture.
each was the result of both technological advances and business enterprise.
millions of radios and phonographs as well as phonograph records were marketed in the 1920s.
on a deeper level the phonograph and radio helped produce a standardized culture.
americans in the east and west and north and south listened to the same songs learned the same dances and shared the same popular culture as they never had before.
the radio or wireless was developed in the 1890s by italian inventor guglielmo marconi.
before the 1920s the radio was an innovation used by a small group of military technicians telephone operators and amateur wireless operators.
then in 1920 an executive of the westinghouse company started radio station kdka in pittsburgh pennsylvania.
it was an immediate success.
within three years there were almost 600 licensed stations broadcasting to more than 600 000 radio sets.
americans listened to music educational lectures and religious sermons and news and weather reports.
they also heard commercials for a wide variety of consumer products.
radios brought distant events into millions of homes in a way unmatched by newspapers or magazines.
in 1927 much of america listened to a championship boxing match between gene tunney and jack dempsey.
that night theaters and movie houses played to empty seats as americans huddled next to their sets.
even the men on death row at sing sing prison listened to the broadcast.
before the 1920s such coverage of an event had been impossible.
although radio programs and music occasionally broadcast racial or cultural stereotypes as well such as the radio show amos n andy in the 1920s the radio allowed americans to keep up with current events around the country as they occurred.
americans share music with the phonograph the phonograph allowed people to listen to the same music they heard on the radio but whenever they wanted.
early phonographs employed difficult to use wax cylinders and suffered from poor sound quality.
in the 1920s grooved disc recordings and superior sound reproduction improved the sound of the earlier machines and production of phonographs rose to approximately five million in 1929.
there was also a corresponding rise in record sales.
the first country western album to sell over one million copies was produced in 1924.
city ughtt v u t us ihkfcl i lu produced charleszchaplin before talkies or movies with synchronized sound americans went to the movies to see silent pictures.
charlie chaplin was perhaps the most famous of all silent film actors.
the invention of the phonograph and grooved disc record stimulated the growth of the music industry.
by the 1920s records had one song on each side and rotated at 78 revolutions per minute rpm.
world war i and the 1920s 275 4 7 the roaring twenties as the popularity of country western music rose one positive impact was that the uniquely american symbol of the cowboy and life on the the western frontier was mythologized throughout the country.
a negative impact was that stereotypes of westerners and country dwellers sometimes also spread.
recordings helped bring country and western music from the south and west to the north and east while pop tunes from new york citys tin pan alley traveled in the other direction creating national markets for different genres of music.
as they listened to the same songs americans also learned the same fashionable dances from the fox trot to the charleston.
b identify main ideas how did films like the immigrant reflect the social issues of the time.
american role models hollywoods chief rivals for the creation of heroes were the nations baseball parks football fields and boxing rings.
before the 1920s there were relatively few nationally famous athletes such as boxer john l sullivan and all around athlete jim thorpe.
most sports stars were local heroes.
this changed by the 1920s often called the golden age of sports.
with the help of increased newspaper readership and radio coverage sports figures like babe ruth became national heroes and symbols of american culture.
media coverage creates sports heroes thanks to increased newspaper readership and the rise of radio coverage every major sport boasted nationally famous performers.
perhaps the leading sports hero was baseball home run king babe ruth.
others included red grange in football jack dempsey in boxing bobby jones in golf and bill tilden in tennis.
women athletes too contributed to the hero culture from tennis player helen wills to gertrude ederle the first woman to swim the english channel.
why did athletes reach such heights of popularity.
part of the answer is that the golden age of sports was also the golden age of the sportswriter.
such journalists as damon runyon and grantland rice captured the excitement of sports events in their colorful prose.
turning the finest athletes into seemingly immortal gods the sportswriters nicknamed babe ruth the sultan of swat and dubbed notre dame s football backfield the four horsemen.
the other part of the answer is that the decade needed heroes.
world war i had shattered many americans faith in progress making the world seem cheap and flawed.
athletic heroes reassured americans that people were capable of great feats and lofty dreams.
if in our heroes we see our idealized selves the sports heroes of the 1920s gave americans a sense of hope.
a transatlantic flight even the biggest sports stars could not match the adoration given to aviators.
in the 1920s the airline industry was in its infancy.
flying aces had played a role in world war i and a few small domestic airlines carried mail and passengers.
but airplanes were still a novel sight to most americans.
the pilot became a new breed of hero a romantic daredevil who risked death with every flight.
as aviation technology improved by leaps and bounds in the early twentieth century many dreamed of flying across the atlantic ocean.
these dreams were made possible by innovators such as glenn curtiss who designed an aircraft engine capable of just such a flight.
as flight crews were successfully flying longer distances across the atlantic daring aviators wondered if they could accomplish the same feat alone.
then aviator charles lindbergh attempted the long journey alone.
in may 1927 he took off from long island new york in his tiny single engine plane the spirit of st louis and headed east to paris france.
other pilots had flown across the atlantic ocean before but lindbergh was the first to do it solo and non stop.
the flight took more than 33 hours and the lone pilot had to stay awake the entire time.
he also recalled in the daytime i knew where i was going but world war i and the 1920s 276 47 the roaring twenties in the evening and at night it was largely a matter of guesswork when lindbergh landed in paris he became an instant media celebrity dubbed lucky lindy and the lone eagle.
the radio reported on his landing and movie newsreels showed his triumphant return home.
the modest young man from the midwest made an impact as the greatest hero of his time.
h identify for what accomplishment was charles lindbergh known.
the role of women changes in a 1931 book only yesterday journalist frederick lewis allen attempted to make sense of the fads heroes and problems of the 1920s.
featured prominently was the new woman.
during the decade many women challenged political economic social and educational boundaries to prove that their role was as vital outside the home as inside it.
womens roles began to change in many ways caused by the overall changes that society was undergoing as well as the passage of the nineteeth amendment in 1920.
the effect of these changes was that women made more and more contributions to shape american culture.
flappers push back against expectations during the victorian age of the late 1800s and early 1900s middle class women had been expected to center their lives on the home and family.
the new woman of the 1920s noted allen was more liberated.
she wore dresses with shorter hemlines put on more makeup danced to the latest crazes and generally assumed that she had the same political and social rights as any man.
popular magazines sociological studies novels and movies all echoed allens observations.
the rejection of victorian morality seemed so total and the new woman so novel that the change amounted to a revolution in manners and morals the symbol of all these changes was the flapper a young woman with short skirts and rouged cheeks who had her hair cropped close in a style known as a bob.
there was only a germ of truth in the various observations.
the victorian code of separate spheres for men and women was disappearing but not as rapidly or as completely as allen indicated.
the flapper was undoubtedly more publicized than imitated.
still the image of the flapper underscores an important aspect of the decade.
not all women aspired to be flappers but many wanted more control over their lives and got it.
the individualism and modernism of the early 1920s prompted many women to see themselves as equals to men deserving the same political and social rights.
womens political rights the great fight for suffrage had been won with the passage of the nineteenth amendment.
soon women looked for a way to use their political rights to make an impact.
but what was the next step.
some groups such as the national american woman suffrage association called on women to work in reform movements run for office or fight for laws to protect women and children in the workplace.
some women had success in public life.
in 1925 nellie tayloe ross of wyoming and miriam ferguson of texas became the first women to take office as elected state governors.
the national womens party took a more militant position demanding complete economic social and political equality with men.
their primary goal was the passage of an equal rights amendment.
many women though believed that a new constitutional amendment was premature.
they set more achievable goals and made significant strides in employment.
the efforts of these political organizations and women elected to public office redefined the role of women in american culture and opened doors through which others would walk in the decades to come.
although most working women continued to toil in domestic service and manufacturing others moved into clerical sales and management positions.
women also won world war i and the 1920s 277 4 7 the roaring twenties jobs in journalism aviation banking and the legal and medical professions.
life at home changes perhaps the most widespread revolution taking place in womens lives was a quiet one.
during the decade women tended to live longer marry later and have fewer children freeing their time to pursue other interests.
some entered the workforce others devoted more time to charitable work and still others joined clubs that discussed books and ideas.
all these pursuits enlarged the intellectual world of women.
the consumer economy of the 1920s benefited women.
electric vacuum cleaners and irons took some of the labor and drudgery out of household chores.
of course not all women shared in the blessings of technology.
many homes in rural america had no access to electricity.
for women in these regions household labor continued to involve intense even painful work.
they drew and carried water from wells heated irons on stoves and washed clothes by hand.
here again the split between urban and rural americans was distinct.
h recall why would many who advocated for womens political equality have thought 1925 was a significant year.
modernist painters like edward hopper expressed their reservations about the progress of civilization.

interactive chart social issues are reflected in art and literature no area of american life however reflected the impact of world war i more than literature and the arts.
the war altered the way writers and artists viewed the world changed the way they approached their craft and inspired them to experiment with new forms and fresh ideas.
postwar uncertainty during the victorian era most poets and novelists had expressed a belief in progress placing boundless faith in human potential.
but world war i called the notion of progress into question.
how could a society ruled by the idea of progress embark on a war that killed millions of people destroyed monuments of civilization and left survivors hungry homeless and hopeless.
this was not an action of a rational people a new generation of writers argued but the irrational exploits of civilization without a sense of direction.
this pessimistic skeptical worldview sparked an artistic movement known as modernism.
modernism in both art and literature to some extent also reflected some of the issues and characteristics of american society in the 1920s from the renewed interest in new technology to the uncertainty of many in a rapidly changing world.
the theories of jewish austrian psychologist sigmund freud sihg muhnd froid also contributed to literary and artistic modernism.
freud argued that much of human behavior is driven not by rational thought but by unconscious desires.
to live in society people learn to suppress these desires.
but the tension between outward behavior and the subconscious said freud could lead to mental and even physical illness.
freuds theories led writers and artists to explore the subconscious mind.
modern art moves in new directions modernism clashed head on with traditionalism most dramatically in the field of modern art.
since the late 1800s european painters had led the way in seeking a fresh visual idiom or language.
they moved away from representational paintings that simply reproduced real life and experimented with more abstract styles.
most americans got their first real glimpse of the new european approach at a major art show at new york s 69th infantry regimental armory in 1913.
traditionalists were outraged by the armory show and theodore roosevelt said that most of it represented the lunatic fringe of the art world.
but many american painters and sculptors were inspired by the bold new styles.
they began their own search for artistic world war i and the 1920s 4 7 the roaring twenties honesty in abstract patterns.
in the 1920s paintings by edward hopper man ray joseph stella and georgia okeeffe demonstrated the richness and varied styles of american artists.
at the same time the works of artists such as archibald motley and william h johnson portrayed african american perspectives on modern life.
postwar american literature flowers american writers of the 1920s are often referred to as the lost generation because they no longer had faith in the cultural guideposts of the victorian era.
but many were inspired by their lost condition to search for new truths and fresh ways of expressing those truths.
never in american history had one decade seen the emergence of so many great literary talents.
a list of writers who rose to distinction in the 1920s includes f scott fitzgerald ernest hemingway edith wharton sinclair lewis william faulkner gertrude stein eugene oneill and t s eliot.
each of these writers remains today on any list of distinguished american authors.
novelist f scott fitzgerald explored the reality of the american dream of wealth success and emotional fulfillment.
in this side of paradise he wrote that his generation had grown up to find all gods dead all wars fought and all faiths in man shaken in the great gatsby 1925 his most accomplished work fitzgerald showed the american dream ending in nightmare.
in the novel through hard work and careful planning james gatz re creates himself as jay gatsby a successful tycoon.
gatsby fills his home with wild parties dancing bootleg liquor and endless activity in the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.

op r h american writers f scott fitzgerald and his wife zelda visited the french riviera often in the 1920s.
in many ways their turbulent life together mirrored fitzgeralds stories of striving and tragedy.
but in the end gatsby is destroyed by the very things he hoped to achieve.
his lofty dreams end in a violent meaningless death.
fitzgeralds fellow novelist and good friend ernest hemingway explored similar themes but in a new idiom.
hemingway felt betrayed not only by the american dream but also by literary language itself.
in a fareweil to arms his 1929 novel about world war i hemingways narrator says 1 was always embarrassed by the words sacred glorious and sacrifice.
1 had seen nothing sacred and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it.

he created a style that was as concrete and as powerful as a rifle shot.

playwright eugene oneill experimented with techniques that put the subconscious right on stage.
in the emperor jones the title character gets lost in a jungle and is attacked by imaginary beings called little formless fears.
in strange interlude characters turn away from their conversations with other people on stage and speak their thoughts directly to the audience.
certainly many poets and novelists of the decade were disillusioned.
like hemingway and fitzgerald they wrestled with the meaning of the war and life itself.

world war i and the 1920s 280 4 7 the roaring twenties v as a result of world war i and the great migration millions of african americans relocated from the rural south to the urban north.
this mass migration continued through the 1920s and contributed to a flowering of music and literature.
jazz and the harlem renaissance made a lasting impact not only on african americans but on the culture all americans share.
the harlem renaissance support for black nationalism in urban areas like the immigrants who traveled from europe and asia african americans who left the south dreamed of a better future.
they had heard stories of economic opportunity social advancement and greater political rights.
the south they reasoned was a dead end.

migration creates opportunities and challenges most african american migrants to the north probably found a better life.
wages in a detroit auto plant or a pittsburgh steel mill were far better than what a sharecropper earned in the south.
in such cities as new york chicago pittsburgh and cleveland african americans had a growing political voice.
in those towns there also existed black middle and upper classes.
african american ministers physicians lawyers teachers and journalists practiced their professions and served as role models to the younger generation.

281 marcus garvey an african american nationalist promoted the idea that african americans should separate themselves from whites and support their own communities.
the african american population of harlem new york continued to grow after world war i and in the 1920s.
but in coming north african americans had certainly not escaped racism and oppression.
on average they were forced to live in the worst housing and labor in the lowest paying jobs.
in addition as the race riots of the summer of 1919 demonstrated violence was a threat to african americans north as well as south of the mason dixon line.
after world war i african americans increased their demand for a real solution to the countrys racial problems.
new york citys harlem became the focal point for the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of african americans.
some 200 000 blacks settled in harlem.
migrants from the south mixed with recently arrived immigrants from caribbean islands such as jamaica.
this dynamic blend of different cultures and traditions bred new ideas.
the impact of marcus garvey the most prominent new african american leader to emerge in the 1920s was marcus garvey.
born in jamaica garvey traveled widely before immigrating to harlem in 1916.
from his travels garvey drew one important conclusion blacks were exploited everywhere.
to combat the problem he promoted the idea of universal black nationalism and organized a back to africa movement.
unlike booker t washington or w e b.
du bois garvey did not call for blacks and whites to work together to improve america.
instead garvey advocated the separation of the races.
garveys message found willing converts in american cities.
by the mid 1920s his universal negro improvement association boasted almost 2 5 million members and sympathizers.
his advocacy of black pride and black support of black run businesses won considerable support.
garveys movement fell apart in the second half of the decade.
the federal government sent him to prison for mail fraud and then deported him to jamaica.
without his powerful leadership the universal negro improvement association lost its focus and appeal.
although garveys movement died his ideas did not fade.
the nationalist and separatist aspects of the nation of islam and the black power movement in the 1960s borrowed from garveys ideas.
so too did later appeals to black pride self reliance and cultural ties to africa.
harlems major newspaper the amsterdam news later wrote in a world where black is despised he taught african americans to admire and praise black things and black people u describe what challenges did many african american migrants face as they moved north.

a truly indigenous american musical form jazz is a musical form based on improvisation.
jazz musicians creatively recombine different forms of music including african american blues and ragtime and european based popular music.
jazz music was fast free loud rebellious and fun so in many ways it reflected the characteristics and issues of the 1920s.
a unique musical style jazz emerged in the south and midwest particularly new orleans where different cultures and traditions came together and influenced each other.
early jazz artists won fame playing in storyville a section of new orleans known for its night life.
from the south it spread north with the great migration of african americans.
trumpet player louis armstrong became the unofficial ambassador of jazz.
after playing with king olivers band in new orleans and chicago and with fletcher hendersons orchestra in new york armstrong began to organize his own groups.
his ability to play the trumpet and his subtle sense of improvisation made him a legend and influenced the development of jazz.
after armstrong all jazz bands featured soloists.
many also began to feature vocal soloists such as bessie smith the empress of the blues jazz wins worldwide popularity jazz was more than a musical style.
it was also a symbol of the roaring twenties.
it was part of the prohibition era played in speakeasies and nightspots in new york chicago st louis and los angeles.
it was the sound of the cotton club one of harlems most famous attractions where african americans played african american music to all white audiences.
phonograph records and radio spread the influence of jazz across the country and beyond.
by the end of the decade the popularity of jazz had spread to europe as well.
but jazz was still more.
it was a demonstration of the depth and richness of african american culture.
many musicians such as armstrong introduced rhythms and themes with clear african roots into their music to better convey the african american cultural experience.
gerald early a modern scholar of english and african american studies predicted that in the future america will be best remembered for three great contributions the constitution baseball and jazz.
all three enriched lives opened windows to new possibilities and lifted the human spirit.

together and created something greater than their parts.
the jazz movement was then a reflection of an evolving african american identity born of shared historical experience including the contemporary experiences of the great migration and continuing troubled race relations.
jazz quickly bridged the races.
trumpeter bix beiderbecke bi der behk became the first white musician to contribute to the styles and popularity of jazz.
jazz sounds influenced such white songwriters and composers as cole porter irving berlin and george gershwin whose jazz inspired orchestral work rhapsody in blue premiered in 1924.

african american music legends including duke ellington and cab calloway played regularly at harlems many nightclubs.
the harlem renaissance jazz and blues were expressions of the african american experience.
the pain of the african american experience can be heard in the blues and the joy of that experience in the soaring notes of jazz.
the range of such african american musicians as duke ellington and cab calloway speaks to the varieties of african american life.
but in the 1920s there were other expressions of african american culture.
novelists poets and artists celebrated their culture and explored questions of race in america.
this flowering of african american culture became known as the harlem renaissance.
the harlem renaissance helped give a new vocabulary and dynamic to race relations in the united states.
cultural movements in literature and art in the 1920s the term the new negro entered the american vocabulary.
it suggested a radical break with the past.
no longer would african americans silently endure the old ways of exploitation and discrimination.
the new mood was most vividly expressed in harlem which attracted african american artists and writers from all over the country and beyond.
in their work these artists and writers explored the pains and joys of being black in america leaving a legacy that spoke to all americans of all times.
artists such as aaron douglas created paintings with stylized art that reflected african americans racial pride and collective historical experience while other artists such as jacob lawrence and archibald j.
world war i and the 1920s 284 4 8 the harlem renaissance motley jr expressed similar sentiment in their colorful paintings of urban life.
many writers communicated the same themes.
jean toomer s cane 1923 set the literary tone for the harlem renaissance.
a collection of short stories poems and sketches cane presented african american life and folk culture in all its richness.
it was not a blueprint for where african americans needed to move politically in the future but a plea to remember and preserve the past.
soon other african american writers joined toomer at the forefront of the harlem renaissance.
jamaican immigrant claude mckay was the most militant of these writers.
in his novels and poems mckay showed ordinary african americans struggling for dignity and advancement in the face of discrimination and economic hardships.
a poem that mckay wrote after chicago was stricken by violent race riots captured his sense of anger and militancy if we must die let it not be like hogs hunted and penned in an inglorious spot.
while round us bark the mad and hungry dogs making their mock at our accursed lot.
what though before us lies the open grave.
like men we will face the murderous cowardly pack pressed to the wall dying but fighting back.
claude mckay if we must die mckay represented the political and ideological left wing of the harlem renaissance.
more in the center was langston hughes probably the most powerful african american literary voice of his time.
for hughes the force of the movement was not politics but a celebration of african american culture and life.
in more than 50 works of fiction poetry journalism and criticism he captured the remarkable diversity of the writer jean toomers works appealed to african americans to remember their pasts.

the lasting impact of the harlem renaissance the harlem renaissance gave a voice to african american culture just as jazz and blues gave it a tune.
it altered the way many white americans viewed african american culture and even the way african americans viewed themselves.

some for example dismissed the quality of literature produced during the period.
others such as langston hughes expressed a degree of disillusionment with the movements inability to improve the political status and economic opportunities of african americans throughout the country.
however the artistic forms and cultural debates associated with the harlem renaissance continue even today.

it most certainly was not regular.
production employment and income will normally expand contract and expand again over time in a cyclical way.
however a number of factors combined in the 1920s to turn the normal cyclical expansions and contractions of the nations economy into an economic collapse in the 1930s.
millions of americans suffered hardships and despair as a result.
for most of the 1920s however republican leaders exuded confidence about both their party and their country.
the roaring twenties had been a republican decade.

republicans took credit for the bullish economy and most americans heartily agreed.
hoover sweeps to victory when the republicans met at their 1928 nominating convention they chose herbert hoover an accomplished public servant to run for the white house.
born in iowa hoover was orphaned as a child.
but he overcame this personal tragedy and eventually graduated from stanford university with a degree in geology.
he became a mining engineer and worked all over the world.
by 1914 after amassing a vast fortune he retired from engineering and devoted himself to public service.
herbert hoover came to the attention of americans during world war i first as the brilliant coordinator of the belgium relief program and then as head of the food administration.
during the harding and coolidge administrations hoover served as secretary of commerce.
his philosophy was simple but effective.
he stressed the importance of competition but he also believed in voluntary cooperation between labor and management.
american greatness showed itself hoover maintained when owners workers and government officials converged on common goals.
with a solid record of accomplishments behind him and seemingly endless prosperity in front of him hoover was a formidable presidential candidate in 1928.
while his campaign ads noted how republicans had put the proverbial chicken in every pot hoover spoke glowingly of ending poverty in america by adherence to the principles of decentralized self government ordered liberty equal opportunity and freedom to the individual our american experiment in human welfare has yielded a degree of well being unparalleled in all the world.
it has come nearer to the abolition of poverty to the abolition of fear of want than humanity has ever reached before.

americans voted overwhelmingly for hoover prosperity and the continuation of republican government.
when the new president took office in march 1929 america was awash in a sea of confidence.
few imagined that an affluent middle class family poses for a portrait in 1924.
many families bought their first automobile and radio during the 1920s as mass produced consumer products became more affordable.
during his 1928 campaign herbert hoover emphasized his belief that competition was vital to ensure robust economic growth.
the great depression and the new deal 301 5 1 causes of the depression mechanized farm equipment became more common during the 1920s but many farmers still used basic equipment such as this horse drawn plow.
the gap between rich and poor widened in the 1920s the wealthy built large homes and began to fill them with lavish furnishings.
an economic disaster lay just seven months in the future.
but even as hoover delivered his victory speeches economic troubles were beginning to worry some americans.
the prosperity of the 1920s was not as deep or as sturdy as hoover claimed.
throughout the u s economy there were troubling signs.
farmers face challenges after world war i american farmers faced difficult times during the 1920s.
farmers made up one fourth of the american workforce during the decade.
to meet the unprecedented crop demands created by world war i they had increased harvest yields and bought more land to put under the plow.
they also bought costly tractors and other mechanized farm equipment to help them meet demand.
farmers amassed huge debts doing this and the additional mortgage payments followed them into the 1920s.
after the war the demand for american crops fell sharply.
despite this drop postwar production remained high because of increasingly mechanized farm equipment and more intensive farming methods.
farms were getting bigger and yielding bumper crops at harvest.
however farmers were failing to sell off their huge crop surpluses and to pay the debts they owed banks and other institutions.
the result was a rural depression that affected millions of americans.
hard pressed to pay their debts forced to sell their goods in a glutted and competitive world market and confronted by several natural disasters farmers did not share in the boom times of the 1920s.
they did not have the cash to buy the new consumer goods produced by american industries.
they lived largely on credit from month to month often teetering on the brink of financial ruin.
any downward slide in the economy was likely to hit americas struggling farmers first and hardest.
a significant gap between the rich and the poor unlike farmers industrial workers participated in the great national success story.
during the 1920s their wages rose steadily as did their disposable income.
many purchased model t fords along with a variety of other consumer products.
though they were certainly not wealthy industrial laborers were in a better financial position than their fathers had been a generation before.
but the problem was that while wages rose gradually worker productivity increased astronomically.
between 1923 and 1929 output per person hour jumped 32 percent but workers wages inched up only 8 percent.
during that same period corporate profits from worker output skyrocketed 65 percent.
all these figures the great depression and the new deal 5 1 causes of the depression income distribution 1929 analyze graphs based on the information in the pie chart what share of total income earned in 1929 did the top 5 percent of income earners account for.
pointed to the fact that during the 1920s the rich became much much richer while industrial workers simply became less poor.
in few periods of the country s history have so small a number of rich americans dominated such a large percentage of the country s total wealth.
in 1929 for example the wealthiest 1 percent of the population earned about the same amount of money as the bottom 42 percent.
uneven distribution of wealth creates problems this uneven distribution of the nations wealth created economic problems.
more than 60 percent of all american families had yearly incomes of less than 2 000 per year.
in contrast 24 000 of the countrys wealthiest families enjoyed annual incomes of more than 100 000 which was 50 times more than what most families were earning.
but these wealthy families did not eat 50 times more food than lower income families.
the wealthiest households did not purchase 50 times more automobiles or radios or ovens.
the rich undoubtedly spent a lot on consumer products.
the problem was that the wealthiest few could not buy enough to keep the economy booming.
a healthy economy needs more people to buy more products which in turn creates even more wealth.
in this way a healthy economy avoids underconsumption that can limit economic growth.
the uneven distribution of wealth in the 1920s pointed to an uncertain future for the american economy.
from the overproduction of the struggling farmer to the underconsumption of the lower income industrial worker deep seated problems created economic instability.
too many americans did not have enough money to buy what they needed or wanted.
americans rely on credit for a time the expansion of credit partially hid this problem.
americans bought automobiles appliances radios and other goods on credit.
using the installment plan they paid a small percentage down and the rest over a period of months or years.
by the end of the decade 80 percent of radios and 60 percent of cars were purchased on installment credit.
americans even bought stock on credit making such stock purchases on margin.
every year americans accumulated more debt.
in the past they had feared debt and put off buying goods until they had all of the cash to pay for those items.
easy credit changed this behavior during the 1920s.
but the growing credit burden could mask the problem of americans living beyond their means for only so long before the economy imploded.

v elps the great depression and the new deal 303 5 1 causes of the depression dazed investors gathered outside the new york stock exchange as the stock market crashed on october 29 1929.
despair gripped many americans following the stock market crash.
some people who were hardest hit by the crash had to sell their belongings just to pay their bills.
the stock market hits bottom by 1929 some economists were observing that soaring stock prices were based on little more than confidence.
the prices had no basis in reality.
although other experts disagreed it became clear that too much money was being poured into stock speculation as investors gambled often with money they did not even have on high risk stocks in hopes of turning a quick profit.
if the markets upward climb suddenly reversed course many investors would face economic devastation.
on september 3 1929 the stock market began to sputter and fall.
prices peaked and then slid downward in an uneven way.
at the end of october however the slide gave way to a free fall.
after the dow jones average dropped 21 points in one hour on october 23 many investors concluded that the boom was over.
they had lost confidence the very thing that had kept the market up for so long.
the next day october 24 came to be known as black thursday.
with confidence in the stock market failing nervous investors started to sell.
stock in general electric that once sold at 400 a share plunged to 283.
across the united states investors raced to pull their money out of the stock market.
on october 29 black tuesday the bottom fell out.
more than 16 million shares were sold as the stock market collapsed in the great crash.
billions of dollars were lost.
whole fortunes were wiped out in hours.
many speculators who had bought stock on margin lost everything they had.
president hoover tried to soothe americans by insisting that the business of the country is on a sound and prosperous basis but by november 13 the dow jones average had dropped like a brick from its september high of 381 to 198 7.
the great crash represented a rare extreme in the nations business cycle and a turning point for the american economy.

the great depression begins the stock market crash marked the beginning of the great depression a period lasting from 1929 to 1941 in which the economy faltered and unemployment soared.
though it did not start the depression by itself the crash sparked a chain of events that quickened the collapse of the u s economy.

1 interactive chart crash was the country s banking system.
the crisis in confidence continued as frightened depositors feared for their money and tried to withdraw it from their banks.
few banks could survive a sustained run of requests by depositors for their money.
in 1929 some 641 commercial banks failed.
a year later 1 350 failed.
and a year after that 1 700 went under.
by 1932 many americans feared that no banks would be left standing.
another cause of many bank failures was misguided monetary policy by the federal reserve.
during the 1920s the federal reserve which regulates the amount of money in circulation cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth.
but in 1929 worried about investors speculating too much with borrowed money the fed limited the money supply to discourage lending.
as a result there was too little money in circulation to help the economy after the stock market crash.
when plummeting stock prices sent investors to the banks to secure whatever hard money they had left the banks were cleaned out of currency and forced to close.
decreasing demand proves challenging for businesses banks were not the only institutions to face the harsh financial realities of the depression.
the collapse of stock prices combined with reduced consumer spending spelled trouble for american business.
business leaders believed that the survival of their companies depended on production cutbacks to maintain price levels and layoffs to reduce payroll.
while their stocks were still falling companies began closing plants and forcing workers onto the growing ranks of the unemployed.
in august 1931 henry ford closed several of his detroit automobile factories putting nearly 75 000 people out of work.
like a snowball rolling downhill the problem of production cuts kept getting bigger and bigger.
as businesses closed plants and fired workers to save money consumers spent less.
so businesses cut production even more closing more plants and firing more workers.
by 1933 nearly 25 percent of all american workers had lost their jobs.
the impact of tariffs new tariffs compounded the nations woes and helped to spread the depression.
intending to reverse the downward slide the government moved to protect american products from foreign competition by raising tariffs the taxes on goods imported from other countries.
in june 1930 congress passed the hawley smoot tariff.
president hoover signed the bill into law.
the hawley smoot tariff raised taxes on foreign imports to such a level that the foreign goods could not compete in the american market.
the tariff inspired european countries to retaliate and enact protective tariffs of their own.
the great depression and the new deal 305 5 1 causes of the depression far from solving the problems of the depression the hawley smoot tariff added to them.
at a time when american manufacturers and farms had a glut of unsold products the international move toward high protective tariffs closed markets.
this closure was not just harmful to american producers.
it was equally disastrous to the global economy.
the ripple effect caused by the hawley smoot tariff helped to damage international trade.
other nations endure economic hardship the hawley smoot tariff was one of the causes of a depression spreading across the globe.
as we saw earlier the european problems of reparation payments war debt payments and international imbalance of trade had already created a shaky economic structure.
in the early 1930s the structure collapsed.
germany ceased their reparation payments and the united states agreed to suspend france and britains war debt payments.
the international economy had largely been funded by american loans to europe but the crisis in the united states drastically curtailed those loans.
as a result european nations experienced the same cycle of business failures bank collapses and high brooklyn daily eagle late news viiss v wall st.

the causes of the great depression historians and economists struggle to identify the exact causes of the great depression.
some have stressed a single root cause in their explanations of the financial crisis.
the economist milton friedman believed that the depression resulted from the contraction in the money supply.
the twin events of the stock market crash in 1929 and the run of bank failures in 1930 added to the federal reserves monetary policy decisions left too little money in circulation for the nations economic needs.
john maynard keynes was one of the most influential economists of the depression.
he argued that the lack of government interference in the economy led to the depression.
critical problems in money supply distribution of wealth stock speculation consumer spending productivity and employment could have been controlled he said by proactive government policies.
keyness work points to a fundamental difference between many economists regarding the depression.
while keynes recommended that governments spend more money to keep people employed when the economy slows other noted economists like ludwig von mises and friedrich von hayek criticized centralized economic planning and management.
there will never be a fully accepted answer to the question of what caused the great depression.
but clearly problems in consumption contributed heavily to it.
economic hardships before 1929 in europe and rural america coupled with an uneven distribution of wealth and over speculation in the stock market created dangerous economic conditions.
when this was combined with poor or misinformed economic decisions by congress and president hoover the great depression resulted.

the stock market crash signaled the end of boom times and the beginning of hard times.
as investors mourned their losses americans watched the economy stagger into the great depression.
in the cities and on the farms desperate poverty gripped the nation.
even after prosperity returned those who lived through the crisis would remember the pain and worries of the depression.
tested by extreme hardship this generation of americans forged a character and will strong enough to overcome economic ruin and restore prosperity.
americans suffer economic hardship shakes the cities the great depression had a deep and lasting impact on the lives of the people who lived through it.
few americans grasped the underlying problems of the 1920s economy or the subtle reasons for the stock market crash.
fewer still comprehended how the crash led to the great depression.
but they did understand the effects of the economic crisis.
workers understood having a job one day and being unemployed the next.
whole families knew the fear and shame of losing their homes.
the great depression touched most americans because many americans either experienced or knew someone who experienced the hardships and loss caused by the economic catastrophe.
for many their lives were never the same again.
unemployment leaves families struggling the threat of widespread unemployment and destitution effected workers in cities and towns across the united states.
between 1921 and 1929 annual average unemployment rates had never risen above 3 7 percent.
but then the depression hit and the rate shot up.
by 1933 it had climbed to a shocking 24 9 percent.
308 despite this high rate millions of workers were able to keep their jobs.
however most had their wages or hours cut.
many workers brought home paychecks that were 10 20 sometimes 30 percent less than their predepression checks.
yet statistics tell only part of the story.
the human drama of unemployment unfolded over and over again in city after city across the nation.
for a man employed as a factory worker the 1920s had promised a chance at upward economic mobility.
he had been able to provide for his family enjoy a decent standard of living and save something for retirement.
then the depression hit.
the man saw his hours cut and his workweek shortened.
eventually he was laid off.
looking for another job he trudged from one factory to the next.
no help wanted here or we dont need nobody greeted him at every turn.
the mans clothes began to look worn.
his collars and cuffs became frayed and his pants became shiny at the knees.
he said less stared more and moved slower.
maybe his wife was able to find work washing and ironing clothes or laboring as a maid.
but those jobs were hard to find too.
at home children ate smaller meals.
water replaced milk.
meat disappeared from the table.
hunger lurked about the home like an unwanted guest.
sometimes the parents and children received free meals in public soup kitchens.
often the only place for the family to get a free scrap of food was in a bread line where people lined up for handouts from charities or public agencies.
poverty becomes a reality for many men like the factory worker just described moved from unemployed to unemployable.
whole families descended into hunger and homelessness.
their dreams of success and prosperity turned into nightmares of failure and poverty.
the challenges of homelessness as americans lost their jobs and ran through their savings they had to scrounge wherever they could to keep from going hungry.
they sold furniture pawned jewelry and moved to cheaper lodgings anything to keep their pantries stocked and rents paid.
in many cities they ran out of money were evicted from their homes and ended up on the streets.
homeless people slept on park benches in empty railway cars or in cardboard boxes.
many grouped together in hoovervilles makeshift shantytowns of tents and shacks built on public land or vacant lots.
homeless people some of whom had worked as skilled carpenters before the crisis cobbled houses together out of lumber scraps tar paper tin and glass.
one of unemployed men gathered outside a busy new york city unemployment office during the 1930s.
new york police officers stood guard.
draw conclusions why do you think this unemployment office required guarding.
struggling americans built temporary shelters called hoovervilles like this in one washington d c.
this encampment was home to war veterans who were lobbying the government for help.
the great depression and the new deal 309 5 2 americans suffer the largest hoovervilles in the country sprang up in the middle of central park in new york city.
there the homeless covered themselves with newspapers called hoover blankets to stay warm at night.
they walked around looking for jobs with their empty pants pockets turned inside out a sign of poverty known as hoover flags.
despite the difficulties of life during the depression many americans did what they could to boost morale and help their neighbors.

rural america struggles with poverty in cities and towns across the nation americans faced a terrible plight.
the numbers of the unemployed homeless and hopeless increased like a casualty list in some great war.
in rural america people fared no better.
in fact sometimes their condition was even worse.
farmers had been suffering even before the great depression.
falling commodity prices and accumulating debt had made it a struggle for farmers to keep their heads above water.
many failed to stay afloat and sank so deep that they lost their farms.
crop prices fall but then the bottom fell out of the economy and the depression added more woes.
crop prices fell even further and new debts were added to old debts.
to make matters even worse the great plains was suffering through a choking drought an ecological disaster that lasted for years.
as a result many more farmers lost their farms and moved.
they traveled about the country looking for work and fighting for survival.
the basic reality of farm life was the low prices paid to farmers for crops they grew for market.
in 1919 a bushel of wheat sold for 2 16 in 1932 it sold for 38 cents.
a pound of cotton fetched 35 34 cents in 1919 the same pound fetched 6 52 cents in 1932.
the sharp fall in prices was evident with other farm products corn and beans cattle and hogs.
the income farmers generated was not enough to allow them to continue farming.
they could not pay their debts purchase more seed repair equipment and buy what their families needed to survive.
overburdened by the diminishing returns for their labor some farmers buckled under the stress.
draw conclusions why did commodity prices fall after 1919 even though the great depression was years away.

in sioux city iowa in 1932 the sioux city milk producers association threatened to strike if its members did not see higher profits for their milk.
when the associations threats were ignored by local storeowners farmers dumped 1 000 gallons of milk on a road outside the city.
despite such a drastic and for many americans unthinkable action farmers everywhere feared losing everything.
losing the family farm between 1930 and 1934 nearly one million farmers failed to pay their mortgages and lost their farms.
banks foreclosed on their lands and houses and repossessed their farming equipment.
the bankers sold what they could at public auctions.
some farmers remained on the land as tenant farmers working for bigger landowners rather than for themselves.
but another effect was that many people drifted away from their rural communities and migrated to cities to look for some other kind of work.
cesar chavez who later became a well known labor organizer recalled the troubles his proud father had during the depression.
a california bank repossessed his fathers small ranch and the family was evicted from their house.
chavez remembered how it felt to lose his home we had been poor but we knew every night there was a bed there and this was our room.
but that all of a sudden changed.
when you re small you cant figure these things out.
you know somethings not right and you dont like it but you don t.
let that get you down.
you sort of just continue to move.
cesar chavez like the chavez family other farmers moved on after their losses.
but for those who remained mother nature dealt a cruel blow to already cruel times.
the dust bowl farmers who survived the tumble in prices were still not safe.
through the mid 1930s a drought in the great plains added to their problems.
water was a constant problem in the region.
normal rainfall seldom exceeded the 20 inches a year that traditional american agricultural practices demanded.
as a result droughts on the great plains were often more devastating than those in the east and midwest.
in the years before americas western rivers were dairy farmers poured out their milk as part of a 1932 protest.
infer what can you infer about the price farmers received for milk in 1932.
ii i many american farmers struggled to keep their farms during the great depression.
in time falling prices and rising debt forced many like this oregon farmer to sell or abandon their farms.
the great depression and the new deal 311 5 2 americans suffer dammed and irrigation practices became widespread there were few answers to the drought threat.
new farming methods made drought conditions worse.
intensive farming came to prominence throughout the region in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
farmers then had moved onto the plains and plowed under much of the natural grasses in order to plant oceans of winter wheat.
and after 1909 there were many more farmers too.
in that year the federal government expanded the acreage allotted in the homestead act to 320 acres per settler.
so a new wave of transplants decided to try farming on the often marginal lands that were still available on the great plains.
all this intensive farming reduced the amount of grassland available to graze livestock causing overgrazing on what was left.
in addition new tractor pulled disk plows pulverized the soil making it more vulnerable to wind erosion.
population growth and shifts in population distribution along with new methods of farming tipped the ecological balance of the region.
in the past plains grasses prevented the topsoil from blowing away during periods of drought.
by the early 1930s that dwindling grassy safety net could no longer do the job.
in 1932 the combination of the human geographic factor of loose topsoil caused by overfarming and grazing and the physical geographic factors of drought and high winds resulted in disaster on the great plains.
the winds kicked up towering dust storms that began to blow east.
these gigantic clouds of dust and dirt could rise from ground level to a height of 8 000 feet.
the dust storms moved as fast as 100 miles per hour and blotted out the sun plunging daylight into darkness.
most of the dust storms started in the southern great plains especially the high plains regions of texas oklahoma kansas new mexico and colorado.
this swath of parched earth became known as the dust bowl.
for people living in these hardest hit regions depression and dust storms defined the misery of the dirty thirties those unfortunate enough to be caught in a dust storm were temporarily choked and blinded by the swirling dirt.
the storms killed cattle and birds blanketed rivers and suffocated fish.
dirt seeped into houses covering everything with a thick coat of grime.
some dust clouds blew east as far as the atlantic coast dumping acres of dirt on boston new york and washington d c.
altogether dust storms displaced twice as much dirt as americans had scooped out to build the panama canal.
moving wherever work can be found many farm families trapped in the dust bowl had little choice but to leave the region.

dust storms had destroyed most remaining opportunities in their locale.
they were low on everything except despair.
although only some came from oklahoma dust bowl refugees were generally referred to as okies regardless of their states of origin.
okie families packed onto rickety trucks and headed toward california or oregon or washington any place where a job might be found.
before the pace slowed 800 000 people migrated out of missouri arkansas oklahoma and texas alone.
the collapse of agriculture and the great plains dust bowl caused millions of other americans to leave the midwestern and southern regions where they were born.
many migrated to california lured by the promise of jobs but were crushed when that promise too often proved empty.
in reality the migrants faced fierce competition from mexican american filipino and other farm laborers who were also seeking work.
many of them gave up farming and headed for nearby cities such as los angeles san francisco and san diego hoping to find factory work or to join the military.
other farm families headed north or east to the cities of the northeast and midwest again looking for jobs shelter and relief.
one of the irreversible effects of this massive migration some 2 5 million people left the plains states alone was that rural states lost population while states with large cities gained population.
it was one of the largest migrations in the nations history once again changing the nations demographic patterns.
the dust bowl had other effects as well.
the farmers best able to survive the great depression were the ones with the biggest operations.
they often bought repossessed land at rock bottom prices and expanded their holdings into large commercial farms.
the dust bowl also motivated the government to help great plains farmers.
after the initial crisis immense federal projects dammed western rivers.
dams eventually provided irrigation that made farm profits possible on the great plains.
check understanding how did some farmers become tenant farmers.
hard times hit most americans one of the ironies of the depression was the word itself.
in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries an economic slump was called a panic or a crisis.
president hoover used the word depression to describe the state of affairs because he thought it sounded less large clouds of dust engulfed farmhouses like these in stratford texas in 1935.
the intensity of dust bowl storms caused many to lose their farms to the banks and forced families to migrate.

the great depression and the new deal 313 5 2 americans suffer severe than the other terms.
but before long hoovers depression gave way to the depression and then the great depression the term described not only a state of mind but also an economic reality.
it showed a despondent america filled with people overwhelmed by seemingly inescapable poverty.
not only did the depression make victims of the men and women who lost jobs it also was an economic and emotional crisis that profoundly affected u s society.
families suffer during the depression for millions of americans the depression was an intensely personal affair.
men who lost their jobs and could not find other work often felt that they had betrayed their families.
they had been the breadwinners the providers the ones whose paychecks fed and clothed the family and kept a roof over everyones head.
the loss of a job meant a reduction in status.
different men reacted differently to unemployment.
many labored tirelessly to find a new job while others sank into shame and despair.
some even deserted their families.
the unemployed were not the only ones who suffered.
men lucky enough to have jobs lived in constant fear that the next paycheck would be their last.
they often felt guilty for being employed while so many of their relatives and friends were suffering.
few americans were spared from the crisis.
mothers like this one struggled during the great depression to find ways to earn additional income while trying to ensure their children had enough to eat.
interactive gallery wives and children experienced the pain of their husbands and fathers.
birthrates plummeted to the lowest levels in american history a sure sign of family distress.
mothers worked constantly to stretch meager family incomes.
they sewed clothes searched for odd jobs and valiantly tried to meet their families needs.
with both parents preoccupied with making something out of nothing family discipline often declined.
some children quit school.
others ran away from home.
families coped with the depression as best they could.
some huddled together working to survive the hard times.
others broke apart making those times even harder and lonelier.
poor minorities suffer disproportionately the depression affected everyone but it did not affect them equally.
americans on the bottom rung of the economic ladder the poorest of the poor often minorities with no financial resources felt the sting of the depression the keenest.
a howard university sociologist noted early in the crisis that african americans were the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
in the south landowners threw african american sharecroppers off the plots they had been farming.
many of these workers migrated to northern cities but there were no jobs waiting there.
only more poverty greeted them.
in 1932 unemployment among african americans hovered around 50 percent nearly double the national rate.
however african americans had long stood firm against the challenges of poverty.
they relied on the emotional resources of family and religion to cope with grim times.
during his interview with a depression historian an african american man explained what the depression meant to african americans the negro was born in depression.
it didnt mean too much to him the great american depression as you call it.
there was no such thing.
the best he could be was a janitor or a porter or shoeshine boy.
it only became official when it hit the white man.
clifford burke quoted in hard tunes 1970 hard times came upon mexican americans and others as well.
as more okies headed west out of the dust bowl the competition for jobs between those migrants and mexican american and asian american farmworkers in states like california heated up.
a flood tide of workers struggled to find and keep farm jobs.
often mexican americans and asian americans the great depression and the new deal 314 5 2 americans suffer faced the additional burden of discrimination when competing with white farmhands for those jobs.
in the southwest many white americans clamored for asian american and mexican american repatriation.
repatriation involved efforts by local state and federal governments to encourage or coerce immigrants and their naturalized children to return to their country of origin.
hundreds of thousands of people of mexican ancestry many of them u s citizens were pushed out of the united states.
some were deported others pressured to leave voluntarily.
even so many more remained.
by the end of the 1930s mexican americans were working in most economic sectors of the southwest including farming ranching and industry.
compared to the exit of mexican americans the number of europeans departing was small.
still nearly 200 000 european immigrants left the united states between 1931 and 1934 the peak years of repatriation.
how many of these departures were involuntary is impossible to know.
what is known however is that the united states severely restricted all immigration during the depression.
tragically this policy included denying entrance to thousands of german jews who were fleeing nazi persecution in their homeland.

but americans looked to him as their president to solve the crisis.
hoover was an intelligent man familiar with business methods and economic theory.
he labored long hours consulted a wide range of experts and tried to marshal the resources of the country to solve the problems of the depression.
as the effects of the great depression on the u s economy worsened he tried several different approaches.
in the end although he failed to discover the right formula it was not because of a lack of effort.
at the start of the economic downturn hoover followed a hands off policy.
like most economists of the day hoover viewed the upswings and downswings of business cycles as natural occurrences.
he felt that government should not interfere with such events.
periodic depressions were like storms.
they could not be avoided but strong businesses could weather them without the support of the government.
relying on volunteerism a policy of doing nothing however was no policy at all.
hoover soon recognized this fact and turned to a policy he had used in the past.
as secretary of commerce during the pearsonl realize access your digital lesson.
316 1920s hoover had encouraged business and labor to voluntarily work toward common goals.
to address the current crisis he asked business and industrial leaders to keep employment wages and prices at current levels.
he simultaneously called for the government to reduce taxes lower interest rates and create public works programs.
the plan was to put more money into the hands of businesses and individuals to encourage more production and consumption.
this hoover said would reverse the cycle that led to the depression.
lastly hoover requested that wealthier individuals give more money to charity.
millions of americans did give money clothing and food to private and religious charities which then distributed the goods to those in need.
the idea was for all americans to voluntarily join forces to combat the depression.
voluntary cooperation fails although the plan was well intentioned hoovers program relied too much on voluntary cooperation.
the president believed he could persuade americans to act in the best interests of the country as a whole rather than in their own best interests.
he took care to encourage not legislate americas recovery.
but volunteerism did not work.
businesses cut wages and laid off workers because business owners thought they had to do so to keep their businesses afloat.
farmers boosted production because they thought that producing more crops would help them keep their family farms.
most americans followed individual not cooperative courses.
hoover had also asked state and local governments to provide more jobs and relief measures.
he had faith in localism the policy whereby problems could best be solved at local and state levels.
however in this severe situation towns and states simply did not have the financial or human resources to successfully combat the crisis.
making matters worse the president strongly resisted using federal resources to provide direct relief to individuals.
believing it to be unconstitutional hoover opposed public assistance and instead favored rugged individualism which allowed people to better themselves through their own efforts.
yet as the months wore on unemployment increased charities ran low on money and local and state governments could no longer plug the leaks in the economy.
some critics began to argue that the crisis demanded decisive federal action.
hoover reverses course with hoovervilles and homelessness on the rise it became evident that the presidents policies were not working.

determine point of view what do the signs in the photo tell you about how the poor perceived the governments role in the economic crisis.
analyze political cartoons what does this cartoon say about the difference between president hoovers perception of the depression and the reality many americans faced.
the great depression and the new deal 317 5 3 two presidents respond name with suffering and want indicated americans negative feelings about their leader and his failed policies.
faced with growing and increasingly harsh criticism hoover finally decided to reverse course and use federal resources to battle the depression.
believing the economy suffered from a lack of credit he urged congress to create the reconstruction finance corporation rfc.
created by congress in early 1932 the rfc gave more than a billion dollars of government loans to railroads and large businesses.
the agency also lent money to banks so that they could extend more loans to struggling businesses.
hoover believed that if the government lent money to bankers they would lend it in turn to businesses.
companies would then hire workers production and consumption would increase and the depression would end.
this theory known as trickle down economics held that money poured into the top of the economic pyramid will trickle down to the base.
although the rfc put the federal government at the center of economic life it did not work well under hoovers guidance.
the rfc lent out billions but all too often bankers did not increase their loans to businesses.
additionally businesses often did not use the loans they received to hire more workers.
in the end the money did not trickle down to the people who needed it the most.
despite the failings of the rfc hoover succeeded with one project that made a difference.
during the 1920s secretary of commerce hoover had called for the construction of a dam on the colorado river.
by the time hoover became president in 1929 congress had approved the project as part of a massive public works program.
workers broke ground on boulder dam later renamed hoover dam in 1930.
construction brought much needed employment to the southwest during the early 1930s.
check understanding why was hoovers faith in localism as a response to the depression misplaced.
challenging economic times lead to protest from the oval office hoover worked hard to end the depression.
but to many out of work americans the president became a symbol of failure.
some people blamed capitalism while others questioned the responsiveness of democracy.
many believed the american system was due for an overhaul.
calls for radical change some americans thought the answer to the countrys problems was source harvard kennedy school analyze charts supply side or trickle down economics is a theory that plays out differently based on economic circumstances.
in theory how would trickle down economics generate economic growth.
the great depression and the new deal 318 5 3 two presidents respond the rejection of capitalism and the acceptance of socialism or communism.
they argued that capitalism created great inequities of wealth and an unhealthy atmosphere of competition in society.
in fact they saw the depression as a sign that capitalism was about to collapse.
looking at the soviet union they maintained that a state run economy was the only avenue out of the depression.
however even during the worst of the crisis most americans were unmoved by communist calls for revolution.
communisms appeal proved no match for americans guarantees of individual freedom and dreams of progress and opportunity.
fascist appeals from the political right also failed to hold any attraction.
economic troubles in europe contributed to the rise to power of fascist leaders like benito mussolini in italy and adolf hitler in germany.
despite this political shift abroad fascists failed to gain power in the united states.
although some questioned the ability of americas capitalistic and democratic institutions to overcome the crisis most americans never lost faith in their country.
the bonus army marches on washington although most americans did not want a revolution many did desire substantial changes.
in 1932 thousands of world war i veterans marched on washington d c demanding a solution to their particular problem.
they became known as the bonus army.
in 1924 congress had passed the adjusted compensation act which provided for a lump sum payment to veterans of world war i in 1945.
but in 1931 many veteran groups began to call for an early payment of the bonus arguing that out of work vets needed the money to support their families.
in may and june of 1932 almost twenty thousand veterans arrived in the capital setting up camps and occupying empty government buildings.
the house of representatives agreed with their aims and passed a bill to provide early payment of the bonuses.
however the bill was defeated in the senate in mid june.
some of the bonus army marchers left discouraged.
others stayed to continue to lobby for the bill.
a riot broke out in july when police tried to evict the marchers from government buildings.
the protests end badly although president hoover sympathized with the marchers he called for general douglas macarthur and federal troops to sjurround the affected area and clear it without delay macarthur exceeded his order deciding to move the marchers out of the city altogether.
he ordered his troops to ready tear gas and fix bayonets.
the army force that pushed the marchers out included not only macarthur but also the future world over 2 000 veterans held a vigil on the u s.

war ii generals dwight eisenhower and george patton.
while eisenhower regretted the use of the army to solve a political problem patton ordered his troops to brandish their sabers in a show of force.
force was exactly what macarthur used.
more than one thousand marchers were tear gassed and many were injured some very badly.
after the removal macarthur said that the marchers were a gang of revolutionaries bent on taking over the government they had come to the conclusion beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were about to take over.
direct control of the government.
it is my opinion that had the president let it go on another week the institutions of our government would have been very severely threatened.
douglas macarthur 1932 hoover had not ordered the use of such force against the veterans.
nevertheless photographs of american troops marching with fixed bayonets against ragged veterans shocked the nation.

evalyn mclean washington d c resident in the summer of 1932 any chance that hoover had for winning reelection in november ended after the summer of 1932.
recall what argument was made by some in favor of turning to socialism or communism in the face of the depression.
americans turn to roosevelt in 1928 herbert hoover had almost no chance of losing his bid for the presidency.
in 1932 however he had almost no chance of winning reelection.
with unemployment nearing 25 percent peoples savings wiped out by bank failures long lines at soup kitchens general douglas macarthur left confers with colonel dwight eisenhower right as they prepare to clear out the bonus army marchers in washington d c stomachs grumbling from hunger and the number of homeless increasing every day the depression had taken its toll.
most americans felt that their president had failed completely and they were ready for a change.
in july of 1932 the governor of new york franklin d roosevelt accepted the democratic partys nomination for president.
political success and personal challenge strangely enough democrats had chosen a presidential candidate who had never known economic hardship.
as a child franklin delano roosevelt had enjoyed all the privileges of an upper class upbringing including education at elite schools and colleges.
from his parents and teachers fdr gained a great deal of self confidence and a belief that public service was a noble calling.
in 1905 franklin married his distant cousin eleanor roosevelt.
president theodore roosevelt eleanors uncle and franklins fifth cousin gave the bride away.
in time eleanor would also become deeply involved in public affairs.
like teddy roosevelt franklin rose quickly through the political ranks.
after election to the new york state senate he served as woodrow wilsons assistant secretary of the navy.
in 1920 roosevelt was the democratic partys vice presidential candidate.
although the democrats lost the election many considered him the rising star of the party.
then in the summer of 1921 tragedy struck.
while vacationing fdr slipped off his boat into the chilly waters of the north atlantic.
that evening he awoke with a high fever and severe pains in his back and legs.
two weeks later roosevelt was diagnosed with polio a dreaded disease that at the time had no treatment.
he never fully recovered the use of his legs.
fdr did not allow his physical disability to break his spirit.
with eleanors encouragement he made a political comeback.
in 1928 he was elected governor of new york and earned a reputation as a reformer.
in 1932 he became the democrats presidential candidate pledging a new deal for the american people roosevelt becomes president when fdr pledged a new deal he had only a vague idea of how he intended to combat the depression.
believing that the federal government needed to play an active role in promoting recovery and providing relief to americans he experimented with different approaches to see which ones worked best.

experimentation.
it is common sense to take a method and to try it.
if it fails admit it frankly and try another.
but above all try something.
d roosevelt speech at oglethorpe university may 22 1932 the 1932 election campaign pitted roosevelt against president hoover.
the two men advocated very different approaches to the problems of the great depression.
hoover believed that depression relief should come from state and local governments and private agencies.
roosevelt believed that the depression required strong action and leadership by the federal government.
as hoover correctly noted this campaign is more than a contest between two men.
it is a contest between two philosophies of government hoovers popularity declined as the great depression worsened.
even longtime republicans deserted him.
fdr with the support of those who embraced his ideas as well as those who opposed hoovers approach won a landslide victory winning the electoral votes of all but six states.
americans had to wait four long months between roosevelts election in november 1932 and his inauguration in march 1933.
meanwhile they watched helplessly as thousands of banks collapsed and unemployment soared.
what would roosevelt do to combat the depression.
even the experts did not know what to expect.
forming the brain trust to help him plan the new deal fdr sought the advice of a diverse group of men and women.
among the most influential was a group of professionals and academics whom the press nicknamed the brain trust roosevelt a democrat displayed his bipartisan openness by nominating two republicans henry wallace and harold ickes ihk uhs to serve as his secretary of agriculture and secretary of interior.
roosevelt also nominated frances perkins a social worker to serve as his secretary of labor.
she became the first woman cabinet member in u s history.
throughout his presidency fdr depended heavily on his wife eleanor.
she traveled widely interacting with the american people and serving as fdrs eyes and ears for example in 1933 the bonus army which had marched on washington d c in 1932 returned to the capital once again seeking an early payment of its bonus for world war i service.
like hoover fdr informed the marchers that the government could not afford to pay them their bonus.
but unlike hoover who had sent the army to evict the bonus army fdr sent eleanor.
she sang songs with the great depression and the new deal 321 5 3 two presidents respond the veterans and made them feel that the government cared.
u check understanding in your own words explain what hoover meant when he said the 1932 presidential election was a contest between two philosophies of government the new deal begins during his first hundred days in office which became known as the hundred days roosevelt proposed and congress passed 15 major bills.
these measures had three goals relief recovery and reform.
roosevelt wanted to provide relief from the immediate hardships of the depression and achieve a long term economic recovery.
he also instituted reforms to prevent future depressions.
restoring the nations confidence roosevelt wasted no time dealing with the nations number one crisis.
late in 1932 banks had begun to fail in great numbers.
a banking panic gripped the nation as frightened depositors lined up outside banks trying to withdraw their savings.
president roosevelt talked directly to the american public through his fireside radio broadcasts.
he used these broadcasts as an opportunity to calm the fears of the american people.
the day after his inauguration roosevelt called congress into a special session and convinced them to pass laws to shore up the nations banking system.
the emergency banking bill gave the president broad powers including the power to declare a four day bank holiday banks all over the country were ordered to close.
the closings gave banks time to get their accounts in order before they reopened for business.
eight days after becoming president roosevelt delivered an informal radio speech to the american people.
this was the first of many presidential fireside chats.
they became an important way for roosevelt to communicate with the american people.
in the first fireside chat fdr explained the measures he had taken to stem the run on banks.
his calming words reassured the american people.
when the bank holiday ended americans did not rush to their banks to withdraw their funds.
roosevelt had convinced them that the banks were a safe place to keep their money.
reforming the financial system a number of roosevelt s proposals sought to reform the nations financial institutions.
one act created the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic which insured bank deposits up to 5 000.
in the following year congress established the securities and exchange commission sec to regulate the stock market and make it a safer place for investments.
these financial reforms helped restore confidence in the economy.
runs on banks ended largely because americans now had confidence that they would not lose their lifetime savings if a bank failed.
therefore more americans trusted their money to a bank where it could be lended out to individuals and businesses helping to ensure an adequate money supply.
the stock markets also stabilized as regulated trading practices reassured investors.
today both organizations continue to affect the lives of u s citizens.
the fdic continues to insure bank deposits so americans can trust their money to banks.
the sec continues to regulate trading practices so americans feel comfortable investing in the stock market.
to further solve the banking crisis fdr took action to combat the currency shortage.
in april 1933 roosevelt ordered individuals and businesses to turn in any gold they owned worth more than 100 to the federal reserve and stopped u s banks from exporting and redeeming gold.
the federal reserve began to accumulate and hold on to gold reserves which it pegged to a certain value.
then in june 1933 a joint resolution of congress cut the tie between gold and paper money.
americans could no longer redeem their paper money for its value in gold.
with these actions interactive timeline the great depression and the new deal 322 5 3 two presidents respond the tennessee valley authority analyze maps use the map and the text to describe specifically the number and i nature of tva projects what states benefited and how they benefited.
key i j region served by tva dam a power plant a interactive gallery 3 100 km albers conic equal area projection fdrs administration took another step in the shifting trend from a gold standard to fiat money or money that is not backed by gold or silver only a government decree.
the move had the advantage of making the money supply more flexible and controllable.
however many experts even some of roosevelts advisers believed that devaluing the dollar was risky and dangerous and would have long term negative effects.
reforming agriculture a number of new deal programs were aimed at easing the desperate plight of american farmers.
for years the supply of crops grown by american farmers had far exceeded demand.
prices dropped to the point where it was no longer profitable to grow some crops.
to counter this congress passed the agricultural adjustment act aaa which sought to end overproduction and raise crop prices.
to accomplish these goals the aaa provided financial aid paying farmers subsidies to cut production and forego planting on some of their land.
some farmers plowed under crops and killed off excess livestock.
many americans believed it was immoral to kill livestock or destroy crops while people went hungry.
by 1934 however farm prices began to rise.
these governmental actions to help farmers proved a mixed blessing for the nation however.
some farmers didnt qualify for the program.
the increase in farm prices also raised the price of food.
in addition the aaa left many tenant farmers unemployed when large landowners took the land they were farming out of production.
creating the tva americans living in the tennessee river valley of the rural south were among the poorest in the nation.
few had electricity running water or proper sewage systems.
in 1933 congress responded by creating a government agency called the tennessee valley authority tva.
the tva built a series of dams in the tennessee river valley to control floods and to generate electric power.
the agency also replanted forests and built fertilizer plants.
these projects created jobs and attracted industry with the promise of cheap power.
despite its accomplishments the tva attracted a host of critics.
some labeled it socialist because it gave government direct control of an industry.
private power companies complained that they could not compete with the tva because the agency paid no taxes.
however the tvas successes in improving life in the tennessee valley have ensured its survival to the present.
relief and recovery during the hundred days roosevelt proposed and congress enacted numerous other relief measures.
to counter the depressions the great depression and the new deal 323 5 3 two presidents respond devastating impact on young men fdr created the civilian conservation corps ccc.
the ccc provided jobs for more than 2 million young men.
they replanted forests built trails dug irrigation ditches and fought forest fires.
as time went on programs such as the ccc became more inclusive extending work and training to mexican american and other minority youth as well as to whites.
fdr called the ccc his favorite new deal program.
congress passed a number of other relief acts.
the federal emergency relief act fera granted federal funds to state and local agencies to help the unemployed.
the short lived civil works administration cwa provided jobs on public works projects.
on another front congress created the home owners loan corporation holc which loaned money at low interest rates to homeowners who could not meet mortgage payments.
the federal housing administration fha insured bank loans used for building and repairing homes.
these new deal measures marked a clear break from the policies of the hoover administration which had avoided direct relief to individuals.
the 500 million appropriated for fera represented the largest peacetime expenditure by the federal government to that time.
the centerpiece of the early new deals recovery program was the national industrial recovery analyze political cartoons cite evidence from the cartoon that supports the conclusion that new deal programs had negative effects on the american public.
act which established the national recovery administration nra.
roosevelt called the nra the most important and far reaching legislation ever enacted by the american congress.
working with business and labor leaders the nra developed codes of fair competition to govern whole industries.
these codes established minimum wages for workers and minimum prices for the goods that businesses sold.
the idea behind these codes was to increase the wages of workers so they could buy more goods and raise prices so companies could make a profit.
another major piece of new deal legislation was the public works administration pwa which built bridges dams power plants and government buildings.
the pwa was responsible for building many important structures that are still in use today such as new york citys triborough bridge the overseas highway linking miami and key west florida and the bonneville dam on the columbia river in the pacific northwest.
these public works projects improved the nations infrastructure and created millions of new jobs for workers.
id recall what was the purpose of fdrs fireside chats.
critics of the new deal while roosevelt had little difficulty gaining support from congress for his proposals a minority of americans expressed their opposition to the new deal.
critics on the political right thought the changes the new deal brought were too radical.
critics on the left thought that they were not radical enough.
several of fdrs critics attracted mass followings and made plans to challenge him for the presidency in 1936.
too much or not enough.
the chief complaint of conservatives against the new deal was that it made the federal government too powerful.
critics contended that the government was telling business how to operate spending large sums of money and piling up a huge national debt.
to many conservatives the new deal was destroying free enterprise and undermining individualism.
in a 1934 book entitled the challenge to liberty former president herbert hoover described the new deal as the most stupendous invasion of the whole spirit of liberty in the nations history.
robert taft the son of former president william howard taft and a leading republican in congress believed that roosevelts programs threatened individual freedom.
in 1934 these critics formed the american liberty league.
supporters included prominent business the great depression and the new deal 324 5 3 two presidents respond leaders such as alfred sloan and william knudsen of general motors.
leading democrats such as john w davis the democrats presidential nominee in 1924 and a1 smith the nominee in 1928 joined the liberty league because they felt roosevelt had deserted the democratic partys principles of a limited federal government.
while conservatives accused fdr of supporting socialism some leading socialists charged that the new deal did not do enough to end the depression.
norman thomas the socialist partys presidential candidate claimed that fdrs only concern was saving the banking system and ensuring profits for big business.
the american communist party described the new deal as a capitalist ruse populist critics gain a following the most significant criticism of fdr came from a cluster of figures whose roots were in the populist movement.
they saw themselves as spokesmen for poor americans challenging the power of the elite.
roosevelts strongest and most popular critics were francis townsend father charles coughlin and huey long.
townsend a doctor from california had a simple approach to resolving the economic effects of the great depression.
it called for the federal government to provide 200 a month to all citizens over the age of 60.
these funds he argued would filter out to the rest of society and produce an economic recovery.
to promote this plan he established townsend clubs and held meetings that resembled old time church revivals.
father charles coughlin presented an even bigger challenge to fdr.
coughlin a roman catholic priest had attracted millions of listeners to his weekly radio show.
at first coughlin supported the new deal but in time he broke with fdr accusing him of not doing enough to fight the depression.
coughlin said that roosevelt had out hoovered hoover and called the new deal the raw deal coughlin mixed calls for the nationalization of industry with anti semitic remarks and attacks on communists who he charged were running the country.
by the early 1940s coughlins views became so extreme that roman catholic officials forced him to end his broadcasts.
canadian by birth coughlin could not run against fdr in the 1936 election.
however he threatened to throw his support behind an even more popular new deal critic senator huey long of louisiana.
long was an expert performer whose folksy speeches delighted audiences.
longs approach to solving the depression was his share our wealth program that proposed louisiana senator huey long drew attention for his sharp criticism of new deal programs and his belief that income should be redistributed from the wealthy to the poor through taxes.
high taxes on the wealthy and large corporations and the redistribution of their income to poor americans.
god invited us all to come and eat and drink all we wanted.
he smiled on our land and we grew crops of plenty to eat and wear.
but then rockefeller morgan and their crowd stepped up and took enough for 120 000 000 people and left only enough for 5 000 000 for all the other 125 000 000 to eat.
and so the millions must go hungry and without those good things god gave us unless we call on them to put some of it back.
huey long radio broadcast 1934 roosevelt viewed long as a serious political threat.
indeed a poll taken in 1935 estimated that under the right circumstances long could have attracted up to 4 million votes in the 1936 presidential election.
although not enough votes to win the election his candidacy could have drawn votes from roosevelt the great depression and the new deal 325 5 3 two presidents respond damaging the presidents chances.
but long never got that opportunity.
for years he had ruled louisiana as if he owned the state wresting control of nearly every facet of governance from local and other state officials.
on his way to achieving this dominance he made many enemies.
in 1935 a political enemy assassinated long ending the most serious threat to roosevelts presidency.

the great depression and the new deal 5 3 two presidents respond fdrs goals for the first phases of the new deal were relief recovery and reform.
progress had been made but there still was a long way to go.
beginning in early 1935 roosevelt launched an aggressive campaign to find solutions to the ongoing problems caused by the great depression.
this campaign sometimes known as the second new deal created social security and other programs that continue to have a profound impact on the everyday lives of americans.
the new deal expands expanding new deal programs in his fireside chats press conferences and major addresses roosevelt explained the challenges facing the nation.
he said that the complexities of the modern world compelled the federal government to promote the general welfare and to intervene to protect citizens rights.
roosevelt used legislation passed during the second phase of the new deal to try to accomplish these goals.
this second wave of legislation addressed the problems of the elderly the poor and the unemployed created new public works projects helped farmers and enacted measures to protect workers rights.
it still focused on relief recovery and reform but with more of a longer term focus.
it was during this period that the first serious challenges to the new deal emerged.
new jobs programs in the spring of 1935 congress appropriated 5 billion for new jobs and created the works progress administration wpa to administer the program.
roosevelt placed his longtime associate harry hopkins in charge.
the wpa built or improved a good part of the nations highways dredged rivers and harbors and promoted soil and water conservation.

327 the wpa even provided programs in the arts for displaced artists writers and actors.
as hopkins explained artists have to eat just like other people by 1943 the wpa had employed more than 8 million people and spent about 11 billion.
its workers built more than 650 000 miles of highways and 125 000 public buildings.
among the most famous projects funded by the wpa were the san antonio river walk and parts of the appalachian trail.
all of these programs were expensive and the government paid for them by spending money it did not have.
the federal deficit 461 million in 1932 grew to 4 4 billion in 1936.
the enormous expenditures and growing debt led many to criticize the governments public works projects as wasteful.
some economists disagreed.
british economist john maynard keynes argued that deficit spending was needed to end the depression.
according to keynes putting people to work on public projects put money into the hands of consumers who would buy more goods stimulating the economy.
keynes called this theory pump priming.
critics also argued that fdr was using the program to build voter loyalty to the democratic party.
social security was established to help retirees.
retired bookkeeper ida fuller of ludlow vermont displayed her monthly check here.
it was for 41 30.
aiding older americans the united states was one of the few industrialized nations in the world that did not have some form of pension system for the elderly.
during the depression many elderly people had lost their homes and their life savings and were living in poverty.
on january 17 1935 president roosevelt unveiled his plans for social security.
the social security act passed by congress in 1935 established a pension system for retirees.
it also established unemployment insurance for workers who lost their jobs.
in addition the law created insurance for victims of work related accidents and provided aid for poverty stricken mothers and children the blind and the disabled.
it was funded by a payroll tax on employers and workers.
the social security act had many flaws.
at first it did not apply to domestic workers or farmworkers.
since african americans were disproportionately employed in these fields they were not eligible for many of the benefits of social security.
widows received smaller benefits than widowers because people presumed that elderly women could manage on less money than elderly men.
despite these shortcomings social security proved the most popular and significant of the new deal programs.
social security continues today to provide basic economic security to millions of americans.
its programs act as a safety net for senior citizens the poor and others in financial need.
popular support for social security continues although concern mounts over the programs long term funding and ability to keep making payments.
supporting american farms another new deal program that passed in 1935 included further help for farmers.
when the depression began only 10 percent of all farms had electricity largely because utility companies did not find it profitable to run electric lines to communities with small populations.
to bring farmers into the light congress established the rural electrification administration rea.
the rea loaned money to electric utilities to build power lines bringing electricity to isolated rural areas.
this program had a tremendous beneficial effect on rural communities.
the rea was so successful that by 1950 about 80 percent of american farms had electricity.
new deal programs changed the relationship of the federal government to the american farmer.
the government was now committed to providing price supports or subsidies for agriculture.
critics attacked price supports for undermining the free market.
others observed that large farms not small farmers benefited most from federal farm programs.
even during the 1930s many noticed that tenant farmers the great depression and the new deal j 5 4 the new deal expands r 1933 agriculture the new deal agricultural adjustment act 1933 congress set price supports to taxes were levied against food offset falling prices by controlling processors to pay for subsidies.

water for an expanding west many of the new deal public works water projects had an enormous impact on the development of the american west.
the government funded the complex central valley irrigation system in california.
the massive bonneville dam in the pacific northwest controlled flooding and provided electricity to a vast number of citizens.
u describe why was it necessary to establish the rural electrification administration in order to bring electricity to farmers.
labor unions thrive even before the great depression most industrial workers labored long hours for little pay.
few belonged to labor unions.
during the great depression however there was an upsurge in union activity.
new unions enlisted millions of workers from the mining and automobile industries.
a new relationship between workers and business owners roosevelt believed that the success of the new deal depended on raising the standard of living for american industrial workers.
this he believed would improve the entire economy.
the national labor relations act was the most important piece of new deal labor legislation.
also called the wagner act it recognized the right of employees to join labor unions and gave workers the right to collective bargaining.
collective bargaining meant that employers had to negotiate with unions about hours wages and other working conditions.
the law created the national labor relations board nlrb to look into workers complaints.
the fair labor standards act of 1938 provided workers with additional rights.
it established a minimum wage initially at 25 cents per hour and a maximum workweek of 44 hours.
it also outlawed child labor.
the minimum wage remains one of the new deals most controversial legacies.
in the years ahead the minimum wage would be gradually raised.
today whenever a raise in the minimum wage is proposed economists and political leaders debate the wisdom of such an increase.
supporters say such raises are necessary for low paid workers to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
opponents counter that some producers will pass the wage increases on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
they also fear that minimum wage increases will increase the great depression and the new deal 329 5 4 the new deal expands unemployment if some employers cut jobs to keep their labor costs the same.
workers organize for gains the upsurge in union activity came at the same time as a bitter feud within the major labor federation the american federation of labor afl.
the afl represented skilled workers such as plumbers carpenters and electricians who joined trade or craft unions.
few workers in the major industries belonged to the afl and the afl made little effort to organize them.
fed up with the afls reluctance to organize these workers john l lewis the president of the united mine workers and a number of other labor leaders established the congress of industrial organizations cio.
the workers targeted by the clo organizing campaigns tended to be lower paid and ethnically more diverse than those workers represented by the afl.
in december 1936 members of the cios newly formed united automobile workers uaw union staged a sit down strike occupying one of general motorss most important plants in flint michigan.
in a sit down strike workers refuse to leave the workplace until a settlement is reached.
when the police and state militia threatened to remove them by force the workers informed michigan governor frank murphy that they would not leave.
we fully expect that if a violent effort is made to oust us many of us will be killed and we take this means of making it known to our wives to our children to the people of the state of michigan and the country that if this result follows from the attempt to eject us you are the one who must be held responsible for our deaths.
auto workers sit down committee flint michigan january 1936 the strike lasted for 44 days until general motors then the largest company in the world agreed to recognize the uaw.
this union success led to others.
by 1940 9 million workers belonged to unions twice the number of members in 1930.

opposition to the new deal franklin roosevelt won an overwhelming victory in the presidential election of 1936.
he received 61 percent of the vote compared to just 37 percent for his republican challenger alfred m landon.
roosevelt carried every state but maine and vermont.
fdr entered his second term determined to challenge the group that he considered the main enemy of the new deal a supreme court that had struck down many of his programs.
some new deal policies face judicial scrutiny a year before the 1936 election the supreme court had overturned one of the key laws of roosevelt s first hundred days.
in the case of schechter poultry v united states the supreme court unanimously ruled that since the president has no power to regulate interstate commerce the national industrial recovery act was unconstitutional.
the power to regulate interstate commerce rests with congress and cannot be delegated to the executive branch.
one pro new deal newspaper captured the mood of many democrats america stunned roosevelts two years work killed in twenty minutes not long afterward the court ruled a key part of the agricultural adjustment act unconstitutional.
roosevelt charged that the court had taken the nation back to horse and buggy days.
he expected the court to strike down other new deal measures limiting his ability to enact new reforms.
roosevelts court packing scheme on february 5 1937 in a special address to congress fdr unveiled a plan that would dilute the power of the sitting justices of the supreme court.
he called for adding up to six new justices to the nine member court.
he justified his proposal by noting that the constitution did not specify the number of judges on the court.
he added that many of the justices were elderly and overworked.
critics recognizing that roosevelts new appointees would most likely be new deal supporters called his plan court packing.
they accused him of trying to increase presidential power and upsetting the delicate balance between the three branches of the federal government.
some critics urged americans to speak out.
if the american people accept this last audacity of the president without letting out a yell to high heaven they have ceased to be jealous of their liberties and are ripe for ruin.
dorothy thompson newspaper columnist 1937 given roosevelts enormous popularity he might have convinced congress to enact his plan but he did not have to because the court began to turn his way.
on march 29 1937 the court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of a the great depression and the new deal 331 5 4 the new deal expands minimum wage law.
two weeks later again by a vote of 5 to 4 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the wagner act.
in both cases justice owen j roberts provided the deciding vote.
pundits called it the switch in time to save nine because roberts had previously voted against several new deal programs.
robertss two votes in support of the new deal removed fdrs main reason for packing the court.
shortly after this switch judge willis van devanter who had helped strike down several new deal programs resigned from the court.
this enabled fdr to nominate a justice friendlier to the new deal.
with more retirements roosevelt nominated a number of other new justices including felix frankfurter one of his top advisers.
indeed 1937 marked a turning point in the history of the court.
for years to come the court more willingly accepted a larger role for the federal government.
yet the court packing incident had the impact of weakening fdr politically.
before the courtpacking plan fdrs popularity prevented critics from challenging him.
fdrs attempt to force a change to the relationship among the executive and judicial branches of government was off putting to many americans even those who had supported him since 1932.
now that roosevelt had lost momentum critics felt free to take him on.
and even though after 1937 the court did not strike down any more laws roosevelt found the public much less willing to support further new deal legislation.
economic setbacks help conservative candidates the turmoil over the supreme court had barely faded when the roosevelt administration faced another crisis.
during 1935 and 1936 economic conditions had begun to improve.
unemployment had fallen 10 percent in four years.
with the economy doing better fdr cut back on federal spending in order to reduce the rising deficit.
but he miscalculated.
while roosevelt reduced federal spending the federal reserve board raised interest rates making it more difficult for businesses to expand and for consumers to borrow to buy new goods.
suddenly the economy was in another tailspin.
unemployment soared to more than 20 percent.
nearly all of the gains in employment and production were wiped out.
largely because of the downturn the democrats suffered a setback in the 1938 congressional elections.
republicans picked up 7 senate and 75 house seats.
although democrats still maintained a majority in both houses of congress roosevelts power base was seriously weakened because many southern democrats already were only lukewarm supporters of the new deal.
needing their support for his foreign policies fdr chose not to try to force any more reforms through congress.

foremost among them was eleanor roosevelt who transformed the office of first lady from a largely ceremonial role to a position of action and deep involvement in the political process.
in fact her more prominent role would set a precedent of increasing involvement in social and political affairs that many subsequent first ladies would follow.
eleanor roosevelt made numerous political social and economic contributions to american society.
representing the president she toured the nation.
she visited farms and indian reservations and traveled deep into a coal mine.
she helped fdr on his campaigns and offered advice on policy issues.
in her newspaper column my day she called on americans to live up to the political and social goal of equal justice for all.

when i wanted help on some definite point mrs roosevelt gave me the opportunity to sit by the president at dinner and the matter was settled before we finished our soup the roosevelt administration included the first female cabinet member secretary of labor frances perkins.
she played a leading role in establishing social security.
perkins also helped win approval of the fair labor standards act which ended child labor and established a minimum wage.
however the new deal did not fight to end gender discrimination in the workplace.
indeed some historians have argued that a number of new deal programs reinforced traditional gender differences.
the wpa and other relief programs employed women but made a much greater effort to provide work to men first.
for example women were not eligible to work for the ccc.
domestic workers a category of jobs held primarily by women were exempted from social security and the fair labor standards act.
h describe what role did eleanor roosevelt play during her husbands presidency.
a stronger political voice for african americans when the depression hit african american workers were often the first to lose their jobs.
by 1934 the unemployment rate for african americans was almost 50 percent more than twice the national average.
eleanor roosevelt and others urged the president to improve the situation of african americans.
as the new deal progressed eleanor roosevelt increasingly used her position to protest against racial discrimination.
at a meeting held by the southern conference on human welfare a biracial group that sought to promote racial reforms the first lady sat with the black delegates a daring move in segregated birmingham alabama.
when a white police officer told her that she was violating local segregation laws mrs roosevelt moved her chair to the space between the black and white sides.
she then delivered a rousing and provocative keynote address in favor of racial reform.

eleanor roosevelt november 22 1938 the president invited many african american leaders to advise him.
these unofficial advisers became known as the black cabinet.
they included robert weaver and william hastie harvard university graduates who rose to high positions within the department of the interior.
hastie later served as a federal judge and weaver became the first african american cabinet member in the 1960s.
mary mcleod bethune was another member of the black cabinet.
the founder of what came to be known as bethune cookman college she was a powerful champion of racial equality.
in her view the new deal had created a new day for african americans.
she noted that african americans gained unprecedented access to the white house and positions within the government during roosevelts presidency.
nevertheless roosevelt did not always follow the advice of his black cabinet.
racial discrimination and injustice continued to plague african americans.
the new deal benefited native americans as well as other minority groups.
it provided funds for the navajo to open a new hospital in fort defiance arizona in 1938.
when the naacp launched an energetic campaign in favor of a federal antilynching law the president refused to support it.
fdr told black leaders that he could not support an antilynching law because if he did southern democrats would block every bill i ask congress to pass hence no civil rights reforms became law during the 1930s.
several new deal measures also unintentionally hurt african americans.
federal payments to farmers to produce fewer crops led white landowners to evict unneeded black sharecroppers from their farms.
even though they benefited from the wpa and other relief measures african americans often did not receive equal wages.
social security and the fair labor standards act exempted domestic workers and farm laborers two occupations in which african americans were employed in great numbers.
bi recall what role did the black cabinet play in the roosevelt administration.
new deal legislation for native americans attempting to improve the lives of native americans the roosevelt administration made major changes in long standing policies.
the 1887 dawes act had divided tribal lands into smaller plots.
by the early 1930s it was clear that the act had worsened the condition of the people it was designed to help.
of the original 138 million acres american indians had owned in 1887 only 48 million remained in american indian hands and much of it was too arid to farm.
john collier the new deals commissioner of indian affairs warned that the dawes act was resulting in total landlessness for the indians.
to prevent further loss of land and improve living conditions for native americans collier developed the indian new deal a program that gave indians economic assistance and greater control over their own affairs.
collier got funding from new deal agencies for the construction of new schools and hospitals and to create an indian civilian conservation corps.
in addition the bureau of indian affairs in a reversal of previous policies encouraged the practice of indian religions native languages and traditional customs.
collier also convinced congress to pass the indian reorganization act of 1934 considered the centerpiece of the indian new deal.
this law restored tribal control over native american land.
although it did not immediately improve their standard of living the indian reorganization act gave native americans greater control over their destiny.

but some new deal measures actually hurt native americans.
for example federal authorities determined that large herds of sheep tended by the navajos were causing soil erosion on the colorado plateau.
as a result the federal government enacted a navajo livestock reduction program which mandated that the navajo sell or kill thousands of sheep.
the navajo deeply resented this act.
they did not believe that their sheep threatened the soil and they did not trust the motives of government agents.
h identify supporting details what was the purpose of the indian reorganization act of 1934.
a new political coalition emerges by the time he died in 1945 roosevelt had been elected to four terms as president.
his legendary political skills had united an unlikely alliance of americans into a strong political force called the new deal coalition.
this coalition brought together southern whites northern blue collar workers especially those with immigrant roots poor midwestern farmers and african americans.
african american voting patterns show the importance of the new deal coalition.
before the new deal most african americans voted republican the party of abraham lincoln.
responding to the efforts of franklin and eleanor roosevelt african americans began to vote democratic during the 1930s.
this trend was strongest in the west and the north.
for example in 1934 arthur w mitchell an african american democrat defeated oscar de priest an african american republican to represent the largely black south side of chicago.
mitchell became the first african american democrat elected to congress.
the new deal coalition gave the democratic party a sizable majority in both houses of congress.
before fdrs election the democrats had been the minority party in the house of representatives for all but eight years since 1895.
but from 1932 to 1995 the democrats controlled the majority of seats in the house of representatives for all but four years.
the coalition that elected roosevelt in 1932 went on to secure the white house for the democrats in six of the next eight presidential elections.
besides forging a powerful political coalition roosevelt and the new deal helped to unify the nation.
social and ethnic divisions so much a part of the 1920s diminished significantly during the 1930s.
immigrant communities in particular gained a greater sense of belonging to the mainstream.
programs such as the ccc and wpa allowed individuals of varied backgrounds to get to know one another breaking the great depression and the new deal 337 5 5 effects of the new deal down regional and ethnic prejudices.

different races and nationalities look each other in the face work and eat together for the first time.
and it is a safe bet we think that this process many times results in the elimination of traditional prejudices based on ignorance and misinformation.
w kirkpatrick ccc worker el check understanding how did the new deal coalition affect the balance of power in the house of representatives and the executive branch.
new deal legislation expands the historical role of government new deal programs greatly increased the size and scope of the federal government.
for the first time for many americans writes historian william leuchtenburg the federal government became an institution that was directly experienced.
more than the state and local governments it came to be the government moreover the government began to do things it had never done before from withdrawing taxes directly from workers paychecks to distributing benefits to the elderly.
though the new deal did not end the depression it did help restore the american economy.
it created the foundation for sustained and stable growth.
according to pulitzer prize winning historian david kennedy the unparalleled economic vitality of the post 1940 decades was attributable to many factors.
but the economic expansion.
owed much to the new deal an increasingly significant role promoting economic growth with the new deal the federal government broke from the tradition of laissez faire or leaving the economy alone which had characterized most of american history.
this changed the relationship new deal legislation passed after 1935 program i effects created a safety net in the form of a pension system and unemployment insurance provided payments to workers injured on the job the poor the elderly and people with disabilities employed millions of people on government projects ranging from highway construction to arts programs provided loans to electric companies to build power lines bringing electricity to isolated rural areas outlawed unfair labor practices granted workers the right to organize unions and to bargain collectively created the national labor relations board provided young americans between 16 and 25 with jobs and counseling tied to the wpa finalized the creation of the fdic and made insurance for bank deposits permanent created a board to regulate the nation s money supply and interest rates on loans remedied ineffectual early efforts by the federal government to provide housing for lower income families by assisting individual homebuyers led to the 1937 passing of the united states housing act which subsidized construction of low cost public housing by providing federal loans expanded the federal government s reach by establishing nationwide compulsory regulation of wages and hours banned child labor established a minimum wage of 25 cents per hour and set the workweek at 44 hours prohibited the mislabeling of food drugs and cosmetics and ensured the safety and purity of these products analyze charts the new deal is considered by some to be a reform movement.
explain whether or not this view can be justified using specific examples from the chart.
the great depression and the new deal 338 5 5 effects of the new deal between government and private business.
instead of being hands off now the federal government accepted responsibility for spurring economic growth or pump priming.
for the first time the government had acted as an employer of the unemployed and a sponsor of work projects.
fdr accepted the idea that the federal government had to do something to get the economy going again and democrats and many republicans agreed.
fdrs rejection of laissez faire policies led a number of new deal critics to accuse him of promoting socialism.
however many new deal measures actually strengthened capitalism and helped make possible the economic boom of the post world war ii era.
the fdic and sec restored americans trust in banks and the stock market and the significant gap between the rich and the poor remained relatively lower for several decades.
the federal housing authority fha provided low interest loans increasing home ownership.
the new deal affected millions of individual workers and their families.
the wagner act boosted union membership which continued to grow after world war ii.
minimum wage increases improved the purchasing power of minorities and those at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.
new deal legislation created child labor laws workers compensation laws and unemployment insurance programs that had important and enduring impacts on the u s economy.
the new deal had a great impact on rural americans.
regional public works projects such as the tva and bonneville dam reduced flooding and provided water for irrigation.
along with the rural electrification administration these dams brought electricity to farmers in the southeast and the northwest.
rose dudley scearce of shelby kentucky recalled what the rea meant to her farm family the first benefit we received from the rea was light and arent lights grand.
my little boy expressed my sentiments when he said mother i didnt realize how dark our house was until we got electric lights.
like the rest of the people we changed our storage battery radio into an electric radio.
next we bought an electric refrigerator.
the next benefit we received from the current was our electric stove.

rose dudley scearce what the rea service means to our farm house a federal safety net for those in need we are going to make a country in which no one is left out franklin roosevelt once told frances perkins.
the many programs he enacted to realize this goal led to the rise of a welfare state in the united states a government that assumes responsibility for providing for the welfare of children and the poor elderly sick disabled and unemployed.
the creation of the american welfare state was a major change in government policy.
with the exception of military veterans most americans had never received any direct benefits from the federal government.
state and local governments private charities and families had long served as the safety net for needy americans.
true the new deal did not achieve fdrs goal of a country in which no one is left out because it exempted many americans from social security and other programs.
still new deal legislation changed the historical roles of state and federal governments.
it established the principle that the federal government not state or local government the great depression and the new deal 339 5 5 effects of the new deal j1 was responsible for the welfare of all americans.
in the latter half of the twentieth century the reach of federal government programs would grow greatly.
new deal reforms provided the framework for the debate over the proper role of the federal government in the private lives of americans.
it energized liberals who would push for an even greater role for the federal government in future years.
but it troubled conservatives who would argue that the expansion of the federal government limited american rights.
for example many argued that new deal legislation increasing the strength of unions and raising the minimum wage infringed on the rights of business owners and limited job creation and economic growth.
many also did not support federal welfare programs because they felt that the federal government was assuming responsibilities that were otherwise granted to the states by the tenth amendment.
indeed this very debate over the role of the federal government in the lives of its citizens divides liberals and conservatives to this day.
conservation efforts produce mixed results reared in new york states beautiful hudson river valley franklin roosevelt had a great love of nature.
as a child fdr also loved outdoor sports and became an expert swimmer and sailor.
a number of his new deal programs such as the ccc aimed at restoring forests and preserving the environment.
other federal agencies started soil conservation efforts.
perhaps most visibly new dealers worked hard to end the dust bowl a symbol of the degraded state of the land at the beginning of the depression.
franklin roosevelt also continued the conservation work of his cousin president theodore roosevelt.
although funds were short the government set aside about 12 million acres of land for new national parks including shenandoah national park in virginia kings canyon national park in california and olympic national park in washington state.
however not all new deal programs helped the environment.
several of the large public works projects such as the tva and the string of dams along the columbia river had a mixed impact.
the dams controlled floods generated electric power and provided irrigation but they also upset the natural habitats of some aquatic life.
massive reservoirs created by these projects also displaced some people and destroyed some traditional native american burial hunting and fishing grounds.
an expansion of executive power in no area did fdr have a greater impact than on the office of the president itself.
the expanding role of the government including the creation of many new federal agencies gave the executive branch much more power.
new deal administrators such as harry hopkins head of the wpa commanded large bureaucracies with massive budgets and little supervision by congress.
their authority increased roosevelts influence.
indeed some commentators even began to speak of the rise of an imperial presidency an unflattering comparison to the power exercised in the past by rulers of great empires.
fdr also affected the style of the presidency.
his mastery of the radio captivated americans.
his close relations with the press assured a generally popular fdr s effect on the presidency increased power of the president and the executive branch made mass media such as radiol an essential tool in advertising and promoting policies expanded role of the president in managing the economy expanded role of the president in developing social policy won third and fourth terms leading to passage of twenty second amendment which limited presidents to two consecutive terms expanded white house staff to include experts and advisers on domestic and foreign policy shaped the president s image as caretaker of the american people increased the power and involvement of the federal government in american life analyze charts how did fdrs policies affect the role of the executive branch.

because he served for such a long time and was such an outstanding communicator fdr set a standard that future presidents had a hard time fulfilling.
later during world war ii fdrs presidential power grew even greater.
as commander in chief of the nations armed forces he exercised enormous authority over many aspects of life.
most americans accepted the presidents increased authority as a necessary condition of wartime.
but after the war they sought to protect the delicate balance between the different branches of government and between the federal and state governments.
the debate over the increasing power of the executive branch relative to other branches is another new deal legacy that lives on today.
one way that americans sought to guard against the growing power of the president was by amending the constitution.
when roosevelt ran for an unprecedented third term in 1940 he knew that he had broken an unwritten rule established by george washington that presidents should serve only two terms.
he won that election and then ran and won again in 1944.
but after roosevelts death in 1945 there was a growing call for limiting a presidents term in office.
in 1951 the twenty second amendment was ratified limiting the president to two consecutive terms.

these films showed a declining faith in government and law enforcement with characters turning to crime to survive the depression.

germany and japan change leadership after world war i germany became a democracy.
the weimar vi mahr republic named after the town of weimar where the government was created struggled throughout the 1920s to establish a functional world war ii 362 6 1 rise of aggressive dictators democracy.
however germany was beset by severe economic troubles in the 1920s including runaway inflation.
anger over the treaty of versailles and internal disunity also plagued the young government.
the weimar republics ship of state was slowly sinking.
emergence of nazis in the early 1930s the worldwide great depression hit the weimar republic hard worsening the problems that already existed.
increasingly antidemocratic parties on the right especially the national socialist german workers party or nazi naht see party threatened the republic.
regardless of the party s name nazis were not socialists.
they bitterly opposed socialism communism or any other ism that promoted class interests or workers rights above german ethnic solidarity.
adolf hitler led the nazi party.
the son of a minor austrian civil servant hitler was a failed artist a wounded and decorated world war i soldier and a person who teetered on the brink of madness.
hitler joined the small nazi party after the war and soon gained control of it.
while in prison after the party attempted a rebellion hitler dictated the book mein kampf my struggle in which he stated his explanations for the problems facing germany.
he criticized many people political programs and ideologies but his sharpest assaults were against communists and jews.
hitler was violently anti semitic or prejudiced against jewish people.
anti semitism had troubled europe for centuries mainly motivated by religious intolerance and economic resentment.
in the late nineteenth century new pseudo scientific theories about jews as a race along with the rise of nationalism caused jews to be marginalized as ethnic outsiders.
hitler believed and spread this type of thinking.
he preached that the greatest threat confronting germany was the jewish people who lived there.
in mein kampf which quickly became a national bestseller hitler presented a blueprint of his hatreds and plans for world domination.
hitler rules a german dictatorship the shattered german economy with its widespread unemployment homelessness and hunger played into the nazis hands as they promised that germany would rise again from the quagmire of reparations and the economic depression.
recognizing the power of hitlers party in january 1933 the president of the weimar republic appointed hitler chancellor of germany.
over the next two years hitler became president as well as chancellor consolidated his power and ruled unchecked by the reichstag riks tahg or the german parliament.
inflation ruined the weimar republic.
presses ran day and night printing paper money.
by 1923 one dollar was equal to one trillion marks.
here children play with stacks of worthless money.
both civilians and military personnel welcomed hitler to a rally in nuremberg 1933.
rallies were held yearly as grand propaganda events lasting several days.
interactive gallery world war ii 363 6 1 rise of aggressive dictators by 1935 the democratic institutions of the weimar republic were silenced and hitler spoke alone as the voice of germany.
like stalin and mussolini hitler was the symbol of his totalitarian regime.
aided by a secret police that crushed all opposition a state controlled press that praised his accomplishments and a state controlled educational system that indoctrinated the young hitler assumed a godlike aura.
by the late 1930s hitlers economic policies including rearmament and massive public works projects had ended the depression in germany.
many germans followed his lead and cheered for him at nazi rallies.
for many his promises came true.
once hitler came to power it was wonderful.
everybody had a job and there weren t any more unemployed people remembered one german citizen.
however hitlers leadership had dark undertones of oppression based on extreme anti semitism and the rejection of democracy.
hitler maintained his power by alternately brainwashing the public with lies and propaganda drives or terrifying them into silence through ruthless violence.
he openly attacked jewish people communists and socialists.
hitler rejected freedom for the people and defined his rule like so in a speech in 1937 girls experienced military life by marching in formation.
students were taught obedience and self sacrifice for the good of the nation.
for everyone has to obey orders.

we cannot permit this authority the authority of the german people to be challenged adolf hitler may 1 1937 militarism gains support in japan in japan as in germany the 1920s was a period of increased democracy and peaceful change.
the japanese government reduced the power of the military passed laws to give all men the right to vote legalized trade unions and allowed several diverse political parties to be established.
this period ended when the great depression discredited japans civilian leaders in the 1930s.
reasserting their traditional powers military leaders argued that expansion throughout asia would gain natural resources and new markets.
this would solve japans economic troubles and guarantee future security.
throughout the 1930s the military played a significant role in shaping japanese civilian and military policy.
japan however did not become a true totalitarian dictatorship.
no charismatic leader like stalin or hitler emerged.
japan continued as a nominal constitutional monarchy headed by a mainly aloof emperor but with the military high command assuming dictatorship like powers over the masses.
as with germany and italy japanese military leaders had strong control over the life of the people and ended many democratic freedoms.
opposition was suppressed media was censored and schools instilled obedience to the nation.
the japanese empire expands as the power shifted toward military control japan started on a course of aggressive military expansion.
extreme nationalists encouraged japanese domination of the region.
in 1931 japan attacked manchuria man chur ee uh a region in northeastern china and established a puppet state.
the new nation was named manchukuo man choo kwoh.
japan controlled its domestic and foreign policies as well as its abundant natural resources.

dictators move to gain territory in the 1930s the italian and german dictatorships resorted to acts of aggression similar to those of japan in asia.
throughout the decade neither the league of nations nor democratic nations succeeded in stopping the aggression.
it was a time that recalled a line from irish poet william butler yeats the best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity weakness of the league of nations in many ways the league of nations never recovered from americas refusal to join it.
the league was also handicapped by its own charter.
it had no standing army and no real power to enforce its decrees.
it was only as strong as its members resolve and during the worldwide depression of the 1930s those members lacked resolve.
when aggressive nations began to test the league they discovered that the organization was long on words and short on action.
hitler and mussolini challenge the peace from the first hitler focused on restoring germanys strength and nullifying the provisions of the treaty of versailles.
from 1933 to 1936 he rebuilt the german economy and dramatically enlarged the army navy and air force in direct defiance of the treaty of versailles.
in the mid 1930s hitler began to move toward his goal of reunifying all germanic people into one reich or state.
he spoke often of the need for germany to expand to gain lebensraum lay buhns rowm or living space for its people.
in 1935 he reclaimed the saar sahr region from french control.
in 1936 in another direct challenge to the league hitler sent german troops into the rhineland.
this region was part of western germany and under german political control.
however under the terms of the treaty of versailles it was demilitarized germany was forbidden to have troops in the region.
reoccupation was a test.
would france or the league defend the terms of the treaty.
the answer was no.
to all these actions the league failed to respond.
meanwhile mussolini commenced his own imperial plans.

dictators support war in spain fascists were also victorious in a bloody conflict that raged from 1936 until 1939 know as the spanish civil war.
the nationalists who had fascist tendencies rebelled against spains democratic republican government.
both hitler and mussolini sent military and economic aid to the nationalist leader general francisco franco using the conflict to test some of their new military technology.
though the soviet union provided some support for the republican side france britain and the united states remained largely on the sidelines deploring the bloodshed but refusing to provide weapons to the republican forces.
h express problems clearly why did the league of nations fail to halt german and italian aggression.
aggression meets appeasement the policy that france and britain pursued against aggressive nations during the 1930s is known as appeasement.
it is a policy of granting concessions to a potential enemy in the hope that peace can be maintained.
unfortunately appeasement only spurred the fascist leaders to become more bold adventurous and aggressive.
why did france and britain appease the fascist powers.
there were a number of reasons.
world war i was so horrible that some leaders vowed never to allow another such war to break out.
other leaders believed that the soviet union posed a greater threat than nazi germany.
they maintained that a strong germany would provide a buffer against the soviet menace.
still other leaders questioned the resolve of their own people and their allies particularly the united states.
the united states played an important role in this appeasement policy.
worried about the rise of dictatorships in europe and asia franklin d roosevelt wanted to mend fences with americas neighbors.
in the 1930s he pursued a good neighbor policy with latin american nations.
the program emphasized trade and cooperation not military force as the basis for a stable relationship with latin american nations.
the united states withdrew troops from several nations.
it agreed not to intervene in latin america and to consult with other nations if faced with danger.
roosevelt also improved relations with world war ii 366 6 1 rise of aggressive dictators the soviet union by restoring diplomatic relations with the soviet government although he remained wary about allying too closely with the communist nation.
however he did not take a forceful line against german aggression.
instead the country concerned itself with its own economic troubles and embraced a policy of isolationism.
hitler took advantage of the lack of commitment and unity among france britain and the united states.
in the spring of 1938 he brought austria into his reich.
austria was given little choice but to accept this union called the anschluss ahn shloos.
in the fall hitler turned toward the sudetenland a portion of western czechoslovakia that was largely populated by ethnic germans.
many people expected the conflict over the sudetenland to lead to a general war.
but once again britain and france appeased germany.
at the munich conference with hitler british prime minister neville chamberlain and french premier edouard daladier sacrificed the sudetenland to preserve the peace.

japan attacked without a declaration of war.
its planes rained terror on chinese cities especially shanghai and nanjing.
the japanese had even killed three american sailors when japanese warplanes sank the united states gunboat panay on the chang river.
in the midst of these bloody events president franklin roosevelt criticized japans aggression in a speech in chicago on october 5 1937.
he lamented the reign of terror and international lawlessness the bombing of civilian populations and the horrible acts of cruelty.
speaking in a city where american isolationist sentiments were strong roosevelt suggested that no part of the world was truly isolated from the rest of the world.

president franklin roosevelt quarantine speech october 5 1937 roosevelts solution for stopping aggression involved an informal alliance of the peace loving nations but he did not suggest what steps the peaceful nations should take in quarantining the aggressive ones.
americans unhappy with the failure of world war i to make the world safe for democracy were not ready for another attempt at peacekeeping in europe.
roosevelts speech was widely criticized and for a time the president backed away from his more interventionist stance.
its a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead and find no one there roosevelt remarked to a speechwriter.
the speech did however alert some americans to the threat japan posed to the united states.
interpret why do you think roosevelt compared war to a disease in his quarantine speech.
war breaks out in europe roosevelts words failed to prevent japan from extending its control over much of china.
similarly france and britains efforts to appease hitler in europe failed to limit the dictators expansionist plans.
by the end of 1938 even the leaders of france and britain realized that hitlers armed aggression could only be halted by a firm armed defense.
the urgency of the situation grew in the spring of 1939 when hitler violated the munich pact by absorbing the remainder of czechoslovakia into his german reich.
hitler was open about his view of war and conquest.
he believed that there was no morality in war only victory and defeat.
just one month before the attack on poland he instructed his generals to be ruthless and merciless.
when starting and waging a war it is not right that matters but victory.
close your hearts to pity.
act brutally.
eighty million people germans must obtain what is their right.
the stronger man is right japanese planes frequently bombed china during the invasion in 1937.
the chinese army lacked the equipment and training needed to defend the country.
president roosevelt addressed the nation about the world political situation which he said had been growing progressively worse.
he did not specifically mention the aggressor states but they were known to be germany italy and japan.
world war ii 369 6 2 america debates involvement poland falls to german blitzkrieg finally british and french leaders saw the need to take action.
they vowed not to let hitler take over another country without consequences.
poland seemed the next likely target for hitler so britain and france signed an alliance with poland guaranteeing aid to the poles if hitler attacked.
hitler however was more concerned about war with the soviet union than with britain and france.
not wanting to fight a war on two fronts germany signed the nazi soviet nonaggression pact with the soviets on august 23 1939.
the two former rivals publicly promised not to attack one another.
secretly they agreed to invade and divide poland and recognize each others territorial ambitions.
the public agreement alone shocked the west and guaranteed a german offensive against poland.
a new world war that would be a turning point in world history came to europe in the early hours of september 1 1939 when a massive german blitzkrieg blihts kreeg or sudden attack hit poland by surprise from three directions.
blitzkrieg means lightning war it was a relatively new style of warfare that emphasized the use of speed and firepower to penetrate deep into the enemys territory.
the newest military technologies made it devastatingly effective.
using a coordinated assault by tanks and planes followed by motorized vehicles and infantry germany broke through polands defenses and destroyed its air force.
the situation became even more hopeless on september 17 when the soviet union invaded poland from the east taking control of the baltic nations of estonia latvia and lithuania soon after.
although france and britain declared war against germany they did nothing to help save poland.
by the end of the month a devastated poland fell in defeat.
axis powers overwhelm western europe europe was at war just as it had been 21 years earlier.
the axis powers eventually included germany italy japan and several other nations.
the allies included britain france and eventually many other nations including the soviet union the united states and china.
but after the polish campaign the war entered an eight month period of relative quiet known in britain as the phony war things would not remain quiet for long however.
the next storm erupted with raging fury in the spring of 1940.
germanys nonaggression pact with the soviet union freed hitler to send his army west.
on april 9 1940 germany attacked denmark and norway.
the two countries fell almost immediately.
on may 10 he sent his blitzkrieg forces into the netherlands belgium and luxembourg.

world war ii 370 6 2 america debates involvement tumbling dominoes.
hitler seemed invincible his army unstoppable.
france falls hitler next set his sights on france.
france had prepared for germanys invasion by constructing an interconnected series of fortresses known as the maginot line along its border with germany.
additionally france had stationed its finest armies along its border with belgium the route that germany had used to attack france in 1914.
in between the maginot line and belgium lay the ardennes a hilly forested area that military experts considered invasion proof.
but once again the military experts were wrong.
in early may 1940 german tanks rolled through the ardennes ripped a hole in the thin french line there and raced north toward the english channel.
the german plan involved attacking the french and british forces from the front and the rear and trapping them against the channel.
it almost worked.
only a few tactical german mistakes gave britain enough time to evacuate its forces from the french port of dunkirk.
some 338 000 british and french troops escaped to britain.
had they not escaped it is doubtful if britain with 70 percent of its troops at dunkirk could have remained in the war.
the miracle of dunkirk was a proud moment for britain but as the new prime minister winston churchill cautioned parliament wars are not won by evacuations although the british army escaped the germans took paris and forced the french to surrender in the same railway car that the french had used for the german surrender in 1918.
france was then divided into two sections a larger northern section controlled by the germans and known as occupied france and a smaller southern section administered by the french and known as unoccupied france or vichy france after its capital city.
although vichy france was officially neutral it collaborated with the nazis.
air forces fight battle of britain france had fallen to hitler in just 35 days.
hitler next turned his fury on britain.
after the evacuation at dunkirk churchill made it clear that he had no intention of continuing the policy of appeasement.
he told his nation we shall go on to the end.
we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall speed and massive power contributed to the success of the blitzkrieg.
british and french troops maintained a disciplined and orderly retreat even under enemy attack.
an assortment of private and military vessels rescued soldiers who would go on to fight again.
world war ii 371 6 2 america debates involvement winston churchill succeeded neville chamberlain as prime minister in may 1940.
he toured london even during intense bombings inspiring the british to continue the fight.
fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender.
winston churchill june 4 1940 churchill s words stirred his nation as the british readied themselves for battle.
hitlers plan to invade britain codenamed operation sea lion depended upon germanys luftwaffe or air force destroying the british royal air force and gaining control over the skies above the english channel.
the battle of britain then was an air battle fought over the english channel and great britain.
it began in july 1940.
the british lost nearly 1 000 planes the germans more than 1 700.
germany bombed civilian as well as military targets destroying houses factories and churches and conducted a months long bombing campaign against london itself known as the blitz but the british held on and sensing failure hitler made a tactical decision to postpone the invasion of britain indefinitely.
h summarize which side seemed to be winning the war at the end of 1940.
german bombers attacked britain nightly for months hoping to break british morale.
the planes first attacked airfields and military factories but then switched to bombing cities and civilians.
londoners took refuge in the citys subways which were used as air raid shelters.
interactive gallery american reaction is divided winston churchill referred to the united states in many of his speeches during the crisis in france and the battle of britain.
the fight against hitler churchill implied was more than simply a european struggle.
nazi aggression threatened the freedoms and rights cherished by democratic nations everywhere.
the contest was between ideologies as well as nations.
public opinion supports isolation president roosevelt shared churchills concerns but at the beginning of the war in europe he understood that the majority of americans opposed u s intervention.
the severe economic crisis of the great depression had served to pin the nations attention firmly on domestic affairs throughout the 1930s.
in addition many believed that u s involvement in world war i had been a deadly expensive mistake.
the rise of fascism in europe made the sacrifices of world war i seem even more pointless.
in the 1930s numerous books and articles presented a new theory about why the united states had become involved in world war i that disturbed many americans.
the theory held that big business had conspired to world war ii 372 6 2 america debates involvement enter the war in order to make huge fortunes selling weapons.
in 1934 a senate committee chaired by gerald nye of south dakota looked into the question.
although the nye committee discovered little hard evidence its findings suggested that merchants of death american bankers and arms manufacturers had indeed pulled the united states into world war i.
the committees findings further reinforced isolationist sentiments.
in order to avoid making the mistakes that had led to u s involvement in world war i congress passed the neutrality acts of 1935 1936 and 1937.
the acts imposed certain restrictions on americans during times of war.
for example americans were prohibited from sailing on ships owned by belligerents or nations at war.
the acts also prevented americans from making loans to belligerents or selling them arms and munitions.
the acts did not distinguish between aggressors like germany and italy and victims like poland or their allies france and britain.
interventionists press for aid to allies once war began in europe roosevelt felt confined by the limitations of the neutrality acts.
though he issued a proclamation of american neutrality he was firmly anti nazi and wanted to aid the democracies of europe.
in the end congress agreed and passed the neutrality act of 1939 which included a cash and carry provision.
this provision allowed belligerent nations to buy goods and arms in the united states if they paid cash and carried the merchandise on their own ships.
since the british navy controlled the seas cash and carry in effect aided the allies.
many americans disagreed with roosevelts openly pro allies position.
they argued that fdrs policies violated american neutrality and threatened to push the united states into the war.
between early 1940 and late 1941 a great debate raged in america between isolationists and interventionists.
the debate became particularly heated after the fall of france left britain standing by itself in europe against germany.
interventionist organizations such as the committee to defend america by aiding the allies claimed that britain was fighting for free countries everywhere.
sending aid to britain was a way for america to stay out of the conflict.
isolationists plead to remain neutral isolationists countered by claiming that giving aid to the allies was automatically harming the axis and would culminate with the united states entering the conflict.
they argued that the only way to keep america safe was to follow a policy of complete neutrality.

charles lindbergh became the leading isolationist voice.
lindbergh believed that the real threats to america were the soviet union and japan and he did not want to see his country weaken itself fighting in western europe to save britain.
we must band together to prevent the loss of more american lives in these internal struggles of europe.
our safety does not lie in fighting european wars.
it lies in our own internal strength in the character of the american people and of american institutions lindberghs addresses were measured and clear.
he appealed to americans minds but not their hearts.
roosevelt shifts closer to involvement events in europe shocked americans out of strict neutrality.
reports by edward r murrow a cbs reporter stationed in london during the blitz brought the war into american living rooms.
his frequent live radio reports which began with the words this is london emphasized that the germans were bombing not armies or military sites but civilians grandparents parents and children.
these reports and the turn of events in europe against the allies convinced many americans that world war ii 373 6 2 america debates involvement with the fall of france more americans began to accept the inevitability of u s involvement in the war.
there was little public resistance to the first peacetime draft.
the united states needed to at least prepare to defend itself.
shortly after the fall of france in september 1940 germany italy and japan signed the tripartite pact and became allies.
in that same month after a heated debate between isolationists and interventionists congress passed a selective service act a peacetime draft providing for the military training of 1 2 million troops and 800 000 reserve troops each year.
at the same time president roosevelt took an additional step to strengthen britain.
he gave britain fifty world war i era destroyers in exchange for eight british defense bases.
britain needed the ships to convoy goods across the atlantic.
believing the act to be an emergency measure roosevelt made the transfer without the consent of congress.
the american people evaluated fdrs leadership the next month in the presidential election.
roosevelt ran for an unprecedented third term against republican nominee wendell l willkie of indiana.
willkie was critical of fdrs handling of both the economy and foreign affairs but not of the presidents basic positions on either.
given such little differences between candidates americans voted overwhelmingly not to change leaders in the middle of a crisis.

roosevelt believed that the best way to stay out of the conflict with germany was to aid britain.
the united states helps the allies with the lend lease act roosevelt compared americas situation to the scenario of a fire in a neighbor s home.
if a neighbor asked to borrow your fire hose to put out the fire you would not debate the issue or try to sell the hose.
extending help was both being a good neighbor and acting to keep the fire from spreading to your own home.

britain roosevelt said needed american aid and it had run out of money to pay for it.
the president called for america to become the great arsenal for democracy once again america answered britains plea for help.
in march 1941 congress approved the lend lease act symbolically numbered 1776 after another heated debate between isolationists and interventionists.
the act authorized roosevelt to sell transfer title to exchange lease lend or otherwise dispose of to any such government any defense article whenever he thought it was necessary in the interests of the defense of the united states.
by 1945 the united states had sent more than 40 billion of lend lease aid to the allies including the soviet union.
the lend lease act was nothing less than an economic declaration of war against germany and the axis powers.
the atlantic charter outlines mutual goals in august 1941 president roosevelt and prime minister churchill met secretly on a warship off the misty coast of newfoundland.
they discussed their mutual war aims the first being strategy their priority was the defeat of germany then japan.
they talked not only about britains problems in the war but also about their hopes for the world after hitlers defeat.
there would be no conquests made in subjugated territories.
on board the ship they signed the atlantic charter a document that endorsed national self determination and an international system of general security the signing of the atlantic charter signaled the deepening alliance between the two nations and the full moral support of united states to britain.
the meeting with churchill and the atlantic charter showed roosevelts international leadership in coordinating the u s relationship with its allies.
the charter also cast the conflict in moral terms with the allies dedicated to freedom in contrast to domination by totalitarian dictatorships.

nor did he fail to notice the fact that the united states had begun to escort arms shipments to iceland where the british picked them up and transported them to england.
in the fall of 1941 he ordered his german u boats or submarines to attack american ships.
the u boats shot at the uss greer hit the uss kearny and sunk the uss reuben james killing more than a hundred sailors.
the attacks shocked and angered americans moving them closer to declaring war on germany.

the forces that tojo sent from japan under the command of vice admiral chuichi nagumo joo ee chee nah goo moh included 6 aircraft carriers 360 airplanes an assortment of battleships and cruisers and a number of submarines.
their mission was to eradicate the american naval and air presence in the pacific with a surprise attack.
such a blow would prevent americans from mounting a strong resistance to japanese expansion.
the attackers struck with devastating power taking the american forces completely by surprise.
the aftermath of the attack the americans suffered heavy losses nearly 2 500 people killed 8 battleships severely damaged 3 destroyers left unusable 3 light cruisers damaged and 160 aircraft destroyed and 128 more damaged.
the u s battle fleet was out of commission for nearly six months allowing the japanese to access the raw materials of their newly conquered territories just as they had planned.

after pearl harbor however men rushed to volunteer for the various branches of the armed forces.
in all 38 8 percent of those who served in the military volunteered with the remaining 61 2 percent responding to the draft.
organizing and prioritizing the needs of the military was a massive job.
as army chief of staff general george marshall directed the military buildup from coordinating and training troops to overseeing the manufacturing and delivery of all the necessary supplies.
during the course of the war more than 16 million americans served in the military.
from 1941 to 1942 alone the army grew from about 1 4 million to more than 3 million the navy increased from under 300 000 to more than 600 000 and the marines expanded from about 54 000 to almost 150 000.

however the casualties mounted and about 50 000 african americans eventually served in combat units.
in addition many of those in service and support units played vital dangerous roles in military operations such as the d day invasion and the battle of the bulge.
a small number of african americans eventually served in integrated units but the military was not officially desegregated until after the war.

the wac was part of the regular army not an auxiliary attachment and women who served in it received the same benefits as men.
more than 150 000 women volunteered for the service.
the wacs fulfilled important functions as clerical workers truck drivers instructors and lab technicians for the united states army.

in january 1942 fdr created the war production board wpb to oversee the conversion of peacetime industry to war industry.

trained and highly motivated military.
at the start of the pacific war the outlook was grim for america.
losses in the philippines in december 1941 general douglas macarthur commander of united states army forces in east asia struggled to hold the u s positions in the philippines with little support.
the task grew even more daunting when the japanese destroyed half of the armys fighter planes in the region and rapidly took guam gwahm wake island and hong kong.
the main land attack came on december 22.
with japanese forces advancing on two sides macarthur and his troops fell back from manila to the bataan buh tan peninsula and a fortification on corregidor kuh rehg uh dor island where they dug in for a long siege.
trapped the allies suffered greatly lacking necessary supplies and living on half and quarter rations.
realizing that it was only a matter of time before the allies were forced to surrender roosevelt ordered macarthur to leave to take command of the army in the southwest pacific.
macarthur famously promised i shall return after macarthur left on march 11 the remaining allied forces held out on the bataan peninsula until early april when about 70 000 troops surrendered.
japanese troops forced the sick and malnourished prisoners of war to march more than 60 miles inland.
more than 7 000 american and filipino troops died on the grueling journey which is known as the bataan death march.
in early may 1942 the allies lost the philippines when the citadel on corregidor surrendered.
the long fight had slowed part of the japanese advance for five months.
the bataan death march was against the rules set out in the geneva convention and other international agreements about the treatment of prisoners of war and wounded soldiers.
it was not the first time that humane standards for the treatment of prisoners had been violated during the conflict and it was far from the last.
japan advances throughout the pacific japanese forces attacked and conquered.
these advances secured important oil and rubber supplies for japan and brought southeast asia and the western pacific securely under japanese control.
by the summer of 1942 japan appeared ready to dominate the indian ocean australia new zealand and the central pacific.
japans strategy was to take over so much of the pacific region that the allies would be too discouraged to fight back.
in may 1942 the allies needed to regroup quickly to have any hope of victory in the pacific.
world war ii f 383 1 6 3 the united states enters world war ii a b 25 bomber plane takes off from the aircraft carrier uss hornet on april 18 1942.
this plane and its five crewmembers along with 15 other planes made a daring raid on tokyo.
pilots from the famous flying tigers flew planes painted with their trademark tiger shark faces.
the united states strikes back after pearl harbor fdr wanted the united states to retaliate against japan.
american military leaders devised a plan for a nighttime bombing raid from the deck of the aircraft carrier uss hornet led by colonel james doolittle.
while still 800 miles away from mainland japan the hornet was detected so rather than wait for night doolittle led a force of 16 b 25 bombers against tokyo.
they delivered their payload on the japanese capital just after noon.
the raid killed 50 japanese people and damaged 100 buildings.
the pilots then flew to china where they crash landed.
doolittles raid proved a minimal military gain but it bolstered american morale for the long fight ahead.
another group that contributed bravely to the american cause was the american volunteer group known as the flying tigers.
led by retired army captain claire chennault the pilots volunteered to fight the japanese in the pacific in 1941 flying their missions out of burma.
between december 1941 and july 1942 the flying tigers destroyed 296 japanese aircraft in china and burma.
the battle of coral sea halts the advance the battle of coral sea also helped to kindle hope for the american military in the pacific.
in early may 1942 the japanese moved to take port moresby in new guinea.
from that position they could threaten australia and protect their important military bases at rabaul also in new guinea.
to counter japan s move the united states sent two aircraft carriers the uss lexington and uss yorktown along with support vessels.
on may 7 and 8 in the middle of a pacific storm japanese and u s aircraft carriers engaged in battle.
it was the first sea fight in which enemy warships never sighted one another.
instead u s airplanes attacked japanese ships and vice versa.
although technically the battle of coral sea proved a draw strategically it was a victory for the united states because it forced the japanese to call off their attack on new guinea.
it marked a shift in momentum toward the americans.
from that day on the pacific theater of battle would be won or lost on the strength of aircraft carriers and planes.

hitler wanted to dominate europe and eliminate inferior peoples.
mussolini had dreams of an italian empire stretching from the eastern adriatic to east africa.

the allies shared more unified goals although they did not completely trust one another.

stalin believed that the west wanted to destroy communism.
none of the allies wanted to risk a breakdown in their alliance however.
roosevelt worked closely with churchill to manage the relationship with their powerful but problematic ally stalin.
roosevelt churchill and stalin considered germany the most dangerous enemy.
none felt japan or italy posed a serious long term threat.
only germany had the resources to simultaneously bomb britain fight u s and british navies on the atlantic and invade the soviet union across a 1 200 mile front.

the problem was delivering the weapons food and medical supplies that fueled the allied war machine.

german u boats patrolled the atlantic and caribbean sinking more than 3 500 merchant ships and killing tens of thousands of allied seamen.
the only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the u boat peril churchill wrote.
finally in mid 1943 the allies began to win the war in the north atlantic.

a new invention radar helped allied vessels locate u boats on the surface at night.
bombers and underwater depth charges allowed allied forces to sink u boats faster than germany could manufacture them.
soviets and nazis battle for stalingrad germany had attacked the soviet union in june 1941 sending one army north toward leningrad a second east toward moscow and a third south toward stalingrad.
although hitlers forces pushed deep into soviet territory killing or capturing millions of soldiers and civilians they did not achieve their main objective of conquering the soviet union.
soviet resistance and brutal winter weather stopped the german advance.
in 1942 hitler narrowed his sights and concentrated his armies in the southern soviet union.
his goal this time was to control the rich caucasus oil fields.
to achieve this objective he would have to capture the city of stalingrad.
the struggle for stalingrad was especially ferocious.
german troops advanced slowly fighting bitter block by block house by house battles in the bombed out buildings and rubble.
soviet troops then counterattacked trapping the german forces.

nazi armies were forced to retreat westward back toward germany.
instead it was the soviet union that now went on the offensive.
war in north africa meanwhile another important campaign was taking place in the deserts and mountains of north africa where the british had been fighting the germans and italians since 1940.
several goals motivated the allied campaign in north africa.
stalin had wanted america and britain to open a second front against germany in western europe which would help relieve german pressure on the soviet union.
roosevelt and churchill felt they did not have the resources to prepare for an invasion of mainland europe.
an invasion of north africa however required less planning and fewer supplies.
in addition forcing germany out of north africa would pave the way for an allied invasion of italy.
allied soldiers had to fight in many different types of terrain during the war.
but the sahara of north africa the worlds largest desert presented special challenges.
in hot dry weather sandstorms choked and blinded troops.
tanks kicked up enormous dust clouds that were visible miles away making it difficult for troops to move without being seen.
furthermore most supplies for allied troops in north africa had to be brought in by sea where transport ships faced german attacks.
in november 1942 the british won a major victory at el alamein ehl al uh mayn in egypt and began to push westward.
the victory prevented germany from gaining access to the suez canal and oil fields in the middle east.
about the same time allied troops landed in morocco and algeria and began to move east toward key german positions.
an energetic american officer general dwight eisenhower known as ike commanded the allied invasion of north africa.
in february 1943 german general erwin rommel known as the desert fox led his afrika korps against the americans at the kasserine pass in tunisia.
rommel broke through the american lines in an attempt to reach the allied supply base at tebessa in algeria.
finally american soldiers stopped the assault.
lack of supplies then forced rommel to retreat.
interactive gallery world war ii a war on two fronts allies take over north africa the fighting at the kasserine pass taught american leaders valuable lessons.
they needed aggressive officers and troops better trained for desert fighting.
to that end eisenhower put american forces in north africa under the command of george s patton jr an innovative tank commander.
a single minded general known as blood and guts patton told his junior officers you usually will know where the front is by the sound of gunfire and thats the direction you should proceed.

american forces advanced east toward tunisia with increasing confidence.
simultaneously the british pressed westward from egypt trapping axis forces in a continually shrinking pocket in tunisia.
rommel escaped but his army did not.
in may 1943 the remaining german and italian forces in north africa some 240 000 troops surrendered.
el identify cause and effect how did geographic factors affect the war on the north atlantic at stalingrad and in north africa.
axis powers on the defensive germany was now on the defensive and the allies planned to keep it that way.
in january 1943 roosevelt and churchill met in casablanca morocco to plan their next move.
the conference resulted in two important decisions.
first the allies decided to increase bombing of germany and invade italy.
second roosevelt announced that the allies would accept only unconditional surrender or giving up completely without any concessions.
hitler mussolini and tojo could not hope to stay in power through a peace agreement.
general george patton was one of the most famous american military leaders during world war ii.
he led american troops to victory in north africa.
italy surrenders the allies next eyed italy.
the island of sicily was the obvious target for an invasion as it was situated across the mediterranean from tunisia and only two miles from the italian mainland.
the allies could invade sicily without great risk from u boats and under the protection of allied aircraft.
in july 1943 british and american armies made separate landings in sicily and began to advance across the island before joining forces in the north.
once again eisenhower commanded the joint american british forces with patton and bradley both leading significant american forces.
eisenhower hoped to trap axis forces on sicily but they escaped to the italian mainland.
still the 38 day campaign achieved important results it gave the allies complete control of the western mediterranean paved the way for an invasion of italy and ended the rule of benito mussolini.
on september 3 1943 italy surrendered to the allies and five weeks later declared war on germany.
but hitler was not through with italy.
after a small german airborne force rescued mussolini from a mountaintop fortress hitler installed him as head of a puppet state in northern italy.
in the south german military forces continued the fight against the allies.
world war ii a war on two fronts the invasion of italy was a slow grinding slog.
italy was crisscrossed with mountains and rivers.
heavy rains and mountain snows made combat difficult.
soldiers fought in ankle deep mud.
in the mountains where tanks and heavy artillery were useless allied forces depended on mules to haul supplies up slippery and steep roads.
to make matters worse the germans occupied the best defensive positions.
fighting continued into 1945.
the allies won battles but none were important enough to end the war in italy.
allied bombers attack germany stalin continued his demand that roosevelt and churchill open a second front in france.
while the allies did not launch a massive invasion of france until 1944 they did open a second front of another kind in early 1942.
from bases in england allied bombers launched nonstop attacks against germany.
flying by night in order to avoid being shot down in large numbers british planes dropped massive amounts of bombs on german cities including civilian targets.
the goal of this saturation bombing was to inflict maximum damage.
by day american bombers targeted germanys key political and industrial centers.
the goal of this campaign of strategic bombing was to destroy germanys capacity to make war.
a nazi official later commented that the fleets of bombers might appear at any time over any large german city or important factory the bravery and contributions of an african american fighter squadron known as the tuskegee airmen played a key role in the campaign escorting bombers and protecting them from enemy fighter pilots.
in more than 1 500 missions over enemy territory in europe the tuskegee airmen did not lose a single bomber.
overall though the bombing missions cost the allies dearly.
bomber crews suffered an incredibly high 20 percent casualty rate.
but they successfully carried the war into germany day after day and night after night.
this second front in the sky did indeed relieve some of the pressure on the soviet armies on the eastern front and helped pave the way for an all out allied offensive.

he turned his attention to midway an american naval base in the central pacific that was vital to the defense of hawaii.
losing midway would force american defenses back to the california coast.
yamamotos ambitious plan entailed taking midway and establishing a military presence in the aleutians a string of islands off the coast of alaska.
what yamamoto did not realize was that admiral chester nimitz commander of the united states navy in the pacific knew the japanese plans.
u s navy code breakers had intercepted japanese messages.
to meet the expected assault nimitz sent his only available aircraft carriers to midway.
the japanese navy was stretched out across more than a thousand miles from the aleutians to well west of midway.
american forces were all concentrated near midway.
the japanese began their attack on june 4 1942.
in the battle of midway the most important naval battle of world war ii the united states dealt japan a decisive defeat.
american torpedo planes and dive bombers sank four japanese aircraft carriers along with all 250 aircraft on board and many of japans most experienced pilots.
america lost only one aircraft carrier.
midway was the turning point of the war in the pacific ending the seemingly unstoppable japanese advance.
japan still had a powerful navy committed troops and fortified positions.
but japanese forces would never again threaten hawaii or dominate the pacific.
japan was now on the defensive.
americans take the offensive the first american offensive in the pacific took place in august 1942 with world war ii i 391 1 6 4 a war on two fronts an assault on the island of guadalcanal.
one marine described fighting on guadalcanal it was beautiful but beneath the loveliness.
guadalcanal was a mass of slops and stinks and pestilence of scum crusted lagoons and vile swamps inhabited by giant crocodiles of ants that bite like fire of tree leeches that fall fasten and suck of scorpions of centipedes whose foul scurrying across human skin leaves a track of inflamed flesh of snakes and land crabs rats and bats and carrion birds and of a myriad of stinging insects.
robert leckie delivered from evil the saga of world war ii guadalcanal was part of a u s strategy to approach japan from both the southwest pacific and the central pacific.
the logic behind the offensives was to force japan to fight a two front war and to capture bases from which to attack japan.
in jungles and on coral reefs under torrential monsoons and the blistering sun american servicemen began their slow painful trek toward japan.

in addition millions of americans bought war bonds.
in a war bond citizens lend the government money in order to help fund the war.
they bought the bonds at face value say 25 and then received a certain amount of interest after ten years.
the bonds allowed americans both to save income and invest in the war effort.

to manage this problem fdr created the office of price administration which had the authority to control wages and set maximum prices.
another form of economic control was rationing.
americans were issued coupon books that limited the amount of certain goods that they could buy.
rationing ensured that raw materials such as rubber and gasoline found their way into war production.
also rationing of food items such as butter sugar milk canned goods and meat ensured that fighting troops would have enough food.
rationing of food and raw materials created shortages that americans could not help but notice.
to help with these shortages people carpooled to work recycled tires and grew their own food in victory gardens planted in vacant lots or in their backyards.
by 1943 more than 20 million victory gardens had been planted from tiny household plots to public areas like copley square in boston.
although most americans accepted the need for wartime controls others resented the restrictions.
unscrupulous profiteers manipulated the ration coupon system to create a black market an illegal underground network for the sale of restricted goods.

world war ii 394 6 5 the home front japanese internment during world war ii not all americans were included in the spirit of unity.
the attack on pearl harbor also spread fear across america.
the federal government began drafting policies aimed toward immigrants and aliens from the axis nations.
aliens are foreign citizens living in the united states.
all resident enemy aliens were required to register with the government submit to fingerprinting and list their organizational affiliations.
executive order 9066 originally laws made no distinction among nationalities.
german italian and japanese aliens were subject to arrest or deportation if deemed dangerous to national security.
some 11 000 german immigrants and hundreds of italian immigrants were held in camps others faced curfews or travel restrictions.
federal orders also forced all three groups to vacate the west coast temporarily in the winter of 1942.
once public fears subsided fdr removed germans and italians from the enemy aliens list.
japanese aliens and japanese american citizens received no such respite.
believing people of japanese ancestry to be inherently disloyal west coast leaders pressed fdr to address the threat in february 1942 the president issued executive order 9066 designating certain areas as war zones from which anyone might be removed for any reason.
by september the government evacuated more than 100 000 japanese americans on the west coast.
evacuees including both issei japanese immigrants and nisei native born american citizens of japanese descent were forced to sell their property at a loss and allowed to take only necessary items.
why did japanese americans generally face harsher treatment than italian or german americans.
several factors help explain the difference racism the smaller numbers of japanese americans their lack of political clout and their relative isolation from other americans.
in hawaii where japanese americans comprised one third of a multiracial society they escaped a similar fate.
japanese americans are interned the first orders stipulated only that japanese americans must leave designated military zones but leaders in interior states objected.

world war ii 396 6 5 the home front increased opportunities in employment all over the united states american industry quickly converted to war production to meet the nations military needs.
as the economic effects of world war ii brought the great depression to an end the millions of unemployed men who had been such a common sight during the 1930s seemed to vanish overnight.
they either joined the military worked to produce food for the world on the nations rich farms or labored in factories producing war materiel.
soon factories needed to hire workers outside of their usual pool of mostly white men.
to keep production going more women and more african americans found opportunity in defense industries although they still faced significant obstacles to gaining and succeeding in those jobs.
women work in defense industries government and industry launched an all out publicity campaign urging women to do their part to meet wartime production quotas.
the image of a strong determined female worker hair tucked under a kerchief graced countless magazines and posters.
the name rosie the riveter was first used in a 1942 song and several real life rosies won national publicity.

they were generally paid less than men for the same or similar work.
some new workers also faced hostility in their new workplaces.
still by the end of the war women made up more than one third of the wartime workforce.
a woman working outside the home was nothing new but wartime pressures created two sharp breaks from the past.
many women found jobs especially in heavy industry that fell outside the traditional realm of womens work.
the need for labor also weakened posters like this one sought to motivate women to take jobs in the defense industry.

wartime work changes womens lives although the image of rosie the riveter working in a factory was widespread women labored in both blue collar and white collar jobs.
most factory owners expected women to step aside once men returned home at wars end.
in white collar settings however the war accelerated long term trends toward increased employment.
during the 1940s the number of women employed in secretarial and clerical work increased fivefold.
with fathers in the military and mothers in the workplace childrens lives began to change.
the federal government spent 50 million building day care centers for children of working mothers.
still only about 130 000 kids ended up in day care centers and most were not filled to capacity.
many parents preferred to leave their children in the care of neighbors or relatives.

african americans seek employment opportunities many african american leaders hoped that the war might provide jobs and alleviate their dismal economic situations.
however few found meaningful employment with national defense employers before pearl harbor.
out of 100 000 americans working in the aircraft industry in 1940 for example only 240 were african americans.
even jobs provided by the government and military remained segregated.
african american leaders stressed the need for a double v campaign victory against fascism abroad and victory against discrimination at home.
the charismatic and savvy labor leader a philip randolph asserted that african americans would no longer accept second class citizenship.
we loyal negro american citizens demand the right to work and fight for our country he proclaimed.
in june 1941 randolph presented president roosevelt a list of demands including the end of discriminatory practices in government funded training employment and the armed services.
he also took steps to organize a massive protest march on washington d c roosevelt issues executive order 8802 fdr had hoped to put civil rights reform on the back burner while war raged in europe and asia.
but randolph persisted in his plans.
with the united states nearing involvement in the war roosevelt feared that the sight of a huge protest march on the nations capital would undermine unity and fuel enemy propaganda.
so under pressure he issued executive order 8802.
this measure assured fair hiring practices in any job funded with government money and established the fair employment practices committee to enforce these requirements.
by 1944 nearly 2 million african americans worked in defense industries although racist practices were still common.
such victories encouraged african americans to join organizations dedicated to promoting equal rights.
the naacp grew to 500 000 members.
in 1942 civil rights leaders founded the congress of racial equality core an organization that sought to apply nonviolent protest as a means of fighting segregation.
although segregation still prevailed in the military the south and other parts of the nation wartime developments 6 5 the home front helped set the agenda for the civil rights struggles of the coming decades.
compare and contrast how were the employment experiences for women and african americans the same.
how did they differ.
migration during world war ii wartime needs encouraged migration.
people from rural areas whites and african americans moved north to industrial cities and west to california.
they sought jobs in wartime industries or near military bases.
farmers looked for creative ways to keep their farms producing necessary food.
the moving population and new jobs invigorated americans but the effects of changing demographics also led to strain and unrest in some areas.
workers on the move during world war ii california alone gained 2 million new residents seeking work in shipyards and other industries related to the war.
the south lost residents in its rural areas but grew by a million new people as a whole.
older industrial cities in the north such as detroit and chicago also boomed.
movement of people fostered long term changes in the countrys demographic patterns.
demographics are statistics that show human characteristics of a population.
after receiving billions of dollars to fund industry and build military bases the south and southwest became a growing economic and political force.
population shifts affected native americans too.
as native americans left reservations to work in defense industries they had the opportunity to learn new skills and had greater contacts with non indians.
many of these people as well as native american veterans never returned to the reservations after the war.
migration changes farming meanwhile american farmers faced a challenge.
they needed to produce more food than ever before to power both the american war effort and send to allies abroad.
however more and more people left farms for the military or jobs in the cities.
farmers developed new farming methods including more efficient machinery and better fertilizers to improve yields with fewer workers.
they also found several solutions to alleviate the rural population drain.
first teenagers too young to enlist helped out more.

finally the united states partnered with mexico to operate the bracero program bringing laborers from mexico to work on american farms especially in the west.
during the war years several hundred thousand braceros embraced this opportunity and migrated to the united states.
in the long term the bracero program initiated decades of migratory labor in the west.
conflict springs from migration in the summer of 1943 migration led to racial violence in some cities.
the worst occurred in detroit where conflict rose over the construction of housing for black workers drawn north to defense plants.
some 100 000 whites and blacks broke into scattered fights at a city park.
by the next morning full scale riots erupted in which 34 people were killed.
federal troops ended the violence but the citys problems were never resolved.
mexican americans had long dealt with similar obstacles.
few had mastered the english language and many languished in slums while struggling to find work.
a violent incident highlighted the problems.
in the los angeles area many mexican and mexican american youths dressed in stylish zoot suits with baggy pants and long jackets.
in june 1943 mobs of off duty sailors roamed through the mexican sections of los angeles attacking zooters when the fighting ended police arrested the zoot suited victims not their attackers.

h identify supporting details why did roosevelt and churchill not agree to open a second front in france until late 1943.
the invasion of normandy operation overlord involved the most experienced allied officers in europe.
american general dwight d eisenhower again served as supreme commander.
british general bernard montgomery served as commander of the ground forces while general omar bradley led the american troops who would participate in the invasion.
eisenhower plans the invasion u s army chief of staff george marshall had long pushed for an allied invasion of france believing that the british strategy of invading north africa and italy would not contribute to germanys defeat.
although he was the obvious choice to lead the invasion of normandy once the allies had finally agreed to do so roosevelt decided that he was too valuable to remove from his current position.
instead roosevelt looked to eisenhower.
eisenhower had been given command of all american forces in europe in 1942 even though more than 350 other generals had more seniority.
after strong performances in north africa and italy he was made supreme commander of allied forces.
in this role he planned operation overlord.

on four beaches the landings were lightly opposed and casualties were low.
but at omaha one of the two beaches assigned to american forces the germans offered strong opposition.

hitlers plan called for english speaking german soldiers in u s uniforms to cut telephone lines change road signs and spread confusion.
german tanks would then secure communication and transportation hubs.
the counterattack known as the battle of the bulge almost succeeded.
the germans caught the allies by surprise created a bulge in the american line and captured several key towns.
snowy cloudy skies prevented the allies from exploiting their air superiority.
but at the belgian town of bastogne bas tohn american forces led by eisenhower and patton held despite frostbite and brutal german assaults.
then on december 23 the skies cleared and allied bombers attacked german positions.
after reinforcements arrived the allies went back on the offensive steadily pushing the germans out of france.
the battle of the bulge was a desperate attempt to drive a wedge between american and british forces.

americans advance toward japan while war still raged in europe american forces in the pacific had been advancing in giant leaps.
under the leadership of general douglas macarthur they followed an island hopping strategy capturing some japanese held islands and ignoring others in a steady path toward japan.
navajo troops played a vital role in the pacific island hopping campaign.
the navajo language has no written alphabet and at the start of the war only a small number of non navajo people could understand it none of them japanese.
navajo radio operators developed and memorized a secret code using the language and they used it to send critical messages from island to island.
the code was never broken by the japanese.

then they took another leap to saipan tinian and guam in the mariana islands.
by 1944 the united states navy under admiral nimitz was blockading japan and in october general macarthur began the fight to retake the philippines.
american forces took each island only after a difficult struggle.
time and again japanese defenders fought virtually to the last man.
rather than surrender many japanese troops readily killed themselves.
at the same time japanese kamikaze kah muh kah zee pilots deliberately crashed their planes into american ships.
by the end of the war more than 3 000 japanese pilots had died in kamikaze missions.
their deaths however did not prevent macarthur from retaking the philippines as he had promised when he left the islands in 1942 or the u s navy from sinking japanese ships.

the war comes to an end advances in technology helped determine the outcome of world war ii.
allied and axis scientists labored to make planes faster bombs deadlier and weapons more accurate.
as always in warfare specific military needs resulted in scientific discoveries and technological innovations.
science and technology help win the war scientists and engineers on both sides of the war worked on the development of conventional weapons at a rapid pace creating and improving many wartime technologies.
they developed fast and powerful aircraft ships and weapons as well as radar and sonar to detect enemy aircraft and ships.
to treat sick and wounded soldiers they developed a way to mass produce penicillin an antibiotic and to more easily transport and store blood plasma.
to supply military needs they invented synthetic materials such as nylon used to make parachutes and vehicle tires.
but the most crucial scientific development of all was the atomic bomb.
scientists develop the atomic bomb in the early 1930s scientists learned how to split the nuclei of certain elements.
they also discovered that this process of nuclear fission released tremendous energy.
over the next decade they learned more about the nature of the atom the effect of a chain reaction and the military uses of uranium.

american casualties.
early in the war albert einstein the worlds most famous scientist signed a letter that alerted president roosevelt about the need to proceed with development of atomic weapons.
in 1942 roosevelt gave the highest national priority to the development of an atomic bomb.
the program code named the manhattan project cost several billion dollars and employed tens of thousands of people.
the two primary leaders of the project were general leslie groves and physicist j robert oppenheimer.
groves was responsible for building facilities acquiring materials recruiting scientists and providing security.
oppenheimer ran the scientific aspect of the project from los alamos new mexico.
scientists working on the top secret project included many refugees from europe including enrico fermi developer of the first atomic reactor.
on the morning of july 16 1945 in a barren area outside of alamogordo new mexico the first atomic bomb was tested.
the flash of light was clearly visible 180 miles away and the sound was heard at a distance of 100 miles.
watching the blast oppenheimer recalled the following line from a hindu poem now i am become death the destroyer of worlds the generals thoughts were less poetic.
turning to an aide groves said the wars over.
one or two of those things and japan will be finished truman decides to use the bomb the decision to use the bomb fell directly on the shoulders of harry truman.
the new president fully understood the ethical issues presented by using the bomb especially against civilians.
at the same time he also knew that the axis powers had nuclear scientists and there was no way to tell how close they were to developing their own bomb.
ultimately trumans chief priority was to save american lives.
his military advisers predicted that in light of the ferocious defense waged by japanese soldiers during the island hopping campaign an invasion of japan might cost as many as 1 000 000 american casualties.
in truth truman did not agonize over the decision to use the atomic bomb against japan.
for the president abstract ethical issues did not outweigh very real american lives and an opportunity to end the war.
later some critics would condemn trumans decision.
but in the late summer of 1945 no one close to him did so.

this has become one of the most famous images associated with the holocaust.
mt from the time he came to power adolf hitler had targeted jews for persecution.
by the end of the war the nazis had murdered 6 million jews and 5 million other people they considered inferior.
in 1945 there was no word for hitlers murderous plan of extermination.
today it is called the holocaust.

the holocaust key terms holocaust anti semitism nazism kristallnacht genocide concentration camps death camps war refugee board roots of the holocaust the mass murders of jews as well as other undesirables were a direct result of a racist nazi ideology that considered aryans white gentiles especially those of germanic nordic and anglo saxon blood superior to other people.
among the groups that the nazis considered inferior were the slavic peoples of russia and eastern europe.
from the start the nazi movement trafficked in anti semitism.
hitler blamed jews for all the ills of germany from communism to inflation to abstract painting and especially for the defeat of germany in world war i.
other extremists influenced hitlers ideas and shared his prejudices.
in the 1920s his was just another angry voice in the weimar republic advancing simplistic answers for the nations grave economic political and social troubles.
in 1933 however hitler became chancellor of germany.
hitlers campaign against the jews hitlers persecution of the jews began as soon as he came to power.
at first his focus was economic.
he urged germans to boycott jewish owned businesses and he barred jews from jobs in civil service banking the stock exchange law journalism and medicine.
in 1935 hitler moved to a broader legal persecution.
the nuremberg laws named for the city that served as the spiritual center of nazism.
they denied german citizenship to jews banned marriage between jews and non jews access your digital lesson.
ze 410 1 and segregated jews at every level of society.
yet even these measures were not enough for hitler.
he hinted that in the future there might be what he called the final solution to the jewish question hitler employed the full power of the state in his anti semitic campaigns.
newspapers printed scandalous attacks against jews.
children in schools and the hitler youth movement were taught that jews were polluting german society and culture.
comic books contained vile caricatures of jews.
the violence of kristallnacht acts of violence against jews were common.
the most serious attack on german jews took place on november 9 1938.
it became known as kristallnacht krihs tahl nahkt or the night of the broken glass.
after a jewish refugee killed a german diplomat in paris nazi officials ordered attacks on jews in germany austria and the sudetenland.
secret police and military units destroyed more than 1 500 synagogues and 7 500 jewish owned businesses killed more than 200 jews and injured more than 600 others.
the nazis arrested thousands of jews.
refugees try to escape between 1933 and 1937 about 129 000 jews fled germany and nazi controlled austria.
they included some of the most notable figures in the scientific and artistic world including physicist albert einstein.
more jews would have left but they were not generally welcomed into other countries.
during the great depression with jobs scarce the united states and other countries barred their doors to many jews.
in 1939 the ocean liner st louis departed germany for cuba with more than 900 jewish refugees on board.
only 22 of the passengers received permission to stay in cuba.
u s officials refused to accept any of the refugees.
the ship returned to germany.
almost 600 of the jews aboard the st louis later died in nazi concentration camps.
h identify steps in a process how did hitler and the nazis gradually deprive jewish people of their rights.
hitlers final solution since 1933 the nazis had denied jews the rights of citizenship and committed acts of brutality against them.
these acts of persecution were steps toward hitlers final solution to the jewish question nothing short of the systematic extermination of all jews living in the regions controlled by the third reich.
today this propaganda poster from 1935 glorifies the image of what the nazis saw as the ideal aryan youth.
at the same time posters and comic books viciously caricatured people the nazis considered inferior hitler is greeted by children in poland.
the white shirts and ties worn by the girls were part of the uniform of the female branch of the hitler youth movement.
world war ii 411 6 7 the holocaust we use the word genocide to describe such willful annihilation of a racial political or cultural group.
the first concentration camps in 1933 the year he became chancellor hitler opened the first nazi concentration camps areas where members of specially designated groups were confined.
the earliest camps included dachau sachsenhausen and buchenwald.
later ravensbruck not far from berlin was opened for female prisoners.
in theory the camps were designed not to kill prisoners but to turn them into useful members of the third reich.
the nazis imprisoned political opponents such as labor leaders socialists and communists as well as anyone journalists or novelists ministers or priests who spoke out against hitler.
many jews as well as aryans who had intimate relations with jews were sent to camps.
other groups targeted as undesirable included gypsies jehovahs witnesses homosexuals beggars drunkards conscientious objectors the physically disabled and people with mental illness.
camp administrators tattooed numbers on the arms of prisoners and dressed them in vertically striped uniforms with triangular insignias.
for example political prisoners wore red insignias homosexuals pink jews yellow and jehovahs witnesses purple.
inside the walls of the concentration camps there were no real restraints on sadistic guards.
they tortured and even killed prisoners with no fear of reprisals from their superiors.
death by starvation and disease was an everyday occurrence.
in addition doctors at camps such as dachau conducted horrible medical experiments that either killed inmates or left them deformed.
prisoners were made subjects of bogus experiments on oxygen deprivation hypothermia and the effects of altitude.
bodies were mutilated without anesthesia.
thousands of prisoners died in agonizing pain including some 5 000 mentally or physically disabled children.
the nazis build death camps when germany invaded poland and the soviet union the nazis gained control of large territories that were home to millions of jews.
under nazi rule jews in warsaw lodz and other polish cities were forced to live in crowded walled ghettos.
nazis also constructed additional concentration camps in poland and eastern europe.
at first the murder of jews and other prisoners tended to be more arbitrary than systematic.
but at the wannsee conference in january 1942 nazi leaders made the decision to move toward hitlers final solution reinhard heydrich an ss leader known as the man with an iron heart outlined a plan to exterminate about 11 000 000 jews.

some prisoners might be forced to wear combinations of patches.
the minutes of the meeting do not use the word kill everyone there understood that killing was their goal.
many concentration camps especially in poland were designated as death camps camps where prisoners were systematically exterminated.
the largest death camp was auschwitz in southern poland.
others included treblinka maidenek sobibor belsec and chelmno.
prisoners from various parts of the reich were transported by trains to the death camps and murdered.
nazis forced prisoners into death chambers and pumped in carbon monoxide or crammed the prisoners into shower like facilities and released the insecticide zyklon b.
some concentration camps that the nazis converted into death camps did not have gassing equipment.
in these camps nazi guards shot hundreds of thousands of prisoners.
nazi action groups that followed the army into eastern europe also shot several million jews and buried them in ditches.
in fully functioning death camps the bodies of murdered prisoners were further desecrated.
human fat was turned into soap human hair was woven into wigs slippers and mattresses cash gold fillings wedding rings and other valuables were stripped off the victims.
after the nazis had taken what they wanted they burned the bodies in crematoriums.
by 1945 about 6 million european jews had been murdered.
but jews were not the only victims.
as many as 5 million others lay dead including nearly 2 million non jewish poles.
while many survivors lived with constant nightmares of the experience or with the sorrow and guilt of being the last members of their families many others determined to rebuild their lives and families in the united states israel or elsewhere and continue to be productive citizens.

allied response to the holocaust could the holocaust have been prevented.
could western democracies especially britain france and the united states have intervened to stop the slaughter of millions of innocent people.
there are no simple answers.
however many people today believe that the west could have done more than it did.
early inaction before the war the united states and other countries could have accepted more jewish refugees from germany and austria.
however the u s world war ii 413 6 7 the holocaust state department at first made a conscious effort to block jewish immigration.
later commentators have blamed this failure on several factors anti semitism apathy preoccupation with the great depression and a tendency to underestimate hitlers genocidal plans.
the united states takes limited action once the war started news of the mass killings filtered to the west.
by the end of 1942 the allies acknowledged that jews were being taken to poland and killed.
in april 1943 british and american officials hosted the bermuda conference to discuss rescuing surviving jewish refugees from europe.
however no concrete action was taken.
by early 1944 however fdr began to respond to the reports.
he established the war refugee board a government agency that worked with the red cross to save thousands of eastern european jews especially in romania and hungary.
tragically too few were saved.
of the allies the soviet union was closest to the death camps but stalin showed no concern.
britain and the united states expressed sympathy but their resources and strategy were focused on defeating hitler not on stopping his genocidal campaign.
they might have bombed railway these jewish children from austria were among those who eventually found homes with adoptive families in the united states.
lines to the death camps but the camps were not military targets.
a war department official told the refugee board that bombing the railway lines could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere the allies also refused to pressure countries within the nazi sphere of influence to stop the transportation of jews to germany.
the liberation of the concentration camps as they pushed toward germany from the east and west soviet and american troops liberated the camps one by one.
for most americans the enormity of the nazi crime became real only when the camp liberators began to report back on what they found.
when they saw it all the piles of dead bodies the warehouses full of human hair and jewelry the ashes in crematoriums the half dead emaciated survivors they realized as never before that evil was more than an abstraction.
hardened by war accustomed to the sight and smell of death the liberators were nevertheless unprepared for what they saw.
major richard winters was stunned almost beyond belief the memory of starved dazed men who dropped their eyes and heads when we looked at them through the chain link fence in the same manner that a beaten mistreated dog would cringe leaves feelings that cannot be described and will never be forgotten.
the impact of seeing those people behind that fence left me saying only to myself now i know why im here richard winters quoted in band of brothers ambrose the liberation of the camps led to an outpouring of american sympathy and sincere longing to aid the victims.
many survivors found temporary or permanent homes in the united states.
the revelation of the holocaust also increased demand and support for an independent jewish homeland.
in 1948 when the jewish community in palestine proclaimed the state of israel president truman immediately recognized the new nation.
since then the united states has continued to offer strong support to israel.
today people in the united states and around the world are working to make sure that the holocaust is not forgotten.

one major difference was that it was fought to the bitter end.
in 1918 the kaiser surrendered before the allies could invade germany.
by contrast in world war ii japan and germany kept fighting long after their defeat was certain.
in the last year of the war they lost battle after battle retreated from the lands they had conquered and saw the slow destruction of their military forces.
allied bombing devastated their cities and industries.
yet germany fought on until hitler committed suicide and japan refused to surrender until after the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki.
the yalta conference the protracted fighting gave the allies time to make plans for a postwar world.
roosevelt churchill and stalin met at yalta on the black sea in february 1945 to discuss final strategy and crucial questions concerning postwar germany eastern europe and asia.

the red army already occupied much of eastern europe and roosevelt wanted soviet help in the war against japan.
vague promises were about as much as stalin would give.
the potsdam conference a dramatically altered big three met in july 1945 in the berlin suburb of potsdam.
although stalin remained in power in the soviet union harry s truman had become u s president in april upon the death of fdr.
after the start of the conference clement atlee replaced churchill as prime minister of britain.
at potsdam truman took the reins of international leadership and began to reshape the relationship of the united states with its allies.
while in potsdam truman learned of the successful test of the atomic bomb.
but he was more focused on europe and the soviet union than on asia.
truman was more distrustful of stalin than roosevelt had been.
fearing soviet domination of eastern europe truman continued to press for free elections after the war.
at the meeting the big three formalized the decision to divide germany into four zones of occupation soviet american british and french.
they agreed to new borders and free elections for poland and they recognized the soviets right to claim reparations for war damages from the german sector they controlled.

international impact of the war after the war ended in august 1945 plans for the postwar world had to be turned into realities.
however the changes that took place were often not what the allies had envisioned at yalta and potsdam.
worldwide political changes world war ii changed political boundaries in many parts of the world.
the borders of poland for example shifted slightly to the west.
in time as you will learn differences between the soviet union and its former allies led to the division of germany into two countries communist east germany and noncommunist west germany.
nearly all the nations of eastern europe became communist states under soviet control.
other countries experienced profound political changes.
communist and noncommunist interests clashed in eastern europe.

militarily although the americans had the atomic bomb the soviets had the red army the worlds largest military force.
h identify effects what impact did world war ii have on the relative roles of the united states and britain in the world.
international organizations and treaties americans were quick to recognize that their nation had taken on a new position in the world.
after world war i the senate had rejected the treaty of versailles and refused to join the league of nations.
many americans now viewed these decisions as mistakes that contributed to the rise of fascism and the outbreak of another war.
as world war ii drew to a close americans were ready to embrace the idea of world organizations.
economic effects of world war ii world war ii paved the way for a restructuring of the world economy.
the united states took on major responsibilities in shaping the postwar world economy.
after meeting in 1944 with the allies in bretton woods new hampshire the u s government pushed for establishment of the international monetary fund and the world bank.
the united states provided most of the working capital for these new organizations which worked to foster global economic and financial stability.
the agreements made at bretton woods also represented another step in the shifting trend from the gold standard to fiat money.
the international currency system was pegged to the u s dollar with the united states agreeing to keep the price of gold at a certain level effectively making the dollar the new standard.
in 1947 the united states signed the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt a treaty designed to expand world trade by reducing tariffs.
it went into effect on january 1 1948.
between its signing and 1993 average tarrifs dropped from 40 percent to 5 percent.
losing protective tariffs has caused some industries in the united states to suffer from competition with foreign goods but the lower tariffs world war ii 418 6 8 impact of world war ii encouraged world trade in general.
gatt was replaced by the world trade organization wto in 1995.
the united nations even more importantly the united states led the charge for the establishment of the united nations un an organization that many hoped would succeed where the league of nations had failed.
in april 1945 delegates from 50 nations met in san francisco to write the charter for the un.
the senate overwhelmingly ratified the charter and the un later set up its permanent home in new york city.
a major goal of the un was to prevent further world wars or events such as the holocaust.
the united nations was organized on the basis of cooperation between the great powers not on the absolute equality of all nations.
all member nations sat on the general assembly.
however the five major world war ii allies the united states the soviet union britain france and china were assigned permanent seats on the most powerful arm of the un the security council.
president truman named former first lady eleanor roosevelt to represent the united states at the un.
as elected chair of the commission on human rights she guided the drafting of the universal declaration of human rights a 1948 document that defined rights that belonged to all people in the world.
it states recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world.
all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

the beginning of the cold war background of the cold war when franklin roosevelt died in april 1945 the nation was at a critical point.
the united states was still at war.
in addition relations with the soviet union one of the most important wartime allies were beginning to break down.
soviet aggression against its citizens the united states and the soviet union had been united only in their opposition to nazi germany.
beyond that they had little in common.
the united states was a capitalist democracy.
its citizens believed in free elections economic and religious freedom private property and respect for individual differences.
the soviet union was a dictatorship.
under joseph stalin the communist party made all key economic political and military decisions.
the soviet people could not worship as they pleased own private property or express their views freely.
those who opposed or questioned stalin risked imprisonment and death.
soviets control eastern europe by the time roosevelt stalin and churchill met at yalta in february 1945 it was clear that the 436 allies would defeat germany.
but it was unclear how germany and the nations of eastern europe would be governed after the war.
soviet troops already occupied much of eastern europe and parts of germany.
stalin wanted to keep germany weak and divided.
he also wanted eastern europe to remain under the control of the soviet union.
the united states and great britain sought a stronger united germany and independent nations in eastern europe.
at the conference stalin agreed to establish broadly representative governments and free elections in eastern europe and to divide germany only temporarily into zones of occupation.
despite stalins promises nearly all of the lands occupied by the soviet red army in the spring of 1945 remained under soviet control after the war.
the eastern european countries of poland czechoslovakia hungary romania and bulgaria as well as the eastern portion of germany became satellite states controlled by the soviet union.
wartime alliance unravels by the time soviet british and u s leaders met at potsdam in the summer of 1945 harry truman had succeeded roosevelt as president.
truman and clement attlee the new british prime minister hoped that stalin would confirm the decisions made at yalta.
however stalin refused to make a commitment to allow free elections in eastern europe.
truman left potsdam believing that the soviet union was planning world conquest and that the alliance with the soviet union was falling apart.
with the soviet red army at his command stalin seemed to present a real threat.
thus the stage was set for a worldwide rivalry between the united states and the soviet union.
the 46 year struggle became known as the cold war because the two superpowers never faced each other directly in a hot military conflict.
contrast how did the goals of u s and soviet foreign policy differ after world war ii.

responding to the soviet challenge president truman was not the only world leader who believed that stalin had aspirations toward world domination.

postwar america 438 7 1 the beginning of the cold war the united states contains soviet expansion in the july 1947 issue of the magazine foreign affairs a writer who called himself x published an article titled the sources of soviet conduct the author was really george f kennan an american diplomat and a leading authority on the soviet union.
his article presented a blueprint for the american policy that became known as containment because its goal was to keep communism contained within its existing borders.
kennan urges a policy of containment kennan contended that while stalin was determined to expand the soviet empire he would not risk the security of the soviet union for expansion.
in kennans view the soviet union would only expand when it could do so without serious risks.
stalin would certainly not chance war with the united states a war that might destroy his power in the soviet union just to spread communism.
kennan cautioned his readers that there would be no quick easy solution to the soviet threat.
containment would require a full commitment of american economic political and military power we are going to continue for a long time to find the russians difficult to deal with.
it does not mean that they should be considered as embarked upon a do or die program to overthrow our society by a given date.
in these circumstances it is clear that the main element of any united states policy toward the soviet union must be that of long term patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansive tendencies.
george kennan the sources of soviet conduct united states responds with marshall plan the containment policys first great success was in western europe.
after world war ii people there confronted severe shortages of food fuel and medical supplies as well as brutally cold winters.
in this environment of desperate need secretary of state george c marshall unveiled a recovery plan for europe.
in a speech at harvard university he warned george kennan an expert on russian history and culture was the driving force behind american policy toward the soviet union in the early years of the cold war.

the marshall plan helped germany rebuild all aspects of its society improving germans quality of life in the difficult postwar years.
7 1 the beginning of the cold war r postwar america that without economic health there can be no political stability and no assured peace in early 1948 congress approved the marshall plan.
over the next four years the united states gave about 13 billion in grants and loans to nations in western europe.
the program provided food to reduce famine fuel to heat houses and factories and money to jump start economic growth.
aid was also offered to the soviet satellite states in eastern europe but stalin refused to let them accept it.
the marshall plan provided a vivid example of how u s aid could serve the ends of both economic and foreign policy.
the aid helped countries that desperately needed assistance.
the prosperity it stimulated then helped the american economy by increasing trade.

soviet aggression drives cold war the front lines of the cold war were located in germany.
the zones that were controlled by france britain and the united states were combined to form west germany.
west germany was bordered on the east by the soviet controlled east germany.
the allies also controlled the western part of berlin a city tucked deep inside communist east germany.
united states and britain respond with berlin airlift west berlin was as one soviet leader later described it a bone in the throat of the soviet union.
its relative prosperity and freedom stood in contrast to the bleak life of east berliners.
stalin was determined to capture west berlin or win other concessions from the western allies.
in june 1948 he stopped all highway railway and waterway traffic from western germany into west berlin.
without any means of receiving aid west berlin would fall to the communists.
stalin was able to close roads stop barges and block railways but he could not blockade the sky.
as a result the united states and britain supplied west berlin through a massive airlift that lasted nearly one year.
food fuel medical supplies clothing toys everything the residents of west berlin needed was flown into the city.
even through rain and snow goods arrived regularly.
the berlin airlift demonstrated to west berlin the soviet union and the world how far the united states would go to protect noncommunist parts of europe and contain communism.
the north atlantic treaty organization in may 1949 stalin was forced to acknowledge that his attempt to blockade berlin had failed.
the berlin airlift was a proud moment for americans and berliners and a major success for the policy of containment.
one berlin resident later recalled her feelings when the blockade was finally lifted sheer joy nothing else.
nothing else.
joy and the feeling that we have done it.

although jiang and mao temporarily joined forces in an uneasy alliance to fight japan the civil war resumed with a new fury after the war ended.
the soviet union supported mao while the united states sent several billion dollars in aid to jiang.
american leaders feared that jiangs defeat would create a communist superpower spanning most of asia.

many critics blamed the truman administration saying that the united states had failed to give enough support to jiang.

the 90 000 north korean troops were armed with powerful tanks and other soviet weapons.
within days the northerners overtook the south korean capital city of seoul and set out in pursuit of the retreating south korean army.
reasons for u s involvement president truman remembered how the policy of appeasement had failed to check the german aggression that sparked world war ii.
this knowledge coupled with the u s policy of containment caused truman to announce that the united states would aid south korea.
within days the un security council unanimously voted to follow trumans lead recommending that the members of the united nations furnish such assistance to the republic of korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area undoubtedly the soviet union would have used its veto power to block the un resolution if it had been present for the vote.
however it had been boycotting security council sessions because the un had refused to seat mao s peoples republic of china.
truman did not ask congress for a formal declaration of war as required by the constitution.

american troops who were stationed in japan to move to south korea.
the soldiers were mainly occupation troops who had not been trained for forced marches in monsoon rains or heavy combat in rice paddies nor did they have the military equipment needed to stop the invasion.
soon they joined their south korean allies in retreating to the southeast corner of the peninsula near the city of pusan.
there the allies held fast.
as fresh supplies and troops arrived from japan soldiers from other un countries joined the american and south korean forces.
the u s and its allies counterattack by september 1950 the un forces were ready to counterattack.
general douglas macarthur the world war ii hero had a bold plan to drive the invaders from south korea.
he suspected that the rapid advance of north korean troops had left north korea with limited supply lines.
he decided to strike at this weakness by launching a surprise attack on the port city of inchon well behind enemy lines.
because inchon was such a poor landing site with swift currents and treacherous tides macarthur knew that the enemy would not expect an attack there.
macarthurs bold gamble paid off.
on the morning of september 15 1950 u s marines landed at inchon and launched an attack on the rear guard of the north koreans.
communist forces in south korea began fleeing back to north korea.
by october 1950 the north koreans had been driven north of the 38th parallel.
with the retreat of north korean forces u s officials had to decide what to do next.
should they declare their un mandate accomplished and end the war.
or should they send their forces north of the 38th parallel and punish the communists for the invasion.
truman was concerned about the action china would take if the united states carried the war into north korea.
chinese leaders publicly warned the americans not to advance near its borders.
but macarthur did not take this warning seriously.
he assured truman that china would not intervene in the war.
based on this advice the united states pushed a resolution through the un calling for a unified independent and democratic korea.
truman and macarthur disagree on military goals highly confident macarthur attacked north of the 38th parallel.
despite mountainous terrain and freezing temperatures by thanksgiving the allied advance had reached the chinese border at the yalu river.

it was possible that this war could not be won without huge commitments of troops and even atomic weapons.
truman steadfastly ruled out both of these options.
macarthur who favored an invasion of china was enraged.
he distrusted trumans policy of a limited war fought to achieve only specific goals.
as a soldier macarthur favored total victory.
unable to sway truman the general sent a letter to the house republican leader attacking the presidents policies.
after the letter became public truman fired macarthur for insubordination.
there was a huge outcry in the united states and macarthur returned home a national hero.

outcomes of the korean war by the spring of 1951 allied forces had regrouped aud stabilized their position near the 38th parallel.
the stalemate lasted until 1953.
during that time the two sides fought small bloody battles with limited results.

republican candidate dwight d eisenhower promised that if elected he would end the war.
upon his election he visited korea spoke with the troops and studied the enemys fortifications.
eisenhower became president in january 1953.
the former general was convinced that only strong action would break the stalemate.
when peace talks threatened to fail he hinted that he might introduce nuclear weapons into the conflict.
that warning along with the death of joseph stalin convinced the communists to settle the conflict.
on july 27 1953 after slightly more than three years of fighting the two sides signed a cease fire.
that cease fire is still in effect today.
long term outcomes of the korean war there was no victory in the korean war.
north korea remained a communist country allied to china and the soviet union and south korea stayed a noncommunist country allied to the united states and the major democracies.
the two koreas remained divided at about the 38th parallel.
postwar america 445 7 2 the korean war ongoing military exercises between u s and south korean forces such as these on the namhan river emphasize the u s commitment to the safety and security of the south korean people.
yet the war had important long term outcomes.
truman had committed u s troops to battle without a congressional declaration of war.
this set a precedent that future presidents would follow.
the korean war also seemed to support the growing belief among policymakers that the fall of one nation to communism could have a ripple effect throughout the region.

developers predicted that the h bomb would be 1 000 times as powerful as an atomic bomb.
they hoped it would restore the united states military advantage over the soviets.
some scientists such as j robert oppenheimer and albert einstein opposed developing the h bomb claiming it would only lead to a perpetual arms race.
others argued that stalin would continue to develop more powerful weapons no matter what the united states did.
in 1952 the united states tested the first hydrogen bomb.
the next year the soviets tested one of their own.
more bombs and tests followed.
most of these tests were conducted above ground spewing radioactive waste into the atmosphere.
atomic testing in the american west at sites such as the nevada desert led to increased atmospheric radiation and like truman president eisenhower left and his secretary of state john foster dulles right believed that the containment of communism was essential to u s foreign policy.

eisenhowers secretary of state john foster dulles was an experienced diplomat who had helped organize the united nations after world war ii.
dulles endorsed the presidents vision of the role the united states should play in the world and had stood firmly behind u s efforts to contain communism through involvement in korea.
containment dulles believed could prevent the possibility of a domino effect throughout southeast asia with one country after another falling under communist rule.
in their approach toward foreign policy eisenhower and dulles differed significantly from both truman and his secretary of state dean acheson.
both teams of men considered the spread of communism the greatest threat to the free world.
but eisenhower believed that truman s approach to foreign policy had dragged the united states into an endless series of conflicts begun by the soviet union.

eisenhowers policies toward communism eisenhower opposed spending billions of dollars on conventional forces such as troops ships tanks and artillery.
instead he focused on stockpiling nuclear weapons and building the planes missiles and submarines needed to deliver them.
he assumed that if there were a major war it would be nuclear.
eisenhowers new policy drew some criticism conservatives felt that downgrading conventional forces would weaken american defense while liberals feared that preparing for nuclear war made such a war more likely.
still eisenhowers approach did save money by providing a bigger bang for the buck in 1953 the defense budget was 50 5 billion in 1955 it dropped down to 35 8 billion.
in 1954 dulles announced the policy of massive retaliation.
the united states would respond to communist threats to its allies by threatening to use crushing overwhelming force perhaps even nuclear weapons.
a potential aggressor must know that he cannot always prescribe battle conditions to suit him.
the way to deter aggression is for the free community to be willing and able to respond vigorously at places and with means of his choosing.
john foster dulles 1 954 dulles further believed that only by going to the brink of war could the united states protect its allies discourage communist aggression and prevent war.
you have to take some chances for peace just as you must take chances in war he said in 1956.

uprisings behind the iron curtain poland and hungary american talk of rolling back communist borders and khrushchevs talk of peaceful coexistence were taken seriously by people in soviet dominated countries behind the iron curtain.
people in poland hungary and czechoslovakia resented the control exerted by the soviet union.

in 1956 two uprisings shook eastern europe.
first workers in poland rioted against soviet rule and won greater control of their government.
since the polish government did not attempt to leave the warsaw pact soviet leaders permitted the actions.
then encouraged by khrushchev s words and polands example hungarian students and workers organized huge demonstrations.
they demanded that pro soviet hungarian officials be replaced that soviet troops be withdrawn and that noncommunist political parties be organized.
khrushchev responded brutally sending soviet soldiers and tanks to crush the hungarian revolution.
the soviets executed many of the revolutions leaders killed hundreds of other hungarians and restored hard line communists to power.
americans could only watch these events in horror.
eisenhowers massive retaliation approach was powerless.
the united states would not use nuclear weapons or any other weapons to guarantee hungarian independence from the soviet union.

as cold war tensions intensified egypts president gamal abdel nasser tried to use the u s soviet rivalry to his advantage.
postwar america 450 7 3 the cold war intensifies suez canal region nasser wanted to construct a dam on the nile river at aswan.
the united states and britain initially offered to fund the project but when nasser recognized the communist people s republic of china and opened talks with the soviet union the eisenhower administration withdrew its offer.
in response nasser nationalized the suez canal placing it under government control.
the canal which connects the mediterranean sea and the red sea had originally been managed by a british french company and was protected by british armed forces.
nassers action threatened the flow of middle eastern oil to europe.
without consulting with eisenhower britain and france plotted to get the canal back into western hands.
they joined forces with israel a young nation that had long suffered from raids along its border with egypt.
britain and france used the suez crisis as an excuse to seize control of the suez canal.
israel viewed egypts nationalization of the canal as a violation of international law and wanted to preserve freedom for israeli shipping.
president eisenhower was outraged by these actions.
rather than support his western allies eisenhower criticized them and refused to supply them with u s oil.
the three nations had counted on eisenhower s support and when it did not come they were forced to withdraw their troops from egypt.
the eisenhower doctrine eisenhowers response to the attempted seizure of the suez canal did not mean that he was unconcerned with communist influence in the middle east.
in response to soviet influence there and elsewhere the president made a statement in january 1957 that became known as the eisenhower doctrine.
eisenhower announced that the united states would use force to help any middle eastern nation threatened by communism.
eisenhower used his doctrine in 1958 to justify sending troops to lebanon to put down a revolt against its pro american government.
the eisenhower administration also used the central intelligence agency cia in its struggle against communism.
congress had created the cia in 1947 as an intelligence gathering organization.
eisenhower gave it a new task.
he approved covert or secret cia operations to protect american interests.
in 1953 the cia aided a coup that installed a new government in iran.
in 1954 it accomplished a similar mission in guatemala.

the soviets named the tiny satellite sputnik 1.
the following month they launched a much larger satellite.
it carried a dog named laika to see how a living creature would react to space travel.

the second red scare the fear that communists both outside and inside america were working to destroy american life created a reaction known as a red scare.
this fear was not unique to the late 1940s and 1950s.
the 1917 russian revolution and the communists call for worldwide revolution had led to a similar red scare in 1919 and 1920.

and each carries in himself the death of our society the spread of communism into eastern europe and asia raised concerns that american communists some in influential government positions were working for the enemy.
in truth some american communists were agents of the soviet union and a handful of them held high ranking positions in government.
however overwhelmingly government officials were loyal to the united states.
recognizing public concern about domestic communism president truman used an executive order to create a federal employee loyalty program in march 1947.
the order permitted the fbi and other government security agencies to screen federal employees for signs of political disloyalty.
about 3 000 federal employees either were dismissed or resigned after the investigation.
the order also empowered the attorney general to compile a list of totalitarian fascist or subversive organizations in the united states.
americans who belonged to or supported organizations on the attorney generals list were singled out for more intense scrutiny.
many were labeled security risks and dismissed from their jobs.
the truman administration also used the 1940 smith act to cripple the communist party in the united states.
this act made it unlawful to teach or advocate the violent overthrow of the u s government.
in 1949 a new york jury found 11 communists guilty of violating the smith act and sent them to prison.
the house un american activities committee congress joined in the search for communists.
in 1938 the house of representatives had created the house un american activities committee huac to investigate possible subversive activities by fascists nazis or communists.
after the war the committee conducted several highly publicized hearings on communist activities in the united states.
cold war fears were intensified by huac investigators who probed the government armed forces unions education science newspapers and other aspects of american life.
the best known huac hearings targeted the movie industry in 1947.
the huac investigations uncovered people who were or had been communists during the 1930s and 1940s.
a group of left wing writers directors and producers known as the hollywood ten refused to answer questions asserting their fifth amendment rights against self incrimination.
the hearings turned into a war of attacks and counterattacks as committee postwar america 1 454 7 4 cold war fears at home members and witnesses yelled at each other and pointed accusatory fingers.

movie executives circulated a blacklist of entertainment figures who should not be hired because of their suspected communist ties.
the careers of those on the list were shattered.
not until the case of watkins v united states 1957 did the supreme court decide that witnesses before huac could not be forced to name radicals they knew.
the huac investigation had a powerful impact on filmmaking.
in the past hollywood had been willing to make movies about controversial subjects such as racism and anti semitism.
now most producers concentrated only on entertainment and avoided addressing sensitive social issues.

domestic spy cases increase fears two sensational spy trials drew the nations attention to the threat posed by communist agents working to subvert the united states.
the accused in the two cases could not have been more different.
alger hiss had been educated at johns hopkins university and harvard law school.
julius and ethel rosenberg were from the poor lower east side of manhattan.
although hiss and the rosenbergs never met their crimes and their trials have linked them in the publics imagination.
huac investigates alger hiss until 1948 alger hisss career seemed flawless.
a seemingly dedicated government servant hiss had worked on several important new deal agencies and helped to organize the united nations.
but a man named whittaker postwar america 455 7 4 cold war fears at home chambers disputed hisss image.
as a young man chambers had become a communist espionage agent.
but chambers later turned against communism because of the brutality of stalins rule.
chambers began writing compellingly about the evils of communism.
in 1948 he testified before huac about his communist past and named alger hiss as one of his contacts in the federal government.
hiss soon appeared before huac.
he denied that he was a communist and an espionage agent and he denied that he even knew whittaker chambers.
but richard nixon a young member of congress from california convinced the other committee members to press the case.
slowly hisss story began to unravel.
chambers proved that he did know hiss and that hiss had given him confidential government documents.
chambers had even kept a microfilm copy of some of those documents storing them in a hollowed out pumpkin on his maryland farm.
hiss was tried for perjury.
the first trial ended in a hung jury.
at his second trial he was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.
even after his conviction many americans continued to believe that hiss was innocent.
however as years passed the evidence grew overwhelmingly against him.

agent raised serious concerns.
the hiss case had another unexpected effect.
the congressional hearings thrust richard nixon into the national spotlight.
in 1952 he was named eisenhowers running mate and would later become president.
the rosenbergs and the venona papers nothing created more concern about internal security than the charge that some americans had helped the soviets build an atomic bomb.
the case began when a scientist named klaus fuchs was charged with sending atomic secrets to the soviet union.
the investigation against fuchs ultimately led to the arrest of ethel and julius rosenberg in 1950.
the rosenbergs were charged with conspiring to pass secret information about nuclear science to soviet agents.
the trial of the rosenbergs generated intense controversy in america and around the world.
the case against them was based largely on the word of one confessed spy.
pleading innocent the rosenbergs claimed that they were being persecuted for being jewish and for holding unpopular beliefs.
in the end both were found guilty and sentenced to death.
many believed that the harsh sentence was intended as a lever to force them to identify other members of the alleged spy ring.
but the rosenbergs claimed they had no such information.
after 26 months on death row the rosenbergs were electrocuted in 1953.
years of debate followed the executions.
some insisted that anti semitic sentiment led to the rosenbergs conviction and death.
however in 1995 the u s national security agency released secret soviet messages that the united states had intercepted in the 1940s known as the venona papers.
the papers revealed the names of many americans who spied for the soviet union.

the fall of china soviet nuclear bombs and the exposure of soviet agents in the united states all undermined american confidence.
at that time as americans worried about the nations security a interactive timeline a postwar america 456 7 4 cold war fears at home clever and unscrupulous man began to take advantage of this sense of fear and helplessness.
he suggested that these setbacks were really caused by the work of traitors inside the united states.
the rise of senator joe mccarthy in february 1950 a little known senator from wisconsin made a speech in wheeling west virginia.
the senator joseph r mccarthy charged that the state department was infested with communist agents.
he waved a piece of paper which he said contained the names of state department employees who were secretly communists.
the reason why we find ourselves in a position of weakness is not because the enemy has sent men to invade our shores but rather because of the traitorous actions of those who have had all the benefits that the wealthiest nation on earth has had to offer the finest homes the finest college educations and the finest jobs in government we can give.
i have here in my hand a list of 205 individuals that were known to the secretary of state as being members of the communist party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping the policy of the state department.
joseph mccaithy february 9 1950 the charge provoked a furor.
when challenged to give specific names mccarthy said he had meant that there were 205 bad security risks in the department.
then he claimed that 57 employees were communists.
over the next months the numbers on his list changed.
mccarthy never did produce the list of communists.
still with the outbreak of the korean war in june 1950 mccarthys accusations grabbed the attention of the american public.
at the time of the above speech mccarthy was finishing his first term in the senate.
he had accomplished very little in that term and was looking for a popular issue on which to focus his 1952 reelection campaign.
anticommunism seemed to be just the issue.
mccarthy was easily reelected to a second term.
the methods of mccarthyism in the following four years mccarthy put forward his own brand the charges from mccarthy and others that communists were working from within to overthrow the american government helped spread panic through popular culture.
of anticommunism so much so that the term mccarthyism became a catchword for extreme reckless charges.
by making irresponsible allegations mccarthy did more to discredit legitimate concerns about domestic communism than any other single american.
between 1950 and 1954 mccarthy was perhaps the most powerful politician in the united states.
piling baseless accusations on top of charges that could not be proved mccarthy became chairman of an investigations subcommittee.
merely being accused by mccarthy caused people to lose their jobs and destroyed their reputations.
he attacked ruthlessly.
when caught in a lie he told another.
when one case faded he introduced a new one.
confident because of his increasing power mccarthy took on larger targets.
he attacked former secretary of state george marshall a national hero and author of the marshall plan.
even other senators came to fear mccarthy.
they worried that he would brand them as communist sympathizers.
mccarthy loses support in 1954 mccarthy went after the united states army claiming that it too was full of communists.
army leaders responded that mccarthys attacks were personally motivated.
postwar america 457 7 4 cold war fears at home republican senator margaret chase smith of maine so strongly opposed mccarthys tactics that she made her declaration of conscience on the senate floor in june 1950.
finally the senate decided to hold televised hearings to sort out the allegations.

most were horrified by mccarthys bullying tactics.

postwar america 7 4 cold war fears at home after world war ii many americans worried that the wars end would bring renewed economic depression.
numerous economists shared this pessimistic view of the future predicting that the american economy could not produce enough jobs to employ all those who were returning from the military.
yet instead of a depression americans experienced the longest period of economic growth in american history a boom that enabled millions of americans to enter the middle class.
this era of sustained growth fostered a widespread sense of optimism about the nations future.

it granted veterans a variety of benefits.
it provided a year of unemployment payments to veterans who were unable to find work.
those who attended college after the war received financial aid.
the act also entitled veterans to government loans for building homes and starting businesses.
the gl bill had an enormous impact on american society.
home loans to veterans fueled an upsurge in home construction which led to explosive growth in suburban areas.
perhaps the greatest contribution of the gl bill came in education.
the average soldier was inducted into the armed forces at the time when he or she would have been finishing high school.
the bill encouraged veterans to enter or return to college.
each veteran was eligible to receive 500 a year for college tuition.
the bill also provided 50 a month for living expenses and 75 a month for married veterans.

americans had put off having children because of the depression and war.
now confident that the bad times were behind them many married couples started families.

however americans experienced some serious economic problems.
the most painful was skyrocketing prices.

the end of wartime restrictions finally opened the floodgates to consumer purchases.
as demand soared businesses employed more people to produce goods.
this created a cycle in which people bought new goods leading businesses to hire more workers who in turn bought more goods.
at the end of world war ii the united states was the only developed nation largely untouched by the devastation.
although it had only 6 percent of the worlds population the united states produced about 50 percent of the worlds total output.
the free enterprise system allowed americans to enjoy a higher standard of living than any other nation in the world.
technological progress enhances productivity the american economy benefited from numerous technological advances during the postwar period.
some developments such as the use of atomic energy were the result of war research.
the use of computers increased and businesses gradually began to depend on them.
farms benefited from improved machinery and chemicals allowing farmers to grow more crops with fewer laborers.
worker productivity the rate at which goods are produced or services performed continued to improve largely because of new technology.
military spending supports growth increased government spending boosted the economy too.
the cold war had a number of economic effects.
with the outbreak of the korean war and the escalating cold war with communist nations in europe and asia the united states once again committed a significant part of its budget to defense spending.
military spending led to the development of new technologies and new materials such as plastics and new light metal alloys that found widespread use outside the military.
other large federal spending programs such as the marshall plan initiated foreign demand for goods made in the united states.

postwar american prosperity led to widespread depictions in the media of an idealized suburban society.
postwar america 461 7 5 postwar prosperity americans migrate to the sunbelt in 1958 two new york baseball teams the dodgers and the giants moved to california.
their move reflected another crucial trend of the postwar era the growth of the sunbelt the name given to the southern and western states.
by the mid 1960s california passed new york as the state with the largest population.
the migration to sunbelt cities such as houston texas and los angeles california continued for the rest of the twentieth century.
causes of migration many factors played a role in attracting people to the sunbelt.
a warm sunny climate drew some americans.
a booming industrial economy and rapidly growing cities attracted people to texas which added more than 3 million new residents in the 1940s and 1950s.
the explosive growth of the aerospace and electronics industries also attracted newcomers to the sunbelt.
the development of air conditioning also played a major role.
invented in 1902 air conditioners were at first used only in public buildings such as movie theaters and courthouses.
but after world war ii the development of window units made it possible to cool homes.
northerners who had visited states like florida texas or arizona only in winter could now live in hotter climates all year round.
latinos contributed to the growth of the sunbelt.
in the late 1950s and early 1960s many cubans who were escaping the new regime of fidel castro made miami florida their new home.
prior to world war ii most mexican americans lived in rural areas.
however by the 1960s the majority of them migrated to urban areas such as los angeles el paso and phoenix.
effects of migration on society and the environment the shift to the suburbs and the sunbelt had a momentous impact on american society.
as people moved their political power went with them.
thus suburbs and the sunbelt gained representation.
urbanites in the northeast and midwest lost political power.
texas for example gained eleven new seats in the u s house of representatives between 1940 and 2000.
urban and suburban growth created environmental concerns ranging from traffic jams and smog to water shortages.
to meet growing populations communities utilized once valuable open lands for housing schools roads new businesses and parking lots.

q check understanding what motivated so many americans to migrate to the sunbelt.
innovations and economic development the important postwar population shifts were matched by equally groundbreaking structural changes in the american economy.
for the first time in american history more people found employment in the service sector businesses that provide services such as healthcare law retail banking or insurance than in the manufacturing sector.
these shifts led some to describe the united states as a postindustrial society.
innovative computers drive economic growth between 1947 and 1957 the percentage of the american workforce employed in industrial or blue collar jobs declined 4 percent.
during the same time period employment in the service sector or white collar jobs rapidly grew.
the new workforce included many who worked in information industries including those who built or operated the first computers.
these computers were enormous.
one of the first named eniac short for electronic numerical integrator and computer took up roughly 18 000 square feet or the size of three basketball courts.
despite its size it was less powerful than todays desktop computer.
still eniac was a remarkable advance.
by the 1960s the government and private industry had found many uses for the computer.
hotels used computers to help make reservations and banks used them to keep track of accounts.
industries started using computers to automate work or perform jobs once done by people.
all these technological innovations clearly revealed that the free enterprise system was improving the standard of living in the united states.
changes in the labor force meanwhile the number of women in the labor force continued to grow doubling between 1940 and 1960.
many of these women worked part time.
few pursued long term careers and most remained underpaid.
yet without their paychecks their families would have found it difficult to remain in the middle class.
while the service sector grew rapidly both the number and the percentage of americans who made a living by farming continued to decline.
in 1935 one fourth of the nations families lived on farms.
by 1960 during the 1950s many americans moved to the warm and sunny south and west the so called sunbelt huge developments like lakeland park in california met their need for housing.
less than one in ten families did.
at the same time improvements in technology ranging from mechanical cotton pickers to chemical pesticides made agriculture much more productive.
this allowed fewer workers to grow even more food.
new irrigation systems helped transform much of the land in the southwest from arid to fertile fields.
the role of entrepreneurs at home the postwar era saw the rise of franchise businesses.
a franchise business allows a company to distribute its products or services through retail outlets owned by independent operators.
franchises were attractive to consumers because they stressed quality and sameness no matter where one was in the united states.
the holiday inn franchise came into existence following a trip that home builder kemmons wilson took to washington d c with his family of five children.
frustrated wilson found hotels difficult to locate overpriced and lacking adequate parking facilities.
as he traveled according to author david halberstam wilson became more irritated until he turned to his wife and announced that he was going into the hotel business.
everyone in this country he thought had a car and a family and sooner or later postwar america 463 1 7 5 postwar prosperity everyone had to go somewhere today there are tens of thousands of holiday inn hotels all over the world.
many postwar critics lamented the growth of franchise businesses.
for them the franchises represented a growing lack of originality evidence that the united states was becoming a bland nation in which people ate bland food lived in bland look alike houses and watched bland television shows that followed the same plot line.
entrepreneurs lead management innovations the transition from an industry based to a service based economy created opportunities for entrepreneurs.
for example californians richard and maurice mcdonald opened their new restaurant in 1948.
the brothers emphasized efficiency low prices high volume and quick service.
they did away with anything that slowed down the process including plates glasses dishwashing and tipping.
in 1955 ray kroc began to franchise mcdonalds system and name.
by the end of the century mcdonalds had become the most successful food service organization in history and the name mcdonalds came to stand for low priced standardized quality food.
other entrepreneurs names also came to represent their businesses.
for example wal mart a discount merchandising business founded by sam walton became one of the most successful businesses in the late twentieth century.
another entrepreneur estee lauder founded a cosmetics company that specialized in skin care and protection products.
lauders focus on selling her products only in high end department stores created a 100 million dollar business by the 1970s.
walton and lauder are just two of the millions of small business entrepreneurs whose businesses grew allowing them to achieve the american dream.
5 mcd0nrlu5 cpwous 15 hamburgers buvib bv the brg the original mcdonalds restaurant in san benardino california featured 15 cent hamburgers.
american corporations go multinational as the postwar economy expanded so did multinational corporations companies that produced and sold their goods and services all over the world and established branches abroad.
general motors general electric and ibm produced a larger and larger share of all of the goods sold.
changing business strategies and management innovations allowed many of these corporations to earn large portions of their profits abroad.
coca cola for instance sold its soft drinks all over the globe.
hollywood movies found eager audiences in tokyo mexico city and germany.

the new organization enjoyed a good deal of political clout especially within the democratic party yet trade unions also lost some momentum during the late 1940s and early 1950s.
most of the new white collar workers did not join unions and labors image was tarnished by a corruption scandal involving the teamsters union.

fid explain in what ways did american business change during the postwar period.
trumans postwar leadership as the postwar economy evolved and new demographic patterns changed society american leaders faced rapidly shifting domestic and foreign political landscapes.
on april 12 1945 when franklin roosevelt died harry s truman had been vice president for only 4 months.
when eleanor roosevelt told him that her husband had died truman responded is there anything i can do for you she replied is there interactive gallery postwar america 464 7 5 postwar prosperity anything we can do for you.
for you are the one in trouble now eleanor roosevelts remark captured harry trumans predicament.
he had to preside over one of the more difficult times in american history.
the postwar years saw the beginning of the cold war and communist takeovers in europe and asia.
at home there was inflation and labor unrest.
communist advances and a troubled domestic economy created a sense of deep unrest in the american public during the truman years.
relationships with congress and labor from the first days of his presidency truman faced a double barreled challenge a restless labor movement and a combative republican party.
trade unionists demanded pay increases to keep up with inflation.
when employers refused to meet labors demands millions of steel coal railroad and automotive workers went on strike.
the wave of strikes was one of the largest in american history.
it prompted congress to enact the taft hartley act a law that outlawed the closed shop a workplace in which only union members can be hired.
taft hartley rolled back some of the rights that labor unions had gained during the new deal.
although truman vetoed the taft hartley act congress overrode his veto.
support for civil rights unlike fdr who feared challenging the power of white southern senators and representatives truman refused to remain passive.
he established a special committee on civil rights to investigate race relations.
the committee made several recommendations for civil rights reforms.
however congress rejected the recommendations and did not pass any meaningful civil rights reforms until the late 1950s.
truman also issued an executive order desegregating the military.
this was more successful.
by 1951 most units had been integrated.
truman defeats dewey by the spring of 1948 trumans standing had sunk so low that he faced challenges from both the right and the left in his own democratic party.
southern democrats angry at trumans support for civil rights left the party and established the states rights party.
they named south carolina governor strom thurmond as their candidate for president.
at the other end of the political spectrum henry wallace who had been vice president during fdrs third term broke with truman over foreign policy issues.
wallace became the candidate of a new progressive party.
unmet demands for pay raises in the face of inflation led to labor unrest such as this strike at a pittsburgh steel mill during the truman administration.
the breakaway of two large blocs of democrats was accompanied by the republican party s nomination of thomas dewey the well known governor of new york for president.
few people thought that truman had any chance of winning the 1948 election.
truman however did not see it that way.
he staged an energetic whistle stop train tour of the nation delivering over 300 speeches and traveling 31 000 miles in a matter of weeks.
at train stops in small towns truman attacked the current congress as do nothing and the worst in history.
give em hell harry some in the crowd would cry out during his speeches.
although every political poll predicted that dewey would win easily truman won by a narrow victory.
he had managed the political upset of the century.
consequences of trumans presidency shortly after the election truman announced a far ranging legislative program which he called the fair deal.
the fair deal he explained would strengthen existing new deal reforms and establish new programs such as national health insurance.
but congress was not in a reforming mood and truman failed to win approval for most of his fair deal proposals.
legislative failure and a stalled war in korea contributed to trumans loss of popularity.
he chose not to seek the 1952 democratic nomination.
his reputation however has improved through the years.

u recall why was trumans victory in 1948 so surprising.
eisenhower leads a thriving nation the 1952 election was hardly a contest.
the republican candidate dwight eisenhower was so popular that both the democratic and republican parties had wanted him as their presidential candidate.
eisenhower whose nickname was ike charmed the public with his friendly smile reassuring personality and record of service and honesty.
the democratic candidate adlai stevenson a senator from illinois failed to catch the popular imagination the way eisenhower did.
dwight eisenhower had spent nearly his entire adult life in the military and had never held a political office before 1952.
thus americans could not know for certain which way he would guide the nation upon taking office.
however most americans believed that eisenhowers calm personality mirrored his political views and that he would keep to the middle road achieving a balance between liberal and conservative positions.
eisenhower charted a middle course as president.
while he shared the conservative view that the federal government had grown too strong he did not repeal existing new deal programs such as social security and the minimum wage.
federal spending actually increased during his presidency.
eisenhower even introduced several large new programs.
for example he created an interstate highway system and began to spend federal dollars for education specifically to train more scientists.
one reason for eisenhowers popularity was the strength of the american economy during the 1950s.
his presidency was one of the most prosperous peaceful and politically tranquil in the twentieth century.

postwar america 466 7 5 postwar prosperity the 1950s marked a period of changing national population distribution.
between 1940 and 1960 more than 40 million americans moved to the suburbs one of the largest mass migrations in history.
rural regions suffered the most dramatic decline in population but people also came by the thousands from older industrial cities seeking as one father put it a place where a kid could grow up with grass stains on his pants during the same time period many older industrial cities lost population.
americans yearning for a better life after world war ii coupled with innovations in home building led to an explosion of growth in suburban areas interactive flipped video mass culture in the 1950s suburban migration causes and effects of suburban growth people flocked to the suburbs in part because the nation suffered from a severe shortage of urban housing.
during the depression and world war ii new housing construction had come to a near standstill.
at war s end as americans married and formed families they went in search of a place they could call their own.
fortunately at this time of peak demand developers figured out how to build affordable housing in a hurry.
william levitt became a leader in mass producing suburban homes.
entire rows of houses in levittown a suburb of new york city on long island were built using the same plan.
this method enabled workers to build houses in weeks rather than in months.
on the installment plan buyers could pay 58 a month toward the cost of a home.
demand for the homes was so great that levitt built two other levittowns one outside philadelphia pennsylvania and the other in new jersey.
these houses were ideal foi young couples starting out because they were affordable and comfortable.
other developers adopted levitts innovative techniques and suburbs were soon springing up across the country.

467 suburban development benefited from investment by the government.
state and federal governments constructed thousands of miles of highways that linked the suburbs to cities.
new home buyers also benefited from the gi bill and the federal housing administration fha which provided low interest loans.
fha backed loans allowed home buyers to pay as little as 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price and to pay off their mortgages over 30 years.
residents of new suburbs faced the challenge of establishing new towns with churches synagogues schools and police and fire departments.
through these institutions the suburbanites forged a sense of community.
during the 1950s the suburbs became increasingly self contained.
while suburban residents of earlier generations had depended on the city for entertainment and shopping the postwar suburban dweller could find a vast array of goods and services in nearby shopping centers.
interstates support migration and prosperity free enterprise was supported by government policy to improve the quality of life in suburban communities.
committed to the idea of easing automobile travel president eisenhower authorized the first funding of the interstate system in 1953.
further legislation president eisenhower authorized funding of the massive new interstate highway system.
one outcome was that new suburbanites could more easily commute by car to jobs in major cities.
passed by congress in 1956 resulted in the interstate highway act which authorized funds to build 41 000 miles of highway consisting of multilane expressways that would connect the nations major cities.
such expressways eisenhower argued would safely carry the nations growing automobile traffic boost economic prosperity and provide a valuable transportation network to strengthen national defense.
this represented the biggest expenditure on public works in history bigger by far than any project undertaken during the new deal.
in 1990 further recognition of president eisenhowers role in establishing the massive highway system led to a renaming of the highways.
it became the dwight d eisenhower system of interstate and defense highways.
besides easing commutes from suburbs to cities highways boosted the travel and vacation industries.
vacationers drove to national parks to beaches and to new destinations such as las vegas.
with more money and more children families sought leisure activity.
walt disney met this demand by building an extraordinary amusement park in california.
disneyland excited the imagination with visions of the future including make believe rides in space.
technological innovations lead to the car culture during the 1920s automobile ownership had soared in the united states.
with the explosion of suburban growth in the 1950s americans grew even more dependent upon their cars.
the number of registered automobiles jumped from 26 million in 1945 to 60 million in 1960.
these new automobiles tended to have big engines and enormous horsepower.
they came with the newest technology such as power steering and brakes and automatic transmissions.
harley earl of the ford motor company captured the mood of the 1950s by designing cars with lots of chrome that reminded people of jet planes.
while some suburbanites rode the train or other forms of mass transportation americans increasingly depended upon their cars to commute to work.
suburbanites also needed their cars to shop at suburban shopping malls.
entrepreneurs opened fast food restaurants and drive in movie theaters both of which catered to the car culture.
while these businesses flourished many older businesses often located in older city neighborhoods struggled to survive.

increased consumption and consumerism for much of our history americans had been taught to save their money.
a penny saved is a penny earned advised benjamin franklin.
however as the u s economy began to boom in the postwar era americans were caught up in a wave of consumerism buying as much as they could much of it on credit.
what accounted for this spending spree.
free enterprise system improves standards of living one reason americans spent more was that they had more money to spend.
during the 1950s median family income or average family income rose from 3 319 to 5 417.
the average american family now had twice as much real income as the average family had during the prosperous years of the 1920s.
consumer oriented companies found new and innovative ways to encourage buying on credit.
for example general motors advertised its cars with the slogan buy now pay later the diners club introduced the first credit card.
technological innovations drive new conveniences embracing the free enterprise system american businesses developed technological and purchasing innovations that improved the standard of living.
home appliances topped the list of the goods that americans bought.
families purchased electric washing machines and dryers refrigerators and ranges.
these labor saving appliances helped transform housework lessening the physical demands of everything from washing clothes to preserving foods.
with money to spend easy credit and new goods to buy shopping became a new pastime for americans.
supermarkets where customers could buy everything from milk to mops appeared.
shopping centers sprouted all over suburbia.
one product that americans bought in record numbers was a television.
in 1946 manufacturers produced fewer than 6 000 tv sets.
seven years later americans purchased 7 million sets and by the end of the decade 90 percent of all households owned a television.
identify cause and effect what were some reasons why consumption skyrocketed in the postwar era.
families and communities in the fifties american society had been shaken to its core by the mass mobilizations and disruption brought about by world war ii.
as americans readjusted to life in postwar america 469 7 6 mass culture in the 1950s peacetime they embraced traditional ideals of family life and community.
the ideal american family during world war ii many women including married women with children had gone off to work in factories.
in 1943 women made up 25 percent of the workers in the wartime auto industry.
with the wars end however most of the women who had entered the workforce returned to being homemakers.
now a more traditional image of the family took hold one in which women stayed home and men served as breadwinners women who wanted a career outside the home faced social pressures to rethink their decisions.
during the 1950s the ideal family was one in which men worked and supported their families and women stayed home and reared their children.
in the popular magazines of the postwar era social scientists and other opinion makers described the nuclear family or a household consisting of a mother and father and their children as the backbone of american society.
for the nuclear family to function smoothly experts claimed women had to accept their role as homemakers.
television shows and movies made similar assertions.
for example in the 1955 hollywood movie the tender trap actress debbie reynolds declared a woman isnt a woman unless shes been married and had children women in the 1950s were encouraged to return to traditional family roles by staying home to raise families.
as the 1950s progressed however more women were willing to challenge the view that a woman could not have a career outside the home.
by 1960 women held one third of the nations jobs.
approximately half of these women workers were married.
baby boom increases focus on children more so than in the past family life revolved around children.
not surprisingly the best selling book of the era was dr benjamin spocks common sense book of baby and child care.
parents bought and read his book because they wanted expert advice on how to raise their children.
spock emphasized the importance of nurturing children from their earliest days as infants through their teen years.
mothers spock suggested should not worry about spoiling their children because children could not get too much comfort and love.
some criticized spock for promoting what they called a permissive culture nevertheless spocks book remained extremely popular for several decades.
another sign of the degree to which family life revolved around children was the amount of money parents spent on their children.
some parents defended their spending by arguing that such spending guaranteed against the recurrence of another depression.
as baby boomers became teens their impact on the economy and american culture became even more noticeable.
while as children they received toys such as davy crockett caps and barbie dolls as teens they purchased very expensive items.
as life magazine observed the time is past when a boys chief possession was his bike and a girls party wardrobe consisted of a fancy dress worn with a string of dime store pearls.
todays teenagers surround themselves with a fantastic array of garish and often expensive baubles and amusements.
they own 10 million phonographs over a million tv sets 13 million cameras.
uee august 31 1959 billy graham contributes to a religious revival the 1950s also witnessed a revival of religion in the united states.
organized religious groups became more powerful and more houses of worship were built.
regular church attendance rose from about 50 million in postwar america 7 6 mass culture in the 1950s 1940 to about 80 million in 1958.
the increased number of churches and synagogues in suburban communities across the country helped to strengthen community ties.
the evangelist billy graham attracted millions to religious revivals that he held around the nation.
roman catholic bishop fulton sheen effectively used television to reach audiences estimated at 10 million a week.
during the 1950s congress added the words in god we trust to the dollar bill and under god to the pledge of allegiance.
these additions were aimed at making clear the contrast between the centrality of religion in american society and the atheist basis of communist societies.
specific needs lead to medical innovations during the 1950s american families benefited from numerous advances in medicine.
by 1952 dr jonas salk was refining a vaccine against polio the disease that had struck down franklin roosevelt and that in 1952 alone had crippled tens of thousands and killed 1 400 mostly children.
by 1960 the widespread distribution of salks new vaccine and an oral vaccine developed by albert sabin had nearly eliminated the disease.
at the same time antibiotics such as penicillin came into widespread use.
the antibiotics helped control numerous infectious diseases caused by bacteria such as whooping cough and tuberculosis.
as a result of these medical advances and a better understanding of the importance of diet children born after 1946 had a longer life expectancy than those born before 1946.
hl connect how did the focus on children and teenagers help develop prosperity during the 1950s.
educational opportunities and priorities as the economy grew so too did opportunities for americans to attain higher education.
a more educated workforce boosted economic productivity.
in 1940 only about 15 percent of college age americans attended college.
by the early 1960s however close to 40 percent did.
the percentage of americans who completed high school also rose sharply.
the astonishing growth of education in the late 1940s and thereafter wrote historian james patterson seemed yet another sign that the american dream was well and alive defense spending shapes education priorities new priorities meant that students had expanded opportunities.
in texas for example the state in 1954 dr jonas salk created a polio vaccine.
the vaccine was ordered for all american children and was eventually used around the globe to virtually eradicate polio.
a combination of more educational opportunities and a large baby boom population contributed to full classrooms across the nation.
postwar america 471 7 6 mass culture in the 1950s legislature passed laws guaranteeing young people the chance to attend public school through the twelfth grade.
large sums of money were needed to meet the education needs of the baby boom generation.
most of the funding for education came from local and state governments but after the soviet union launched sputnik 1 in 1957 many americans called for more federal funds for education.
in a mood of crisis congress quickly approved the national defense education act.
its 1 billion program was aimed at producing more scientists and science teachers.
the act authorized money for loans to high school and college graduates to continue their scientific education.
education becomes more accessible the postwar era saw the stirrings of a movement to make education more accessible.
many states poured funds into their public universities making it easier for ordinary americans to attend college.
california for example established a california master plan which called for three tiers of higher education research universities state colleges and community colleges.
all of them were to be accessible to all of the states citizens.
other states also built or expanded their college systems.
on another front in 1954 the supreme court ruled in brown v board of education of topeka that segregated vour dine out carton carries your reputation television gained such popularity during the 1950s that many families got into the habit of watching their favorite shows even while eating dinner.

white author of charlotte s web wrote that it is going to be the test of the modern world.
we shall stand or fall by the television while whites view may have been exaggerated clearly television has had an enormous impact on american society.
between 1945 and 1960 americans purchased television sets at a faster pace than they had bought either radios or cars during the 1920s.
the popularity of this new technology threatened the movie industry because families stayed home to watch tv rather than go out to watch movies at the theater.
although television attracted viewers of all ages it had a special influence on children.
baby boom children rushed home from school to watch the howdy doody show or the mickey mouse club.
children also watched hours of cartoons and shows featuring their favorite superheroes such as the lone ranger.
westerns were especially popular during the 1950s and early 1960s.
among the most memorable shows were sitcoms about families.
fifty million americans tuned in each week to watch the i love lucy show starring the comedic actress lucille ball.
other popular family sitcoms included leave it to beaver the adventures of ozzie and harriet and father knows best.
these shows reflected and reinforced the ideal of the 1950s family.
none of the family sitcoms had important african american characters.
none of the major characters got divorced.
major real life problems such as mental illness alcoholism and personal depression rarely if ever appeared.
writes david halberstam no family problem was so great that it could not be cleared up within the allotted twenty two minutes even before television emerged in the 1950s a mass national culture had begun to develop in the united states.
nationally broadcast radio programs hollywood films and other forms of popular culture had helped erode distinct regional and ethnic cultures.
television sped up and reinforced this process.
americans in every region of the country watched the same shows and bought the same goods they saw advertised.
television changed political campaigns.
during the 1952 presidential campaign americans could see the postwar america 472 7 6 mass culture in the 1950s candidates in action.

cultural movements against conformity many social critics complained about an emphasis on conformity.
in a book called the lonely crowd sociologists david riesman and nathan glazer lamented that americans had sacrificed their individualism in order to fit into the larger community.
they also criticized the power of advertising to mold public tastes.
the theme of alienation or the feeling of being cut off from mainstream society dominated a number of the most popular novels of the era.

the impact of the beat generation on american society an additional critique of american society came from a small group of writers and artists called beatniks or the beats.
the beats refused to conform to accepted ways of dressing thinking and acting.
conformity they insisted stifled individualism.
they displayed their dislike of american society by careless dress and colorful jargon.
in their poems such as allen ginsbergs howl and novels such as jack kerouacs on the road the beats lambasted what they saw as the crass materialism and conformity of the american middle class.
many americans in turn were outraged by their behavior and believed that beatnik values would have a negative impact on society.
hollywood captured this rebellious spirit and youthful defiance in several influential films in the 1950s.
in rebel without a cause james dean portrayed a tormented teenager who rejects the values of the establishment while trying to fit in with his peers.
actor marlon brando became a symbol of nonconformity for his role as the leader of an outlaw motorcycle gang in the film the wild one.
these characters and ultimately dean and brando themselves became role models for disenchanted teenagers.
a new style of music in the summer of 1951 a relatively unknown white disc jockey named alan freed began broadcasting what commonly had been called race music to listeners across the midwest.
renaming the music rock and roll freed planted the seed for a cultural revolution that would blossom in the mid 1950s.
rock music originated in the rhythm and blues traditions of african americans.
as african americans began to move north they brought their musical traditions with them.
independent recording companies began recording rhythm and blues r b music.
rock and roll borrowed heavily from rhythm and blues.
as chuck berry known as the pioneer of rock and roll put it it used to be called boogie woogie it used to be called blues used to be called rhythm and blues.

chuck berry was one of the most popular musicians of early rock and roll.
this new musical genre blurred the racial divisions of 1950s society.
postwar america 475 7 7 social issues of the 1950s in the north.
but now through the radio it began to attract a wider white audience in the postwar era.
for example a young elvis presley listened to a memphis radio station that played african american gospel tunes.
he began to integrate those tunes into the music he played.
meanwhile in the early 1950s sam phillips set up a recording studio in memphis to record and play the music of some of memphiss best african american blues performers such as b.
one day phillips heard presley and almost immediately recognized that he had found the person he had been looking for.
presleys arrival set off the new rock craze.
his first hit heartbreak hotel sold in the millions and his success sparked popularity for rock music.
presley along with african american performers such as chuck berry fats domino little richard and ray charles had profound influence on popular music throughout the world.
within a few years this new music would inspire the beatles and the rolling stones british rock and roll groups whose music would captivate audiences worldwide.
yet at first not everyone liked elvis or the new rock craze which many saw as having a very negative impact on culture.
when ed sullivan the host of a famous tv variety show invited elvis to sing on his rock and roll singer elvis presley became extremely popular with young people but some americans worried that his hip shaking performances were subversive or immoral.
show he directed cameramen to show elvis only from the waist up because many parents objected to elvis s gyrating hips and tight pants.
ministers complained about the passions that rock music seemed to unleash among so many youngsters.
congress held hearings on the subversive nature of rock music.
nonetheless it became a symbol of the emerging youth culture and of the growing influence of youth on mass culture.
h infer why would elvis presley have achieved greater success than african american musicians in the 1950s.
poverty in the cities and rural areas behind the new household appliances the spreading suburbs the burgeoning shopping malls and the ribbons of highways was a very different united states.
it was a nation of urban slums desperate rural poverty and discrimination.
people who were poor and dispossessed were well hidden.
in an influential 1962 book entitled the othei america michael harrington shocked many americans by arguing that poverty was widespread in the united states.
harrington claimed that 50 million americans one fourth of the nation lived in poverty.
despite american affluence harrington said poverty plagued african americans in the inner cities rural whites in areas such as appalachia and hispanics in migrant farm labor camps and urban barrios.
harrington argued that americans could not afford to ignore the existence of the poor the poor live in a culture of poverty.
they get sick more than anyone else in the society.

american cities were suffering a severe decline as middle class white families moved to the suburbs.
the loss of the middle class hurt cities economically because the middle class paid a large share of the taxes.
it hurt them politically as well because as the suburbs gained population they also gained representation in state legislatures and the national government.
this combination of declining economic and political power put a serious strain on cities leading to a deterioration of services such as garbage removal and street repair.
in turn as the conditions worsened and crime increased in what was now called the inner city more of the middle class decided to move to the suburbs.
inner city refers to the older central part of a city with crowded neighborhoods in which low income usually minority groups live.
inner cities are often plagued with problems such as inadequate housing and schools as well as crime.
federal state and local governments tried to reverse the downward trend in american cities by developing urban renewal projects.
with these projects the government cleared large tracts of older housing and built freeways and developments that it was hoped would revitalize downtown areas.
unfortunately the projects often backfired.
urban renewal drove people from their homes to make room for the new projects and highways.
the poor were forced to seek housing rn neighborhoods that were already overcrowded and overburdened.
one resident of east harlem new york who lost his home to an urban renewal project observed middle class flight only worsened inner city problems such as inadequate services and schools.
nobody cared what we wanted when they built this place.

americas history since 1865 the federal government tried to ease the shortage of affordable housing by constructing public housing.
at the time these housing projects seemed a godsend to those who lived there.
rent was cheap and the residents often enjoyed certain services like hot running water for the first time in their lives.
yet since the public housing was often built in poor neighborhoods the postwar america 477 y7 social issues of the 1950s projects led to an even greater concentration of poverty.
this in turn led to other problems such as crime.
migration from rural areas the plight of the rural poor was just as bad if not worse than that of the urban poor.
mississippi delta sharecroppers coal miners in appalachia and farmers in remote areas were left behind as others prospered and often their economic situation got worse as time passed.
a major transformation in farming was taking place.
corporations and large farm owners came to dominate farm production.
many independent small farm owners found it difficult to compete with the large farms and slipped into poverty.
many farmers responded by leaving their rural communities behind joining the waves of the poor who relocated to the city.
others remained behind wondering if they would ever get to enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
recall how did the federal government respond to the decline of american cities.
struggles of minorities during the postwar years the battle for civil rights in the south began to gain headlines.
yet in the same time period african americans and other minorities also fought for equality in the urban north and west.
central to their struggles were efforts to overcome housing and employment discrimination.
discrimination against puerto ricans latinos from puerto rico and mexico and native americans faced many of the same problems that african americans encountered in the years following world war ii.
puerto rican migrants to new york city for example often found themselves clustered together in many of the poorest inner city neighborhoods with employment opportunities limited by both formal and informal forms of discrimination.
as newcomers whose native language was not english they enjoyed little political power.
thus they received little help from city governments in getting better services education or an end to discriminatory practices.
labor conditions and mexicans both mexicans and mexican americans faced a similar situation in the united states.
during world war ii the u s government had established the bracero program as a means of addressing the shortage of agricultural workers.
braceros was a term for mexican migrant farmworkers in the united states.
the program gave temporary visas to mexican immigrants.
by 1964 3 million mexicans had worked in the united states under the program most of them as farm laborers.
many were exploited and cheated by their employers.
mexican workers followed crops from state to state.
often children worked alongside their parents.
the migrants poverty levels in the united states 1955 2005 analyze graphs this graph shows how poverty levels changed from 1955 2005.

postwar america 478 s 7 7 social issues of the 1950s had little power to oppose the exploitation for if they complained about conditions employers threatened to deport them back to mexico.
one u s department of labor official called the program legalized slavery.
one champion of the rights of mexican migrant workers ernesto galarza joined the effort to organize unions for mexican farm laborers.
americanization of native americans in 1953 the federal government enacted the termination policy a major change in the rules governing native americans.
the law sought to end tribal government and to relocate native americans to the nations cities.
it also terminated federal responsibility for the health and welfare of native americans.
proponents of the policy argued that it would free american indians to assimilate or merge into american society.
while some native americans praised the intent of the program most came to agree with senator mark hatfield of oregon who argued that it made things worse for them.
tjhe social and economic devastation which these policies have wrought upon many groups has been tremendous.
while these problems were already severe among indian societies generally they have become epidemic among terminated indians.

h identify supporting details what tactics did some civil rights organizations use during the 1940s.
a landmark supreme court decision although the civil rights movement had made some gains in the 1940s it stalled in the early 1950s.
one of its greatest disappointments was the naacps failure after decades of lobbying congress to make the lynching of african americans a federal crime.
feeling that the executive and legislative branches of government were unwilling to promote additional reforms the naacp decided to turn to litigation in the federal courts to attain its political goals.
the naacp turns to litigation in the courts by the end of world war ii the naacp had become the largest and most powerful political civil rights organization in the nation.
it attracted a wide array of individuals both black and white including a number of lawyers who used litigation as a means to expand civil rights across the country.
in the 1940s a team of naacp attorneys pursued a legal strategy to challenge the legality of segregation in the courts.
thurgood marshall an african american lawyer from baltimore maryland headed the legal team that mounted this challenge.
in 1950 the naacp won a number of key court cases.
in sweatt v painter the supreme court ruled that the state of texas had violated the fourteenth amendment by establishing a separate but unequal all black law school.

analyze data cite evidence to support the claim that school desegregation improved the lives of minorities living in the united states.
court a truly equal education involved more than simply admitting african americans to previously all white universities.
the supreme court issues a broad decision not long after it won these cases the naacp mounted a much broader challenge to segregated public education at all grade levels.
this challenge became known as brown v board of education.
in the sweatt and mclaurin cases the naacp asserted that texas and oklahoma had failed to provide equal educational experiences.
in the brown case however the naacp challenged the separate but equal principle itself which had been established in the 1896 plessy v ferguson case.
the supreme court agreed with the naacps argument that segregated public education violated the u s constitution.
all nine of the courts justices supported the brown decision which was written by newly appointed chief justice earl warren.
does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race.
deprive the children of the minority group equal education opportunities warren asked in his decision.
we believe that it does the chief justice and the court declared in the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place in the same month as the brown decision the supreme court decided another civil rights case this time involving mexican americans.
in hernandez v texas the court ended the exclusion of mexican americans from trial juries.
the hernandez decision was the first supreme court ruling against discrimination targeting a group other than african americans.
the public response the brown decision was one of the most significant and controversial in american history.
because public education touched so many americans it had a much greater impact than cases involving only professional and graduate schools.
moreover by overturning the principle of separate but equal the court lent its support to the views of many civil rights advocates that all forms of segregation are wrong.
in a separate ruling known as brown ii the court called for the implementation of its decision with all deliberate speed across the nation.
however most southerners had no intention of desegregating their schools without a fight.
in 1956 about 100 southern members of congress endorsed the southern manifesto they pledged to oppose the brown ruling through all lawful means on the grounds that the court had misinterpreted the constitution.
civil rights and reform in the 1960s 495 8 1 the civil rights movement strengthens more ominously the ku klux kian staged a revival.
many prominent white southerners and businessmen organized white citizens councils that declared that the south would not be integrated.
the citizens councils imposed economic and political pressure against those who favored compliance with the supreme courts decision.
b check understanding how did earlier legal decisions differ from brown v board of education.
conflict between federal and state power historically education had been a state matter.
states and local school boards ran the schools and the federal government had little involvement.
local and state officials resisted the brown decisions order to desegregate and clashes with the federal government resulted.
the most famous battle took place in 1957 in little rock arkansas.

none of the little rock nine gained entrance to the school that day.
up until the little rock crisis president eisenhower had provided little leadership on the civil rights front.
following the brown decision he did not urge the nation to rapidly desegregate its schools.
privately he expressed his misgivings about the ruling.
but when governor faubus resisted the will of the federal courts eisenhower realized he had to act.
he sent federal troops to little rock to protect the students and to enforce the courts decision.
eisenhower explained this action in a nationally televised address it is important that the reasons for my action be understood by all our citizens.
a foundation of our american way of life is our national respect for law.
if resistance to the federal court orders ceases at once the further presence of federal troops will be unnecessary and the city of little rock will return to its normal habits of peace and order and a blot upon the fair name and high honor of our nation in the world will be removed.

all of the major civil rights organizations sought to overcome these political injustices.
sncc and political rights sncc had spent several years organizing voter education projects in mississippi.
it met with little success and a great deal of violent opposition.
but in 1964 it decided to get more directly involved in the political process.
it called for a major campaign known as freedom summer.
about 1 000 volunteers mostly black and white students were to flood mississippi to register african americans to vote.

work of political organizations after freedom summer ended in august 1964 an mfdp delegation traveled to the democratic convention in new jersey seeking to be recognized as mississippi s only democratic party.

and we shall overcome voting rights act of 1965 spurred by the actions of protesters lobbying by the washington bureau of the naacp and the words of the president congress passed the voting rights act of 1965.
the act banned literacy tests and empowered the federal government to oversee voting registration and elections in states that had discriminated against minorities.
in 1975 congress extended coverage to hispanic voters in the southwest.
some legislation laid the groundwork for the voting rights act.
one such legal landmark was the twenty fourth amendment to the constitution ratified in 1964.
it banned the poll tax which had been used to keep poor african americans from voting.
also in response to litigation the federal courts handed down several important decisions that expanded the right to participate in the democratic process.
baker v can and reynolds v simms limited racial gerrymandering the practice of drawing election districts in such a way as to dilute the african american vote and established the legal principle of one man one vote in 1973 the supreme court further challenged racial gerrymandering in white v regester.
these laws and decisions had a profound impact.
particularly in the deep south african american participation in politics skyrocketed.
in mississippi the percentage of african americans registered to vote jumped from just under 7 percent in 1964 to about 70 percent in 1986.

8 3 successes and setbacks civil rights and reform in the 1960s violence troubles civil rights efforts many celebrated the passage of the voting rights act of 1965.
yet for some african americans things had not changed much.
in many urban areas there was anger and frustration over continuing discrimination and poverty.
that anger exploded into violence in several cities.
disorder in the cities less than a week after johnson signed the voting rights act one of the worst race riots in american history erupted in the predominantly african american neighborhood of watts in los angeles.
violence looting and arson spread for several days before national guard troops restored order.
watts was one of many race riots that erupted in the 1960s.
the worst violence occurred in newark new jersey and detroit michigan in the summer of 1967.
in detroit 43 people died and property damage reached 50 million.
the outbursts frightened many white americans.
in most previous race riots whites had used violence to keep african americans in their place but now blacks were using violence against police and white business owners in black neighborhoods.
investigating the race riots to determine the causes of the riots president johnson established the national advisory commission on civil disorders known as the kerner commission.
it concluded that long term racial discrimination stood as the single most important cause of violence.
the commission also recommended establishing and expanding federal programs aimed at overcoming the problems of americas urban ghettos.
our nation is moving toward two societies one black one white separate and unequal.
segregation and poverty have created the racial ghetto and a destructive environment totally unknown to most americans.
national advisory commission on civil disorders report 1967 the kerner commissions findings proved highly controversial.
a number of conservative commentators argued against expanding federal spending.
they said that this amounted to rewarding the rioters.
others noted that the black white split that the report described ignored other minorities.
during the 1960s race riots like this one in detroit often left significant parts of largely african american neighborhoods burned out or otherwise destroyed.
conservative critics argued that the kerner commission did not satisfactorily explain why the riots occurred.
civil rights and reform in the 1960s 509 8 3 successes and setbacks malcolm x speaks to a crowd at the unity rally in harlem new york city on june 29 1963.
he drew criticism from many civil rights activists for his belief that the races should be separated.
at the 1968 summer olympic games u s athletes tommie smith center and john carlos right raise their gloved fists to show their support for the black power movement.
president johnson did not follow up on the commissions recommendations largely because the vietnam war was consuming enormous sums of federal money.
the riots also fueled a white backlash.
many whites opposed further reforms.
however the private sector stepped in to create economic opportunities for citizens.
in 1967 the life insurance industry formed an urban problems committee of ceos who created a billion dollar urban investment program to provide investments for low and moderate income housing and job creating enterprises in poor urban areas.
recall why was the kerner commission formed.
new civil rights groups the racial rioting of the mid 1960s coincided with the radicalization of many african americans particularly young urban african americans.
rather than advocating nonviolence and integration they called for another approach.
malcolm x offers a different vision the most well known african american radical was malcolm x who was born malcolm little in omaha nebraska in 1925.
he adopted the x to represent his lost african name.
little he argued was his slave name.
malcolm had a difficult childhood.
in his teens he moved to boston and then to new york city where he became involved in drugs and crime and landed in prison on burglary charges at age 21.
while in prison malcolm became a convert to the nation of islam a religious sect headed by elijah muhammad.
the group prescribed strict rules of behavior including no drugs or alcohol and demanded a separation of the races.
after his release from prison malcolm became the nation of islams most prominent minister.
in this role he preached a message of self reliance and selfprotection.
he called for black pride and spread the idea of black nationalism a belief in the separate identity and racial unity of the african american community.
malcolm was a charismatic speaker who could play an audience as great musicians play instruments his dynamic speeches won many adherents to his cause.
in 1964 malcolm x broke away from the nation of islam and formed his own organization.
he then made a pilgrimage to mecca the holy city of islam afterward adopting the religious name el hajj malik el shabazz.
returning to the united states he seemed willing to consider limited acceptance of whites.
in february 1965 however malcolm x was shot and killed.
three members of the nation of islam were convicted of the murder.
civil rights and reform in the 1960s 510 8 3 successes and setbacks the black power movement many young african americans saw themselves as heirs of the radical malcolm x.
they began to move away from the principle of nonviolence.
they also began to question the goal of integration.
as sncc leader stokely carmichael put it integration.
has been based on complete acceptance of the fact that in order to have a decent house or education blacks must move into a white neighborhood or send their children to a white school.
this reinforces the notion.
that white is automatically better and black is by definition inferior.
stokely carmichael.
what we want 1 1966 carmichael first used the term black power in 1966.
in that year james meredith had set off on a march against fear across the state of mississippi to encourage african americans to register and vote.
meredith traveled only 20 miles before he was shot and left for dead by a white supremacist.
sncc core and sclc members vowed to continue the march.
when they reached greenwood mississippi carmichael and some other marchers were arrested.
after his release carmichael told a crowd that african americans needed black power.
he later said that black power meant african americans should collectively use their economic and political muscle to gain equality.
yet many white americans felt threatened.
they believed that black power meant black violence.
the black panthers approach not long after carmichaels black power speech huey newton and bobby seale formed the black panther party in oakland california.
almost overnight the black panthers became the symbol of young militant african americans.
the black panthers organized armed patrols of urban neighborhoods to protect people from police abuse.
they also created antipoverty programs such as free breakfasts for poor african american children.
the black panthers gained national attention when they entered the state capitol in sacramento carrying shotguns and wearing black leather jackets and berets to protest attempts to restrict their right to bear arms.
the panthers style appealed to many young african americans who began to wear their hair in afros and to refer to themselves as black rather than negro or colored at the university of california at berkeley stokely carmichael advocated combining the economic social and political power of african americans to achieve civil rights.
members and sympathizers demonstrate their support for black panther leader huey newton as he stands trial for the murder of an oakland police officer in alameda county california.

civil rights activists at the lorraine motel in memphis point toward the snipers position moments after dr martin luther king jr was shot by an assassin.
some following the lead of malcolm x changed their name and celebrated their african heritage.
at the same time the panthers militancy often led to violent confrontations with police.
each side accused the other of instigating the violence.
et explain what effect did malcom x have on the civil rights movement.
king expands his dream martin luther king understood the anger and frustration of many urban african americans whose lives had changed little despite the civil rights reforms of the 1960s.
however he disagreed with the call for black power and sought a nonviolent alternative to combat economic injustice.
after spending about a year in chicagos slums to protest conditions there king made plans for a massive poor people s campaign the campaigns goal was to broaden civil rights goals to address economic inequality in america.
kings assassination a turning point as part of this effort king journeyed to memphis tennessee in early april 1968.
there he offered his assistance to sanitation workers who were striking for better wages and working conditions.
on april 3 king addressed his followers.
he referred to threats that had been made against his life.
like anybody i would like to live a long life king declared.
but im not concerned about that now.
i just want to do gods will the following day as king stood on the balcony outside his motel room he was struck by a shot from a high powered rifle.
he died at a hospital shortly afterward at the age of 39.
james earl ray a white exconvict was later charged with kings murder.
kings assassination marked an important turning point.
his efforts had increased minority participation in the political process and encouraged racial integration.
yet much racist hostility persisted.
for example lester maddox a restaurant owner in atlanta georgia gained national attention when he closed his business rather than comply with 1964 civil rights act that banned discrimination against african americans.
hoping to maintain the status quo maddox then ran for and was elected governor of georgia.
after kings assassination governor maddox would not even allow the civil rights leaders body to lie in state in the georgia state capitol building.

by then the civil rights movement had made significant gains.
yet the impact of kings legacy would continue to grow.
his messages of political equality and economic opportunity for all continue to define political discourse to this day.
robert f kennedy responds robert f kennedy was campaigning for the presidency in indianapolis when he heard of kings death.
rfk stopped his campaign speech to give the audience the sad news.
he reminded them that he had lost his own brother to an assassins bullet.
kennedy asked those assembled to honor kings memory by replacing their anger and desire for revenge with an effort to understand with compassion and love despite kennedys plea riots broke out in hundreds of cities after kings assassination.
two months later robert kennedys life too was cut short by an assassin.
check understanding why did king go to memphis in 1968.
results of the civil rights movement the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s succeeded in eliminating legal or de jure segregation and knocking down barriers to african american voting and participation in the political process.
during the same period african american poverty rates fell and the median income of african american men and women rose rapidly as did the number of african americans who graduated from high school.
one symbol of the progress that had been made was the appointment of thurgood marshall as the first african american supreme court justice in 1967.
the following year in the wake of king s murder congress passed one final civil rights measure the fair housing act which banned discrimination in housing.
yet in spite of these efforts to create economic opportunity the social and economic gap between many blacks and whites remained.
new measures aimed at closing this gap tended to provoke more controversy than consensus in america.
controversies over busing and affirmative action attempts to increase economic opportunities for african americans and to integrate neighborhoods and schools encountered great difficulties.
to achieve desegregated schools the federal courts had ordered the use of forced busing.
richard nixon who succeeded lyndon johnson as president criticized busing as a means of attaining racial balance.
at the same time the nixon administration formally established affirmative action as a means of closing the economic gap between blacks and whites.
in a short period of time colleges and universities businesses and local and state governments followed the federal governments lead and implemented their own affirmative action plans to increase african american representation in schools and the workforce.
affirmative action proved controversial almost from the start.
some whites argued that it constituted civil rights and reform in the 1960s 513 0 3 successes and setbacks african american poll watchers observe voters in tuskegee alabama on may 31 1966.

changes to the voting rights act the voting rights act of 1965 continues to encourage minority participation in the democratic process.
congress has renewed the law four times for 5 years in 1970 for 7 years in 1975 for 25 years in 1982 and most recently for 25 years in 2006.
in recent years however the supreme court has redefined the scope of the acts provisions.
in 1993 the court ruled that the first district in north carolina to elect an african american to congress was shaped in a way that violated the rights of white voters.
in 2013 the court severely weakened the heart of the act section 5 which empowered the federal government to oversee election practices in states where voting rights are at risk.
in a 5 4 decision the court released nine states seven of them in the south from federal supervision.
the ruling cited the gains those states had made since 1965 in black voter registration as rationale for the decision.
list what gains had the civil rights movement made by the early 1970s.
reverse discrimination and violated the goal of creating a colorblind society.
justice thurgood marshall disagreed.
three hundred and fifty years ago the negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold into slavery marshall wrote.
the position of the negro today in america is the tragic but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment until the nation addressed the legacy of this unequal treatment marshall asserted it would not fulfill its promise of providing equal rights and opportunities to all.
affirmative action remains a divisive social policy.
critics and even some supporters contend that the practice has had unintended consequences sometimes hurting the very people it is intended to help.
for example some studies show that minority students accepted through affirmative action at the nations most selective universities do not have as high a graduation rate as minority students accepted assessment 1.

after getting out of the hospital he committed himself to a grueling schedule of public appearances.
by the time of the first debate held in late september in chicago and watched by about 70 million people nixon looked pale and exhausted.
he arrived at the television studio an hour early but he refused the offer to have makeup applied to hide his newly growing beard.
by contrast kennedy tanned from open air campaigning in california looked healthy and confident.
his relaxed manner easy charm and quick sense of humor added to his appeal.
in many ways the debate boiled down to how the candidates looked and spoke rather than what they said.
most americans who listened to the debate on radio believed that nixon had won.
but the larger audience who watched the debate on television concluded that kennedy was the clear victor.
although nixon tried to change his image in the later debates he was unable to significantly alter the countrys initial impression of him.
kennedys victory in chicago proved crucial in the election.

nixon said nothing publicly about the episode.
kennedy however telephoned kings wife coretta scott king to voice his concern.
he also worked behind the scenes to obtain kings release on bail.
kennedys actions attracted the strong support of african americans in the election.
the election of 1960 was the tightest presidential election since 1888.
in an election that witnessed the largest voter turnout in the countrys history kennedy won by less than 120 000 of the 68 million votes cast.
his electoral victory was more convincing.
he carried enough states to give him 303 electoral votes to nixons 219.

continuing kennedys civil rights policies on becoming president after kennedys assassination johnson radiated reassurance and strength.
his every action indicated that he was ready for the job and that the government was in good hands.
less than a week after the assassination johnson addressed a joint session of congress.
n o memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.
president johnson speech before a joint session of congress 1963 with johnsons ability to build consensus or agreement on an issue by a group the civil rights act became law in the summer of 1964.
it outlawed discrimination in voting education and public accommodations.
the act demanded an end to discrimination in hospitals restaurants theaters and other places open to the public.
it also created the equal employment opportunity commission to fight discrimination in hiring.
african americans and mexican americans who faced almost daily discrimination benefited immeasurably from the legislation.
finally title vii of the 1964 civil rights act prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex.
the fight to expand economic opportunity johnson made his intentions clear in his first state of the union address when he said it was time to declare an unconditional war on poverty the new president planned to fuse his own dreams for america onto kennedys legislative agenda.
although kennedy had failed to get congress to approve his tax bill calling for dramatic tax cuts for middle class americans johnson was able to maneuver it through.
in addition he had added a billion dollar war on poverty to the bill.
johnsons war on poverty introduced measures to train the jobless educate the uneducated and provide healthcare for those in need.
the 1964 economic opportunity act created the job corps to train young men and women between the ages of 16 and 21 in the work skills they needed to acquire better jobs and move out of poverty.

do you think the programs were a success.
why or why not.
1 interactive chart civil rights and reform in the 1960s 522 8 5 reform under johnson the act also established volunteers in service to america or vista patterned after kennedys peace corps which sent american volunteers into poverty stricken american communities in an effort to solve the countrys pressing economic educational and medical problems.
the volunteers served in inner city schools and on indian reservations.
they worked in rural health clinics and urban hospitals.
perhaps the most successful element of the economic opportunity act was the head start program.
funds were provided for play groups day care and activities designed to help underprivileged children get ready for elementary school.
head start enjoyed bipartisan support for decades.
johnson defeats a conservative challenger if johnson was to continue his war on poverty and other social goals he needed to win the 1964 presidential election.
in that year the republicans nominated arizona senator barry goldwater whose economic and social views were directly opposed to johnsons.
whereas johnson believed the federal government could best regulate the economy and promote social justice goldwater maintained that the federal government was the problem not the solution.
according to goldwater social and economic issues such as racism and poverty should not be addressed by the federal government.
goldwater promised to rein in the federal government by reducing its size and restricting its activities.
he favored significant tax cuts and right to work laws and he opposed social welfare legislation and government spending on educational public housing and urban renewal programs.
in 1964 most americans were not ready for goldwaters conservative message.
in addition johnsons campaign portrayed goldwater as an extremist suggesting that his election would ensure the repeal of civil rights legislation and economic ruin.
johnson had prosperity on his side as well as his own impressive legislative record and the legacy of kennedy.
in the november election he won a landslide victory capturing more than 60 percent of the popular vote and carrying all but six states.
goldwater carried only arizona and five southern states louisiana mississippi alabama georgia and south carolina.
furthermore the outcome of the election was significant.
the south was no longer solidly democrat.
not only had johnson won a ringing victory but democrats had captured both houses of congress.
although goldwater suffered a crushing political defeat in 1964 his conservative ideas resonated with barry goldwater the republican nominee for president in 1964 strongly opposed the use of federal resources to address social issues.
support for goldwaters message remained strong in parts of california propelling ronald reagan to the governor s office in 1966.
when a conservative tide swept reagan into the white house in 1981 goldwater regained some influence and continued to be a strong voice on behalf of modern american conservatives.
et recall how did johnson continue kennedy s plan to eliminate poverty in the united states.
creating the great society in the spring of 1964 in a speech at the university of michigan johnson outlined his vision for america calling it the great society.
he said that during the past hundred years americans had spread across the continent developed industrially and created great wealth.
but the work of america was not complete.
he added the challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life and to civil rights and reform in the 1960s 523 8 5 reform under johnson advance the quality of our american civilization.
w e have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society but upward to the great society.
president johnson university of michigan may 22 1964 for johnson the great society demanded an end to poverty and racial injustice and opportunity for every child.
increasing access to healthcare in the first half of 1965 congress passed parts of johnsons great society legislation.
kennedy had supported similar legislation that failed to win congressional support.
johnsons agenda amended the social security act by adding the medical care for the aged program or medicare as it was more popularly called.
medicare provided basic health insurance for americans in the social security system who were age 65 and older.
it was funded by a new tax on workers earnings and by payments from the social security benefits of retirees.
president johnson gave healthcare special attention.
with medicare and medicaid more americans would be able to receive basic healthcare.
the new law also included a medicaid feature that provided basic medical services to poor and disabled americans who were not part of the social security system.
johnson signed the bill into law in independence missouri home of former president harry truman who had called for a national health insurance program almost 20 years earlier.
when the social security act was amended few questions were raised about how programs like medicare and medicaid would be paid for in the years to come.
medicare has become increasingly expensive as medical costs have risen the percent of retirees in the population relative to workers has increased and because people live longer now than they did in 1965.
investing in public education along with health education was one of the centerpieces of the great society program.
improved healthcare and education were necessary steps toward the goal of ending poverty the 1965 elementary and secondary education act was designed to aid schools in poorer communities.
it provided federal funds to improve school libraries learning centers language laboratories and services in impoverished school districts.
the act dramatically increased funding for indian inner city and mexican american schools.
environmental and consumer protection the great society program extended to improving the overall quality of american life.
in the early 1960s several best selling books raised americans awareness about environmental and consumer problems.
rachel carsons silent spring 1962 detailed how chemical fertilizers and pesticides were damaging the fragile ecosystem.
ralph naders unsafe at any speed 1965 attacked the automotive industry for its lack of concern for passenger safety.
both these books helped to foster environmental and consumer activity and led to several important pieces of legislation.
the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act 1966 established safety standards for automotive vehicles and created the national highway traffic safety administration to administer them.
the water quality act 1965 the clean water restoration act 1966 and the air quality act 1967 aimed at improving water and air standards in the country.
the u s public health service was empowered to enforce air quality standards but dealing with water pollution was largely left to the states.
not until the environmental protection agency was created in 1970 did the federal government gain significant regulatory power to protect the environment.

less restrictive immigration policies meanwhile the civil rights movement was raising questions about americas long standing immigration policy.
the national origins acts of 1921 and 1924 had established a quota system that favored western european immigrants and limited immigrants from other parts of the world.
such a discriminatory policy was clearly out of touch with the mood of the country in the early 1960s.
the immigration and nationality act of 1965 altered americas quota system.
nearly 170 000 immigrants from the eastern hemisphere were allowed into the country.
nearly 120 000 immigrants from the western hemisphere were welcomed.
immigrants from latin america central america the caribbean and asia soon began to pour into the united states providing the country with a pool of ideas talent and skills.
the doors of america were once again open to immigrants from around the world.
during the 1960s and 1970s millions of immigrants would arrive on american shores.
like earlier immigrants many came seeking economic opportunity.
others were fleeing war or social unrest or were in search of political or religious freedom.
as in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries new york and the urban east and west coasts attracted many of the countrys newest immigrants.
the legacy of the great society although critics said that great society programs did not work many point out that these programs have improved the lives of millions of individual americans.
poverty and infant mortality rates declined.
medicare and medicaid delivered needed healthcare to millions of elderly and poor americans.
head start and other antipoverty programs provided the educational tools many underprivileged americans needed to escape poverty.
furthermore congress also provided artists and scholars with assistance through the national endowment for the arts and humanities created in 1965.
the better future that the great society envisioned inspired many americans including women and minorities to take action to expand their economic opportunities.
latino farm workers formed a union and organized national boycotts of farm products to win better wages.
latino students boycotted their schools to demand better education.
meanwhile asian americans made economic gains unmatched by any other minority group.
women too made great advances during this time.
by 1970 the percentage of women with college degrees was nearly double what it had been in 1950.
the great society victories may not have been as grandiose as johnson predicted but they were victories.
the simple fact that 22 2 percent of all americans lived civil rights and reform in the 1960s 525 8 5 reform under johnson below the poverty line in 1960 and 12 6 percent lived below the poverty line in 1970 says something about the triumphs of the great society.
u identify which immigrant groups were affected by the immigration and nationality reform act of 1965.
elps speaking 3 c 3 read the section titled increasing access to healthcare with a partner.
then practice asking and answering questions about medicare and medicaid.
af elps the impact of the warren court during the 1960s the supreme court demonstrated a willingness to take the lead on controversial social religious and political issues.
led by chief justice earl warren the supreme court at this time often called the warren court became the most liberal in american history.
its decisions supported civil rights civil liberties voting rights and personal privacy.
a principle of voting rights in several decisions the supreme court ruled in favor of the one man one vote principle.
the problem was one of apportionment the warren court issued many landmark rulings in the areas of civil rights criminal justice the first amendment and legislative districting.
interactive gallery of seats in state legislatures.
during the twentieth century large numbers of voters moved from rural to urban areas but many state governments had not changed or reapportioned electoral districts to reflect the new conditions.
this led to an electoral imbalance.
in many states rural areas had more power and urban areas had less power than their populations actually mandated.
in baker v carr 1962 the supreme court ruled in favor of reapportionment on the basis of one man one vote electoral districts it said had to reflect the numbers of people in those districts.
in reynolds v sims 1964 the court reaffirmed its decision adding that any arrangement other than one man one vote violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
redefining civil rights and liberties in several decisions the warren court expanded the definition of what constitutes free speech.
for example in tinker v des moines school district 1969 the court ruled that wearing black armbands in school to protest the vietnam war was protected as symbolic speech.
the decision also made it clear that students do not give up all of their rights to free speech while in school.
in the tinker decision critics complained that the court interpreted the constitution too loosely taking their judicial interpretation of the constitution too far.
the court applied what critics have called judicial interpretation to the constitution.
that is the justices expanded the constitutions meaning beyond the framers original intent.
in this case the court expanded the definition of free speech to include more than the spoken word.
a narrow or strict construction of the first amendment would have protected only actual speech.
the warren court also showed a heightened concern for the constitutional rights of accused lawbreakers.
in four landmark cases the court broadened the individual rights of accused criminals and narrowed those of federal state and local government officials.
in mapp v ohio 1961 the court ruled that evidence obtained illegally violated the fourth amendment and had to be excluded from federal and state trials.
in gideon v wainwright 1963 the court decided that all accused criminals had the right to a lawyer whether or not they could pay for one.
in escobedo v illinois 1964 the warren court expanded on gideon v wainwright by adding that every accused lawbreaker had to be offered access to a lawyer before questioning and all evidence obtained from a suspect who had not been informed of his or her right to a lawyer could not be used in court.
finally in miranda v arizona 1966 the court ruled that an civil rights and reform in the 1960s 526 8 5 reform under johnson accused criminal had to be informed of his or her fifth and sixth amendment rights before being questioned.
critics of these decisions argued that the warren court had tipped the balance of justice in favor of the rights of accused criminals.
today many conservative justices still side with this opinion.
the majority of the members of the warren court however countered that the rights of individuals had to be protected especially when freedom hung in the balance.
church and state in the public sphere the warren court addressed the separation of church and state in the case of engel v vitale 1962.
the case involved whether or not a public school could require students to recite a state sanctioned prayer.
the court ruled that school prayer was a violation of the first amendment and an attempt by a governmental body to promote religion.
the next year the court ruled in abington v schempp that bible reading in public schools also violated the first amendment.
the two decisions divided religious groups and the american people.
some welcomed the rulings saying the government should have no say in personal religious matters.
others insisted the decisions were hostile to religion.
the two decisions ignited and continue to ignite controversy.
for more than 40 years various religious groups have railed against these decisions.
identify what major court ruling gave a person accused of a crime the right to have a lawyer.

kennedy argued that during the eisenhower years america had lost ground in the cold war struggle against communism.
he pointed to the new communist regime under fidel castro in cuba and charged that there was now a missile gap that left the u s nuclear missile force inferior to that of the soviet union.
the first goal of the kennedy administration would be to build up the nations armed forces.

the cold war and vietnam kennedy strives to win the cold war nowhere was the difference between eisenhower and kennedy more evident than in two important 1961 addresses.
in his farewell address eisenhower counseled caution in foreign affairs.
the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist he said.
as the first president born in the twentieth century kennedy proclaimed that a new generation of americans was ready to meet any challenge.
in his inaugural address kennedy warned his country s enemies pearson realize key terms john kennedy fidel castro flexible response peace corps alliance for progress bay of pigs invasion cuban missile crisis nikita khrushchev hot line nuclear test ban treaty berlin wall ho chi minh domino theory southeast asia treaty organization seato vietcong gulf of tonkin resolution let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.

542 as the cold war continued into the 1960s kennedy took office facing the spread of communism abroad and the threat of nuclear war.
determined to succeed where he felt eisenhower had failed kennedys enthusiasm and commitment to change offered the hope that with hard work and persistence the united states could win the cold war.
kennedy issued a challenge to americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country significant national decisions impact the cold war eisenhowers defense policy of massive retaliation had emphasized the construction of nuclear weapons.
although kennedy did not ignore the possibility of a nuclear war he wanted to make sure that the united states was prepared to fight both conventional wars and conflicts against guerrilla forces.
kennedy therefore gave increased funding to conventional u s army and navy forces as well as to army special forces such as the green berets.
he wanted a flexible response defense policy one that prepared the united states to fight any type of conflict.
important international decisions shape the cold war the third world as it was known at the time was made up of the developing nations in africa asia and latin america that did not align themselves with the united states or the soviet union.
according to soviet propaganda western capitalism created poverty and inequalities in the third world whereas communism promoted equality.
like previous american leaders kennedy believed that democracy combined with prosperity would contain or limit the spread of communism.
therefore he initiated programs to economically and politically strengthen the nations of the third world.
the peace corps created in 1961 sent american volunteers around the world on missions of freedom to assist developing countries.
they worked to provide technical educational and health services.
the first peace corps volunteers arrived in ghana africa in 1961 to work as teachers.
by the end of the year the peace corps had volunteers working in two other countries in africa nigeria and tanzania.
the program celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2011 and had 8 073 volunteers in 76 countries in 2012.
other programs stressed purely economic development.
one such project the alliance for progress promised to resurrect americas good neighbor policy toward latin america.
during the 1950s many latin americans had grown increasingly resentful of the united states claiming that it had too cauch influence in their region.
kennedy hoped the alliance for progress would change that view.
president elect kennedy meets president eisenhower at the white house in december 1960.
after he took office kennedy increased defense spending by 6 billion.
by 1963 the peace corps had over 7 300 volunteers serving in over 40 countries including togo.
president kennedy appointed his brother in law sargent shriver as the peace corpss first director.
the vietnam war era 543 9 1 the cold war and vietnam at its start in 1961 the program pledged 20 billion to help 22 latin american nations raise their per capita income distribute income more equitably and improve industry agriculture health and welfare.
unlike the peace corps however the alliance for progress was not successful.
h contrast how did the message of kennedys inaugural address differ from that of eisenhowers farewell address.
kennedy responds to communism in cuba in 1959 cuban revolutionary fidel castro succeeded in overthrowing the regime of fulgencio batista.
initially the united states attempted to cultivate good relations with castro.
however it soon became clear that the cuban leader was determined to nationalize land held by u s citizens enforce radical reform measures and accept soviet economic and military aid.
thousands of wealthy and middle class cubans fled their country many settling in miami and southern florida.
proud of their heritage and deeply anticommunist they made new lives for themselves and their families in the united states.
bay of pigs invasion after breaking diplomatic relations with cuba in 1961 the eisenhower administration authorized the central intelligence agency cia to plan an invasion of cuba to overthrow castro.
the cia recruited cuban exiles and trained them in guatemala.
but when eisenhower left office the invasion plan was still that an unexecuted plan.
pressured by members of the cia and his own aides kennedy decided to implement the plan.
on april 17 1961 a cia led force of cuban exiles attacked cuba in the bay of pigs invasion.
the invasion was greatly mismanaged.
the poorly equipped forces landed at the site with no protective cover.
all but 300 of the 1 400 invaders were killed or captured.
not only did the bay of pigs invasion fail it probably strengthened castros position in cuba.
it also turned many cuban americans against kennedy.
kennedy took personal responsibility for the failed invasion.
he emphasized however that the united states would continue to resist communist penetration in the western hemisphere.
kennedys role in the cuban missile crisis kennedys efforts to contain communism were severely threatened during the cuban missile crisis.
in august and september of 1962 u s intelligence discovered that the soviets were building nuclear missile sites in cuba cuba and the bay of pigs key 1 cuba united states and its territories european possessions analyze maps based on the information in the map what factors might have influenced president kennedys decision to launch the bay of pigs invasion of cuba in 1961.
sil interactive timeline the vietnam war era 544 9 1 the cold war and vietnam apparently to protect castro from another american invasion.
when the sites were completed major east coast cities and the panama canal would be in range of the missiles.
in response to this soviet aggression kennedy demanded the removal of the missiles.
in a dramatic television address on october 22 1962 he blamed nikita khrushchev the soviet premier for causing a reckless and provocative threat to world peace he also announced that he had approved a naval quarantine blockade of cuba to prevent the soviets from completing the bases.
behind the scenes however kennedy worked toward a diplomatic settlement.
he indicated that he would remove u s missiles in turkey and italy if the soviets removed their missiles in cuba.
after six tense days during which nuclear war seemed a real possibility khrushchev agreed to honor the blockade and remove the missiles.
as secretary of state dean rusk later told a reporter remember when you report this that eyeball to eyeball they blinked first the impact of the crisis during the cuban missile crisis kennedy and khrushchev stood on the edge of a nuclear war and then slowly backed away.
in the soviet union khrushchev lost prestige and more hard line leaders chipped away at his power.
in the united states kennedy emerged as a more mature and thoughtful leader one who had faced a frightening test and had remained calm and resolute.
the crisis prompted both leaders to move toward detente a relaxing of tension between rivals.
they installed a hot line telephone system between moscow and washington d c to improve communication.
in 1963 the year after the crisis the united states great britain and the soviet union signed the nuclear test ban treaty the first nuclear weapons agreement which ended aboveground nuclear tests.
thirty six other nations soon signed the agreement.
h identify supporting details what diplomatic enticement did kennedy offer the soviets to help solve the cuban missile crisis.
the causes and outcomes of the berlin crisis since 1958 khrushchev wanted to sign a peace treaty that would put the western zones of berlin under control east germany.
his actions were motivated by the steady flow of skilled east german workers into west berlin.
desiring to show his strength kennedy stood firm on americas commitment to defending the rights kennedy and khrushchev smile for the cameras but their june 1961 summit in vienna less than 2 months after the bay of pigs was tense and combative.
in 1961 workers build part of the berlin wall.
the ninety six mile long wall would divide soviet controlled east berlin from democratic west berlin.
the vietnam war era 545 9 1 the cold war and vietnam of west berliners and west germans.
at a conference in vienna in june 1961 kennedy and khrushchev focused on berlin as the key issue.
khrushchev called the present situation intolerable he demanded that the united states recognize the formal division of germany and end its military presence in west berlin.
kennedy refused.
he did not want to give up occupation rights he considered critical to defending western europe.
in a tense atmosphere khrushchev said i want peace but if you want war that is your problem kennedy answered it is you not i who wants to force a change the meeting ended abruptly.
the conference meant to relax cold war tensions only increased them.
after returning home both world leaders made moves that threatened the peace.
kennedy asked congress to dramatically increase military spending.
khrushchev ordered the construction of a wall between east and west berlin.
the berlin wall became a visible symbol of the reality of the two germanys and the gulf between the communist east and the democratic west.
kennedy responded by sending 1 500 u s troops to west berlin.
for a time russian and american tanks moved within sight of each other.
yet neither side could fully claim a victory.

i nir rr nr nhrac thn onntpnnpq alniiri iisina the i reasons for u s involvement in indochina presidents kennedy and johnson shared a vision for a better america in the 1960s.
they also shared a vision for a better world in which america would emerge victorious from its cold war struggle against global communism.
as part of this strategic and ideological battle the united states established a new line of defense against communism in vietnam.
the conflict in southeast asia would grow to be one of the most costly wars in american history.
situated far away in southeast asia vietnam did not attract significant american attention until the 1960s.
television news shows rarely mentioned it and many americans could not locate it on a map.
but over a span of more than ten years the united states sent several million soldiers to fight in vietnam.
americas involvement in vietnam had roots in european colonialism cold war politics and vietnamese calls for national independence.

slightly larger than the state of texas indochina included almost 27 million people by the end of world war ii.
french colonial officials ruled vietnam with an iron fist.
they transplanted french laws into vietnam and imposed high taxes.
french business people acquired large rice and rubber plantations and controlled the mineral wealth of the country.
some vietnamese especially wealthier members of society benefited from western culture and technology.
many others however were impoverished by colonialism.
some vietnamese rebelled against frances exploitative rule.
ho chi minh became the most important voice demanding independence for vietnam.
born in 1890 ho became involved in anti french organizations as a young man and fled vietnam in 1912.
he traveled the world visiting american ports and living periodically in london paris and moscow.
during his 30 year absence ho constantly thought and wrote about vietnam and he searched for westerners who would support his plans for vietnamese independence.
ho embraced communism and eventually soviet communists rallied to his cause.
the french fight nationalism and communism during world war ii japan had undermined french control over vietnam.
but when the conflict ended france reasserted its colonial claims there.
france s problem however was that colonialism was a dying institution.
world war ii had strengthened nationalist movements while weakening the economic and military positions of traditional european powers.
in vietnam ho chi minh clamored for independence as france struggled to maintain its dwindling global power.
meanwhile the united states faced a difficult decision.
on the one hand it supported decolonization.
on the other hand america wanted france as an ally in its cold war effort to contain the soviet union.
president harry s truman believed that if he supported vietnamese independence he would weaken anticommunist forces in france.
so to ensure a strong anticommunist western europe truman sacrificed his own anticolonial sentiments.
vietnam thus became a pawn in cold war politics.
to ensure french support in the cold war truman agreed to aid frances efforts to regain control over vietnam.
after communist forces won the civil war in china in 1949 america increased its aid to the french in vietnam.
truman did not want to see another ho chi minh was a revolutionary leader who fought against french occupation.
later he became the prime minister then president of the democratic republic of vietnam north vietnam.

containing ho chi minhs communist vietminh an abbreviation of the league for the independence of vietnam became a national priority.
the domino theory spurs u s involvement in vietnam when president dwight d eisenhower took office in early 1953 he continued trumans policies toward vietnam.
he sent monetary aid to the french arguing that by battling ho chi minh they were containing the spread of communism.
eisenhower told a journalist that the fight in vietnam involved more than the future of just one country you have a row of dominoes set up you knock over the first one and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly.
so you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences.
d eisenhower arpil 7 1954 the vietnam war era 9 1 the cold war and vietnam the domino theory was the idea that if vietnam fell to communism its closest neighbors would follow.
this in turn would threaten japan the philippines and australia.
in short stopping the communists in vietnam was important to the protection of the entire region.
in 1954 however the french lost their eight year struggle to regain vietnam.
the vietminh trapped a large french garrison at dien bien phu a military base in northwest vietnam and laid siege to it for 55 days.
during the siege which one frenchman described as hell in a very small place vietminh troops destroyed the french airstrip cut french supply lines and dug trenches to attack key french positions.
finally on may 7 1954 after suffering some 15 000 casualties the french surrendered.
the very next day at an international peace conference in geneva switzerland france sued for peace.
according to the geneva accords france granted independence to vietnam laos and cambodia.
the accords also divided vietnam at the seventeenth parallel into two countries north vietnam and south vietnam.
ho chi minhs communist forces ruled in north vietnam and an anticommunist government supported by the united states assumed power in south vietnam.
the accords also called for free elections in 1956 to unify vietnam.
b check understanding why was supporting the french in indochina problematic for president truman.
the united states responds to communism in vietnam during the battle of dien bien phu france appealed to the united states for military support.
president eisenhower was willing to supply money but not soldiers.
ike would not commit american troops to defend colonialism in asia.
nevertheless the president firmly supported the new anticommunist government of south vietnam.
escalates involvement in south vietnam america channeled aid to south vietnam in different ways.
in 1954 the united states and seven other countries formed the southeast asia treaty organization seato.

were these strategists justified in their concern about the spread of communism.
1 interactive gallery the vietnam war era 548 9 1 the cold war and vietnam the united states provided economic and military aid to the south vietnamese government led by ngo dinh diem.
diem was an ardent nationalist and anticommunist.
although he lacked popular appeal his anticommunism guaranteed american support.
when it came time for the 1956 unification elections american intelligence analysts predicted that diem would lose to the more popular ho chi minh.
rather than risk losing diem refused to participate in the elections a move made with the support of the u s government.
impact of the communist insurgency by 1957 a communist rebel group in the south known as the national liberation front nlf had committed itself to undermining the diem government and uniting vietnam under a communist flag.
nlf guerrilla fighters called vietcong launched an insurgency in which they assassinated government officials and destroyed roads and bridges.
supplied by communists in north vietnam the vietcong employed surprise hit and run tactics to weaken diems hold on south vietnam.
diems own policies also weakened his position in south vietnam.
a devout roman catholic in an overwhelmingly buddhist nation diem did little to build a broad political base.
instead he signed anti buddhist legislation and refused to enact significant land reforms.
his lack of popular support hurt him in the civil war against north vietnam.
only the support of the united states kept the unpopular leader in power.
kennedy sends u s.
troops to vietnam after his election in 1960 president john f kennedy took a more aggressive stand against the communists in vietnam.
beginning in 1961 he sent special forces troops to south vietnam to advise the army of the republic of vietnam arvn on more effective ways to fight the communist forces.
by 1963 more than 15 000 american military personnel were fighting in vietnam.
although u s military personnel fought bravely and achieved some success diem continued to alienate south vietnamese citizens.
by late 1963 his regime was in shambles.
buddhists protested his restrictive policies occasionally by setting themselves on fire.
the kennedy administration eventually concluded that south vietnam needed new leadership.

he did not recognize subtle differences.
he also knew that the american people expected victory in vietnam.
reasons for escalating conflict in 1964 president johnson faced his first crisis in vietnam.
on august 2 north vietnamese torpedo boats fired on the american destroyer uss maddox as it patrolled the gulf of tonkin off the coast of north vietnam.
the maddox was not hit and it returned fire on the north vietnamese boat.
johnson promptly responded to the attack and to other north vietnamese provocations.
he announced that aggression by terror against peaceful villages of south vietnam has now been joined by open aggression on the high seas against the united states of america troubled by increasing strikes against an american ally johnson ordered an airstrike against north vietnam.
congress gives johnson broad military powers the president next asked congress to authorize the use of force to defend american troops.
with little debate and only two senators voting against it congress agreed to johnsons request and passed the gulf of tonkin resolution.
the resolution authorized the president to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the united states and to prevent further aggression the resolution gave johnson tremendous war powers.
it allowed him to commit u s troops to south vietnam and fight a war against north vietnam without ever going back to congress to ask for a declaration of war.
by authorizing the resolution congress had handed its war powers as expressed in the constitution to the executive branch.
this raised questions about the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government.

in response to a vietcong attack that killed american troops at pleiku johnson ordered the start of operation rolling thunder the first sustained bombing campaign against north vietnam.
johnson hoped that this new strategy of intensive bombing would convince north vietnam to stop reinforcing the vietcong in south vietnam.
the bombs caused widespread destruction but they failed to convince north vietnam to make peace.
as the communist forces continued to fight the united states committed more troops to battle them on the ground.
american soldiers moved beyond their advisory roles and assumed greater combat responsibilities while south vietnamese troops accepted a secondary more limited role in the war.
u s military and civilian leaders hoped that american airstrikes along with the troops on the ground would eventually force the communists to the peace table.

551 1 mcnamara and general william westmoreland the american commander in south vietnam.
these two advisors believed that the united states needed to increase its military presence in vietnam and do more of the fighting in order to win the war.
operation rolling thunder and increased troop commitments fulfilled this need to americanize the war effort.
beginning in march 1965 u s airstrikes hammered north vietnam and vietcong strong points in south vietnam.
between 1965 and 1973 american pilots dropped more than 6 million tons of bombs on enemy positions almost three times the tonnage dropped by all the combatants during world war ii.
in addition to conventional bombs american pilots dropped napalm and sprayed agent orange.
napalm is a jellied gasoline which was dropped in large canisters that exploded on impact covering large areas in flames.
it clung to anything it touched and was difficult to extinguish.
agent orange is an herbicide meant to kill plant life.
u s forces used it to defoliate forest areas that might conceal enemy fighters and to disrupt the enemys food supply.
almost half of south vietnams forested areas were sprayed at least once and the ecological impact was devastating.
there also may have been a hidden human cost as many scientists believe that agent orange causes cancers and other physical problems.

as airstrikes intensified american ground troops landed in south vietnam.
on march 8 1965 u s marines arrived to defend the airbase at da nang.
they were soon followed by other troops.
the soldiers accepted a wide range of missions.
some guarded bases.
others conducted search and destroy missions to kill as many vietcong guerrillas as they could.
helicopters ferried commandos to and from remote locations for quick strikes against enemy positions.
vietcong tactics and strategies large scale battles against vietcong or north vietnamese army units were not typical of americas strategy in vietnam.
american soldiers generally fought lightly armed vietcong guerrillas in small engagements.
ho chi minhs military doctrine hinged on fighting only when victory was assured which meant never fighting on his opponents terms.
he compared his troops to a tiger while the americans were like an elephant.
if the tiger stands still the elephant will crush it.
but if the tiger keeps moving and occasionally jumps on the elephant to take a bite out of it the elephant will slowly bleed to death.
during the war the vietcong behaved like hos tiger.
they traveled light often carrying just a rifle and a few handfuls of rice.

their strategy was to wear the americans down.
the leaders of north vietnam and the vietcong remained convinced that if they could just avoid losing the war the americans would eventually leave.
american casualties escalate american strategy during this stage of the war yielded limited results.
u s bombers did disrupt north vietnamese industry and slow the movement of supplies to the vietcong.
but when the communists did not sue for peace american troop commitments and battlefield deaths escalated rapidly.
by the end of 1965 there were 184 300 u s troops in vietnam and only 636 american soldiers had died in the war.
three years later there were more than 500 000 u s troops in vietnam and the number of american dead had risen to more than 30 000.
each year the war claimed more american lives and cost more american dollars.

americas mission was to help south vietnam build a stable noncommunist nation and thereby win the hearts and minds of its citizens.

yet from the outset they faced the dangers of vietnams battlefields with dedication and bravery.
new battlefield dangers and guerrilla warfare although american troops won numerous battles they could not win the war outright.
the problem was that the vietcong and north vietnamese avoided significant engagements.
rather than expose themselves to superior american firepower the communists employed guerrilla warfare tactics fighting smaller skirmishes where their small unit abilities and their knowledge of the landscape bettered their chances for victory.
u s forces often had no alternative but to fight indecisive battles in the jungles rice paddies and mountains of vietnam.
most of these battlefields abounded with natural cover.
clad in black clothing vietcong gunmen would spring out of the dense foliage attack with automatic rifles and grenades and disappear back into the landscape.
much of this fighting took place at night which reduced the effectiveness of american planes artillery and troop tactics.
american soldiers fulfill their duty despite the trials of war american soldiers adapted to adverse conditions in vietnam and fought with the same intensity that u s forces had shown in world wars i and ii.

about 10 000 american military women served in vietnam during the war.
most female military personnel were nurses.
not only did they face danger working close to the front but they also had to cope with the emotional toll of constantly working with injured and dying soldiers and civilians.

van devanter united states army nurse questioning the cause as the war lengthened many americans began to question u s involvement.
the earliest soldiers in vietnam had been volunteers men committed to the fight against communism.
but by the end of 1965 most american soldiers in vietnam had been drafted into military service and they were not as certain that preserving the government in south vietnam was crucial to american interests.
they sensed that many south vietnamese people were indifferent if not openly hostile to their own nation.
increasingly it seemed that americans were dying to defend a nation whose people were unwilling to die to defend themselves.
u describe what relatively successful tactic did north vietnamese and vietcong fighters employ against u s forces.
doubt grows on the home front the lack of progress toward victory in vietnam also led to doubt in the united states.
when president johnson had begun to send troops to war americans had expected a relatively quick victory.
after all the united states was a militarily powerful technologically advanced country and north vietnam was a poor country with comparatively little technology.
over the next few years the johnson administration kept asserting that an american victory was close at hand.
but when that did not come many began to question the presidents foreign policy.
impact of defense spending on the economy the war strained government finances.
president johnsons the vietnam war era 555 9 2 americas role escalates great society plan called for enormous domestic spending to eliminate poverty improve education and medical care and fight racial discrimination.
the costs of fighting a war on the other side of the world were just as mammoth.
although massive government spending lowered the unemployment rate it also led to rising prices and inflation.
the combination of heavy government spending rising prices and inflation forced johnson to raise taxes.
ultimately johnson had to cut back on his great society reform initiatives to help pay for the war.
an antiwar movement emerges as long as americas involvement in vietnam had been small and relatively inexpensive few politicians voiced serious opposition.
congress offered bipartisan support for the vietnam policies of johnsons predecessors.
soon after the gulf of tonkin resolution however congressional support began to waver over the presidents escalation of the war.
beginning in 1967 congress and eventually most of the nation divided into two camps hawks and doves.
the mostly conservative hawks supported johnsons war policy.
believing strongly in the containment of communism and the domino theory they accepted rising troop levels escalating costs and increasing numbers of battlefield deaths.
for the hawks vietnam was a crucial front in the cold war.
doves however broke with johnsons war policy.
a diverse group that included liberal politicians pacifists student radicals and civil rights leaders doves questioned the war on both moral and strategic grounds.
for them the conflict was a localized civil war not a vital cold war battleground.
senator j william fulbright chairman of the senate foreign relations committee emerged as the early leader of the doves in congress.
a democrat who had supported the gulf of tonkin resolution fulbright soon came to believe that the war in vietnam was a national civil war not a cold war conflict directed from moscow or beijing.
in 1967 and 1968 fulbright held public hearings on the war providing a platform for critics of the conflict.

protesting the draft by 1965 most of the troops sent to vietnam were no longer volunteers who had enlisted in the army.
instead they were draftees young men drafted into military service who had been assigned a tour in vietnam.
in accordance with the selective service act of 1948 the government drafted more than 1 5 million men into military service during the vietnam war.
all males had to register the draft when they turned 18 and the selective service system called up draftees based on projected military needs.

most of the 2 5 million men who served in vietnam came from working class and poor backgrounds.
during the johnson presidency the number of african american troops fighting and dying in vietnam was also disproportionately high.
at the beginning of the war african americans suffered more than 20 percent of the total combat deaths roughly twice the percentage of the u s population.
additionally african american soldiers were more likely to serve in combat positions and less likely to become commissioned officers.
civil rights leader martin luther king jr spoke out against the added war burden shouldered by african american soldiers.
speaking at a new york church in 1967 king said that the war was hurting both poor blacks and whites.
vietnam was drawing human and economic resources away from americas other wars on poverty and discrimination.
he added that it hindered poor americans in other more direct ways it was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinary high proportions relative to the rest of the population.

protests on college campuses across america college campuses became centers of antiwar sentiment.
professors and students criticized the war for a variety of reasons ranging from pacifism and the wars effects on the economy to a personal desire to avoid military service.
antiwar activity on college campuses did not however reflect the attitudes of all americans.
in fact many professors remained vocal in their defense of the war effort during lectures and at the vietnam war era 558 9 3 the antiwar movement protest rallies.
for the most part though colleges and universities were focal points of the strongest antiwar opinion.
antiwar activities were part of more significant changes taking place on college campuses.
never before the 1960s had so many americans entered colleges and universities.
between 1946 and 1970 the number of students enrolled in institutions of higher education increased from 2 million to 8 million.
many college students became a class unto themselves segregated from the workforce free from many adult responsibilities and encouraged by their professors to think critically.
many of the students who embraced the antiwar cause came from middle class families.
students from working class families were less likely to protest against the war.
the university of michigan and the university of california at berkeley became important hubs of the antiwar movement.
the students for a democratic society sds was founded in 1960 at the university of michigan.

in addition since the issue concerned rights for young people student activism played a key role in getting out the movements key message old enough to fight old enough to vote this idea was not exactly new.

widespread attacks in early 1968 u s officials anticipated a communist offensive.
as expected on january 21 the north vietnamese army hit khe sanh in northwest south vietnam.
however ten days later the communists expanded their attack by hitting u s and arvn positions throughout south vietnam.
the tet offensive named after the vietnamese lunar new year was a coordinated assault on 36 provincial capitals and 5 major cities as well as the u s embassy in saigon.
the communists planned to take and hold the cities until the urban population took up arms in their support.
they thought the tet offensive had a good chance of ending the war.
the fighting was fierce but in the end american and south vietnamese forces repelled the offensive and there was no popular uprising against the government of south vietnam.

and it still might not lead to victory.
clifford calling the war a bottomless pit concluded that the president should radically shift u s policy from one that pursued victory to one that pursued a negotiated peace.
johnson refuses to seek reelection while clifford deliberated many americans began to turn dramatically against the war.

robert geary may 20 1970 as the fighting continued in vietnam the american home front became its own physical and emotional battlefield.
the my lai massacre in 1971 two events increased the pressure on nixon to pull u s troops out of vietnam.
the first event had roots in a u s action in south vietnam three years earlier.
the vietnam war era 566 9 4 the wars end and effects on march 16 1968 american forces searching for enemy troops in an area with a strong vietcong presence came upon the village of my lai.
by this point in the war many american troops had been injured and killed by vietcong fighters posing as civilians.
it was a recipe for disaster at my lai where lieutenant william calleys unit began shooting and killing unarmed civilians.
during the assault u s soldiers killed between four and five hundred vietnamese.
lt calley later maintained that he was following orders but many of the soldiers present did not participate in the massacre.
at least one risked his own life to stop it.
the tragedy was made even worse by an inadequate military investigation of the incident.
life magazine eventually published disturbing photos taken during the event and in march 1971 a military court convicted lt calley of his participation in the attack.
news of the my lai massacre the coverup and calleys trial shocked many americans and added fuel to the burning antiwar fire.
the pentagon papers on the heels of my lai came the 1971 publication of the pentagon papers in the new york times.
the papers were a classified government history of americas involvement in vietnam.
the study was leaked to the times by one of its coauthors daniel ellsberg.
nixon tried to block the full publication but in new york times v united states the supreme court ruled against the administration.
the study revealed that american leaders involved the united states in vietnam without fully informing the american people and occasionally even lied to congress.
along with the invasion of cambodia the killings on college campuses and the my lai massacre the pentagon papers turned even more americans against the war.
fej check understanding why did the nixon administration try to stop publication of the pentagon papers.
the vietnam war ends the failings of vietnamization and growing dissent at home forced president nixon to search for some final way out of the conflict.
a 1971 public opinion poll revealed that two thirds of americans favored withdrawing american troops even if it meant a communist takeover of south vietnam.
sensitive to the public mood congress pressed nixon to bring the troops home.
many believed that to win reelection in 1972 he had to end the war.
american troops withdraw from vietnam in october 1972 the united states and north vietnam a photographer captured the terrible scene in the village of my lai where american troops killed civilians.
u s troops wait to return home after completing their tours in vietnam.
hypothesize what difficulties might be faced by soldiers returning from duty.
interactive gallery the vietnam war era 567 9 4 the wars end and effects came to terms on a peace settlement.
one month later with lasting peace almost at hand nixon easily defeated the antiwar democrat george mcgovern for reelection.
but nixons triumph was short lived.
the vietnamese peace fell apart when north vietnam refused to sign the agreement.
talks broke off but renewed american bombing in north vietnam finally induced the north vietnamese to resume negotiations.
at last in january 1973 the united states south vietnam north vietnam and the vietcong signed the paris peace accords.
the parties agreed to a ceasefire and a u s troop withdrawal from south vietnam.
pows would be exchanged but north vietnamese troops would remain in south vietnam.
the national liberation front vietcong would become a legitimate political party in south vietnam and south vietnam s noncommunist government would remain in power pending a political settlement.
with the war ended the last american troops came home.
among the returning soldiers were more than 550 pows most of whom were pilots shot down during the war.
the fall of saigon for the united states the war in vietnam was over.
for the vietnamese however it continued.
neither north nor south vietnam honored the cease fire or worked toward a diplomatic settlement of their differences.
in the spring of 1975 minor fighting escalated when north vietnam launched an offensive against the south.
without american aid and ground support the arvn was no match for the soviet supplied north vietnamese army.
by the end of april the communists had taken saigon.
after decades of fighting and millions of deaths vietnam was unified under one flag.
b recall did the paris peace accords bring an end to fighting in vietnam.
effects of the vietnam war more than 58 000 american soldiers gave their lives serving their country in vietnam another 300 000 were wounded.
although figures are not exact the vietnamese death toll most likely exceeded 2 million.
peace however did not mean the end of pain and hardship.
the end of the war created other problems in southeast asia.
the war also affected american attitudes toward world affairs.
southeast asia after the war many foreign policy experts in the united states had predicted that if north vietnam won the vietnamese civil war communism human cost of the vietnam war service unit fatality category vietnam war deaths 58 220 americans killed or missing 2 559 naw analyze data compare the total number of civilian casualties to the number of military casualties.
what do the totals tell you about the effects of modern warfare on civilian populations.
the vietnam war era 568 9 4 the wars end and effects would spread to other nations in southeast asia.
in a limited sense they were right.
communist regimes eventually came to power in both laos and cambodia.
in cambodia the ruling khmer rouge unleashed a genocide on the populace killing everyone who had ties to the west or previous cambodian governments.
between 1975 and 1979 upwards of 2 million cambodians were executed or died in labor camps.
in an expanded sense however many american foreign policy strategists misjudged the spread of communism.
they concluded it was a monolithic global movement controlled by moscow and beijing.
however as the wars aftermath would attest communist movements in southeast asia were nationalistic and intolerant of outside influences.
in 1978 vietnam invaded cambodia and installed a pro vietnamese government.
china supported the ousted khmer rouge.
for more than ten years that followed the u s supported a coalition of anti communist cambodian opposition groups that included the khmer rouge.
american veterans return home the war and the peace divided americans.
some argued that the united states should never have entered the war and that their leaders had lied to them.
others countered that the war was part of an ongoing struggle against communism and that in the end the united states betrayed south vietnam.
an unfortunate result of the controversy was that the nation never fully expressed its appreciation to the returning veterans.
overwhelmingly the 2 5 million enlisted men who served in vietnam did so with honor and distinction.
yet unlike the soldiers that returned to the united states after world wars i and ii the famed doughboys and g i.
joes few vietnam vets enjoyed the warmth and adulation of victory parades.
in addition to the indifference that some veterans encountered some also suffered from physical and psychological ailments for years when they returned home.
not until almost a decade after the end of the war did americans begin to fully honor the courage and sacrifice of these veterans.
the vietnam veterans memorial dedicated in washington d c in 1982 stands as an eloquent testament to the men and women who served and died in vietnam.
individuals of all races and genders served their country during the vietnam war.
there were countless actions of heroism and sacrifice some of which were singled out for the congressional medal of honor.
for example army sergeant peter c lemon fought off numerous enemy assaults even after being seriously wounded three times.
marine sergeant rodney m davis was one of an astounding number of soldiers who a veteran and his son visit the vietnam memorial in washington d c on this wall are the names of all military personnel who lost their lives in the war.
gave his life to save the lives of others by diving on a live grenade and absorbing the explosion.
green beret sergeant roy p benavidez was also decorated for his bravery in combat.
despite terrible injuries he rescued the lives of at least eight men.
for his outstanding gallantry he was awarded the nations highest military award the congressional medal of honor.
sergeant benavidez gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical straits to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds saved the lives of at least eight men.
his fearless personal leadership tenacious devotion to duty and extremely valorous actions in the face of overwhelming odds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect the utmost the vietnam war era 569 9 4 the wars end and effects i credit on him and the united states army.
citation congressional medal of honor sergeant roy p benavidez the impact on u s.
domestic and foreign policies the war was costly both monetarily and in the human toll of shattered lives.
the war also altered american domestic and foreign policies.
lyndon johnsons great society campaign against poverty and racism fell victim to the conflict.
increasingly between 1964 and 1968 johnson could not pay for both the vietnam war and the great society.
paying for more guns left less money to pay for textbooks school lunches and prenatal care.
additionally the war undermined americans trust in their leaders and fragmented the cold war consensus on foreign affairs.
in 1973 congress passed the war powers act.
the act restricted the presidents warmaking powers by requiring him to consult with congress within 48 hours of committing american forces to a foreign conflict.
the act was a congressional attempt to check the unilateral formation of american foreign policy and stop the growth of the imperial presidency the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1971.
draw conclusions why did the war focus attention on the voting age.
thus the vietnam war had an important impact on the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government.
with the gulf of tonkin resolution congress had years earlier granted the president a great deal of power to conduct war using all necessary measures without further legislative approval.
the war powers act was an attempt to regain some of that power from the executive branch and return it to the legislative branch.
ultimately the question of where war making power lies is a constitutional issue.
on one hand the constitution gives the power to declare war to congress.
on the other it makes the president commander in chief of the armed forces.
the vietnam war had an impact on america foreign policy as well.
the deaths and costs and ultimate failure of the war left many americans with war fatigue even those who had not been personally touched by the war had grown weary of the conflict.
this weariness of war became a social factor that would be reflected in the u s role in the world from the 1970s through 1990.
throughout this time american citizens would cite the vietnam war as a cautionary tale whenever the country considered using force abroad.
many americans would view conflicts in central america africa the balkans and the middle east through a lens tinted by the fear of another vietnam u analyze information what effect did the quagmire in vietnam have on u s foreign policy through 1990.
the impact on the american economy the united states spent about 738 billion in 2011 dollars to fight the vietnam war.
since that time the government has spent an additional 270 billion on benefits for veterans and their families.
these payments continue costing the federal government more than 20 billion every year.
therefore the vietnam war can be said to have cost the country more than 1 trillion and the price keeps going up.
this is a staggering amount of money and it has had an enormous impact on the american economy.
many economists view the spending on the vietnam war as marking the end of the prosperity of post world war ii america.
war spending meant war production and so american factories made military goods instead of consumer goods warping american industry.
although the relationships are complex war spending was a factor in federal budget deficits inflation higher interest rates and a weaker dollar.
interestingly this greatly increased amount of defense spending did not cut into the amount of money the nation spent on education.
by one estimate public school expenditures actually increased by 58 percent in the 1960s and 27 percent in the 1970s.
federal aid outlays to college students also increased between 1965 and 1975.

boomers parents had learned to live frugally through years of rationing during the depression and war.
as teens they had listened to big band music.
they generally valued loyalty and authority and respected the military and veterans.
many also married at a young age choosing to take on the responsibilties of a family.
as a result many in this so called silent generation sought stability by conforming.
their baby boomer children on the other hand rejected tradition and authority in favor of individuality.
do your own thing became the catchphrase of the young.
boomers did not want to fit in they wanted to stand out.
with the economic difficulties of the 1930s and 40s a distant memory boomers grew up in a time of prosperity for much of the nation.
many embraced political activism and opposed the vietnam war.
the boomer generation also expressed a distrust of tradition and authority which was expressed in popular magazines like mad.
rock and roll music shaped their worldview and set them apart from their parents who had grown up in a very different world.

the counterculture shapes a generation many people have used the so called trinity of the counterculture sex drugs and rock and roll to define the youth generation.
but the counterculture was also marked by an interest in spirituality.
a cultural revolution in the arts by the 1960s rock and roll had become a defining characteristic of the baby boom generation.

the beatles also had an impact on folk musicians like bob dylan whose protest songs highlighted the civil rights and peace movements.
as radical poet and activist john sinclair put it rock became a weapon of cultural revolution that urged listeners to reject conventions and in many cases the political policies of the government.
even after the counterculture had declined in significance rock music remained popular among baby boomers as well as their children.
the art and literature of the 1960s and 1970s also displayed a rebellious side.
andy warhols realistic paintings of ordinary grocery items such as campbells soup cans questioned traditional ideas of art and mocked the values of consumerism.
in literature the novels of tom wolfe and hunter s thompson blurred the lines between reporting and political activism.
experiments in living and the sexual revolution members of the counterculture rejected many traditional restrictions on sexual behavior in what became known as the sexual revolution they called for the enjoyment of sex for its own sake and often advocated new living members of the hog farm commune gather to prepare a meal.
living off the land they created a community of like minded people.
for example many hippies lived together in communes or small communities in which the people have common interests and share resources.
the sexual revolution was one of the strongest indicators of the generation gap.
one poll showed that nearly two thirds of all americans over the age of 30 opposed premarital sex whereas a majority of those under age 29 did not.
eventually however the sexual revolution led to a more open discussion of sex in the mainstream media.
impact of the hippie culture in san francisco in 1967 as many as 2 000 people flocked to the haight ashbury district of san francisco a center of the counterculture.
hippies there experimented with drugs wore unconventional clothing and listened to rock music and speeches by political radicals such as timothy leary a one time harvard researcher.
he preached that drugs could free the mind and he encouraged american youths to tune in turn on to drugs and drop out of mainstream society.
the hippies of san francisco attracted a great deal of media attention much of it critical of the lifestyles they advocated.
life in haight ashbury did lead to negative consequences.
as in other enclaves of hippie culture it experienced high rates of drug abuse that led to increased crime.
seeking new forms of spirituality some members of the counterculture sought spiritual enlightenment outside of the judeo christian traditions in which they had been raised.
many explored buddhism and other eastern religions while others sought spirituality by living in harmony with nature.
particularly in the late 1960s and early 1970s some hippies established rural communes seeking to live off the land as native americans had in the past.
these beliefs had a lasting impact on the budding environmental movement.
positive and negative effects of the counterculture by the end of the 1960s many people even those within the counterculture had become disillusioned with some of its excesses.
the utopian urge to discover a more authentic way of living had an unfortunate underside.
drug addictions and deaths from overdoses rose.
the hedonism and violence of rock and roll seemed to be having a negative effect as a number of rock musicians most famously jimi hendrix and janis joplin died of drug overdoses while only in their twenties.

key terms feminism betty friedan national organization for women now equal rights amendment era gloria steinem phyllis schlafly the womens rights movement a new feminist movement pushes for equality historians often refer to the women s movement of the 1960s and 1970s as the second wave of feminism or the theory of political social and economic equality of men and women.
the struggle for womens rights in the united states has had a long history going back at least to the 1840s when women drafted the declaration of sentiments at seneca falls new york.
the phrase second wave of feminism also reminds us that the first wave which culminated with women winning the right to vote in 1920 ended well before the nation addressed the call for full equality in the decades that followed women made little legal or social headway in the battle for equal rights.
in fact after world war ii most women gave up their jobs to returning servicemen and went back to their homes to take care of their families.
during the 1950s social analysts and popular culture portrayed women especially suburban housewives as the personification of americas achievement of the good life.
by the 1960s attitudes like these had begun to change.
pearson i realize access your digital lesson.
588 seeking to redefine traditional roles several factors influenced the rebirth of the womens movement in the 1960s and 1970s.
the civil rights struggle prompted women to look at the ways in which society judged and discriminated against them as a group.
as casey hayden and mary king two veterans of that movement put it sex and caste.
there seem to be many parallels that can be drawn between the treatment of negroes and the treatment of women in society as a whole hayden and king used the phrase jane crow to emphasize a link between racial and gender discrimination.
the civil rights movement both inspired women to demand gender equality and taught them how to achieve it.
it also brought black and white women together strengthening their shared cause.
women also wanted to redefine how they were viewed.
many women objected to the inaccuracy of the housewife stereotype.
some needed to work to support themselves or their families.
others wanted more opportunities than their lives as housewives could offer.
betty friedan powerfully articulated this message in her groundbreaking book the feminine mystique.
the problem lay buried unspoken for many years in the minds of american women.
it was a strange stirring a sense of dissatisfaction.
each suburban wife struggled with it alone.
as she made the beds shopped for groceries matched slipcover material ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children chauffeured cub scouts and brownies lay beside her husband at night she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question is this all betty friedan the feminine mystique 1963 fighting workplace discrimination despite the stereotypes the number of women in the workforce grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
yet working women often found themselves in dead end jobs.
regardless of the quality of their work women found it difficult to advance or even retain their positions.
pregnancy for example was all too often seen as grounds for dismissal or demotion.
in many cases pregnant women were routinely denied leave or forced to take unpaid leave.
even women with advanced training and education had their access to careers or advancement blocked in many cases by blatantly discriminatory employers.
sandra day oconnor who ultimately became the first female supreme court justice graduated near the top of her class at stanford law school in the early 1950s.
the 1960s and 1970s witnessed a broad based struggle for equal rights among women in the united states.
betty friedan president of the national organization for women now claimed that it was not simply men but society in general that kept women unequal.
an era of change 589 10 2 the womens rights movement yet while she found few employment opportunities upon graduation her male counterparts won job offers at prestigious law firms.
facing such restrictions women increasingly demanded equal treatment in the workplace.
b identify main ideas what was an essential goal of the feminist movement.
the role of womens civil rights organizations several years after she wrote the feminine mystique betty friedan helped establish the national organization for women now.
the organization which dedicated itself to winning true equality for all women and to attaining a full and equal partnership of the sexes galvanized the womens movement.
now works to expand rights through lobbying now was formed to compel the federal government to enforce the part of the civil rights act of 1964 that outlawed sex discrimination in employment.
the organization set out to break down barriers of discrimination in the workplace and in education.
it attacked stereotypes of women in the media and called in 1978 over 100 000 women marched in washington d c to demand that congress extend the deadline for ratification of the equal rights amendment.
for more balance in roles in marriages.
its major goal in the 1970s was to bring about passage of the equal rights amendment era an amendment to the constitution that would guarantee gender equality under the law.
the era initially had been proposed in the early 1920s but had never passed.
now also wanted to protect reproductive rights especially the right to an abortion.
now worked within the existing political system lobbying for political reforms and readying court cases to compel the government to enforce existing legislation that banned discrimination.
for some women now seemed too extreme for others it was not extreme enough.
still now served as a rallying point to promote equality for all women.
feminists raise societys awareness through different methods finding now too tame radical feminists sought a more fundamental restructuring of society.
rather than seeking legislative change these protesters sought to show the way society trapped women into adopting restrictive roles.
like the civil rights campaigners they adopted a variety of nonviolent methods.
in addition to public protests of the miss america pageant radical feminists engaged in small scale consciousness raising efforts.
other feminists sought to raise public awareness by making personal issues political.
charlotte bunch for example wrote that there is no private domain of a persons life that is not political and there is no political issue that is not ultimately personal some feminists like gloria steinem tried to change awareness through the mass media.
after graduating from college steinem worked as a freelance writer including a stint of undercover work at a club run by playboy magazine.
while society tended to view playboy bunnies in glamorous terms steinem revealed how much humiliation they had to endure to make a living.
in 1972 she helped co found ms a feminist magazine.
its title was meant to protest the social custom of identifying women by their marital status rather than as individuals.
phyllis schlafly and conservatives oppose the womens movement some americans both men and women openly challenged the womens movement.
phyllis schlafly for example is a conservative political activist who denounced womens liberation as a total assault on the family on marriage and on children she worked hard to defeat the era arguing that the act would compel women to fight in the military end sex segregated bathrooms and hurt the family.
her argument resonated with many conservatives.
due to conservative opposition the interactive timeline an era of change 590 10 2 the womens rights movement era fell three states short of becoming a constitutional amendment.
el recall what was the purpose of the proposed equal rights amendment.
the impact of the women s movement the womens movement affected all aspects of american society.
womens roles and opportunities expanded.
women gained legal rights that had been denied them.
and feminists sparked an important debate about equality that continues today.
yet the issues they raised continue to divide americans.
some say that women havent made enough gains.
others fear that the movement has actually harmed society.
achieving equality of political rights through litigation before the 1960s there were no federal laws prohibiting gender discrimination.
the civil rights act of 1964 however gave feminists a legal tool.
it included a clause called title vii that outlawed discrimination on the basis of sex.
the clause was actually inserted by civil rights opponents who thought it was so outlandish that it would make the entire bill look ridiculous.
when the bill actually passed however women used title vii to challenge discrimination.
the bill also set up the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to enforce the federal prohibition on job discrimination.
enforcing title vii even with the eeoc was often difficult.
still now and other feminist organizations tirelessly filed suits against employers who refused to hire women or to pay them fairly compelling the federal government to act.
president kennedy established the commission on the status of women in 1961 to examine workplace discrimination.
title ix of the higher education act of 1972 banned discrimination in education.
the equal credit opportunity act passed in 1974 made it illegal to deny credit to a woman just because of her gender.
title ix applied to many facets of educational opportunities but had an especially profound impact on collegiate athletics.
in effect title ix said that the ratio of women to men participating in collegiate athletics had to mirror the ratio of women to men enrolled in the school.
participation by women in college athletics has increased dramatically since 1972.
since then however the number of women coaches has decreased significantly.
as womens sports gained in popularity and became revenue generating sports male coaches the battle for womens rights took place in many venues.
in 1973 tennis player billie jean king demonstrated womens equality with men by defeating bobby riggs in the battle of the sexes.
as a result of title ix womens athletics increased dramatically in the 1980s.
many like the womens usa basketball team now dominate international competitions.
an era of change 591 10 2 the womens rights movement were drawn to these higher profile positions.
in 1972 the number of women coaching collegiate womens sports was over 90 percent.
by 2010 that number was down to approximately 42 percent.
this is one of the ways in which title ix created unintended consequences that have been difficult to counteract.
some feminists considered their most important legal victory to be the 1973 supreme court decision in roe v wade which assured women the right to legal abortions.
prior to roe most states outlawed or severely restricted abortion.
some women turned to illegal and often dangerous ways to end their pregnancies.
the case and its decision were highly controversial at the time and still are today.
expanding economic and employment opportunities the womens movement fostered a shift in attitudes among both men and women and the american workplace today reflects this change.
the percentage of women in the workforce has grown from about 30 percent in 1950 to more than 60 percent in 2000.
so too has the number of married female workers.
fields long closed or severely limited to women such as medicine law and accounting have opened up as well.
the general shift in attitudes symbolized by these changes has created a world of possibilities for many young women who never knew a time when women were not allowed to do these things.
despite these gains the average woman still earns less than the average man partly because many women continue to work in fields that pay less.
some people have referred to this situation as a pink collar ghetto whether this is because of discrimination or because women who shoulder family responsibilities often have limited job choices remains a matter of debate.
many studies suggest that a glass ceiling exists limiting the advancement of even the most highly educated and skilled women workers.
most troubling the united states has witnessed a feminization of poverty over the past 30 years.
this means that the majority of the nations poor people are single women.
these are the women in the lowest paying jobs with the fewest benefits.
many of these poor women are single mothers who must bear the costs and responsibilities of raising children alone while also working.

594 impact of legal and illegal immigration beginning in 1942 mexican immigrants came to the united states under the bracero or farmhand program.
this program granted mexican migrants temporary guest worker status and over a period of 25 years more than 4 million entered the united states.
the braceros played a crucial role in sustaining american agriculture during and after world war ii.
along with mexicans who had migrated to the united states illegally in search of work braceros who had outstayed their permits were targeted for deportation in the 1950s.
in 1965 however the government passed the immigration and nationality act amendments eliminating national origin quotas for immigrants.
in the decades that followed the number of legal mexican and asian immigrants surged.
more than 400 000 mexicans arrived during the 1960s another 630 000 in the 1970s and more than 1 5 million in the 1980s.
latino communities on the east coast after world war ii large numbers of puerto ricans dominicans and cubans migrated to the united states.
as citizens of a united states territory puerto ricans came legally leaving their homeland in search of better paying jobs.
in contrast most cuban and dominican immigrants came to america as political refugees fleeing their countries to escape the harsh rule of dictators.
most puerto rican cuban and dominican immigrants settled in urban areas especially in new york city and miami florida which had notable effects on the demographic patterns in these cities.

because they migrated from farm to farm and often from state to state to pick fruits and vegetables they were known as migrant farmworkers.
they labored for long hours in deplorable conditions with no benefits.
dolores huerta was another activist who shared cesar chavezs concerns about migrant farmworkers.
huerta worked as a leader of a community service organization in stockton california.
during this time she founded the agricultural workers association which organized voter registration drives and worked to improve hispanic neighborhoods.
in 1962 chavez and huerta organized a farmworkers union in delano california.
in the late 1960s chavez and huerta merged the union with a separate union of filipino farm laborers to form what became the united farm workers ufw.
committed to nonviolent tactics the ufw implemented a workers strike and consumer boycott of table grapes.
with the help of huerta chavezs top aide the ufw urged people across the nation to boycott california grapes in order to win recognition from the growers.

farmworkers finally had a legal basis to ask for better working conditions.
actions taken to improve economic educational and political opportunities while chavez focused on farmworkers rights a broader mexican american social and political effort grew which came to be known as the chicano movement.
part of it was dedicated to increasing latinos awareness of their history and culture.
the chicano mural movement in which mexican american culture was celebrated in large outdoor paintings sprang up at this time.
at california colleges and high schools and in other states with a mexican american population chicano students demanded that educators teach more about their heritage.
others in the movement focused on quality of life issues.
for example the national council of la raza was founded in 1968 with the goal of reducing poverty and discrimination and providing better opportunities for latinos.
much of the movements energy was concentrated on attaining political strength for latinos or what some called brown power in texas jose angel gutierrez organized the political party la raza unida.
the party worked for better housing and jobs and it successfully supported latino political candidates.
by 1980 six hispanics sat in congress representing districts from new york to california.
moreover hispanics gained greater representation in state county and city governments.
e2 identify central ideas why was the united farm workers ufw formed in the 1960s.
native americans and asian americans battle discrimination native americans had a long history of discrimination and suffered high rates of poverty unemployment and suicide.
inspired by the struggle for civil rights they forged their own protest movements in the 1960s and 1970s.
at the same time asian americans fought longstanding discrimination.
american indian civil rights organizations emerge as with the civil rights movement the movement demanding change for american indians was led by young people.
in 1961 the national indian youth council niyc formed with the goal of preserving native fishing rights in the northwest.
over time the group expanded its aims to include broad civil rights for native americans.
an era of change 596 10 3 expanding the push for equality in 1968 the chippewa activists dennis banks and george mitchell helped found the american indian movement aim.
at first aim focused on helping indians living in urban ghettos.
before long however aim was addressing all civil rights issues particularly the securing of land legal rights and self government for native americans.
activism leads to confrontation as indians dissatisfaction with the government grew their activism became more militant.
in late 1969 a group of american indians occupied the island of alcatraz the site of a federal prison in san francisco bay that had closed in 1963.
members of the sioux tribe asserted that the island belonged to them under a treaty provision granting them unused federal land.
about 100 american indians representing 50 tribes joined the occupation.
in spite of efforts by the coast guard and other federal authorities to evict them the indians maintained control of the island until mid 1971.
the 1970s saw another series of confrontations.
in 1972 led by dennis banks and russell means aim orchestrated a long march from san francisco to washington d c.
upon arriving in the capital they took control of the bureau of indian affairs building.
they temporarily renamed it the native american embassy suggesting native americans are treated as foreigners.
tragedy returns to wounded knee in 1970 dee brown published bury my heart at wounded knee which includes a chapter about the 1890 massacre of sioux at wounded knee south dakota.
brown noted that in all the history of the american west only occasionally was the voice of an indian heard and then more often than not it was recorded by the pen of a white man.
the indian was the dark menace of the myths and even if he had known how to write in english where would he have found a printer or a publisher.
the best selling book raised public consciousness about the historic mistreatment of native americans.
building on this momentum aim planned a dramatic confrontation at wounded knee.
in late february of 1973 aim took over the village and refused to leave until the government agreed to investigate the condition of reservation indians.
federal authorities put wounded knee under siege and russell means center and dennis banks right early leaders of the american indian movement aim brought the struggle for native americans rights to the public s attention.
interactive gallery two aim members died in the resulting gunfire.
the standoff ended in may when the government pledged to reexamine native treaty rights.
fighting discrimination through litigation several landmark cases in the 1940s paved the way for native americans to fight discrimination through litigation.
in 1947 the ninth circuit court of appeals upheld the decision in mendez v westminster ruling that the segregation of mexican american students in schools in california was unconstitutional.
the 1948 decision in delgado v bastrop i s d.
ended segregation in the texas public school system.
the ruling stated that the segregation of children of mexican descent in texas was illegal.
native american activism spurred the passage of several laws in the 1970s.
the indian self determination act of 1975 for instance fulfilled one of the main demands of the american indian movement by granting tribes greater control over resources and education on reservations.
native americans also continued to win legal battles to regain land mineral and water rights.
yet the protests staged by aim and other militant groups also provoked a political backlash with some contending that the federal government gave special treatment to american indians.
while politicians an era of change 597 10 3 expanding the push for equality debated how the government should treat native americans the indians themselves continued to suffer from disproportionately high rates of unemployment and other social ills.
asian americans fight discrimination prejudice against people of japanese and chinese ancestry who had come to the united states as laborers had long been part of the american social and economic climate.

activists win rights for consumers and the disabled in the same way that many activists worked to extend rights to women and minorities and to protect the environment others worked to protect the rights of consumers and americans with disabilities.
a new movement for consumer rights during the progressive era reformers had pushed for measures to protect consumers ranging from the pure food and drug act to the meat inspection act.
the consumer rights movement reemerged during the 1960s and 1970s.
it was led by ralph nader a lawyer who began to investigate whether flawed car designs led to increased traffic accidents and deaths.
his book unsafe at any speed 1965 attacked automakers whose thirst for profits produced unsafe vehicles that endangered the public.
naders best selling book stirred the nation and prompted congress to pass the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act in 1966.
among other things the act made safety belts standard equipment in all cars.
nader went on to form several consumer advocacy groups.

silent spring launches a movement coal smog is just one kind of toxic waste or poisonous byproduct of human activity.
another is acid rain or moisture in the air caused by the mixing of water with chemicals produced by the burning of fossil fuels.

when a fire erupted on the cuyahoga river in cleveland ohio in 1969 activists instantly spoke out.
the fire occurred when a spark ignited floating oil and debris byproducts of industrialization on the rivers surface.
time magazine reported that the river oozes rather than flows even more luridly the magazine remarked that in the cuyahoga a person does not drown but decays a grassroots movement creates earth day events like the cuyahoga river fire seemed to confirm the dire predictions of silent spring.
one response to growing environmental concerns was a nationwide protest called earth day.
wisconsin senator gaylord nelson who played the leading role in organizing the protest wanted to shake up the political establishment and force this issue the environment onto the national agenda on april 22 1970 close to 20 million americans took part in earth day events across the nation.
the yearly event attracted the support of many of the same people who had advocated civil and womens rights.
it was also backed by a number of grassroots groups including the sierra club founded by john muir in 1892 and the wilderness society established in 1935.
historically these groups had focused on conservation.
with the rise of the environmental movement however they called for broader environmental protections.
nixon creates government entities to manage the environment in 1969 president nixon declared that the 1970s must be the years when america pays its debts to the past by reclaiming the purity of its air its water and our living environment nixon had not come into office as an environmental activist.
but the publics increasing concern with protecting the environment convinced him to support environmental reforms.
under nixons leadership congress created the environmental protection agency epa in 1970.

on march 28 1979 the core of the nuclear reactor at three mile island outside harrisburg pennsylvania began to melt after the reactor malfunctioned.
when the plant threatened to release radioactive gas the governor declared a state of emergency and shut it down.
to reassure the public that plant managers had contained the accident president jimmy carter and his wife traveled to three mile island and toured the reactor.
even though the incident was contained and there proved to be no health risks it had profound effects on americas energy policy.
in the wake of the accident public opinion shifted against nuclear energy as americans became fearful of possible disasters.
the government temporarily stopped building new nuclear power plants.
even though it later lifted the ban no new american nuclear plants were ordered for more than a quarter of a century.
in the 2000s with the nation threatened by energy shortages many americans began to call for building new nuclear plants.
governmental actions challenge fifth amendment rights as more environmental regulations were passed opposition to them grew.
based on an understanding of the fifth amendment which holds that citizens shall not be deprived of property without due process of law many complained that environmental regulations stripped individuals the businesses they owned and the communities they lived in of their property rights by restricting what they could or could not do with their land.
some argued that private property owners would do a better job of protecting the environment than the government because the owners had an interest in preserving the profitability of their land.
many people and especially industry leaders also worried that too much environmental regulation would hamper business and jobs by diverting funds to cleaning up the air and water.

key terms henry kissinger realpolitik zhou enlai strategic arms limitation treaty salt i detente silent majority stagflation organization of petroleum exporting countries opec southern strategy affirmative action watergate twenty fifth amendment executive privilege the two sides of the nixon presidency nixons new approach to foreign policy nixons cold war foreign policy during his years in office richard nixon fundamentally reshaped the way the united states approached the world.
before nixon took office most american leaders shared a common cold war ideology.
they stressed that a basic conflict existed between democratic capitalist countries and totalitarian communist ones.
they divided the world into us and them and they established policies based on an assumption commonly held that the enemy of my enemy is my friend therefore a country opposed to communism was by this definition a friend of the united states.
in a number of ways nixon and henry kissinger his leading advisor on national security and international affairs altered this cold war policy approach.
at first glance richard nixon s partnership with henry kissinger seemed improbable.
nixon was a conservative california republican suspicious of the more liberal east coast republicans and exhausted with the political and strategic theories of ivy league intellectuals.
kissinger was a harvard educated jewish emigre from germany and access your digital lesson.
604 a prominent figure in east coast intellectual circles.
in several prior presidential campaigns kissinger had actually worked against nixon.
however both men were outsiders equipped with an outsiders readiness to question accepted orthodoxy.
kissinger and realpolitik in foreign affairs nixon and kissinger embraced the idea of realpolitik a german word meaning real politics according to realpolitik political goals should be defined by concrete national interests instead of abstract ideologies.
the two statesmen argued that if americans would put aside their cold war biases and look at the world with fresh eyes u s global interests could be surveyed not in black and white but in shades of gray.
for example china and the soviet union americas ideological enemies had the potential to become excellent trading partners.
at the same time west germany and japan americas ideological friends were fast developing into economic rivals.
nixon and kissinger also questioned some lingering cold war assumptions.
for instance they concluded that there was no united worldwide communist movement as lyndon johnson and other presidents had believed.
there were important differences between the unique ideologies of the soviet union and china and other communist countries such as yugoslavia north korea and north vietnam which often behaved quite independently.
as president nixon insisted on a flexible pragmatic foreign policy that avoided ideological absolutes.
e3 explain how did nixon and kissinger reshape americas approach to foreign affairs.
opening relations with china from his first days in office nixon seemed determined to leave his mark on the nations international affairs.
lyndon johnson focused primarily on domestic affairs the nuts and bolts of legislation and political deal making.
nixon was more a man of the world fascinated by global politics and shifting alliances.
johnson believed his great society would solidify his reputation as a great president.
in stark contrast nixon thought his reorientation of american foreign policy would cement his legacy in the annals of u s history.
reaching out to china youre not going to believe this a nixon aide told a journalist in 1969 but nixon wants to recognize china it was an odd almost unbelievable statement.
at the time the communist as head of the national security council 1969 1975 and as secretary of state 1973 1977 henry kissinger had a massive influence on american foreign policy.
in 1969 a parade in beijings tiananmen square celebrated the 20th anniversary of the founding of the peoples republic of china.
an era of change 605 10 5 the two sides of the nixon presidency peoples republic of china was the most populous country in the world but it was not officially recognized by the united states.
nor had it been admitted to the united nations.
the china that the united states recognized as the official representative body of the chinese people was the nationalist chinese government exiled on the island of taiwan.
nixon built his impressive career as a hard line cold warrior a vigilant opponent of communism.
he was the last politician americans could imagine to extend the olive branch of recognition and thus peace to the communists.
ever the political realist however nixon knew that the peoples republic of china could not be ignored forever.
he recognized that establishing diplomatic relations with the chinese communists would benefit the united states.
from an economic standpoint improved relations would bring significant trade agreements especially benefiting california and the pacific coast.
politically u s normalization would drive a wedge between china and the soviet union who had strayed from their traditional alliance and become rivals for territory and diplomatic influence.
finally if the united states forged stronger relations with the chinese they might pressure north vietnam to accept a negotiated peace to end the conflict still raging at the time.
normalizing u s china relations with so much to gain and so little to lose nixon quietly pushed ahead with his plans.
in public the chinese made symbolic overtures toward a meeting.
in april 1971 china invited an american table tennis team to play against its athletes.
this small action demonstrated chinas willingness to talk.
henry kissinger worked behind the scenes talking with chinese leaders and ironing out sensitive issues with premier zhou enlai.
then in july 1971 nixon announced that he would make an official state visit to china.
in february 1972 the president made the trip and toured the great wall the imperial palace and other historic sites.
nixon sat down for lengthy talks with zhou enlai and communist party chairman mao zedong.
he even learned enough chinese to make a toast in the language of his host country.
the visit was a great success and an important step toward normalizing diplomatic relations with china.
the following year american tourists started visiting and american companies set up a thriving trade with china.
nixons china trip was the high point of his presidency.
it bridged as zhou enlai said the vastest ocean in the world twenty five years of no communication in 1979 the united states and china established full diplomatic relations.

created a stronger front upset anti communist against the soviet threat american allies strengthened economic ties increased tensions temporarily between both countries between the united states lifted the 22 year ban on and the soviet union travel to china eventually created a rift formed stronger bond between the united states between east and west and and china over the political greater cultural exchange status of taiwan analyze charts based on the information in the chart why was nixons policy toward china likely to be supported by american businesses.

nixons policy of detente nixons trip to the peoples republic of china prompted an immediate reaction from the soviet union which had strained relations with both countries.
soviet leader leonid brezhnev feared that improved u s chinese relations would isolate russia.
therefore he invited nixon to visit moscow.
nixon made the trip in may 1972.
afterward the president reported to congress that he and brezhnev had reached agreements in a wide variety of areas recognizing the responsibility of the advanced industrial nations to set an example in combating mankinds common enemies the united states and the soviet union have agreed to cooperate in efforts to reduce pollution and enhance environmental quality.
we have agreed to work together in the.
conquest of cancer and heart disease.
richard nixon speech to congress june 1 1972 nixon also announced plans to conduct a joint u s soviet space mission.
however by far the high point of the summit was the signing of the first strategic arms limitation treaty.
otherwise known as salt i the treaty froze the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms and placed limits on antiballistic missiles abms but it did not alter the stockpiling of the more dangerous multiple independent reentry vehicles mirvs.
salt i did not end the arms race between the united states and the soviet union.
but it was a giant step in the right direction.
the importance of salt i stemmed first and foremost from u s and soviet efforts to reduce tensions between them.
a policy aimed at easing cold war tensions detente had replaced previous diplomatic efforts based on suspicion and distrust.
with his visits to china and the soviet union coming within six months of each other richard nixon dramatically altered americas global strategy.
he relaxed the nations inflexible stance toward communism and applied a more pragmatic approach to foreign policy.
in the short term the new relationships he forged helped the united states to end the vietnam war.
in the long term nixons foreign policy breakthroughs moved the world a step closer to the end of the cold war.
u explain how did salt i support nixons new policy for dealing with the soviet union.
nixons domestic policy having eased tensions with the nations two great cold war adversaries richard nixon stood at the summit of his long government career when he was reelected president in a landslide in november 1972.
yet less than two years later nixon left office in disgrace the first time a president of the united states had resigned.
the watergate scandal gripped the nation and shaped the values and attitudes toward government that many americans hold today.
nixons long political career richard nixons political career had more ups and downs than a roller coaster ride.
brought up in hard times he worked his way through college and law school.
after service in the navy during world war ii nixon was elected to the house of representatives in 1946 and then to the senate in 1950.
as dwight eisenhowers running mate in 1952 he became vice president with eisenhowers victory.

richard nixon displays his signature victory signal to supporters during a 1968 rally.
after he took office he proposed to establish new federalism that would restructure american government.
then came the defeats.
in 1960 nixon narrowly lost to john f kennedy in the race for the white house.
two years later nixons career hit bottom when he lost an election to become governor of california.
in 1968 however nixon made a dramatic comeback.
calling himself the new nixon he narrowly defeated democrat hubert humphrey to win the presidency.
nixons new federalism during the campaign for president nixon cast himself as the spokesperson for those he called middle americans or the silent majority.

serve in the government.
provide most of the soldiers.
and give life to the american dream winning the support of middle america proved a tricky task.
nixon believed that americans had tired of the big government of lyndon johnsons great society.
however he also believed that the american people still wanted the government to address various social ills ranging from crime to pollution.
nixons solution was to call for the establishment of a new federalism as he explained in his 1971 state of the union address the nation needed to reverse the flow of power and resources from the states and communities to washington and start power and resources flowing back from washington to the states and communities nixon proposed revenue sharing with the states.
under revenue sharing the federal government gave the states the money to fund social programs.
the states then controlled the operations of these programs.
increasing the size and role of government however while returning power and money to the states nixon also sponsored many programs that increased the size and role of the federal government.
during his presidency a number of powerful new federal agencies and laws came into existence.
the occupational safety and health administration osh a regulates workplaces to make them safer for workers.
the dea or drug enforcement administration administers the federal war against illegal drugs.
the environmental protection agency epa enforces federal environmental standards.
the clean air act signed into law in 1970 gives the epa the power to set air quality standards.

drug enforcement administration 1973 the dea provides a unified front against the global war on drugs.
at its inception the dea had a budget of 75 million with 1 470 special agents.
today these figures have risen to 2 02 billion and 5 000 special agents.
analyze charts based on the information in the table how did the creation of osha affect american workers.
proposed creating a family assistance plan fap which called for providing a guaranteed or minimum income to every american family.
although the fap did not become law federal spending on other social programs such as social security medicare and public housing grew steadily.
a 1970 reform added yearly cost of living increases to the checks of social security recipients.
in 1972 nixon signed legislation that increased the social security benefits of widows and widowers of retirees.
he also signed the largest expansion of medicare in the programs history.
the legislation extended medicare coverage to nearly 2 million americans under age 65 who were receiving social security disability payments.
the costs of these programs continues to rise prompting many to voice their concerns about the long term solvency of social security and medicare.
the struggling economy as his presidency progressed nixon grappled with an increasingly troublesome economy.
after decades of strong growth and low inflation the u s economy experienced both recession and inflation at the same time.
these symptoms began during the johnson administration but they grew stronger during the nixon years thanks partly to vietnam war defense spending under both administrations.
the combination of recession and inflation baffled economists and led them to coin a new term stagflation to describe the dual conditions of a stagnating economy and inflationary pressures.
stagflation had several causes.
expanding federal budget deficits caused by spending for the vietnam war produced inflation.
another cause was rising foreign competition which cost thousands of americans their jobs.
heavy industries such as steel and auto production which had enjoyed a dominant position since world war ii proved especially vulnerable to foreign competition.
yet the factor that caused most americans pain was the rapid increase in the price of oil.
in 1973 the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec a multinational organization that sells oil to other nations and cooperates to regulate the price and supply of oil raised oil prices by 70 percent.
then in october in response to the united states support of israel during the 1973 arab war against israel opecs arab members who had formed oapec organization of arab petroleum exporting countries placed an embargo on israels allies including the united states.
dependent on imports for nearly one third of their energy americans soon felt the sting of this embargo as oil prices skyrocketed 400 percent in a single year.
the embargo lasted until the spring of 1974 and resulted in gas lines at the pumps that stretched for blocks.
with the end of the embargo gas prices remained high.
an era of change 609 10 5 the two sides of the nixon presidency nixon fought stagflation in a variety of ways.
in august 1971 he ended the bretton woods system of monetary management in which other countries currencies were pegged to the u s dollar which in turn was pegged to a set amount of gold.
because this system was increasingly difficult to maintain and was unbalancing the u s economy nixon ended the convertibility between dollars and gold meaning that dollars were no longer tied to gold prices.
to fight stagflation nixon also placed a 90 day freeze on all wages and prices.
the controls worked for a short time causing a spurt of economic growth.
however price controls do not work well in a free economy and the economy went into a tailspin in the mid 1970s.
u identify what was the goal of president nixons new federalism.
nixons southern strategy having narrowly won the presidency in 1968 richard nixon set out to expand his base of support.
he targeted blue collar workers and southern whites both of whom had traditionally voted for democrats.
even before the election he nominated spiro agnew a relatively unknown governor from maryland to serve as his running mate in order to attract southern voters.
by winning the support of southern whites nixon hoped to make the republican party a powerful force in the south.
commentators called this nixons southern strategy.
as part of his southern strategy nixon tried to place a number of conservative southerners as judges in federal courts.
most prominently he nominated clement haynsworth and g harrold carswell to serve on the u s supreme court.
both men failed to win senate confirmation in part because both had supported segregation in the past.
the school busing controversy criticizing court ordered busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood was another way nixon reached out to southern whites and urban blue collar workers.
for years many school districts in both the south and the north had resisted desegregation.
in 1971 federal courts ordered school districts to bus students to achieve greater racial balance.
recognizing the unpopularity of busing nixon made a nationally televised address in which he called for a moratorium or freeze on court ordered busing.
by speaking forcefully nixon won the support of many busing opponents.

in 1969 the nixon administration initiated the philadelphia plan a program that required labor unions and federal contractors to submit goals and timetables for the hiring of minorities.
it was a type of affirmative action a policy that gives special consideration to women and minorities in the fields of education and employment in order to make up for past discrimination.

some of this popularity was based on his trips to the soviet union and china.
some was based on his domestic policies.
nixon ran a masterful political campaign in 1972 positioning himself as a moderate.
he portrayed his opponents george mcgovern an antiwar senator from south dakota and alabama governor george wallace as extremists.
wallaces campaign was cut short when he was shot and left paralyzed by a would be assassin.

the s botched burglary of democratic party headquarters at the watergate complex in june 1972 received little s attention at first.
but as investigators began to unravel i the connections between the burglars and the white house watergate as the scandal become known came to dominate the national news.
the watergate burglars were tried in 1973.

the two reporters followed tips provided by a secret government informant known as deep throat who was later revealed to be a top official of the fbi.
woodward and bernstein reported that the men who had attempted to burglarize the watergate hotel had close ties to nixons reelection committee.
nixon repeatedly proclaimed his innocence.
for example in november 1973 long after evidence had implicated his top aides and forced them to resign nixon declared i am not a crook yet the polls indicated that the public disagreed.
one poll taken the next month showed that fewer than one in five americans believed that he was being honest about the watergate affair.
the watergate scandal created a crisis in the relationship among the three branches of government.
how far would congress go to investigate the president.
would the courts demand that the president turn over information that might implicate him.
and if the courts sided with congress would the president comply with its decisions.
the limits of executive privilege the watergate scandal came to a climax with a dizzying array of developments.
in the fall of 1973 vice president spiro agnew resigned in the face of an unrelated corruption scandal.
according to the procedures established by the twenty fifth amendment which deals with presidential succession nixon nominated gerald ford to become his new vice president.
nixons troubles multiplied when in the summer of 1973 it was revealed that he had been secretly taping oval office conversations for many years.
many commentators speculated that these tapes would show that the president had played a leading role in trying to cover up the break in.
nixon refused to turn over these tapes to the special prosecutor investigating the scandal.
the president justified withholding the tapes by claiming executive privilege.
executive privilege is the principle that the president has the right to keep certain information confidential.
it took almost a year for the courts to sort out the matter.
on july 24 1974 in the case of united states v nixon the supreme court disagreed that the tapes fell under the principle of executive privilege and ordered nixon to turn them over.
chief justice warren burger made it clear that the court rejected nixons claim of executive privilege in this instance the expectation of a president to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence.

but this presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law the principle that all citizens are bound by the same laws.
the very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts within the framework of the rules of evidence.
supreme court united states v nixon 1974 nixon resigns when investigators listened to the tapes they found that crucial parts of the conversations were missing.
nixon claimed his secretary had mistakenly erased them.
still the tapes provided enough evidence of nixons involvement in the coverup to lead the judiciary committee of the house of representatives to vote to impeach the president.
the committee charged nixon with obstructing justice in the coverup of the watergate break in misuse of power and refusing to comply with house subpoenas.
a number of republican committee members joined the democrats in voting for impeachment.
recognizing that the full house of representatives would vote in favor of impeachment and that many republicans would vote to convict him in a trial in the senate nixon decided to resign.
in a speech to the american public on august 8 1974 nixon informed the nation that he would step down the following day in the hope that he will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in america the long ordeal of watergate had finally come to an end.
with it nixon became the first and only president to resign the presidency.
historians disagree about whether nixon knew beforehand of the decision to burglarize democratic party headquarters.
few doubt however that he took part in the coverup.
testimony by his top aides the watergate tapes and evidence gathered in the prosecution of the burglars all show that nixon sought to quash the investigation.
moreover investigations revealed that nixon had committed other abuses of presidential power.
his reelection team had engaged in dirty tricks to secure his election.
he had developed an enemies list on august 9 1974 richard nixon waved farewell as he prepared to leave the grounds of the white house after resigning as president of the united states.
and used federal agencies to go after his enemies.
the president had ordered the fbi to place wiretaps on the telephones of those government employees and reporters he suspected of leaking information unfavorable to the administration.
watergates lasting impact in pursuit of personal power richard nixon damaged the reputation of the presidency and shook the publics confidence in government.
one conservative commentator formerly a supporter of nixon echoed the disillusionment of many americans the lies the lies the lies.
what a pity what a pity.
here was a president who got us out of vietnam ended the draft.
and by his bold overtures to red china opened new avenues toward world peace.
now the good vanishes in the wreckage of the bad.
the swearing in of gerald ford cant come one hour too soon.
j kilpatrick national review august 30 1974 an era of change 10 5 the two sides of the nixon presidency polls revealed that from the late 1950s to the mid 1970s the percentage of americans who believed in the truth of government statements plummeted from 80 percent to 33 percent.
in the wake of watergate congress enacted numerous reforms to try to restore the publics confidence in government and to prevent abuses of power in the future.
it established a procedure for naming an independent counsel to investigate charges against the white house.
the federal election campaign act of 1974 sought to limit the amount of money that individuals could give candidates in order to prevent the corruption of the political process.
yet the watergate affair also demonstrated that the nation could weather such a crisis.
it showed the strength of the system of checks and balances.
both congress and the supreme court had successfully checked the power of the president.
according to time magazine nixons resignation represented an extraordinary triumph of the american system watergate demonstrated that no person not even a president is above the law.

these changes contributed to a growing sense among americans that something had gone wrong that the nation had gotten off the right track.
this sense of disquiet is even now a part of the nations political dialogue.
ford and carter struggle ford governs through difficult times gerald ford had been nixons vice president and became president when nixon resigned.
although only recently appointed as vice president following the resignation of nixons two term vice president spiro agnew ford brought a long record of public service to the presidency.
a star football player at the university of michigan ford enlisted in the united states navy and fought in world war ii.
following the war ford successfully ran for a seat in the u s congress where he served for 25 years rising to the position of house minority leader in 1965.
democrats as well as republicans supported fords nomination for vice president because he had a stellar reputation for hard work integrity and dependability.
ford stepped into a delicate situation when he became president after richard nixons resignation.
watergate had scarred the public s faith in government.
furthermore the nation struggled with the most severe economic problems it had faced since the depression.
ford wrestled with these problems but not very successfully.
he left office with the economy still suffering and the publics distrust of government still high.

president fords win or whip inflation now strategy called for a combination of personal saving and discipline coupled with government action to stabilize the economy.
pardoning nixon ford moved quickly to try to restore confidence in government.
he selected nelson rockefeller a former governor of new york state to serve as his vice president.
he also promised to continue the foreign policy approaches of the nixon administration.
whatever support he gained from these steps was lost when ford announced that he had pardoned or officially forgiven richard nixon for any crimes he may have committed as president.
though the pardon was meant to heal the nations wounds in some ways it achieved just the opposite.
ford s critics accused him of having made a secret deal promising nixon the pardon in exchange for the vice presidential nomination.
though ford strongly denied this his popularity declined dramatically.
the congressional election results of 1974 indicated the publics disapproval of the pardon and the impact of watergate in general.
the republicans lost 48 seats in the house of representatives including fords longtime district in grand rapids michigan.

the stagflation that plagued the nation during nixon s presidency continued under ford.
inflation hit double digits in 1974 and early 1975.

ford continues nixons foreign policies the ordeal of the vietnam war led many to question the direction of american foreign policy.
they asked why was the united states so concerned with fighting communism that it ended up supporting oppressive anticommunist governments.
should the united states continue to pursue detente with the soviets.
or should it instead demand that the soviet government grant its people more freedoms.
although the soviet union no longer exists similar debates over the relationship between foreign policy and human rights continue to be heard today.
an era of change 616 10 6 ford and carter struggle relations with the soviet union remained central to u s foreign policy during the ford administration.
upon assuming the presidency gerald ford made clear that his foreign policy would differ little from that of richard nixons.
he retained henry kissinger as his secretary of state and continued to pursue detente with the soviet union and china.
continuing to pursue detente ford and soviet leader leonid brezhnev met in late 1974 and again the next year when the two leaders endorsed the helsinki accords.
this document put the nations of europe on record in favor of human rights or the basic rights that every human being is entitled to have.
some thought that president ford would try to compel the soviet union to allow more political freedoms but ford decided to put arms control ahead of human rights.
at his direction the united states continued disarmament talks with the soviets.
these talks eventually led to an agreement known as salt ii in which the two nations pledged to limit nuclear arms production.
however the u s senate never ratified the treaty.
trouble in southeast asia under ford the united states sought to put the turmoil of the vietnam war behind it.
when the communist khmer rouge government of cambodia began a genocidal slaughter of civilians killing about 1 5 million people between 1975 and 1979 the united states did not intervene.
the main exception to this policy of noninvolvement came in may 1975 when the khmer rouge seized an american merchant ship the mayaguez which had been steaming just outside cambodian waters.
ford responded by sending in some united states marines who freed the ship.
south vietnam fell to north vietnam during fords presidency.
as the communists took over hundreds of thousands of vietnamese many of whom had worked with the united states tried to escape.
many refugees took to the seas in rickety unseaworthy boats.

over a 20 year period more than one million men women and children braved storms pirates and starvation in search of refuge abroad.
their immediate destinations were in other nations of southeast asia but many eventually found refuge in the united states and canada.
q describe how did ford deal with foreign policy challenges during his presidency.
the soviet union continued to limit its peoples freedoms.
alexander solzhenitsyn was expelled from the soviet union in 1974 for writing novels that exposed the harsh conditions in soviet labor camps.
hundreds of vietnamese refugees were stranded for months on the freighter tung an waiting for a country to give them permission to disembark.
an era of change 617 10 6 ford and carter struggle a new president faces challenges prior to the mid 1970s few americans outside georgia had ever heard of jimmy carter a one time governor of that state.
but on election day 1976 americans elected carter president of the united states.
he won a slim popular majority receiving slightly more than 50 percent of the vote to fords 48 percent.
in the electoral college carter won 297 votes compared to 240 for ford.
carters rise was the result of several factors.
most important was the turmoil of the 1960s and watergate which created a backlash against professional politicians.
carter seized this opportunity by casting himself as a fresh face a washington outsider with no ties to washington d c a born again christian who taught sunday school carter won the support of many christian fundamentalists people who believe in a strict literal interpretation of the bible as the foundation of the christian faith.
this group became increasingly involved in politics in the 1970s.
the cost of inexperience from the beginning of his presidency jimmy carter sought to portray himself as a citizens president he became the first president since william henry harrison to walk all the way from both during and after his presidency jimmy carter shown here with his mother portrayed himself as an average american and political outsider who could help clean up washington.
the capitol to the white house during the inaugural parade.
he held town meetings wore casual clothes and carried his own suitcase.
however carters inexperience which helped him get elected hurt him during the early days of his presidency.
as an outsider he did not have close ties with the democratic leadership in congress.
he also surrounded himself with aides whose experience in washington was limited.
carter submitted numerous bills to congress but few of them passed without major changes by his own party.
just one day after his inauguration carter fulfilled one of his campaign pledges by granting amnesty or political pardons to americans who had evaded the draft during the vietnam war.
carter hoped this act would help the nation move beyond the divisions caused by that war.
yet the war remained an emotional issue and many americans criticized the president for forgiving those who had refused to fight.
republican senator barry goldwater called the amnesty the most disgraceful thing that a president has ever done economic problems sap confidence like ford carter contended with the energy crisis and severe inflation.
inflation ate away at peoples savings raised the prices of necessities and made american goods more costly abroad.
the u s automobile industry long a symbol of the nations economic power became a symbol of its ills.
japanese car companies vastly expanded their sales in the united states by selling better built and more fuel efficient cars at reasonable prices.
the situation grew so bad that chrysler one of the three major american automobile companies needed a federal loan to survive.
at the center of the nations economic ills lay the ongoing energy crisis.
in 1973 a gallon of gas cost about 40 cents.
by the end of the decade it cost close to 1 20.
to make matters worse the winter of 1976 1977 was an especially bitter one in parts of the united states increasing the need for heating oil.
fuel shortages caused factory closings and business losses.
the 1979 oil crisis caused another spike in gas prices and inflation.
carter responded to the oil crisis by calling on americans to conserve and by asking congress to raise taxes on crude oil which he hoped would encourage conservation.
however the bill that finally passed in the senate had few of the presidents ideas in it.
critics saw this as one more example of carters poor leadership skills.
carter did implement several domestic policies that his successors would build on during the 1980s.
to fight inflation carter nominated paul volcker to head an era of change 618 10 6 ford and carter struggle carter s sanctions against the soviet union 1979 1980 responses to the soviet invasion of afghanistan asked the u s senate not to ratify salt ii imposed a grain embargo on the soviet union in 1980 called for a boycott of the 1980 summer olympics in moscow revoked export licenses for high technology items recalled the u s ambassador to the soviet union increased aid to afghan resistance fighters.
analyze charts what can you infer about the united states relationship with the soviet union during the carter administration.
the federal reserve board.
under volckers lead the federal reserve began raising interest rates.
in the long term this policy helped to bring an end to the inflation that had plagued the nation for so long.
the community reinvestment act which congress passed and carter signed into law in 1977 also helped address the nations economic woes.
in order to create economic opportunity for citizens this law required banks to make loans in the same neighborhoods where they took deposits.
this requirement enabled many low to moderate income americans especially ethnic minorities to become homeowners for the first time.
the law remains in effect today.
whether it has had unintended consequences possibly contributing to the mortgage crisis that triggered the great recession of 2007 to 2011 is an issue hotly debated in the business community.
e2 list what challenges did president carter face.
foreign policy changes under carter early in his presidency jimmy carter proclaimed that as much as possible american foreign policy would be guided by a concern for human rights.
carter hoped to make his foreign policy into a tool to end acts of political repression such as torture murder and imprisonment without trial.
this policy direction helped reaffirm the position of the united states as a nation of freedom and justice.
however it undercut the goal of better relations with the soviet union.
soviet american relations cool at first carter continued nixons and fords policies toward the soviet union.
he worked to achieve detente.
he continued efforts at arms control meeting with leonid brezhnev in june 1979 and signing the salt ii treaty.
however relations between the two superpowers soon took a decidedly frosty turn.
the salt ii treaty was bitterly debated in the united states senate where its opponents argued that it put the national security of the united states in jeopardy.
then in december 1979 the soviet union invaded the neighboring country of afghanistan to prop up a tottering communist government.
carter responded by withdrawing the salt ii treaty from senate consideration and by imposing sanctions or penalties on the soviets.
the sanctions included a u s boycott of the 1980 summer olympic games held in moscow as well as a suspension of grain sales to the soviet union.
attempts to protect human rights since the end of world war ii american presidents had tended to see the developing world the less developed nations of asia africa and latin america as another stage for the cold war.
carter broke with that approach and insisted that foreign policy toward the developing world should revolve around the expansion of human rights.
carter believed that u s relations with foreign countries should be determined by how a country treated its citizens.
carters emphasis on human rights led him to alter the u s relationship with a number of dictators.
in nicaragua the somoza family had ruled the country with an iron grip since the mid 1980s most of the time with the support of the united states.
in 1978 a leftist group known as the sandinistas began a an era of change 619 10 6 ford and carter struggle sandinistas celebrate on the streets of managua nicaraguas capital after their defeat of the dictator anastasio somoza and his troops in july 1979.
president carter helped to ease tensions in the middle east by inviting israeli prime minister menachem begin and egyptian president anwar sadat to camp david for peace talks in 1978 rebellion against the countrys ruler general anastasio somoza.
his brutal response to the rebellion helped convince carter to withdraw u s support.
without u s aid general somoza had to flee nicaragua and the sandinistas came to power.
other foreign policy initiatives in latin america the carter administration briefly sought to improve relations with communist cuba ruled by fidel castro since 1959.
u s cuban relations soured in 1980 however when castro announced that any cuban could leave the island from the port of mariel for the united states.
however castro insisted that any boats headed to the united states would also have to take criminals from cubas prisons.
because of this requirement the mariel boatlift developed a bad reputation in the eyes of many americans.
fewer than 20 percent of the people transported had spent time in prison and many of those were political prisoners.
still americans were repelled by castros lack of concern for the welfare of the emigrants and by the idea that he would send criminals to the united states.
carters most controversial foreign policy move involved his decision to return the panama canal zone to panama.
you will recall that in 1903 panama had given the united states control of a wide strip of land across the middle of the country that later became the site of the panama canal.
in 1977 carter negotiated a set of treaties to return the canal zone to panama by 1999.
many americans worried that the loss of control over the canal would threaten american shipping and security.
nonetheless the united states senate narrowly ratified the treaties in 1978 and all control of the canal was ultimately turned over to panama.
ki identify in what way did president carters policies differ from those of ford.
success and setback in the middle east carters greatest achievement in foreign policy came in the region that also saw his greatest setback.
he helped negotiate a historic peace agreement between israel and egypt but he failed to win the release of americans held hostage by iranian radicals.
the camp david accords egypt had opposed israels existence since israels founding in 1948.
as recently as 1973 egypt and syria had attacked israel.
by 1977 eager to improve relations egyptian president anwar an era of change 620 j 10 6 ford and carter struggle el sadat and israeli prime minister menachem begin met in jerusalem to negotiate a peace agreement.
to help continue the negotiations carter invited the two leaders to camp david the presidential retreat.
for nearly two weeks the three leaders carried on the difficult negotiations that produced what is known as the camp david accords.
these agreements provided the framework for a peace treaty in which egypt formally recognized the nation of israel becoming the first arab nation to do so.
in return israel withdrew its troops from the sinai peninsula which it had controlled since the 1967 war.
the preamble to the accords states after four wars during 30 years despite intensive human efforts the middle east which is the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of three great religions does not enjoy the blessings of peace.
israel and egypt recognize that for peace to endure it must involve all those who have been most deeply affected by the conflict.
they therefore agree that this framework as appropriate is intended by them to constitute a basis for peace not only between egypt and israel but also between israel and each of its other neighbors.
camp david accords september 19 1978 the iran hostage crisis carter hoped that the camp david accords would usher in a new era of cooperation in the middle east.
yet events in iran showed that troubles in the region were far from over.
since the 1950s the united states had supported the anticommunist rule of the shah or emperor of iran.
in the 1970s however opposition to the shah began to grow within iran.
anger toward the nation that had long propped up the shah s repressive regime the united states would soon boil over as well.
dying of cancer the shah fled iran in january 1979.
fundamentalist islamic clerics led by the ayatollah khomeini i yuh toh luh koh mayn ee took power.

a leader of the iranian revolution he became the supreme ruler of iran after the shah was overthrown.
interactive timeline americans as hostages.
the khomeini government took control of both the embassy and the hostages to defy the united states.
the hostage crisis consumed carters attention during the last year of his presidency.
to many americans his failure to win the hostages release was evidence of american weakness.
as peter bourne put it in his biography of jimmy carter because people felt that carter had not been tough enough in foreign policy some bunch of students could seize american diplomatic officials and hold them prisoner and thumb their nose at the united states the hostage crisis began to change the way americans viewed the world outside their borders.
nuclear war between the two superpowers was no longer the only threat to the united states.
although the cold war still concerned americans the threats posed by conflicts in the middle east threatened to become the greatest foreign policy challenge of the united states.
b describe how did the seizure of the u s embassy by iranian students affect americans view of the world.
an era of change 621 10 6 ford and carter struggle unease over changing values social and cultural changes that had begun in the 1950s and 1960s continued unabated in the 1970s.
as a result by the end of the decade the united states was a very different society from the one it had been a generation earlier.
these differences gave rise to an ongoing debate about the nation s values.
migration immigration and politics after world war ii there had been a demographic shift as american moved to the southern and western states in search of jobs and a better climate.
the migration of americans to the sunbelt and the continued growth of the suburbs both of which had begun in the post world war ii years continued during the 1970s.
as northern industries suffered many blue collar workers and their families moved from the rust belt states of the northeast and midwest to the sunbelt of the south and west.
they sought work in the oil fields of texas and oklahoma and in the defense plants of southern california the southwest and the northwest.
these changing demographic patterns changed the face of the united states.
the elections of richard nixon and jimmy carter demonstrated the growing political power of the sunbelt.
earlier in the century presidents tended to come from the large northern industrial states such as new york and ohio.
in the latter decades of the twentieth century presidents tended to come from the sunbelt.
the influx of immigrants from latin america and asia represented a different kind of demographic change.
even before the 1970s hundreds of thousands of cubans puerto ricans and mexicans had migrated to the united states in search of work and a better life.
this migration both legal and illegal especially from mexico and other latin american countries showed continued strength in the 1970s.
the growing power of the latino vote did not escape the notice of politicians.
richard nixon was the first presidential candidate to seriously court the spanish speaking vote.
countercultural styles spread in the me decade during the 1960s radicals had challenged many of society s traditional values.
they questioned restrictions on premarital sex and drug use.
they sported casual clothing and long hairstyles that many of their parents generation found improper.
yet the counterculture remained a relatively isolated phenomenon during the 1960s.

to some americans the new ways were a sign of troubled times.
some critics called the 1970s the me decade because many americans appeared to be absorbed with improving themselves.
this trend was reflected in the rise of movements like transcendental meditation tm a practice based in eastern religious ideas.
those who practiced tm sought to find inner relaxation and vitality by chanting their personal mantras for about half an hour twice a day.
the seventies also witnessed an increasing interest in personal fitness and health.
millions began to jog for exercise and to eat natural or less processed foods.
in 1970 just over 100 men and women ran in the new york city marathon.
ten years later more than 14 000 ran in the race.
body building took off too largely due to the influence of arnold schwarzenegger.
a charismatic personality schwarzenegger went on to become one of hollywood s most popular actors and later governor of california.
conservatives call for a return to traditional values the 1970s witnessed a resurgence of fundamentalist christianity partly as a response to the shift in values.
to some commentators it seemed as if the nation was experiencing another great awakening like the great religious movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
although the total number of americans who attended church on a regular basis did not change much the number of men and women who belonged to evangelical churches rose rapidly.
one in five americans considered himself or herself a religious fundamentalist by 1980.
religious conservatives firmly opposed many of the social changes begun in the 1960s that had gone mainstream in the 1970s.
they opposed the supreme court s rulings that legalized abortion and restricted prayer in school.
religious conservatives saw the latter as an unfair curtailment of religious freedom.
in 1972 however the court upheld religious freedom in wisconsin v yoder when it ruled that the state could not compel amish children to attend school beyond the eighth grade because doing so violated amish religious principles.
in opposing some supreme court rulings and what they believed were the negative effects of social change evangelical ministers used the media to gain a broader following.

ralph nader a third party candidate from the left of center green party also joined the presidential race in 2000.

690 the vote margin in the electoral college was razor thin.
although gore received a half million more votes than bush both fell short of winning the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency.
the issue was floridas 25 electoral votes.
the popular vote in florida was so close that a state law mandated an automatic statewide recount.
bush led by a margin of 537 popular votes.
he was awarded 271 electoral votes one more than was needed to win the election.
ralph nader received more than 97 000 votes in the state of florida.
if as many democrats believe the vast majority of votes for nader would have otherwise gone to gore then gore would have garnered floridas 25 electoral votes and won the presidency.
the supreme court steps in given the extreme closeness of the votes democrats demanded a hand recount in several florida counties.
republicans countered by suing in a miami court to prevent the recount.
for more than a month confusion reigned.
the election was now affecting the relationships among the legislative executive and judicial branches of government.

focus on education bushs other domestic priority was education.
he supported legislation that tied the federal funding of schools to academic achievement.
the 2002 no child left behind act penalized schools that did not reach federal performance standards.
it also called for improving teacher quality and other reforms.
bush also addressed the concerns of older americans who faced rising costs for prescription drugs.
in 2003 congress extended medicare to cover prescription drugs for senior citizens.
the measure was controversial.
it was expensive and many seniors found its provisions confusing and its coverage inadequate.
reforming entitlements in his inauguration address bush promised to reform social security and medicare the government run health plan for senior citizens.
together these programs account for about one third of the federal budget.
bush was concerned that because of a rapidly aging u s population and the rising cost of medicare these government programs would eventually become insolvent unless changes were made.
bush was able to make some progress on medicare with the medicare act of 2003.
but democratic opposition to social security reform thwarted bushs efforts.
on september 11 2001 the north tower of the world trade center left was already on fire when a second airliner crashed into the south tower right.
recall what two benefits did bush claim his tax cut would provide.
the september 11 2001 attacks and the war on terror as the first anniversary of bushs election victory approached the nation faced a number of important but typical problems.
no one was expecting a devastating attack that would stun the nation and usher in a new era in u s history.
shortly before 9 a m eastern time on september 11 2001 american airlines flight 11 slammed into the north tower of the world trade center in new york city.
soon another hijacked plane hit the world trade center.
just over an hour after the first crash the world trade center towers began to collapse spewing dust and debris over the city and trapping the hundreds of firefighters and police who had gone into the towers to rescue people.
as panicked people fled the area around the site stunned americans watched the horrific scenes unfold on their televisions.
these two crashes were not accidents but part of a carefully planned assault on the united states at 9 40 a m a third airliner that had been hijacked after leaving washington d c crashed into the pentagon.
meanwhile passengers on a fourth hijacked america in the twenty first century 692 12 2 the george w bush presidency plane learned of the earlier crashes on their cellphones.
they bravely stormed the cockpit refusing to allow the hijackers to target another building.
at 10 03 a m this fourth airliner crashed in a field near pittsburgh.
that same day it was confirmed that the al qaeda islamist terrorist group had spearheaded the attacks.
in time americans also learned that nearly 3 000 people had died as a result of the attacks on 9 11.
al qaedas campaign of terrorism the suddenness surprise and cruelty of the 9 11 attacks against thousands of defenseless people was unprecedented in american history.
however americans soon began to realize that the 9 11 attacks were the most destructive in a series of attacks that al qaeda had launched against the united states.
al qaeda led by osama bin laden the son of a wealthy businessman from saudi arabia was a terrorist group committed to an extreme form of islam.
one of its goals was to end all american involvement in muslim countries.
throughout the 1990s al qaeda had been targeting americans at home and abroad and in fact it had attempted to blow up the world trade center once before.
in 1993 it exploded a bomb at the site killing six people and injuring more than a thousand.
in 1998 the organization set off car bombs at american embassies in nairobi kenya and dar es salaam tanzania killing 225 people and injuring more than 5 500.
in 2000 al qaeda bombed the an american ship anchored off the coast of yemen killing 17 american sailors.
in 2001 al qaeda chose to attack the world trade center and the pentagon because these buildings represented american economic and military power.
americans responded to the 9 11 attacks as a unified determined people.
on the day of the attacks president bush addressed the nation today our fellow citizens our way of life and our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts.
thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil despicable acts of terror.
these acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat.
but they have failed.
terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings but they cannot touch the foundation of america.
these acts shatter steel in addition to the september 11 attacks in new york city hijackers crashed a plane into the pentagon in northern virginia taking the lives of more than one hundred government employees.
osama bin laden was a member of a wealthy saudi arabian family and a founder of the al qaeda terrorist network.
interactive gallery america in the twenty first century 693 12 2 the george w bush presidency but they cannot dent the steel of american resolve president george w bush september 11 2001 americans unite in troubling times americans were shocked by the 9 11 attacks but they rallied to defend their nation.
millions of americans rushed to donate money supplies services and their own blood.
throughout the country americans put up flags to show their patriotism and determination.
many held candlelight vigils and prayer services for the dead and bereaved.
continued fears of more terrorist attacks however kept the nation on edge.
in october 2001 a newspaper editor in florida died from an anthrax infection.
anthrax is a type of bacteria that has been used by several countries to create biological weapons.
traces of anthrax then appeared in news offices in new york city and in the office of a u s senator in washington.
two postal workers who had handled materials containing anthrax died.
although the fbi investigated no terrorists were caught.
the legacy of 9 11 september 11 2001 became a watershed in modern american history when flags lined a freeway overpass in california on september 11 2006 the fifth anniversary of the attacks.
identify cause and effect how does this photograph express the continuing impact of the september 11 attacks on american society.
americans confidence in their nations security was deeply shaken.
americans came together to grieve rebuild and decide how to deal with the threat of terrorism.
the name 9 11 quickly entered the national lexicon with people viewing historical events and even ideas as before 9 11 or after 9 11 the 9 11 attacks also had great impact on the nations economy.
despite increased airport security some americans remained wary of air travel which hurt the airline and travel industries.
businesses and households entered a period of uncertainty during which spending decreased.
estimates indicate that the attacks cost the economy one million jobs and reduced the countrys output by three percent.
the war on terror and the invasion of afghanistan president bush had been in office less than a year when these attacks occurred.
the al qaeda terrorist attack against the nation challenged the new president in unforeseen ways and led to a major shift in american foreign policy.
in the wake of september 11 bush and his advisers agreed that the most important priority should be finding and prosecuting the people behind 9 11.
this would be just the first step in what bush called the war on terror american government officials had determined that osama bin ladens al qaeda network had been behind the attacks.
bin laden opposed the presence of american troops in saudi arabia the u s economic boycott against iraq and u s support for israel.
bin laden and other al qaeda leaders were in afghanistan where the islamist taliban government allowed them to operate training camps for terrorists.
bush believed that any government that sponsored terrorism should be held accountable.
he demanded that the taliban turn bin laden over to u s custody.
when the taliban refused american forces joined by great britain invaded afghanistan.
allied forces quickly overthrew the taliban.
although american troops captured several of al qaedas leaders osama bin laden escaped.
ensuring national security bush moved quickly to prevent future terrorist attacks.
soon after september 11 congress passed the usa patriot act to give law enforcement broader powers to monitor suspected terrorists.
critics claimed that the usa patriot act violated civil liberties.
but many americans were willing to give up some freedoms in return for improved security.
congress also approved bushs call for the creation of a new cabinet level department of homeland security to coordinate security matters among federal state and local agencies.
the bush administration exercised broad powers fighting the war on terror.
the u s operations in merica in the twenty first century 694 s 12 2 the george w bush presidency afghanistan led to the capture of alleged members of the taliban and others fighting against the united states.
these prisoners were sent to a u s base located at guantanamo bay cuba.
many of these prisoners were held for years without formal charges brought against them.
controversy surrounded the holding of the prisoners mostly on the grounds that their detentions violated the writ of habeas corpus.
because of the constitutional issues raised by federal government policy changes the supreme court heard a series of cases dealing with this issue and the bush administrations use of military tribunals rather than civilian courts to prosecute enemy combatants.
in hamdan v rumsfeld the court ruled that the bush administrations use of military courts violated the geneva conventions and u s federal law including the u s.
uniform code of military justice.
war on terror moves to iraq bush next contemplated invading iraq as part of his wider war on terrorism.
many people believed that iraqi president saddam hussein was building nuclear biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction wmd.
despite many americans belief that un weapons inspectors should be allowed to continue their search for iraqi wmd congress authorized bush to use military force against iraq.
on march 19 2003 american and british military forces invaded iraq in operation iraqi freedom.
saddams forces collapsed almost immediately.
as the iraqi capital of baghdad fell saddam and other iraqi leaders went into hiding.
b recall why did the fourth hijacked plane not reach its target on 9 11.
bushs second term the iraq war terrorism and the federal budget deficit weighed heavily on americans minds as they voted in the 2004 presidential election.
bush campaigned as a war president saying he had proved his competency as commander in chief.
bush defeated the democratic candidate for president massachusetts senator john kerry by a comfortable margin.

problems surface in iraq iraq remained a major focus of bushs second term as the war raged on.
in baghdad iraqs capital city saddam husseins statue was torn down following the u s invasion in 2003.
interactive map however by late 2005 iraq had a new constitution and the beginnings of a democracy.
the following year saddam hussein was tried and executed.
saddams brutal rule had kept fighting in check among iraq s three major groups sunnis shia and kurds.
now these groups fought bitterly for power.
an american troop surge in 2007 lessened the violence.
however iraqs democracy remained fragile.
in 2008 a senate intelligence committee report determined that there was no credible evidence to support claims that iraq was developing wmd or had ties to terrorist groups.
some accused the bush administration of deliberately misleading congress and the american people to win support for the war.

just months after assuming the presidency in 2001 george w bush announced that the united states would not abide by the treaty.
the bush administration argued that the treaty did not place emission limits on developing countries and that it could harm the u s economy.

the financial crisis of 2008 during the autumn of 2008 americans faced a potentially disastrous economic crisis centered on the financial industry.
the crisis stemmed in part from subprime home mortgage loans that banks had made to less qualified low income borrowers.

the stimulus package included tax cuts aid to state and local governments and funds for infrastructure projects.
obamas appointments elected with the help of a coalition of minority voters women and young voters president obama sought to reflect the country s diversity in his cabinet appointments.
perhaps his most prominent appointment was that of hillary clinton his former democratic primary opponent.

in march 2010 in a dramatic vote the house approved the senate s healthcare bill.
despite unanimous republican opposition in the house and senate it was the most significant federal healthcare legislation since medicare was passed in 1965.
the bill the patient protection and affordable care act quickly became known as obamacare it extends coverage to the uninsured prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre existing medical conditions and provides subsidies to help low income earners buy insurance.
still many americans opposed the new plan.
they argued that it cost too much put too great a burden on small businesses and gave the federal government too much power.
iraq afghanistan and libya in august 2010 obama announced the american combat mission in iraq has ended when the final pull out took place in late 2011 more than 4 000 americans had been killed and more than 31 000 wounded.
during the american troop surge iraq was significantly more stable although acts of terrorism continued.
about 50 000 american troops remained behind in support roles.
some americans hoped that obamacare would quickly be repealed.
they felt it was not only too expensive but that its provisions went beyond the powers given to the government by the constitution.
interactive chart at the same time obama increased the american military presence in afghanistan.
american and allied troops had gone into afghanistan shortly after the 9 11 terrorist attacks but they had never rid the country of the taliban forces that had protected osama bin laden.
now obama asserted american forces would focus on the taliban in afghanistan and their allies in pakistan.
in may 2011 president obama announced the death of al qaeda leader osama bin laden.
in a secret operation lasting less than an hour navy seals raided a compound in pakistan and killed bin laden the mastermind behind the 9 11 terrorist attacks.
however americans were well aware that the death of bin laden did not end the threat of terrorism.
intelligence officers examined computer files and other evidence seized at bin ladens compound in the hopes that such materials would aid the continuing war on terrorism.
during the spring and summer of 2011 the united states also participated in an international coalition aiding the rebels who were fighting to overthrow the libyan dictator muammar al qaddafi.
qaddafi had long supported terrorist groups and was finally overthrown and executed by rebel fighters.
economic issues and reforms americas economic problems continued.
unemployment had risen throughout 2009 peaking at 10 2 percent.
although the economy had stabilized by the spring of 2010 sluggish economic growth and a high unemployment rate left many americans fearful about the future.
in july 2010 obama signed into law a sweeping financial reform bill aimed at changing the wall street practices that had contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
the new law increased federal oversight of banks hedge funds and other financial institutions.
it also created a consumer protection agency to oversee credit card rates bank fees mortgages and car loans.
critics argued however that the 2 300 page bill was too complex and too confusing to yield significant results.
they said it would tighten credit and lead to further economic woes.
the 2010 congresssional elections as the 2010 congressional elections approached the nation seemed increasingly divided.
while many americans supported president obama others were angered by his actions.
the strongest challenge came from the tea party movement which emerged during obamas first year in office.
the movement took its name from the boston tea party a colonial protest against british taxes.
the tea party movement was made up of many local groups united by a common desire to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.

although they ran as republicans they were not traditional party candidates.
they criticized many other republicans as big spenders and urged a phase out of programs such as social security and medicare.
in the 2010 elections more than 40 candidates endorsed by the tea party were elected to the house and senate.
republicans won back control of the house of representatives in the 2010 mid term elections.
leaders of the new republican controlled house announced that their first priority would be to repeal obamas healthcare bill.
meanwhile in the final months of 2010 congress passed a number of important measures including extensions of the bush tax cuts and an arms control treaty with russia.

elps obamas second term as the 2012 presidential election approached the nations economy remained a major concern.
continued economic worries led to political polarization and the established political parties were criticized by activists on the left and right.
on the right the tea party movement urged republicans to reduce taxation and the power of the federal government.
on the left critics from the occupy movement claimed that democracy was threatened by the accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of 1 percent of the population.
for several months in late 2011 and early 2012 the mainly young people of the occupy movement set up tented encampments in american cities to draw attention to their cause.
although the economic situation did not seem to be improving the obama administration received good news on another front.
in june 2012 the supreme court in national federation of independent business v sebelius granted obama a judicial victory by ruling that it was within congresss power to introduce most provisions of the affordable care act.
the ruling surprised many observers who were convinced that the act was unconstitutional.
the election of 2012 the democrats used the issue of income inequality in president obamas 2012 election campaign against the republican candidate mitt romney whom they portrayed as out of touch with ordinary people.
after a deeply divisive campaign romney was defeated by obama who received 51 1 percent of the popular vote and 332 electoral votes.
exit polls offered an insight into americas changing america in the twenty first century i 701 12 3 the barack obama presidency demographics obamas victory rested partly on a coalition of minority voters and the young.
with surveys showing a shrinking white population some suggested that the republican party would have to broaden its appeal to minority voters and young people in order to win future elections.
obama began his second term amidst a continuing economic recession at home and lingering military problems abroad his power weakened by a divided electorate.
many conservative voters still questioned the wisdom of his universal healthcare act and leadership in the war against terrorism.
continuing economic problems with an unemployment rate of just under eight percent and job creation lagging behind presidential expectations obama faced a difficult task.
the problems were significant.
america imported more than it exported creating an unfavorable balance of trade.
in addition there were charges and some evidence that the countrys economic competitors were guilty of unfavorable trade practices.
slow economic growth and failure to significantly reduce spending added to the woes.
although the stock market moved steadily upward so did gas prices home prices and overall consumer protesters march in front of chicagos federal building plaza during the government shutdown in 2013.
many citizens felt that congresss actions hurt the economic recovery.
yet democrats and republicans in congress showed little incentive to negotiate in order to pass effective legislation.
in the autumn of 2013 negotiations to raise the borrowing limit for the government stalled as republicans demanded a number of political concessions that democrats refused to give.
among these republican demands were a postponement of the affordable care act tax reform and energy deregulation.
as the parties could not agree on a budget bill to fund the government certain government services were forced to shut down temporarily.
foreign policy during obamas second term revolutions and civil wars in the middle east continued to challenge american policy.
although the scheduled pull out of american troops from iraq was completed in 2011 the country remains politically unstable and wracked by sectarian violence.
in afghanistan u s combat troops may leave at the end of 2014 but military personnel may remain in that country indefinitely.
meanwhile as civil war raged in syria the obama administration found itself in a difficult position wary of sending arms that might find their way into the hands of terrorists and reluctant to become involved in another war in the middle east.
tensions also remained high over irans nuclear program which many observers believe is intended to produce weapons rather than domestic energy.
in november 2013 president obama and other western leaders persuaded iran to accept an interim agreement to halt elements of its nuclear program and agree to weapons inspections in exchange for western nations lifting some sanctions against that country.
the boston marathon bombings the issue of americas involvement in the middle east was cited as the motive behind a horrific terrorist attack in boston.
on april 15 2013 two pressure cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the boston marathon.
the explosions transformed a day of celebration into grief as americans mourned the three people who were killed and the 264 who were injured.
authorities soon identified the bombers as two brothers islamist extremists upset by americas wars in iraq and afghanistan.
one of the brothers died as he fled from authorities.
police captured the other who was an american citizen.

over the centuries american protection of religious and personal freedom along with opportunities for social and economic mobility has attracted huge numbers of immigrants both legal and illegal.
such a steady flow of immigrants has ensured that american demographics are in a state of constant change.
over time however the nature of immigration has changed.
expanding immigration for years the government limited immigration to mainly northern and western europeans.
in the 1960s however laws began to relax immigration limitations.
the immigration act of 1990 increased quotas by 40 percent and eased most remaining restrictions.
as a result the period from the 1990s to the 2000s saw the largest numbers of immigrants in the country s history.
during that time almost one million immigrants arrived in america each year from all over the globe representing a wide variety of cultures and religions.
today immigrants account for more than 10 percent of the total american population.

704 latinos exert their influence most of the new immigrants were latinos.
in 2000 27 percent of the total immigrant population were mexicans with people from the caribbean and central america making up almost 17 percent.
mexicans and central americans settled largely in the south and southwest.
caribbean immigrants many of them cubans settled in florida.
the census of 2000 showed that a third or more of the residents of texas new mexico arizona and california were latinos.
like all immigrants latinos have varying educational and employment backgrounds.
often they are forced to take lower paying jobs with no healthcare benefits.
however latino immigrants have had a profound social cultural and political impact.
by 2001 latinos held about 5 000 political offices and 4 percent of the seats in congress primarily as democrats.
cuban americans in florida generally republican have had an enormous influence on american political policy concerning cuba.
the growing asian population asians make up the second largest source of the new immigration.
in 2000 they were nearly 23 percent of the total immigrant population with the largest numbers coming from china the philippines and india.
the majority of asian immigrants have settled in california adding to the large asian population in that state.
as a group asian immigrants have come from widely varying backgrounds but overall they have the highest level of education.
some came to america with college degrees and marketable skills and found professional jobs.
others came from war torn countries with very little education.
effects of immigration on american society immigration has long been debated in this country.
people who would restrict it worry that immigrants take jobs and social services away from native born americans.
they generally oppose bilingual education in which students are taught in their native languages as well as in english as they believe that immigrants should learn english in order to assimilate into american society.
proponents point out that immigrants contribute to the economy often by taking jobs no one else wants.
they also argue that with the u s birthrate falling immigrants help the country by maintaining its population.
much of the debate concerns illegal immigrants.
a large number of immigrants to the united states especially latinos have come illegally.
they labor in low paying jobs such as migrant farmwork and receive no benefits.
the goal of the immigration reform and control act of 1986 was to stop the flow of immigrants who were entering the country illegally by penalizing employers who hired them and by granting sources of immigration 2000 2010 analyze graphs given what youve learned about immigration during the early 20th century how have the sources of immigration to the u s changed over the last 100 years.
america in the twenty first century 705 12 4 americans look to the future resident status to those living in the united states since 1982.
but immigrants still regularly cross u s borders illegally.
how to treat these unauthorized workers is an ongoing debate.
in 2008 the bush administration proposed changes that would make it easier for farm employers to legally hire immigrant workers.
bush also proposed a process by which immigrants who entered illegally or whose visitation documents expired could eventually gain citizenship.
immigration reform became a significant political issue again in 2013.
a new comprehensive immigration reform bill brought before congress provided a conditional path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in the country.
it also provided money to secure the borders against future illegal immigration as well as strategies for fixing various aspects of visa programs.
but while the bill passed in the senate the house of representatives declined to vote on it.
house republicans were not in favor of the bill.
president obama continued in 2014 to call immigration reform a priority but prospects for the bills success were not good.
however as with so many other difficult issues that americans have faced throughout their history time will surely bring about some kind of resolution.
b generate explanations why do some americans oppose bilingual education.
american demographics in transition at the beginning of 2000 americans were on the move more than ever.
coastal cities as well as the sunbelt or the region of warm southern and southwestern states saw rapid population and economic growth as people left the cold northeast and the rust belt.
meanwhile the family itself was changing.
new and diverse families in 1960 more than 70 percent of american households were headed by a working father and a nonworking mother neither of whom had ever been divorced.
by 2000 fewer than 15 percent of households fit this model.

debating and challenging affirmative action in the 1960s president johnson introduced the idea of affirmative action or improving opportunities for women and minorities by giving preference to them in school admissions and job applications.
since that time affirmative action has been hotly debated.
proponents argue that without such initiatives minorities cannot overcome generations of discrimination.
opponents say that the policy is unfair and that one of its unintended consequences is that it discriminates against nonminorities.
in 1996 californians voted to end affirmative action in state hiring and education.
that same year a federal court struck down an affirmative action admissions program at the university of texas.
in 2003 however the supreme court decided in two cases involving the university of michigan that while race could not be the deciding factor in admissions it could be one of several factors.
one of these cases was grutter v bollinger in which it was decided that such considerations did not constitute a quota system.
in 2013 the supreme court allowed affirmative action to survive in college admissions fisher v university of texas but imposed a tough legal standard ruling that schools must prove that available workable race neutral alternatives are failing before race can be taken into account in admission decisions.
the case was sent back to a federal appeals court for review.
during this same session the court heard a case that tests whether voters can ban affirmative action programs through a referendum.
the successful referendum at issue in this case was passed in michigan in 2006 and it was a backlash to the university of michigan rulings in 2003.
expanding and protecting the rights of all americans social advocacy groups such as the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and the national organization for women now continued the fight to ensure african americans and women continued to make social and political gains.
by 2002 33 percent of african american families enjoyed incomes of at least 50 000 placing them in the middle class.
also in 2002 17 percent of african americans over the age of 25 held bachelors degrees.

outside of the world of work women have also achieved victories.
issues such as spouse abuse and date rape are now widely discussed.
incidents of violence against women are more often reported and more often punished than ever before.
the 1994 violence against women act increased federal resources to apprehend and prosecute men guilty of violent acts against women.
civil rights are also expanding for members of the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community lgbt helped by social and political advocacy organizations such as the human rights campaign the national gay and lesbian task force and lambda legal.
in 2011 the ban against openly gay service members in the u s military was lifted.
an increasing number of states and towns have passed laws against anti gay discrimination while many states now allow same sex couples to marry.
in 2013 a major supreme court case the united states v windsor resulted in the supreme court striking down part of a law that banned federal recognition of same sex marriages.
the ruling means that same sex couples who are married in states that allow gay marriage are now entitled to the same rights enjoyed by heterosexual married couples.
these rights include social security benefits hospital visitation rights healthcare benefits and military family benefits.

by 2000 older americans tended to retire earlier live longer and exert more political influence.
these factors have strained the countrys social welfare system especially social security and medicare.
in 1960 the federal government spent less than 100 billion on social welfare.
by 2013 the amount had increased to 1 9 trillion.
with the large baby boom generation reaching retirement age the issue of elder care has become critical.
falling birthrates over the past two decades have meant that when the huge population of baby boomers retires there will not be enough workers to cover their social security benefits.
politicians have been debating how to deal with this impending reality.
in his second term president bush called for privatizing social security by allowing younger workers to invest some of their earnings in individual retirement accounts.
critics defeated the measure saying that it would put younger workers at the mercy of fluctuating stock market returns without addressing the shortfall of funds.

briefly mentioning that the twelve warmest years in recorded history had occurred over the course of the previous fifteen years he focused on the problems of global warming last year temperatures in some areas of the ocean reached record highs and ice in the arctic shrank to its smallest size on record faster than most models had predicted it would.
these are facts.
president obama georgetown university june 25 2013 in his speech obama suggested that the answer to the problems rested in stronger federal environmental legislation including higher pollution standards and reducing the dumping of carbon pollution from the nations power plants.
ending his address he called on americans to stand up and speak out and to do what this moment demands his speech seems to call on both government entities and private citizens to manage the environment.
legislating to protect the environment in recent years environmental issues have aroused political controversy.

america in the twenty first century f 708 i 12 4 americans look to the future accepting global warming as fact deny that such warming is the product of human activity.
those who believe that human activity is the cause of global warming have urged the obama administration to move forcefully to pass environmental legislation.
but given the variety of opinion on environmental matters it is not surprising that the administrations policies have attracted plenty of opposition.
the main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nations industries.
regulations have been passed to control emissions from power plants prompting many coal industry officials to condemn the administration for waging a war on coal in 2013 a major battle was brewing as obama prepared to limit greenhouse gas emissions from existing utilities.
many republicans also criticized the presidents efforts to support renewable energy.
in recent years billions of dollars have been invested in the renewable energy industries although republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers money for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer solyndra.
environmental protection energy and the economy most americans including democratic and republican politicians agree that environmental protection is an important concern.
however environmental problems require a global response.
but how does one reach a global consensus.
populous countries such as china india and russia are largely immune to american calls for environmental protection.
nations that are developing economically have made little effort to improve air and water quality.
many point out that the destruction of the rain forest in brazil will have a potentially greater catastrophic impact on the planet than anything done or not done in the united states.
as the worlds population increases and living standards rise there is also mounting pressure on the physical environment and resources such as oil.
and as the human dependency on oil increases so do the possibilities of accidents.
throughout the world oil drilling has led to oil spills that have had devastating effects.
the 2010 deepwater horizon spill in the gulf of mexico often referred to as the bp oil spill created environmental problems in louisiana alabama mississippi and florida.
such spills are even more of a problem in more underdeveloped oil nations.
the deepwater horizon spill has helped intensify the controversy surrounding the keystone xl pipeline project which would transport crude oil from canada to the oil refineries of the gulf of mexico.
critics have condemned this project for its possible damage to the wind farms like this one near palm springs california can produce electricity without releasing harmful carbon based emissions although some claim such farms are dangerous to wildlife check understanding are there any negative aspects of wind power.
interactive gallery environment while the project s supporters promise that it will bring jobs and a reliable oil supply.
controversies like these will no doubt continue however as no economically viable alternative to oil has been discovered.
in fact scientists and engineers are busy developing other ways of extracting and transporting oil.
fracking or hydrofracturing has increased the amount of oil and gas extracted from the earth and in the united states has helped to reduce american dependency on imported oil.
it has had positive economic results.
so has the use of pipelines to move oil from one section of america or canada to another.
but the long range ecological impact of fracking is still under debate and the use of pipelines comes with the risk of spills and accidents.
in short the united states and the world face a delicate balancing act between the need to maintain the environment and the necessity of promoting the economy and boosting people s standard of living.
recycling and green architecture although controversies over energy use remain the environmental movement has achieved victories at a local level.
these have often focused on the strategy of reduce 7091 y 12 4 americans look to the future america in the twenty first century reuse recycle to conserve resources and decrease the amount of waste going into landfills.
state and local governments drive recycling efforts.
several states have a deposit policy on recyclable cans and glass bottles to encourage recycling.
in addition by 2011 more than 9 800 communities in the united states had curbside recycling programs and the united states recycled nearly 35 percent of its total trash.
the 2000s also saw a heightened interest in green architecture or architecture that integrates technology with environmental concerns to lesson the human impact on the environment.
green buildings might feature recycled materials increased insulation to cut down on heating and cooling energy use and alternative sources of energy such as solar or wind power.
for example in boston massachusetts a rooftop farm has been installed on top of the huge design center building beside the harbor.
a layer of rooftop soil in which crops grow also insulates the building.
the crops will be distributed to local stores where fresh produce is hard to come by.
as buildings become more energy efficient environmental groups are working to make cities healthier places to live.
after decades of urban decline american cities have become safer and more crops are grown on the top of this green building in the brooklyn navy yards in new york city.
the produce is sold to local restaurants and grocers and at farmers markets.
prosperous attracting new residents and businesses.
larger concentrations of population means less dependence on cars as more commuters walk or use public transportation.
parks are being restored and waterways cleaned.
in many places urban agriculture is taking off providing local residents with fresh produce.

what two things does the word stronger compare.
what does the word higher compare.
technology transforms life the united states continues to benefit from its free enterprise system which applies technological innovation in the marketplace.
digital technology in the form of cellphones laptops and tablet devices have all brought about rapid change in our way of life and have improved our standard of living.
the microchips that were developed for computers have become essential components of modern televisions cd players vcrs fax machines dishwashers refrigerators washing machines and hundreds of other appliances.
this technology helps to regulate traffic entertain millions of people and facilitate shopping through home shopping sites.
computers telephone and satellite communications have shaped the economic development of the united states.
technological innovation driven by the free enterprise system has changed all of our lives in countless ways.
it has also created new industries and employment opportunities at home while increasing the competitiveness of american products in world markets.
for example the dell corporation uses just in time inventory management an innovation that helps the company maintain lower inventories.
minimizing excess inventory helps businesses such as dell run more efficiently and be more responsive to market demands.
various technological and management innovations such as robotics and computer management allow american companies to produce high tech exports including computers pharmaceuticals electrical machinery and scientific instruments as well as products for the aerospace industry.
in the years to come americas renewable energy industry may surpass chinas.
the united states is now profiting from its solar wind and smart grid technology exports.

mobile technology connects america and the world a revolution in information technology is underway as technology transforms the ways we obtain information.
more and more people are getting their news online rather than through traditional print media such as newspapers and magazines.
this has led to major disruptions and transformations in the media industry.
the information revolution is not only limited to world news.
we can now access social media sites for information about friends or celebrities.
never in human history has so much information been so easily obtained.
meanwhile technology is also changing the way we gain access to entertainment.
music movies and television shows can be retrieved in seconds on a personal computer linked to the internet or with a smart phone.
at times it seems as if streaming videos and podcasts are helping the internet replace television as our main entertainment machine.
but the internet is also spreading that entertainment wider than television ever could by making american culture accessible to much of the worlds population.
through films and videos american freedoms and economic opportunities are being broadcast to a growing audience worldwide.
this trend is not without its dangers as it has provoked violent reactions from radical groups who fear that local culture and traditions are being overwhelmed by american political and social ideals.
the american civic values of religious tolerance respect for diversity and freedom of speech are particularly threatening to extremists worldwide.
many foreign governments are also alarmed by this diffusion of american culture.
but the open nature of the internet has made it difficult for authoritarian regimes to block the flow of information.
as american culture continues to be broadcast throughout the world via various media people abroad are inspired by the example of individuals who have made important political social and economic contributions to society.
one of these is oprah winfrey the influential television host.
although winfrey was born into poverty in mississippi she overcame the trauma and hardships of her early life to become a world famous talk show host and producer.
she is now a billionaire philanthropist social leader and role model for people everywhere who long to improve their lives and the lives of others.

just as american high tech research has made the country the leader in computer and other digital technology american research and development laboratories have ensured that the country remains on the cutting edge of medical and scientific innovation.
no country spends more on medical research and none has introduced more advances in the field.
in particular new research in genetics is opening up promising new possibilities for the treatment of cancer and other ailments.
genetic research will lead to safer pharmaceutical drugs.
today americans have a wider range of medical options than ever before.
from heart kidney and other organ transplants to microsurgery using micro video and fiber optic cameras american advanced medical treatment is the envy of the world.
in addition such american companies as johnson johnson merck eli lilly and pfizer have ensured that the united states leads the world in pharmaceutical innovation.
concerns and hopes americans today are concerned about jobs and the solvency of long term entitlement programs such as social security and medicare in addition the nation is passing through a confusing time of rapid technological change.
the revolution in digital and information technologies is america in the twenty first century 711 12 4 americans look to the future comparable to the earlier industrial revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
these eras of change were characterized by disruption anxiety and fears but also by hopes and opportunities.
americans today are particularly worried about changing patterns of employment and the growing strength of economic competitors.
but the shifting ground is also providing new perspectives and opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship activities that have always stood the nation in good stead.
throughout the countrys history americas resourcefulness and initiative have always been one of its greatest strengths.
the american ethos or character is made up of many other strengths that will continue to guarantee success in these changing times.
u s citizens whatever their origins or ancestry hold a common bond in standing for certain self evident truths.
in a world torn apart by sectarian strife americas great advantage lies in its religious and ethnic diversity and tolerance and in its concept of a nation based not on a single monolithic religious or ethnic identity but on civic virtues and ideals.
these virtues and ideals are the foundation of the republic.
in contrast to many other countries whose governments retain power through brutal political repression the american political system provides a unique advantage.
american representative democracy allows great flexibility to decide what policies to adopt or when to change political course.
unlike more authoritarian political systems where only one party or group remains in control america is open to diversity of thought and action and to peaceful political change.
we the people have the civic and patriotic responsibility to participate in this democratic process and the commitment to political education and voting is a reflection of this patriotism.
in a very real sense americans work together to make a more perfect union these are the civic ideals that will continue to ensure success in a changing world.

638 liberalisms ideas and goals in the late 1970s liberals tended to believe that the federal government should play a significant role in improving the lives of all americans.
they valued social programs that helped the poor unemployed elderly and others.
they also sponsored laws that protected the rights of minorities and women especially in the post world war ii period.
they supported greater government regulation of industry.
in the foreign policy realm liberals tended to favor cooperating with international organizations like the united nations.
conservatisms ideas and goals in contrast some conservatives felt that a large central government endangered economic growth and individual choice.
they felt the liberal policies of the 1960s and 1970s left a legacy of rising inflation and enormous waste.
furthermore some conservatives criticized the liberal solution of throwing money at social problems.
they sought to reduce taxes and limit government regulation of industry in order to promote economic growth.

what produced this miracle.
clearly not central direction by government other conservatives neoconservatives or traditionalists warned about the dangers posed to society by abandoning traditional values in favor of the new freedoms exemplified by the counterculture and advertised by the mass media.

anticommunism formed the third leg of modern conservatism.

however during the 1960s and 1970s many republicans became increasingly critical of the liberal policies of the democrats.
they advanced a new conservative agenda.

1 interactive chart j america in the 1980s and 1990s 639 11 1 the conservative movement surges the decline of liberalism one reason for the revival of the republican party was the unraveling of the democratic party.
the vietnam war and urban riots of the 1960s divided the same people who had rallied around president johnsons vision of the great society.
the rise of the counterculture alienated many midwestern americans and white conservative christians in the south.
feminist advances were opposed by social leaders like phyllis schlafly.
watergate the oil crises of the 1970s and the iran hostage crisis further weakened the publics faith in the federal government.
just as importantly the shifts in the economy of the 1970s including the decline in northern industries dampened americas optimism about the future.
america had supported the great society in part because johnson had suggested that the war on poverty and other new programs would not demand higher taxes.
when the economy stagnated liberal ideas lost their pull and conservative beliefs became more attractive.
criticizing liberal programs many conservatives believed that liberal policies were responsible for stagflation and other economic problems of the late 1970s.
they believed that the government taxed citizens and businesses too heavily and spent too much on the wrong programs.
they complained about unfunded mandates programs required but not paid for by the federal government.
some conservatives also criticized federal welfare programs arguing that they rewarded lack of effort.
furthermore they thought that great society programs did not work and that these programs had made the problem of poverty worse not better.
they pointed to other unintended consequences of such programs.
for example they charged that welfare contributed to the rise in the number of children born out of wedlock and therefore encouraged the decline of the traditional family consisting of a married father and mother and their children.
they also felt that affirmative action programs went too far and contributed to reverse discrimination.
another group that supported the conservative platform was the sagebrush rebels sagebrush rebels were activists who believed that the federal government controlled too much land in western states.
they thought the federal government should give control of this land to the states to be used to their best economic advantage.
most environmentalists opposed the movement because they did not want to expose preserved lands to possible development.
the religious right emerges at the same time concern with cultural change caused more religious groups to become actively involved in politics.

america in the 1980s and 1990s 640 11 1 the conservative movement surges in 1979 was a political organization working to fulfill religious goals.
it also worried about the decline of the traditional family.
the moral majority opposed the 1962 supreme court decision engel v vitale which forbade government written prayers in public schools as well as the historic 1973 roe v wade decision which legalized abortion.
it also condemned the equal rights amendment and gay rights.
the moral majority boosted the republican partys chances of winning the presidency by reaching out to americans who had traditionally not participated in the political process.
with other groups like it the moral majority registered at least 2 million new voters before the 1980 presidential election.
one of their tactics was to distribute moral majority report cards on candidates which almost always favored republicans.
changing demographic patterns boost conservatism demographic or population trends also strengthened the conservative movement.
historically northern cities stood as strongholds of liberal democrats.
when an increasing number of americans moved to the suburbs their attachment to liberalism waned as they struggled financially during the tough economic days of the late 1970s.
at the same time republicans emphasized issues that they believed would convince moderate liberals to switch their party allegiance.
for instance republicans attacked school busing as a form of social engineering that threatened the long cherished ideal of neighborhood schools.
republicans benefited from the migration of americans from the rust belt to the sunbelt.
this demographic shift which began in the 1950s and continued through the 1970s had many causes including the sunny climate and opportunities for jobs in aerospace technology and other growing industries.
republicans also benefited from a historical realignment of white voters in the deep south.
since the civil war most white southerners had voted for the democratic party.
following the enactment of civil rights legislation in the mid 1960s however many white southerners began to shift their party allegiance.
the effect of these shifts in demographics and voter loyalties was that by the 1980s the republicans had become the dominant political party in the south.
recall why did the moral majority oppose the 1962 supreme court engel v vitale decision.
ronald reagan shown here in a 1951 hollywood studio shot originally supported new deal policies.

in 1964 near the end of goldwater s presidential campaign reagan delivered a nationally televised address in which he spelled out these views this is the issue of this election whether we believe in our capacity for self government or whether we abandon the american revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves ronald reagan a time for choosing 1964 while the speech failed to bolster goldwaters campaign it won the admiration of many conservatives.
two years later reagan won the governorship of california.
he served for two terms as governor and nearly won the republican presidential nomination in 1976.
in 1980 he won the nomination by a landslide.
his opponent was jimmy carter the democratic incumbent.
inflation the iran hostage crisis and the soviet invasion of afghanistan made it easy for reagan to cast the carter presidency in a negative light.

evaluate the steps taken to address various issues in the 1980s and early 1990s.
key terms supply side economics deregulation budget deficit national debt savings and loan crisis voucher acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids sandra day oconnor a new direction for the american economy tax cuts and deregulation reagan and his advisors based their economic policies on the theory of supply side economics sometimes called reaganomics the theory of supply side economics rests on the assumption that if taxes are reduced the wealthy would invest more and thus create jobs.
the new jobs would give people more money to spend causing the economy to grow.
the government will then collect more in taxes.
to cut taxes while still balancing the federal budget however reagan also needed to reduce federal spending on programs favored by both democrats and republicans.
congress approved most of reagans plan to institute supply side economics by passing the economic recovery act of 1981 which reduced taxes by 23 percent over three years.
the richest americans received the largest tax cuts.
reagan justified this move by saying that the wealthy would use the money they saved to invest in new businesses which would help everyone.
reagan also convinced congress to cut about 40 billion from the federal budget mostly by cutting spending for social programs.
access your digital lesson.
pearson 1 realize 644 in addition to cutting taxes reagan also reduced the governments role in the economy by calling for deregulation or the removal of government control over industry.
by the mid 1980s congress had deregulated the airline telecommunications and banking industries.
the reagan administration also cut funding for federal agencies that oversaw many other industries.
significant societal issues shortly after reagan took office the economy experienced a severe recession from 1980 to 1982.
unemployment rose to more than 10 percent in 1982.
the recession hit blue collar workers particularly hard.
many farmers facing overseas competition lost their farms.
the policies that paul volcker as head of the federal reserve board had introduced to tame the great inflation of the 1970s contributed to the recession in the early 1980s.
beginning in early 1983 however the economy began to turn around.
inflation fell dramatically.
the gross national product or the annual income earned by americans and american businesses expanded at a healthy pace.
america s economy seemed revitalized.
despite this the number of poor people including the working poor actually increased.
in addition immigrants from latin america and asia attracted by employment prospects and political freedom continued to pour into the united states.
among the asian immigrants were the sikhs a religious group that originated in the punjab a region in pakistan and northern india.
in the 1980s more than 7 3 million legal immigrants and hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants entered the country.
many of these newcomers worked in low paying jobs and struggled to make ends meet.
meanwhile the richest americans grew richer.
in texas tensions from this economic disparity reached a head in 1984 when a poor largely mexican american school system sued the state commissioner of education over inequalities in the education of minorities.
after a nearly 10 year struggle the case edgewood i s d.
v kirby led to a school funding system where some tax money from more affluent largely white school districts was transferred to less affluent largely minority districts to help these poor districts provide better education to their students.
problems with deficits reagan increased defense spending but failed to win the huge cuts in government spending that he wanted in other areas.
these were some of the factors along with a recession that caused the federal budget deficit or the shortfall between the amount of money spent and the amount taken in by the government to skyrocket from about 79 billion in 1981 to more than 221 billion in 1986.

ruiasamisn america in the 1980s and 1990s 645 11 2 the reagan era the amount of money the federal government owes to owners of government bonds rose to 2 5 trillion.
in response to persistent budget deficits congress passed the gramm rudman hollings act in 1985.
the act sought to balance the budget by 1990 by requiring automatic cuts in federal spending if the deficit exceeded a certain amount.
the federal budget deficit set new records however into the early 1990s.
the savings and loan crisis also called the s l crisis in 1989 exacerbated deficit problems.
in the late 1980s about 1 000 savings and loan banks failed some because of fraudulent behavior and others because they made too many risky loans.
critics blamed reagans deregulation policies for encouraging the banks to invest in riskier propositions.
to prevent a broader panic the federal government spent upwards of 200 billion to bail out depositors at the failed banks.
in the 1980s the rising cost of social security also caused concern.
as the number of elderly people in america grew the social security system began to collect less money than it paid out.
in 1983 reagan signed the social security reform act which raised the minimum retirement age and increased payroll taxes for social security.
it provided a temporary fix but did not solve the long term problems of the social security program.
trade imbalance with japan another deficit that alarmed americans was the nations growing imbalance in world trade.
american exports had been falling steadily since the 1970s due to a decline in domestic automobile electronics and other manufacturing industries.
japan began to dominate the american market in televisions automobiles and other consumer products.
at the same time japans markets remained closed to many american made goods.
when japan refused to ease its restrictions on american imports reagan placed a tariff on japanese electronics that doubled their price in american stores.
japanese trade restrictions eased in a deal to get this tariff removed.
however the united states continued to import many more japanese products than american companies were able to sell in japan.
reagan and organized labor in 1981 when thousands of air traffic controllers went on strike reagan refused to negotiate with the professional air traffic controllers organization patco and fired the striking workers because they were violating a law forbidding federal employees from striking.
many americans admired reagan s strong decisive stance.
some union supporters however claimed that reagans action represented an assault on the labor movement.
the patco strike marked a turning point for organized labor.

reagan s actions also signaled that it was acceptable for businesses to get tough with unions.
the private sector creates economic opportunities reagan believed that volunteerism and private initiative could create economic opportunities for citizens.
in 1981 he praised an organization called the clearinghouse on corporate social responsibility for their work in improving americans quality of life.
the clearinghouse had evolved from the committee of insurance company ceos who had first met in response to the urban riots of the late 1960s.
one of the unintended consequences of this meeting was that by 1981 the organization had expanded to include life and health insurance trade associations.
it actively supported community projects employment of women and minorities environment and energy conservation and socially responsible investments.
in 1982 it changed its name to the center for corporate public involvement.
b identify main ideas what is the central theory of reaganomics or supply side economics.
conservative momentum continues despite budget and debt problems the economic recovery improved the national mood and helped ronald reagans popularity.
reagan used his time in office to strengthen the conservative cause.
private conservative educational and research groups such as washington d c s heritage foundation supported reagan and lobbied congress on behalf of his programs.
winning a second term during his 1984 campaign for reelection president reagan used the phrase it is morning in america as a campaign slogan its morning again in america.
in a town not too far from where you live a young family has just moved into a new home.
right down the street one of the neighbors has just bought himself a new car with all the options.
the factory down the river is working again.
life is better america is members of the air traffic controllers union patco picket at new yorks laguardia airport in august 1981 back.
and people have a sense of pride they never felt theyd feel again campaign commercial for the reelection of ronald reagan 1984 this theme dovetailed nicely with reagans upbeat spirit which he displayed even in his darkest moments.
for example on march 30 1981 a disturbed man named john hinckley jr tried to assassinate the president.
one bullet from hinckleys gun lodged in reagans chest.
according to one account reagan joked to his doctors i hope you are all republicans americans voted overwhelmingly to reelect reagan in 1984.
he easily defeated walter mondale the democratic presidential nominee and his running mate geraldine ferraro the first woman to be nominated for vice president by a major political party.
however reagans momentum did not lead to a total triumph for conservatives as democrats retained control of the house of representatives.
creating conservative courts during his two terms reagan appointed judges who he hoped would reverse the liberal drift of the federal courts.
he appointed three new justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony kennedy to the supreme court and elevated william rehnquist a well america in the 1980s and 1990s 647 11 2 the reagan era in 1981 sandra day oconnor became the first woman on the supreme court.
to offset what he saw as liberal bias president reagan appointed three conservative judges to the court during his presidency.
in 1988 after serving for eight years as vice president george h w.
bush ran for president against democrat michael dukakis.
known conservative to the position of chief justice in 1986.
sandra day oconnor nominated in 1981 was the first female justice and a moderate conservative.
although she voted with other conservatives on many issues she consistently voted to uphold roe v wade which reagan opposed.
near the end of reagans first term congress passed the equal access act.
this act required public secondary schools to allow any group equal access to school facilities.
conservative christian groups supported the acts passage because many public schools did not allow religious groups to meet on school property.
the supreme court confirmed the constitutionality of the equal access act in 1990 in board of education of westside community schools v mergens.
george h w.
bush becomes president reagan used his personal popularity to promote george h w.
bush his vice president for eight years as bush campaigned for the presidency against massachusetts governor michael dukakis in 1988.
bush had enjoyed a long and distinguished political career.
he had served the nation in many ways as a member of congress from texas ambassador to the united nations under nixon american envoy to china under ford and head of the central intelligence agency cia.
despite these impressive credentials bush lacked the support of conservatives in the republican party who questioned his commitment to their cause.
although bush called for a kinder gentler nation in his campaign both candidates attacked each other in negative campaign ads.
bush cemented his support among conservatives by promising not to raise taxes and by casting himself as a defender of traditional values.
although bush defeated dukakis in the presidential election democrats won a majority of seats in both houses of congress.
president bush sought to control federal spending by encouraging americans to volunteer.
government he asserted could take a smaller role in daily life if like a thousand points of light community organizations and volunteers provided more help to the disabled illiterate and poor.
when congress passed the americans with disabilities act ada in july 1990 bush signed it into law.
the act ensured that persons with disabilities would receive the same opportunities in employment as well as access to public places and transportation that other americans took for granted.
it benefited america in the 1980s and 1990s 648 h 2 the reagan era more than 43 million people and represented another step in the quest to protect the rights of all americans.
b check understanding did president reagans appointees to the supreme court follow his conservative agenda in full.
culture challenge and change despite reagans vision of morning in america and bushs thousand points of light in truth a great cultural and economic divide existed in 1980s society a division partially defined by race ethnicity and gender.
the economic recovery of the mid 1980s did not affect all segments of society equally.
as the number of poor increased so did violence and drug use in the nations inner cities.
at the same time a culture of acquisition intensified among americans.
material culture in the 1980s i am a material girl sang madonna in her 1985 hit.
for many americans her anthem to acquiring things characterized the decade.
material acquisition especially defined a segment of society that came to be known as young urban professionals or yuppies americans born in the baby boom that followed world war ii and who made 40 000 a year or more in the 1980s.
because there were so many people in this demographic their spending habits were noticed and often criticized by the media.
yuppies were characterized by their attachment to flashy cars and other possessions and for their obsession with making and spending money.
another trend of the 1980s was a new obsession with physical fitness.
being fit however meant more than just being healthy.
it also meant looking good.
americans spent more than ever before on diet drinks and vitamins sportswear health club memberships and home fitness videos and equipment.
some large companies recognizing that healthy employees were more productive opened in house fitness facilities.
they also sponsored programs and provided other incentives to help their employees get healthier.
by the mid 1980s nearly half of americans exercised daily compared to just 24 percent 20 years earlier.
critics observed that these trends embodied the materialistic values of the 1980s.
they complained that instead of trying to improve society americans were focused on improving themselves both physically and financially.
the space program in the 1980s the national aeronautics and space administration nasa added president bush signs the americans with disabilities act on the south lawn of the white house in 1990.
signing ceremonies often include key participants involved with the legislation.
a young urban professional or yuppie speaks on an early model of a cell phone in 1983.
america in the 1980s and 1990s 649 11 2 the reagan era a new type of spacecraft to its fleet in 1981.
unlike rockets that fell to earth and were discarded after a single use the new space shuttle looked and landed like an airplane.
it could take off again and again to complete multiple missions.
the promising shuttle program suffered a disastrous setback in january 1986 however when the space shuttle challenger exploded in midair less than 2 minutes after takeoff from cape canaveral in florida.
its entire crew of seven astronauts was killed.
the crew included new hampshire schoolteacher christa mcauliffe the first private citizen to go into space.
the explosion halted nasas shuttle program for two years while scientists worked to eliminate technical problems.
nevertheless space program technology continued to inspire many products such as improved radial tires the portable cordless vacuum cleaner and better firefighting gear that improved americans quality of life.
cold war culture in the 1980s the ongoing cold war also shaped the 1980s culture in the united states.
the olympic games were held in los angeles in 1984.
it was the first time the summer olympics had come to this country in nearly 50 years.
the festive opening on january 28 1986 millions of americans watched on television as the space shuttle challenger exploded minutes after takeoff.
the tragedy shocked the nation but the u s space program continued.
ceremonies typified the reagan eras emphasis on the renewal of americas greatness and patriotism.
the olympics became a tool in the nations cold war rivalry with the soviet union.
along with most other communist countries the soviet union boycotted the los angeles games.
the soviet led boycott was in retaliation for president carters boycott of the 1980 games in moscow to protest the soviet invasion of afghanistan.
the united states won an unusually high number of medals at the los angeles games an outcome that contributed to the reagan era s sense of a revival in american strength and patriotism.
confronting challenging issues at home one of the most troubling problems the nation faced in the 1980s was a dramatic increase in the use of illegal drugs.
the main culprit in this increasing drug use was the spread of cocaine.
once a problem largely confined to crime infested areas of the nations inner cities cocaine use became much more widespread among other classes of american society during this time.
reformers called for stopping the seemingly unrestricted flow of drugs into the united states and for harsher penalties for drug dealers.
president reagan responded by enlisting the army and navy to help stop the cocaine smuggling route into south florida.
the effort was successful.
but by 1985 drug smugglers had shifted their operations to the u s border with mexico.
in 1986 congress made the possession of drugs for sale an offense punishable by a minimum of 10 years in prison.
many americans also worried about the state of americas public education system.
in 1983 the department of education issued a nation at risk.
this study showed that students were consistently scoring lower on standardized tests as time passed.
the report argued that americas schools failed to prepare students adequately to compete with students around the globe.
even before the report appeared conservatives called for providing vouchers or government checks that could be used by parents to pay tuition at private schools.
conservatives argued that vouchers would force public schools to improve in order to attract and retain students.
liberals in congress argued that vouchers would take much needed money away from public schools.
in addition the nation faced the threat of a new disease acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids which first came to doctors attention in 1981.
aids is the last stage of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which attacks the immune system of its victims.
there is no known cure.
when aids first interactive 3 d model america in the 1980s and 1990s 650 11 2 the reagan era reached the united states it spread mainly among homosexual men and intravenous drug users.
later the virus began infecting various other groups of people.
by 1994 aids had killed more than 250 000 americans.
president reagan was criticized for the governments lack of response to the aids epidemic.
congress consistently felt that reagans requests for funds to battle the epidemic were too low and nearly doubled the money earmarked for aids research and education.
meanwhile aids activist groups demonstrated throughout the country.
in washington d c they unveiled a memorial quilt containing the names of some 2000 people who had died of aids.
but not until george h w.
bushs presidency did funding for research on the disease rise substantially.
the attempt on reagans life in a 1981 shooting and the serious wounding of his aide james brady renewed calls for stronger controls on handguns.
these efforts were opposed by the national rifle association nra led by harlon carter which casted itself as the defender of americans second amendment right to keep and bear arms.
in spite of the efforts of this powerful conservative group attempts in the 1980s to ban armor piercing bullets and plastic handguns that could get by airport metal detectors were eventually passed by congress.

reagan believed that peace would come through strength.
although reagans foreign policies initially increased tension between the two superpowers they contributed to the end of the cold war.
the cold war ends reagan leads with peace through strength president reagan believed that the united states needed to weaken communism by challenging it as much as possible without provoking war.
to this end he devised policies aimed at toppling communist nations ranging from building new nuclear missile systems to funding covert operations against soviet troops and allies around the globe.
reagan decides on u s military buildupunder reagan the united states committed itself to the largest peacetime military buildup in its history.
reagan dedicated billions of dollars to the development and production of b l and b 2 bombers mx missile systems and other projects.
in spite of massive protests by the nuclear freeze movement in the united states and abroad the reagan administration placed a new generation of nuclear missiles in europe.
reagan supported this massive military buildup in part because he did not believe that the soviet union could afford to spend as much on defense as the united states could.
reagan felt this applied particularly to the strategic defense initiative sdi a proposed program in which land and space based lasers would destroy any missiles aimed at the united states before they could reach their targets.

reagan involves the u s in the middle east and central america reagan also sought to weaken the soviet union by supporting anticommunist rebellions around the globe.
to this end the united states funded and trained the mujahadeen moo jah huh deen anti soviet rebels in afghanistan.
reagans advisors believed that with u s help these guerrillas could drive the soviets out of afghanistan.
in 1988 soviet forces finally began to withdraw after years of fierce afghan resistance.
closer to home secretary of state alexander haig feared that the newly formed sandinista government in nicaragua provided the soviets with a safe house in americas backyard.
to counter this threat the administration backed a group of anticommunist counterrevolutionaries known as the contras.
at the same time the united states supported a right wing government in el salvador that was battling leftist rebels.
many human rights activists strongly objected to this policy even u s.
ambassador robert white described the legal system in el salvador as rotten and called for the united states to suspend aid to the nation.
instead congress made funding for el salvadors government dependent on the nation making progress on human rights.
in 1983 reagan acted to counter another perceived threat in the western hemisphere.
members of a radical leftist movement with some help from cuba had violently ousted the grenadian prime minister.
on october 25 1983 u s troops invaded grenada to prevent the island nation from becoming a communist outpost and to protect the lives of american medical students.
even though the legal grounds for this invasion proved questionable most americans approved of reagans decision.
economic pressures force gorbachev to pursue reforms in 1985 mikhail gorbachev mee kah eel gor buh chawf became the president of the soviet union.
gorbachev ushered in a new soviet era by pursuing the twin policies of glasnost and perestroika.
glasnost means a new openness and perestroika refers to reforming the soviet system for instance by moving away from a socialist or state controlled economy.

gorbachev realized that his nation could not match the military buildup initiated by the reagan administration.
reagan and gorbachev reevaluate their positions gorbachevs policies and personality helped soften the soviet unions international image.
reagan responded to this change by moderating his own stance toward the soviet union.
while the two nations had held no summits during reagans first four years in office their leaders met four times between 1985 and 1989.
during their final meeting in moscow reagan and gorbachev toasted each other at a state dinner toured the sights like old friends and held a joint press conference.
at the press conference a reporter asked reagan about his description of the soviet union as an evil empire reagan responded i was talking about another era then gorbachev allowed president reagan to address students at moscow state university on the benefits of the free enterprise system and democracy your generation is living in one of the most exciting times in soviet president reagan meets for the first time with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in geneva switzerland in 1985 history.
it is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free.

impact of the end of the cold war 1991 was a turning point in american and world history.
in a little over three years time after reagans speech in moscow the cold war had come to an end.
the berlin wall came down poland czechoslovakia and hungary held democratic elections and the soviet union disintegrated into numerous separate republics.
time magazine observed it was one of those rare times when the tectonic plates of history shift beneath mens feet and nothing after is quite the same communist governments fall in eastern europe more so than any other event the fall of the berlin wall symbolized the end of communism in europe.
for decades the wall had blocked travel from communist east berlin to democratic west berlin.
guards shot those who attempted to escape over the wall to west berlin.
then in november 1989 following the fall of east germanys communist government east german authorities opened the walls gates.
thousands climbed atop the wall some even took sledgehammers and chipped away at the barricade.

but when millions of russians led by boris yeltsin rallied in the streets of moscow in support of gorbachev the coup fell apart.
not long afterward the communist party lost power and the soviet union separated into 15 independent republics.
boris yeltsin became the new leader of the largest new republic the russian federation.
historians do not totally agree on what caused the soviet union to collapse.
most acknowledge that gorbachevs policy of glasnost opened the floodgates to rebellions against soviet domination of eastern europe.
likewise they note that his policy of perestroika fostered a challenge to communist rule within the soviet union.
yet a number of scholars give reagan credit for bringing an end to the cold war.
by dedicating america to a massive arms buildup they argue he hastened the collapse of the soviet economy.
in turn this compelled gorbachev to promote reform at home and relinquish control of eastern europe.
the key rival competitor and enemy of the united states for so many years had suddenly disappeared.

u s involvement in the middle east and the iran contra affair conflicts in the middle east in the 1980s tested political relationships throughout the world.
the iran iraq war from 1980 1988 and increasing incidents of terrorism brought the united states into direct confrontation with several countries in the region.

in response the united states placed economic sanctions on libya.
in april 1986 following a terrorist attack on a berlin nightclub which reagan blamed on qaddafi u s warplanes bombed libya.
although qaddafi survived unharmed the air raid killed one of his family members.
in the period following the attack qaddafis criticism of the united states dwindled.
tensions between the countries continued through the early 1990s though as u s leaders suspected the qaddafi regime of producing chemical weapons.
reagan sends marines into lebanon even as the soviet union collapsed and conflicts with libya ignited the united states faced additional problems in the middle east.
in 1982 reagan sent a group of 800 united states marines to lebanon as part of an international force trying to bring peace to that nation which was torn by civil war.
on october 23 1983 a truck loaded with thousands of pounds of explosives smashed through barriers at the headquarters of the united states marines in beirut bay root lebanon s capital and into a four story building that housed hundreds of military personnel.
the explosion killed 241 marines.
reagan withdrew the remaining marines in february 1984.
the incident illustrated once again the complicated and dangerous nature of middle eastern politics.
the iran contra affair shakes the presidency reagan s presidency started with a breakthrough in the middle east.
twenty minutes after he took the oath of office on january 20 1981 iran released all 52 americans it had held hostage since 1979.
but during his second term the iran contra affair tarnished reagans reputation.
the iran contra affair began when the united states sold weapons to iran in 1985 in exchange for irans promise to pressure terrorist groups in lebanon to release some american hostages.
the plan didnt work and it contradicted the administration s policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists.
then the administration used the money from the sale to fund the contras in nicaragua despite the fact that in 1983 congress had banned sending funds to the contras.
news of these deals became public in 1986.
although president reagan accepted responsibility for the actions of his administration he never admitted to ordering his aides to support the contras.
ultimately several leading administration officials and a top aide america in the 1980s and 1990s 656 11 3 the cold war ends oliver north were convicted on charges stemming from the scandal although many of the convictions were later overturned on technical grounds.

groups of racketeers in latin america supplied a significant amount of the illegal drugs in the united states.
the bush administration arrested and tried several international drug figures including eduardo martinez romero the reputed financier of a colombian drug cartel.

china resists calls for democracy meanwhile in the spring of 1989 chinese students captured the worlds attention by staging pro democracy protests in tiananmen square in the heart of beijing.
many americans hoped that these protests might result in the fall of communism in china.
instead on june 4 chinese tanks rolled into beijing killed hundreds of protesters crushed the demonstrations and imprisoned many pro democracy activists.
the bush administration condemned this action and suspended arms sales to china.
however bush did not believe that stiffer penalties would influence chinese leaders.
he made the pragmatic choice to remain engaged with china economically and diplomatically rather than cut off ties with the country.
pressures force changes in south africa while china resisted changes long overdue ones were taking place in south africa.
for years the south african government controlled by whites had maintained an oppressive system of rigid segregation known as apartheid.
the leader of the antiapartheid movement nelson mandela man dehl uh had been imprisoned since 1962.
in the late 1980s protests against apartheid within south africa and around the globe grew.
in the united states many private firms divested or withdrew investments from south africa.
congress imposed economic sanctions instead of fully divesting not wanting to destabilize the struggling nation.
president bush met with mandela after his release from jail in 1990 and endorsed the drive to bring democracy to south africa.

hypothesize why was iraqs invasion of kuwait in 1990 considered such a threat by so many nations.
the persian gulf war the most important foreign policy challenge faced by the bush administration took place in the persian gulf.
on august 2 1990 iraq invaded its tiny neighbor kuwait.
nearly 150 000 iraqi troops quickly overran kuwaiti forces.
a dictators thirst for power leads to war saddam hussein iraqs ruthless dictator had run the middle eastern nation with an iron fist since 1979.
by invading kuwait hussein sought to take over kuwaits rich oil deposits.
with kuwait in his power hussein would control nearly 20 percent of the oil produced around the world.
the united states feared how hussein would use the influence that controlling such a large amount of oil would give him.
in addition nearby saudi arabia possessed even greater oil reserves.
the united states did not want hussein to seek to gain control of those reserves next.
oil drove much of the worlds economies including americas.
in 1970 the united states consumed around 14 million barrels of oil each day.
by 1990 that number had increased to 17 million barrels a day.
president bush made it clear that he would not tolerate iraqs aggression against its neighbor.
he worked to build an international coalition and backed a un resolution demanding that iraqi troops withdraw.
u s spearheads operation desert storm by late fall about 700 000 troops had assembled in saudi arabia including nearly 500 000 american forces.
britain france egypt and saudi arabia among others also sent troops.
other nations for example japan agreed to help pay for the costs of the operation.
initially bush hoped that the presence of these troops along with the economic sanctions against iraq would convince hussein to withdraw his soldiers.
at the same time the president asked for and received from congress the authority to use force if necessary to back up the uns resolution that iraq leave kuwait.
operation desert storm the name given to the american led attack on iraqi forces began on january 16 1991.
general colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and general norman schwarzkopf devised and executed a strategy that began with five weeks of devastating aerial bombardment on iraqi forces.
iraq countered by launching scud missiles on both coalition forces and israel.
although these missiles did little serious damage they struck terror in the hearts of many who feared they were armed with chemical warheads.

weve kicked the vietnam syndrome once and for all proclaimed bush.
he then chose to limit american actions to enforcing the un resolution.
the coalitions forces would compel iraq to leave kuwait but would not continue on to baghdad iraqs capital to topple saddam hussein.
as a result hussein and his regime survived the war.
bushs public approval rating skyrocketed.
the united states remained in the region to help iraqi refugees establishing no fly zones over northern and southern iraq.
however saddam hussein and his supporters resented the u s presence.
during operation desert storm similar resentment toward u s forces also grew in saudi arabia where many troops were stationed.
this resentment may have helped attract new recruits to the anti american propaganda of the terrorist organization al qaeda.

saddam hussein had stayed in power continuing to threaten peace in the middle east.
the american economy had gone into recession and the federal deficit had risen.
people were angered by bushs betrayal of his 1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
bush s sinking popularity opened up the way for the democratic challenge.
new democrats emerge the democrats nominated william jefferson clinton governor of arkansas as their presidential candidate.
clinton was born in 1946 into a humble home and had worked his way through college and law school before being elected governor of arkansas in 1978.
to widen his appeal and distance himself from the stereotype of tax and spend liberals clinton promoted himself as a new democrat new democrats were centrists who sought to reconcile liberal and conservative ideals.
they believed in strong national defense tough stands on crime free trade welfare reform and closer ties with corporations.
they believed that government was necessary and important but that it had grown large jr america in the 1980s and 1990s 661 a new era in foreign policy and inefficient.
clintons centrist position attracted conservative and liberal democrats as well as moderate republicans.
his position as a moderate practical democrat had broad appeal for a wide range of voters.
winning the white house by 1992 clinton was poised to capitalize on bushs political problems.
he entered the presidential race along with texas billionaire h ross perot who led a self funded independent party and promised to govern by sound business principles.
ross perot a self made billionaire built his campaign on economic populism and an appeal to americans dissatisfied with the traditional two party political system.
clintons campaign focused on economic and social opportunity.
clinton charged that bushs economic policies had made the rich richer.
he also pointed out that unlike bush he came from a family that had struggled through hard times and knew what it was like to worry about paying bills.
bush responded by attacking clintons character.
republicans accused the governor of draft dodging marital infidelity and other moral laxities.
bush also suggested that clinton and his vice presidential candidate a1 gore were too inexperienced to lead the nation.
unlike his opponents perot opposed free trade agreements with mexico and canada and stressed the importance of eliminating the u s governments budget deficit and national debt.
in the end clintons message carried the election.
in the largest voter turnout since 1960 more than 100 million americans turned out at the polls.
clinton received 43 percent of the popular vote to bushs 37 percent and perots 19 percent.
democrats also retained control of the house of representatives and the senate.
although perot and his third party did not win any electoral votes he garnered nearly 20 million votes.

he did so with mixed success.
intervention in somalia and haiti in the late 1980s civil war broke out in somalia.
by 1991 the government had disintegrated and the fighting had caused widespread famine.
in 1992 the united states led a multinational force later joined by the un to bring about peace and distribute food.
the coalition fell apart in 1994 when several countries including the united states suffered steep casualty rates and withdrew their troops.
eventually the un also withdrew and civil war dragged on for several more years in the devastated country.
meanwhile conflict was simmering in haiti.
in 1990 haitians brought jean bertrand aristide to the presidency in the nation s first free elections.
less than a year later a military coup overthrew aristide plunging the country into turmoil.
thousands of haitians left the country by boat to immigrate to the united states as political refugees.
many were sent back by american immigration officials causing a public outcry.
in 1994 clinton sent american troops to haiti to restore aristide to power.
although american action improved the situation within a decade haiti faced a sinking economy and rising rates of disease and crime.
u s involvement in the balkans crisis in the balkans the collapse of communism broke up the country of yugoslavia.
for decades the communist leader josip broz tito had contained ethnic and religious strife.
but his death in 1980 and the collapse of communism in 1989 left the country with no unifying forces.
soon four of yugoslavias six major republics broke away and became independent nations and long suppressed ethnic and religious hostilities came boiling to the surface.
in newly independent bosnia and herzegovina ethnic and religious rivalries among eastern orthodox serbs catholic croats and bosnian muslims eventually led to civil war.
serbs with the help of serbia dominated yugoslavia attacked bosnians and croats.
in many cases they forcibly removed bosnians and croats from their homes and later murdered them.
this state sanctioned mass murder violence and rape known as ethnic cleansing shocked the world.
the un intervened with humanitarian aid.
yet atrocities continued on all sides of the struggle and years went by before the world community intervened to stop the slaughter.
clinton galvanizes nato forces finally in the late summer of 1995 clinton encouraged nato to bomb serbian strongholds.
this was the first time america in the 1980s and 1990s 663 11 4 a new era in foreign policy the organization had gone into combat and its use of force quickly brought about a cease fire.
in december 1995 the dayton accords established a federated multinational bosnia.
although the ethnic cleansing had ended the enforced peace had not solved the problems of the region.
in 1998 violence flared up anew this time in kosovo a province in southern serbia that borders on albania.
the fighting once again involved ethnic cleansing and also spread to the neighboring countries of macedonia and albania.
nato forced serbs to withdraw from kosovo.
the rwanda genocide as ethnic hatred led to atrocities in the balkans mass murder was also underway far to the south in the african nation of rwanda.
between april and july of 1994 rwandas majority hutu population committed genocide as they exterminated more than 800 000 members of the tutsi population.
the bloodbath in turn forced 2 000 000 people to flee rwanda creating a major humanitarian crisis.
the un was unable to bring about a cease fire and president clinton and other world leaders were criticized for their silence on this tragedy.
eventually tutsi led forces gained ground and established a government of national unity bringing the genocide to an end.

america and the middle east in the 1990s in the 1990s israels military responded to attacks by palestinians.
the level of violence grew increasingly fierce.
meanwhile instability had increased in the region as a whole.
as clinton worked to address it violence originating in the region spread outward with the united states increasingly a target.
small steps toward peace in israel in 1993 palestinians and israelis conducted secret negotiations in oslo norway.
the resulting declaration of principles promised palestinian self rule in jericho and the gaza strip as well as security for the israelis.
the declaration did not adequately address the issues of israeli settlements in the west bank nor did it placate extremists on either side who had no interest in compromise.

america in the 1980s and 1990s 664 11 4 a new era in foreign policy chronic violence continued even though israel withdrew from much of the west bank and later from gaza.
israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin who had agreed to the declaration fell victim to the fury in 1995 when an israeli religious extremist assassinated him.
in 2000 clinton invited palestinian leader yasir arafat and israeli prime minister ehud barak to camp david to work on a peace agreement.
they came close to signing one but arafat was not satisfied with any of the proposals.
back in israel barak was replaced as prime minister by ariel sharon a hawk who once opposed any concessions to the palestinians.
in 2005 however sharon withdrew all israeli settlers from gaza.
nonetheless palestinian suicide bombings increased and with them so did crackdowns by the israeli military.
terrorists hit u s.
targets in 1993 an islamist terrorist group called al qaeda exploded a truck bomb in the parking garage beneath the world trade center in new york city killing six people and injuring more than one thousand others.
al qaeda was led by a wealthy man from saudi arabia named osama bin laden.
bin laden had fought in afghanistan in the 1980s on the side of islamists who sought to expel the soviet union.
by the late 1990s he had formed al qaeda with the purpose of ending american involvement in muslim countries.
five years after the 1993 bombing at the world trade center al qaeda set off car bombs within minutes of each other at american embassies in nairobi kenya and in dar es salaam tanzania.
the blasts killed 225 people and injured more than 5 500 others.
in 2000 al qaeda bombed the uss cole an american warship anchored off the coast of yemen killing 17 american sailors.
in spite of these attacks most americans remained much more focused on domestic issues than on the threat of international terrorism.
no one fully understood the threat that al qaeda posed to american interests and world peace.
b recall where did osama bin laden establish his credentials as an islamic fundamentalist fighter in the 1980s.
in 1993 islamist terrorists detonated a bomb in the parking garage of the world trade center in new york city intending to destroy the buildings.

since 1968 americans had chosen republican presidents in five out of six elections.
the republican argument that government needed to be smaller and less intrusive resonated with many americans.
clinton therefore needed to chart a middle course between the limited role for government advocated by republicans and the traditional democratic reliance on government programs to address social problems.

in 1993 he signed the brady bill a gun control act named for presidential aide james brady who had been wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on ronald reagan.
under clinton congress also passed a 30 billion anticrime bill that increased funding for police and banned several kinds of assault weapons.
still violence continued to haunt the nation.
in 1995 americans were horrified by the bombing of a government building in oklahoma city that killed 168 people and injured more than 800 others.
the mass murder was not committed by foreign terrorists but rather by homegrown anti government extremists.
to ward off similar terrorist attacks federal buildings in major cities were surrounded with barriers.
new laws were passed to deter terrorism and impose stiffer penalties.
in 1999 yet another act of senseless violence stirred nationwide debate.
at colorados columbine high school two heavily armed students killed 12 fellow students and a teacher as well as wounding 24 others before taking their own lives.
in the aftermath of this tragedy many schools across the nation installed metal detectors and other security measures.
still other schools instituted new anti bully policies and zero tolerance approaches to school violence.
q describe describe what the clintons healthcare reform package sought to supply for americans.
republicans lead a conservative resurgence after two years in office clinton had achieved a few lasting legislative victories.
yet the failure of his healthcare initiative signaled that his popularity and his control of congress was waning.
with the 1994 midterm elections approaching congressional republicans seized the opportunity to advance their own ideas.
gingrichs contract with america georgia congressman newt gingrich led the opposition to clinton.
gingrich was bold and aggressive and not interested in compromising with the democrats we will cooperate but we wont compromise.
many in april 1995 domestic terrorist timothy mcveigh detonated a bomb in front of the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city.
the attack killed more than 160 people and injured several hundred others.
in 1994 congressman newt gingrich organized republican opposition to democratic policies around his contract with america campaign.
interactive gallery america in the 1980s and 1990s 667 11 5 clinton and the 1990s people thought that gingrichs goal of the republicans gaining control of the house of representatives in 1994 was a nearly impossible task.
after all the democrats had controlled the house for 58 of the previous 62 years.
gingrich however galvanized republicans around his contract with america a plan that attacked big government and emphasized patriotism and traditional values.
the contract with america called for congressional term limits reduction of the federal bureaucracy a balanced budget amendment to the constitution and large tax cuts as well as increased defense spending significant welfare reform and tough anti crime legislation.
the idea was to capture the votes of americans who felt the federal government was too big too wasteful and too liberal.
republicans sweep the 1994 elections although most eligible voters did not vote in 1994 there was a strong turnout among republicans.
for the first time in 40 years the republicans won control of the house.
they also captured the senate and most of the governorships.
newsweek magazine observed last week in one of the most profound electoral routs in american history republicans won the right to occupy the capitol and mount what their.
commanders think of as a counterrevolution a full scale attack on the notion that a central government should play a central role in the life of the nation once in office republicans in the house passed most of gingrichs program.
getting the program through the senate and signed by clinton was not as successful with only a handful of contract points becoming law.
in addition republican attempts to slash medicare and other government programs proved unpopular.
many americans were also upset when the government shut down in 1995 because congress would not pass clintons budget.
meanwhile clinton incorporated some of the conservative agenda into his own 1996 reelection bid.
he signed a bill to reform welfare passed legislation that appropriated more money for law enforcement and called for stiffer sentencing for criminals.
finally he made balancing the budget and reducing the federal deficit a priority.
a strong economy lifts clinton to reelection beginning in the mid 1990s the american economy broke out of recession and began to soar starting the longest period of sustained growth in the countrys history.
americans benefited from low unemployment low inflation levels and the governments efforts to balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
in 1994 clintons disapproval rating had exceeded 60 percent and few expected him to win a second term.
as the 1996 election approached however the booming economy meant that few americans had a compelling reason to change leadership.
the republicans nominated senate majority leader robert dole a world war ii hero and a moderate republican.
h ross perot entered the race as the reform party candidate.
clinton skillfully captured the middle ground labeling dole as out of touch and perot as a political quack.
on election day americans chose clinton by a wide margin.
the house of representatives and senate however retained their republican majorities.
fed recall why did large numbers of americans vote for republican congressional candidates who supported the contract with america.

interactive chart america in the 1980s and 1990s 668 11 5 clinton and the 1990s federal budget 1990 2000 analyze charts what effect did president clintons economic policies have on the federal budget between 1993 and 2000.
scandals impeachment and trial president clinton had dodged scandals from his first days in office.
one a sexual harassment suit had stemmed from his years as governor of arkansas.
another concerned investments that bill and hillary clinton had made in the whitewater development corporation an arkansas real estate company in the 1970s and 1980s.
investigating clinton leads to new scandal a special prosecutor appointed by attorney general janet reno investigated the whitewater investment case and recommended that no criminal charges be filed.
however in july congress passed a new law requiring that special prosecutors be selected by a three judge panel from the u s court of appeals.
as a result in august of 1994 special prosecutor kenneth starr was appointed to investigate the case again.
in seven years of investigation starr failed to uncover any conclusive evidence of the clintons guilt though some of their associates were convicted.
in the process of prosecuting whitewater starr began investigating clintons relationship with o white house intern.
clinton had denied under oath that the two had an affair.
eventually clinton admitted that he had lied.
the whitewater case was quickly overshadowed by the new scandal.
in 1998 starr recommended impeachment proceedings on a number of counts all related to the intern scandal rather than to whitewater.
impeaching and acquitting the president most americans condemned clintons actions but opposed impeachment.
congressional democrats similarly did not believe his behavior met the standard of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors required by the constitution for the impeachment and removal of a president.
nevertheless the house of representatives led by the republican majority impeached clinton on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
in january 1999 the senate tried the president.
the removal of a president requires a two thirds majority of senators and from the beginning it was clear that clintons opposition did not have the necessary votes.
after a short trial the president was acquitted on both counts on february 12.
however the political scandal shook the trust of u s citizens in the federal government and its leaders.
h identify what led to the appointment of kenneth starr as a special prosecutor to investigate the whitewater case.
america in the 1980s and 1990s 669 115 clinton and the 1990s digital technology changes american life during the twentieth century the rate of technological change sped up dramatically.
new technology touched every aspect of life including how americans worked played and communicated.
at the same time globalization transformed the american economy bringing both new challenges and new opportunities.
the 1900s was a century of unparalleled change.
in 1903 orville wright flew the first airplane.
less than 70 years later astronaut neil armstrong walked on the moon.
during that same span of time television went from a novelty at a worlds fair to a standard household possession and sophisticated microscopes and telescopes unveiled previously hidden worlds.
one of the most important innovations was the development of the computer.
microchips and microprocessors lead to the modern computer intense rivalry between enemies during world war ii brought about a life and death race to develop new technologies such as the computer.
the u s government funded research that led to the creation of the first modern computer in 1946.
this huge machine occupied the entire basement of the research popular computers of the 1980s and early 1990s were produced by commodore texas instruments and coleco.
it calculated artillery ranges and performed computations for the atomic bomb.
soon after world war ii universities and corporations joined government agencies to develop smaller faster more powerful computers that could perform a range of functions.
the ibm company developed one of the first commercially successful computers in 1954.
in the 1960s a few companies located south of san francisco california focused on developing improved technology for running the computer.
their efforts led to the microchip a tiny fragment of silicon containing complex circuits and the microprocessor a silicon chip that held a central processing unit.
these chips made possible the development of small computers called personal computers.
transforming business and industry at first personal computers were a novelty item used mainly by hobbyists.
but by the 1980s computers were transforming industries research labs and businesses.
personal computers could perform many different tasks but were small and simple enough for the average person to use.
the technology that created them eventually spread to many other industries.
video games cellular telephones and other electronics all depended on microchips and microprocessors.
entrepreneurs played a large role in accelerating the use of personal computers.
steve jobss apple computers and bill gatess microsoft made computers and software affordable for millions of americans.
jeff bezoss ushered in buying and selling products by computer.
like andrew carnegie and john d rockefeller a century before these entrepreneurs amassed great fortunes by pioneering new technologies.
the great demand for newer faster and more versatile digital devices coupled with the potential fortunes awaiting those who successfully delivered them motivated a new breed of inventors and entrepreneurs.
improvements in technology and manufacturing helped develop faster working and smaller components that drove down costs allowing a great number of people to use these new technologies.
science and agriculture innovations medical science also moved ahead by gigantic leaps in the late twentieth century often aided by computer technology.
scientists developed drugs that extended patients lives reduced pain and battled a huge number of diseases.
they made artificial hearts and learned how to successfully transplant body organs.
such advancements along with biotechnology or the use of living organisms in the development of new products produced a level of healthcare far above that known to america in the 1980s and 1990s 670 1 11 5 clinton and the 1990s the rise of technology any previous generation.
many of the advances in the biological sciences were spurred by federal research grants such as those from the national institute of health and the national science foundation.
advances in agricultural technology including improved machinery irrigation techniques and growing methods have brought profound changes to american society.
while farms have grown larger and more productive fewer people are needed to work them.
in 1900 50 percent of the labor force worked on farms.
at the end of the century only 2 percent did.
satellite technology transforms communication and navigation satellite technology increased the speed of global communications.
satellites are mechanical devices that orbit earth in space receiving and sending information filled signals that are then relayed to televisions telephones and computers.
originally developed for military purposes during the cold war satellite technology was used in the 1970s by businessman ted turner to run the first superstation in 1980 robert johnson launched bet black entertainment television using technology to broadcast into cable equipped households across the country.
also in 1980 turner began the 24 hour per day all news cable news network cnn.
cellular telephones used similar satellite technology allowing people to communicate away from their homes.
scientists and engineers in the u s department of defense also applied satellite technology to develop the first global positioning system gps.
they developed the system for use in the american military but nonmilitary use later became widespread.
in gps a receiver on earth measures how long radio signals from multiple satellites take to arrive at its location.
using this information the receiver performs the necessary calculations to determine the user s latitude longitude or even altitude.
since its inception the accuracy of gps and the fact that its signals are available for free has caused a massive change in navigation for industrial and everyday users.
creating the internet in the 1970s various branches of the u s government along with groups in several american universities led efforts to link computer systems together via cables and satellites.
by the 1980s the internet or world wide web had been born reaching the general public in the 1990s.
the web made communication and access to information almost instantaneous.
this breakthrough completely and profoundly transformed commerce education research and entertainment.
email provided great advantages over the delays of postal mail and the expense of telephones.
the impact has been especially great on people living in rural areas.
the internets immense storage capacity also changed the world of america in the 1980s and 1990s f 671 i 11 5 clinton and the 1990s boom initial public stock offerings value of issued shares companies va linux foundry networks 156 115 102 webmethods 65 56 conoco 103 94 metlife krispy kreme no longer trading or acquired analyze data what does the information on net operating profits and initial public stock offering suggest about investment in technology companies in the late 1990s.
in the 1980s scientists and scholars primarily used the internet to share information.
by the early 1990s they were using it as a research tool and an online database.
the tech boom fuels economic growth in many ways the free enterprise system drives technological innovation and has filled the marketplace with inexpensive personal computers global positioning products and cell phones.
such technological innovations have improved the standard of living in the united states.
fueled in part by the high tech boom the u s economy in the 1990s flourished.
the strong economy produced the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years and high home ownership rates.
in addition the federal government operated on the first balanced budget since the late 1960s and held the largest budget surplus in u s history.
the era became americas longest peacetime expansion.

684 bill clinton challenged the traditional democratic thinking by supporting free trade blocs which in theory would increase the economic prosperity of particular regions.
europe is an example of a region in which such a bloc was setup.
in 1993 a number of european nations established the european union eu to coordinate monetary and economic policies.
by the end of the century the eu had adopted a single currency the euro to promote economic efficiency.
the eus combined resources both encouraged trade among its members and challenged the economic leadership of the united states.
north american free trade proponents believed a similar bloc would stimulate their own region.
the united states joins nafta the north american free trade agreement nafta a direct response to the eu was originally proposed during the bush administration.
president bush and leaders of the other nations signed the agreement in 1992 but congress blocked it.
it called for a gradual removal of trade restrictions among the united states canada and mexico.
naftas supporters maintained that creating a free trade zone in north america would promote economic growth reduce prices increase exports and encourage economic investment.
most labor leaders environmentalists and liberal democrats argued that nafta would force american manufacturers to relocate to mexico where wages were lower and environmental controls were less rigid.
they feared that hundreds of thousands of american jobs would be lost.
president clinton embraced nafta and pushed it through congress.
it went into effect in 1994 and since then the three countries have also signed agreements covering environmental protection safety standards and workers rights.
fourteen years later with the removal of remaining trade restrictions between the united states and mexico the final provisions of nafta went into effect in january 2008.
expanding global trade through the free enterprise system clinton signed a total of 270 free trade agreements including the revision of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1994 and the accords of the world trade organization wto in 1995.
gatts goal was to reduce tariffs to promote free trade.
the wto replaced gatt expanding the organizations authority to negotiate trade agreements settle disputes and enforce compliance with them.
clinton also continued the strong u s support of the world bank.
