chapter 28 the united states becomes a world power should u s actions in world affairs around the turn of the 20th century be praised or condemned.
28 1 introduction william mckinley owed theodore roosevelt a big favor.
roosevelt had just helped him get elected president.
roosevelt had spoken all over the united states in 1896 promoting mckinley s support of business and industry.
with energy and inspiration he attacked mckinleys opponents.
these were democrats who had adopted some populist ideas.
with the nation in the midst of an economic depression roosevelt feared political instability.
he cried that mckinleys opponents planned nothing less than revolution now roosevelt wanted mckinley to appoint him to be assistant secretary of the navy.
mckinley who favored peace feared that roosevelt was too warlike.
still he gave roosevelt the job.
as he took office roosevelt said no triumph of peace is quite so great as the supreme triumphs of war.
it is through strife or the readiness for strife that a nation must win greatness some newspapers called roosevelt patriotic.
others worried that he would push the country into war.
americans had mixed feelings about getting involved in international affairs.
expanding across the continent had given the united states territory to move into for decades to come.
recovery from the civil war followed by industrial expansion had also given americans plenty to focus on at home.
now the west was more settled and the united states was an industrial and agricultural leader.
to keep the economy growing business leaders wanted to market and sell products overseas.
the national pride that had inspired manifest destiny was calling for new challenges.
theodore roosevelt agreed.
he allied himself with expansionists people who wanted to extend the nation s power within the western hemisphere and around the world.
in this chapter you will learn how expansionists achieved their goals.
as it flexed its muscles overseas the united states gained new territories and became a world power.
when theodore roosevelt became president in 1901 he carried out foreign policiesthatexpanded u s involvement around the world giving the united states a greater role in world affairs.

in this political cartoon secretary of state william seward pulls a wheelbarrow containing a block of ice.
president andrew johnson is pushing the wheelbarrow.
what did this cartoonist think about the purchase of alaska.
imperialism the policy of extending a nations power by gaining political and economic control over other countries 28 2 the nation stretches its wings in 1867 secretary of state william seward arranged for the united states to purchase alaska from russia.
at the time few people thought that acquiring this vast wilderness was a good idea.
even at a price of just two cents an acre many labeled the deal sewards folly but the arctic wasteland turned out to have thick forests plentiful fish and wildlife and mild coastal climates.
eventually settlers would discover gold copper coal and other minerals there.
with such natural resources at stake expansionists felt that the united states should gain control over other areas of the world as well.
addition to arranging the pur chase of alaska seward also secured the rights to the midway islands.
located in the pacific ocean between california and asia the midway islands were annexed by the united states in 1867.
rise of expansionism some americans objected to expansionism saying that it was contrary to american values.
taking over other lands declared former senator carl schurz would mean that our old democratic principle that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed will have to go overboard others warned that such takeovers would cause revolutions abroad.
some raised racist objections arguing that nonwhites in other countries could never learn american values.
william jennings bryan who had run for president against mckinley believed that the united states could be powerful without ta ing over other lands.
he said that the nation has exerted upon uman race an influence more potent for good than all the other tions of the earth combined and it has exerted that influence with out the use of the sword or gatling machine gun y e 1890s however american business leaders were eager to g es and establish plantations in new places.
others wanted new markets for finished products.
for years european countries had been practicing imperialism building empires by taking control of the and ecnomies of other countries.
u s expansionists n e o o ow their example.
senator henry cabot lodge declared worldtn 7s the ag as of he grea nations of the e mted states must not fall out of the line of march 554 chapter 28 annexing hawaii commerce drove u s expansionists to develop an interest in hawaii a group of islands located in the pacific ocean.
americans had first come to these islands in the 1820s as missionaries.
their goal was to convert the native hawaiians to christianity.
the hawaiians whose ancestors had come from the south pacific had lived on these islands for more than a thousand years.
they were ruled by their own kings and queens.
in 1835 a boston merchant established a large sugar plantation in hawaii.
before long american owned sugar and pineapple plantations dotted the islands.
the planters brought laborers to hawaii from china and japan to work in their vast fields.
under pressure from the planters the hawaiians agreed in 1887 to let the united states establish a naval base at pearl harbor on the island of oahu oh ah hoo.
the planters also persuaded congress to allow hawaiian sugar to be imported into the united states without paying any tariff import tax.
u s sugar growers objected that the law now favored hawaiian sugar over domestically grown sugar.
they convinced congress to give a bonus to growers in the united states.
hawaiian planters wanted that bonus too.
so they asked the united states to annex hawaii.
meanwhile native hawaiians increasingly resented being pushed around by americans.
when queen liliuokalani lee lee uh woh kuh lah nee took the throne in 1891 people rallied around her call of hawaii for hawaiians americans in hawaii feared that they would lose their land.
with help from u s marines in 1893 sugar planters forced queen liliuokalani to give up her throne.
now in control the planters established a new government for the islands.
despite the planters wishes president grover cleveland refused to support the annexation of hawaii.
cleveland who opposed imperialism said that hawaii should be ruled by hawaiians.
but in 1898 under president mckinley the united states did annex hawaii.
u s interest in japan and china in the mid to late 1800s the united states turned its attention to japan and china.
the u s government signed a trade treaty with japan in 1858.
several european countries had made efforts to control trade with china.
the united states wanted to maintain its own access to chinese markets.
in 1899 and 1900 the u s government issued what became known as the open door policy.
it called on foreign nations to allow free trade in china.
28 3 a splendid little war closer to the united states americans established huge sugar plantations on the caribbean island of cuba only 90 miles from florida.
like nearby puerto rico cuba was still a spanish colony.
by the 1890s u s expansionists wanted to annex both of these islands.
to support their ambitions they argued that it was time for the united states to enforce the monroe doctrine.
no european country they said should control territory in the western hemisphere.
queen liliuokalani the last reigning monarch of hawaii insisted that native hawaiians should control the islands.
american planters organized a revolt that dethroned her.

in 1976 admiral h g rickover acting forthe u s navy presented evidence thatthe explosion was probably caused by spontaneous combustion in one of the coal containers.
cubans struggle for independence the cubans themselves had staged an unsuccessful revolt against spain in 1868.
in 1895 under the leadership of jose marti ho zay mar tee cubans again tried to win their independence.
to crush this movement the spanish herded men women and children into reconcentration camps forced to live with inadequate food and medical care tens of thousands of people died.
u s newspapers jumped at the chance to report stories of cuban suffering.
competing fiercely for customers some newspapers resorted to yellow journalism offering sensational and shocking reports.
some of these stories were based on rumors and untruths.
one said that a spanish general was feeding prisoners to sharks as sympathy for cubans grew more and more americans were willing to go to war for cuba.
to help americans in cuba in case of trouble president mckinley sent the new battleship uss maine to the islands capital city havana in january 1868.
the spanish american war trouble soon erupted in havana.
about three weeks after the maine arrived an explosion destroyed the battleship killing 260 u s sailors.
no one knew whether the explosion was caused by an accident a mine or a bomb.
but many americans were quick to blame spain.
young men rushed to join the army raising the battle cry remem her the maine.
senators shouted free cuba hoping to avoid war mckinley offered to work out a solution between the spanish and cubans.
but the spanish did not respond.
under pressure from newspapers and members of congress calling him a coward mckinley asked congress to declare war.
congress quickly agreed and in april 1898 voted to go to war with spain.
at the same time congress approved a resolution stating that the united states intended to leave the government and control of the island cuba to its people i i the spanish american war in the caribbean 1898 when spain refused to grant cuba independence the united states declared war on spain.
in july 1898 u s forces sank or captured the entire spanish fleet after the battle of san juan hill.
the united states then defeated spanish troops in puerto rico.
556 chapter 28 the u s army quickly grew from 30 000 to over 274 000 men.
roosevelt resigned from his position as assistant secretary of the navy and put together his own regiment.
a mixture of powerful wealthy men and seasoned ranch hands it came to be called the rough riders.
after long preparations the rough riders and 17 000 other americans arrived in cuba in june 1898.
seeing that cuban fighters lacked the strength or weapons to force the spanish out of fortified cities and harbors roosevelt and his rough riders decided to capture santiago a major city.
to do this they had to capture nearby san juan hill from which spanish forces were able to defend the city.
the attacking force included the rough riders and african american troops from several regiments.
up the hill the troops charged braving spanish fire.
they walked to greet death at every step many of them as they advanced sinking suddenly or pitching forward but others waded on stubbornly forming a thin blue line that kept creeping higher and higher up the hill wrote an american reporter.
it was a miracle of self sacrifice a triumph of bull dog courage the americans captured san juan hill.
realizing that santiago was lost the spanish tried to save their ships sending them steaming out of the harbor.
but americans sank or captured every ship.
the spanish soon surrendered.
the spanish american war lasted just four months.
only 345 americans died in combat although 5 500 died of disease.
many americans agreed with secretary of state john hay that it had been a splendid little war under the terms of the peace treaty between the united states and spain cuba gained its independence from spain and puerto rico came under u s rule.
spain also ceded guam an island in the pacific ocean to the united states.
in a 1903 treaty with cuba the united states leased land in cuba to establish a naval base at guantanamo bay.
the united states becomes a world powei general emilio aguinaldo believed that the united states would help the philippines gain independence from spain.
when the united states annexed the philippines instead he fought for filipino freedom.
28 4 the philippines after the maine exploded in cuba assistant secretary of the navy theodore roosevelt sent a telegram to admiral george dewey the head of the u s fleet in the pacific.
in the event of declaration of war the telegram ordered begin offensive operations in philippine islands the spanish american war had expanded to include the philippine islands halfway around the globe from cuba.
battle at manila bay the philippines provided spains main base in the pacific.
the islands people called filipinos had tried many times to throw off spanish colonial rule.
in 1898 they were trying again.
led by general emilio aguinaldo ah ghee nahl doh they had begun attacking the spanish army and government officials.
now their struggle was about to become part of the war between the united states and spain.
deweys fleet arrived in manila the philippine capital just five days after the united states declared war against spain.
at dawn on may 1 1898 u s battleships faced spanish gunships.
as naval bands struck up the star spangled banner sailors stood on deck and saluted the flag.
these men were about to engage in what would be the first battle of the spanish american war.
by 11 a m the entire spanish fleet was burning sunk or sinking.
spain s old wooden ships were no match for the modern steel u s ships with well trained crews.
only one american had died in the battle.
the spanish american war in the philippines 1898 defeating the spanish dewey block aded manilas port until u s troops could arrive to take over the city.
filipino fighters allied with dewey surrounded manila.
the filipinos believed that the coming americans would help them gain independence.
while they waited aguinaldo issued the philippine declaration of independence formed a national government and designed a national flag.
once u s reinforcements showed up the spanish agreed to lose a fake battle and surrender to the americans.
they didnt want to give themselves up to the filipinos who resented spanish rule so intensely.
the spanish american war was fought on two fronts cuba and the philippines.
in the philip pines located south of china u s forces led by admiral dewey attacked and destroyed the entire spanish fleet in manila bay.
558 chapter 28 fighting the filipinos in a treaty negotiated after the surrender the united states bought the philippines from spain for 20 million.
then in 1899 congress voted to annex the philippines.
aguinaldos government felt betrayed.
angrily the filipino leader called for war without quarter to the false americans who have deceived us.
either independence or death for three years more than 80 000 filipino fighters fought off better trained and better armed u s troops.
soldiers on both sides tortured prisoners.
americans became increasingly cruel harming civilians and destroying villages.
some americans protested that denying independence to the philippines violated u s ideals.
carl schurz a leader among anti imperialists said we shall for the first time since the abolition of slavery again have two kinds of americans americans of the first class who enjoy the privilege of taking part in the government and americans of the second class who are to be ruled by the americans of the first class.
but the expansionists won the day.
senator henry cabot lodge argued that manila with its magnificent bay will keep us open to the markets of china president mckinley himself believed that the philippines could become a land of plenty.
more than 20 000 filipinos and about 4 000 americans died in t e struggle.
when the revolt was finally put down the americans set up a nonmilitary government to prepare filipinos for indepen e ce americans built roads hospitals and schools.
but the united states did not grant the philippines independence until 1946.
a long war between the united states and the filipinos who resisted u s control resulted in heavy casualties.
more than 20 000 filipinos were killed before the philippines became independent in 1946.
the united states becomes a world power the panama canal zone 1914 the united states took control of the panama canal zone in 1903 and started building the canal the following year.
by 1914 the panama canal was complete.
it provided a shortcut for ships traveling between the atlantic and the pacific.
28 5 panama and the canal in 1900 americas favorite hero from the spanish american war theodore roosevelt was elected vice president.
we stand on the threshold of a new century roosevelt declared.
is america a weakling to shrink from the work of the great powers.
the young giant of the west stands on a continent and clasps the crest of an ocean in either hand dreaming of a canal roosevelt wanted to join the atlantic and pacific oceans with a canal.
if ships could move quickly between the atlantic and the pacific the navy would be better able to defend the nations new territories.
in addition businesses would gain from lower shipping costs.
in september 1901 president mckinley was shot and killed by an assassin and roosevelt became president.
in his first speech to congress roosevelt argued for the canal.
no single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is of such consequence to the american people he told the lawmakers.
congress soon approved funding.
in 1903 roosevelt offered colombia 10 million for land in their province of panama the narrowest part of central america.
the colombian senate refused believing that the united states was trying to take a weaker countrys valuable resources.
furious roosevelt sent a u s warship to panama.
roosevelt knew that panamanians wanted independence from colombia.
the day after t e s ip arrived a revolution started in panama.
with u s marines eeping colombian soldiers from reaching panamas harbors the rebels quickly won.
the new country of panama agreed to accept 10 million in l ang j r tbe united states control over a canal zone ten e me us senators and newspapers and countries all r y r objected to americas gunboat diplomacy but most ofthe public supported the president.
1904 p ditch construction on the canal began in clothes inrit faced terrible conditions.
we had to bathe wash our it said on 6 same r ver drink the same river water and cook with the project tbree cluarters of american workers had quit 560 chapter 28 the majority of employees were workers from the west indies who could not afford to go home.
to prevent deadly yellow fever and malaria crews worked to eliminate the mosquitoes that carried these diseases.
they drained ditches spread oil on swamps and screened doors and windows.
within two years canal workers were no longer dying from these diseases.
a new chief engineer improved housing and strictly organized the huge project.
using dynamite and huge steam shovels men made a wide deep cut through panamas mountains.
the excavated dirt was moved by railroad car to lower elevations.
here workers created earthen dams to form three giant lakes.
engineers supervised the construction of locks a type of gate that would allow water levels to be raised and lowered along the canal.
by the time the 51 mile long canal opened in 1914 roosevelt had left office.
his influence in the panamanian revolution continued to be controversial.
roosevelt himself admitted i took the canal zone in 1921 congress apologized to colombia and gave it 25 million.
but anti american feelings remained high in latin america and panamanians increasingly resented u s control of the canal zone.
in 2000 the united states returned the zone to panama.
the culebra cut shown here was one ofthe engineering miracles that allowed engineers to complete the panama canal in ten years.
millions of pounds of dynamite blasted apart the mountain.
the earth was then used to construct dams to form lakes.
the united states becomes a world poj nationalism devotion to a national or ethnic identity including the desire for independence from rule by foreign countries militarism a policy of glorifying military power and military ideas and values 28 6 the outbreak of world war i by the time the first ship sailed through the panama canal the worlds attention was not on panama but on far off europe.
in august 1914 german troops poured across belgium on their way to try to conquer france.
europe was at war.
tensions in europe european countries had long competed with each other for colonies trade and territory.
by the early 1900s nationalism was complicating these rivalries.
austria hungry had built an empire by taking over smaller countries in the part of eastern europe known as the balkans.
nationalism inspired in the balkan people a burning desire to be independent of austrian rule.
as tensions grew european leaders looked for safety in militarism a policy of glorifying military power and military ideas and values.
when germany built up its navy to challenge great britains fleet great britain constructed more battleships.
as germanys army grew france built up its own army.
european countries also looked for safety in alliances.
in secret treaties germany and austria hungary agreed to help each other in case of attack.
great britain russia and france made similar agreements.
europe was dividing into what amounted to armed camps.
archduke franz ferdinand and his wife are shown here shortly before being assassinated by a serbian nationalist.
the assassination triggered world war i.
assassination leads to war an outburst of nationalism lit the fuse of war.
on june 28 1914 the heir to the austro hungarian throne archduke franz ferdinand was visiting the city of sarajevo in the province of bosnia.
many bosnians were serbs who wanted to be part of nearby serbia instead of austria hungary.
a serbian nationalist jumped out of a crowd and fatally shot the archduke and his wife.
outraged austria hungary accused serbia of having a hand in the assassinations and pressured serbia to give up most of its independence.
when the serbs refused austria hungary declared war.
the russians stepped in to defend the serbs.
the germans came to the aid of austria hungary by declaring war on russia.
russias ally france began to prepare for war.
eventually more than a dozen countries took sides in the great war decades later people called the conflict world war i austria hungary and germany headed the central powers.
france russia and great britain led the allied powers.
like most americans president wood row wilson wanted to stay out of the war.
declaring that the united states would remain neutral wilson begged citizens to be impartial in thought as well as deed.
562 chapter 28 a military tactic called trench warfare was used extensively in world war i.
hundreds of miles of trenches like this trench for british soldiers provided protection for soldiers during attacks and allowed supplies and reinforcements to be delivered to the front.
28 7 a new kind of warfare by september 1914 approximately 6 million soldiers were on the march across europe.
on germanys eastern front german troops fought russians.
on the western front german forces advanced quickly before being stopped by french and british troops at the marne river about 40 miles outside the city of paris.
with neither army able to advance both sides dug long narrow ditches called trenches to protect their soldiers.
trench warfare for the next three years the war in the west was fought from two parallel lines of trenches.
men ate slept fought and died in these miserable ditches.
eventually the lines of trenches stretched for 600 miles across france.
each side protected its front trench with barbed wire and booby traps.
the land between opposing trenches was a deadly no mans land attacking soldiers came under intense fire from the men in the trenches.
thousands upon thousands of soldiers died trying to advance their line of trenches a few yards.
the trenches were wretched places infested with rats lice and disease.
we are not leading the life of men at all wrote an american who had volunteered to fight with the british forces but that of animals living in holes in the ground and only showing outside to fight and to feed new weapons new weapons added to the horror of trench warfare.
we never got anywhere near the germans one english corpo ral remembered.
the machine guns were just mowing the top of the trenches these new machine guns fired hundreds of bullets a min ute.
by the end of 1914 the french had lost 300 000 men.
germany lost more than 130 000 soldiers in a single battle.
ihe unit states becomes a world powej european alliances in world war i tensions in europe caused by nationalism and a military buildup led to war between two alliances the allied powers and the central powers.
the central powers included germany.
german submarines called u boats concentrated on attacking ships around great britain.
the next spring a green cloud floated over the allied lines.
soldiers gasped and died their throats and noses burning.
the germans had invented poison gas.
soon both sides were using chemical weapons.
the armies new technology and strategies were effective for defense but not for decisive attack.
at one point the british tried for six months to advance their lines.
they gained only five miles and lost 420 000 men.
the deadlock here is permanent wrote an american volunteer.
war at sea to supply soldiers in the trenches with food ammunition and other supplies the warring nations bought goods from neutral countries.
each side tried to cut off the flow of supplies to its enemy.
most trade especially with the united states was by sea.
great britain had the world s greatest fleet and numerous ocean ports.
germany had a strong navy but its only access to the ocean was through the north sea.
to close german ports great britain laid mines in the north sea.
this blockade stopped most of the neutral shipping and kept the german fleet bottled up in harbors for most of the war.
unable to use its surface ships the german navy tried to blockade great britain using submarines called u boats for underwater boats.
fearing that the british would try to disguise their ships as neutral germany announced that it might sink vessels flying the flags of neutral countries.
because submarines on the surface were easy targets for enemy fire german submarines began sinking vessels on sight instead of rising to the surface to give warning as was expected even in wartime.
germany sinks the lusitania the german embassy in the unit tes p aced newspaper ads warning passengers not to sail to great ntain an specifically not to take the lusitania a british luxury lncr j 1915 six days after leaving new york the lusitania neared the coast of ireland.
suddenly a ships lookout shouted torpedo coming on the starboard side within moments the ship exploded an quic y sank killing 1 198 people including 128 americans.
564 chapter 28 americans were outraged.
one newspaper called the german attack wholesale murder.
when president wilson protested germany said that the lusitania had been carrying arms.
still germany apologized and offered to pay for damages.
hoping to keep the united states out of the war germany also promised not to attack merchant and passenger ships without warning in the future.
protected by this promise u s manufacturers increased their trade with the allies.
trade with allied countries swelled to 3 2 billion in 1916 while trade with the central powers dropped to 1 million.
americans were not fighting in the war but they had definitely taken sides.
28 8 to make the world safe for democracy after the sinking of the lusitania wilson decided that the united states needed to prepare in case war became necessary.
he worked with congress to get money to improve the army and navy.
still neither wilson nor the country wanted war.
in 1916 wilson won reelection under the slogan he kept us out of war wilson also tried to start peace talks.
but european leaders having lost so many soldiers rejected wilsons call for peace without victory the united states enters the war the germans soon risked war with the united states again.
even though u boats were sinking 50 to 100 british merchant ships per month enough were getting through to keep the allies supplied.
desperate to prevent an allied vie tory the germans decided to cut off british supplies before their own ran out.
in february 1917 germany resumed sinking merchant ships from other countries without warning.
in march u boats torpedoed three u s merchant ships killing many americans.
in fact these ships had been carrying weapons to the allies.
the germans knew that this attack might bring the united states into the war but they hoped to win before america was ready to fight.
it was a fatal mistake.
addressing a special session of congress wilson urged a declaration of war.
america would fight alongside the allies he said not just to protect neutral shipping but because the world must be made safe for democracy congress greeted wilsons speech with applause.
later wilson reflected my message today was a message of death for our young men.
how strange it seems to applaud that.
s ft here woodrow wilson appears before congress to ask for a declaration of war against germany.
although wilson tried to avoid war he felt that continued u boat attacks on merchant ships gave him no choice.

all men between the ages of 18 and 45 had to register.
within a few months the army grew from 200 000 men to over 4 million.
americans prepare to fight on april 6 1917 congress declared war.
the allies rejoiced hoping for u s supplies and soldiers.
allied ships were sinking faster than they could be replaced.
to get u s supplies delivered safely convoys of u s warships started escorting cargo vessels protecting them from attack.
u s destroyers also helped the british navy assault u boats.
these strategies dramatically reduced shipping losses.
when the united states entered the war it had only 200 000 soldiers and most of those had limited training.
congress quickly authorized a national draft.
soon 3 million men had been drafted.
another 2 million volunteered.
fighting and winning u s troops who sailed overseas were called the american expeditionary force aef.
as they began arriving in europe in june 1917 aef soldiers soon learned from the allies about trench warfare.
the u s commander general john j pershing hated these terrible conditions for soldiers.
he also realized that trench warfare was not winning the war.
he worked on a plan for driving the germans out of the trenches and forcing them to retreat into open country.
meanwhile russia had dropped out of the war.
with millions of soldiers dead and starvation spreading across the country russians had revolted against their ruler the czar.
russias new government made peace with the germans.
this enabled germany to bring soldiers back from the east swelling their western forces to 3 500 000 men.
the german forces rushed to capture paris before large numbers of americans could arrive from overseas.
they pushed quickly through me village of chateau thierry and a nearby forest called belleau wood.
they were within 50 miles of paris when americans reinforced the t french gradually u s machine guns and artillery enabled the allies to push the germans back.
by the summer of 1918 more than a million americans were in urope.
pershing set his allied offensive into motion.
his plan took i nta several new technologies that had been developed during ar.

more than 9 million people ering the war late the united states had lost 116 000 lives.
566 chapter 28 28 9 the struggle for peace less than two months after the fighting ended in europe president wilson traveled to paris to take part in peace talks.
he was cheered by huge crowds.
the united states had saved the french from endless war.
and many europeans welcomed wilsons eagerness to prevent future wars.
fourteen points for world peace months earlier wilson had presented to congress a 14 point proposal for a postwar agreement.
the first five points aimed to prevent conflict.
nations were asked to avoid secret treaties to practice free trade and to reduce their weapon supplies.
wilson asked that new borders be drawn based on self determination or the will of the people in each area.
points 6 through 13 described new boundaries for many european countries.
finally the ambitious point 14 called for nations to join a general association of countries to protect each others independence.
wilson called this organization the league of nations.
with the league of nations wilson believed the world could achieve a lasting peace.
germany had surrendered believing that wilsons fourteen points would be the basis for a fair and just peace.
but after years of fighting and dreadful losses some allied leaders were not satisfied with a just peace.
the treaty of versailles on january 18 1919 delegates from dozens of countries assembled at a french palace outside paris called versailles vehr sigh.
in addition to wilson three allied leaders dominated the treaty talks.
they were david lloyd george of england georges clemenceau kleh mahn soh of france and vittorio orlando of italy.
the german representatives were not allowed to speak.
this reflected the allies anger and their determination to punish germany and remove it as a future threat.
they created a treaty that forced germany to disband almost all of its armed forces give up its colonies and surrender territory in europe.
in addition they called on germany to pay reparations or money to make up for damages and war deaths.
the amount of these reparations was later set at 33 billion.
this painting shows the signing ofthe peace treaty that ended world war i.
the treaty dealt harshly with germany and planted the seeds of resentment that would lead to world war ii.
the united states becomes a world power woodrow wilson toured the country seeking public supportforthe league of nations which congress opposed.
when he suffered a massive stroke he was unable to continue his fight and the senate refused to approve the treaty of versailles.
president wilson opposed such harsh treatment of germany.
however he eventually accepted the allied leaders demands for punishment in order to win their support for his fourteen points.
the allies rejected some of wilsons points including freedom of the seas.
but the peace conference did create new national boundaries in europe based on self determination.
most important to wilson the treaty of versailles established a league of nations.
wilson thought that this agreement would make the peace treaty successful.
the league of nations he believed could fix any problems created by the treaty.
struggling for senate ratification wilson needed the approval of two thirds of the u s senate to ratify the peace treaty.
he quickly ran into opposition especially to the league of nations.
some senators worried that other countries would force u s soldiers to fight in international conflicts.
they argued that only congress had the constitutional power to send americans to war.
the struggle over the treaty became a fight between political parties.
republicans held a majority in the senate.
they felt that wilson a democrat had made his fourteen points a political issue by not appointing any republicans to his negotiating team.
anxious to increase public support for the league of nations wil son undertook an intense speaking tour.
in 22 days he toured 29 cities.
he spoke up to four times a day with hardly any rest.
finally he collapsed with severe headaches.
he was rushed back to washington d c where he suffered a massive stroke.
recovering slowly wilson was less willing or able to compromise with opposition senators.
in march 1920 the senate rejected the treaty of versailles.
568 chapter 28 a return to isolationism once again the united states was heading toward a policy of isolationism.
when the league of nations opened in geneva switzerland the united states did not participate in later years when crises developed in europe the league lacked the power that wilson hoped it would have.
in germany the treaty of versailles left a bitter legacy.
germans notably adolf hitler a corporal who had been temporarily blinded by gas during the war felt betrayed by the treaty.
hitlers rise to power in the 1930s would pose a fresh challenge to u s isolationism.
only after a second world war would the united states take on the role of world power that it continues to fill today.

the united states becomes a world power 5i reading further by the early 1900s when this photograph was taken william randolph hearst was building the nation s first great media empire.
hearst was just 32 when he bought the new york journal in 1895.
the yellow press goes to war in the late 1890s an intense battle raged in new york city.
william randolph hearst and joseph pulitzer waged a newspaper war to dominate the city s news business.
they relied on yellow journalism printing sensational stories to attract readers and sell newspapers.
in the process they stirred passions that helped lead to a real war the spanish american war.
william randolph hearst needed a good story.
his newspaper the new york journal was gaining on the citys top paper the new york world.
but he needed a spectacular front page story to grab readers attention and sell more papers.
in the summer of 1897 he got his break.
on august 17 hearsts correspondent in cuba reported that spanish officials there had thrown a young woman into jail.
the story had all the elements hearst was looking for.
the woman evangelina cisneros was the daughter of a cuban rebel fighting spanish rule.
she was 18 years old beautiful and appeared to be innocent.
now the correspondent reported she was being held in a filthy dungeon with hardened criminals.
hearst splashed her story across the front page.
he called for an end to spanish abuses and freedom for the cuban people.
hearst went even further.
he began a petition drive calling on women everywhere to protest the spanish action.
many prominent women signed up including president mckinleys mother.
hearst also launched a daring operation to free cisneros.
he sent a reporter to cuba as a secret agent.
in a dramatic late night prison break the agent freed cisneros and helped her escape to new york.
hearst gave her a thunderous welcome including a parade down fifth avenue and a giant rally at madison square garden.
evangelina cisneros rescued by the journal trumpeted the papers front page headline.
hearst s critics accused him of a hoax saying that spanish authorities had allowed cisneros to escape.
meanwhile hearst took full advantage of the publicity and his role in making history.
he was proud of what he called journalism that acts it does not wait for things to turn up he bragged proudly.
he had a sensational story.
good had triumphed over evil at least in hearsts version.
newspaper sales soared.
the power of the press the cisneros story was typical of hearsts approach to the news business.
newspapers were very important in the late 1800s.
in the days before radio and television they were the main news medium.
they p ayed a key role in making news and influencing public opinion.
new york was the nation s leading newspaper town.
with a population of almost 3 million people it had 15 daily papers with a total 570 chapter 28 circulation of nearly 2 million copies a day.
other cities such as boston chicago and philadelphia also had a thriving press.
but new york papers set the agenda for much of the nations news.
by 1897 the two most popular papers in new york were hearsts journal and joseph pulitzers world.
locked in a battle for readership they used a dramatic style of writing called yellow journalism to boost their appeal.
in fact it was their rivalry that gave birth to the term.
the rise of yellow journalism hearst the son of a wealthy mining baron had bought the journal in 1895.
although it was a small paper at the time he was determined to make it big.
he changed the layout to feature large catchy headlines and striking illustrations.
he filled the pages with society gossip and shocking stories about crime corruption and scandal.
the journal like the world presented itself as a force for truth justice and the rights of the common man.
it cast its reporters as brave heroes who solved crimes and rooted out corruption.
to compete with pulitzer hearst was willing to pay more for good stories.
as a result many journalists left the world and came to work for hearst.
one of those who moved was the cartoonist r f outcault.
his popular cartoon hogans alley featured a street kid who dressed in a bright yellow nightshirt.
the yellow kids antics delighted readers and made the cartoon a big hit for the world.
that is it did until the yellow kid moved to the journal.
to fight back pulitzer produced another version of the cartoon.
suddenly there were two yellow kids in the sunday papers.
people began to refer to the world and the journal as the yellow papers.
and the style of the papers brash bold and sensational became known as yellow journalism.
yellow journalism became the style in many papers around the country but the journal and the world set the pattern.
the granger collection newyork jtonto me wmumd.
wrrinoi at the yellow kid played a key role in the newspaper war between hearst and pulitzer.
as the main character in new york s most popular cartoon he boosted sales of both the journal and the world.
7l l2 fcswssr.
new yorkers could purchase the citys 15 daily newspapers at newsstands around the city.
americans atthetime read newspapers lots of them.
in the late 1800s about 14 000 weekly and 1 900 daily papers were published in the united states.
5j new yorkers could read bulletins about the war s progress on the front of the journal s building as well as in its bold headlines.
the journal and other yellow papers helped push the country toward war.
but they were just one factor.
many americans were opposed to colonial rule and some hoped to annex cuba to the united states.
i i i 3 in their quest for readers the journal and the world were both drawn to the rebellion in cuba.
hearst in particular used the cuban conflict to boost sales.
he clearly believed in the cuban cause.
but he also saw the conflict as a good story that could help him win his circulation war with pulitzer.
the journal ran a steady stream of articles that painted the cuban revolt in black and white terms.
the cuban rebels were noble patriots seeking liberty.
the spanish rulers were heartless villains trying to deny cubans their freedom.
in printing these stories hearst had one goal in mind to push the united states into war.
in fact many of the stories that came out of cuba were false or exaggerated.
spanish officials allowed reporters little access to the fighting.
as a result many correspondents based their stories on flimsy evidence or on no evidence at all.
in 1897 hearst published a series of stories that raised the pressure for war.
the cisneros story was one of these.
another concerned a search of three cuban women on an american ship in havana harbor.
a third reported that a cuban american doctor had been murdered in a cuban jail.
none of these stories was entirely accurate but they all raised a storm of protest in the united states.
more stories followed.
early in 1898 the journal reported that a riot in havana was directed at american citizens when in fact it was not.
then the paper reported on the contents of a stolen letter from the spanish ambassador in which the official called president mckinley weak.
the headline read the worst insult to the united states in its history.
again readers were outraged.
but that story was soon pushed aside by a much bigger event.
on february 15 the u s s.
maine blew up in havana harbor.
although the cause of the blast was unknown both hearst and pulitzer blamed spain.
destruction of the war ship maine was the work of 572 chapter 28 an enemy read the journal s headline.
other inflammatory stories followed.
hearst even published a card game called war with spain two months later hearst got his wish.
congress declared war on spain.
on the journal s front page hearst gloated how do you like the journals war hearst at the front contrary to his claims hearst did not cause the spanish american war.
although the journal and other yellow papers built public support for the war they did not make it happen.
they were just one factor in a set of circumstances that led to war.
hearst was brilliant at self promotion however and he knew that war was good for newspaper sales.
in fact circulation figures continued to rise.
as the war began both the journal and the world were selling more than a million copies a day.
hearst made sure his paper was at the center of the action.
he sent dozens of correspondents to cuba to report on the war.
he even offered to organize and equip a regiment to fight in cuba.
when president mckinley declined his offer hearst proposed sending his own yacht to cuba as a military vessel.
the navy accepted this offer though it rejected hearsts request to command the ship.
denied the chance to fight in cuba hearst went as a reporter.
he fitted out a ship with food and medical supplies and sailed to cuba with some of his staff.
there he filed several stories from the front lines.
he took his reporting duties seriously though he sometimes got in the way of the fighting.
at one point soldiers warned him off the battlefield.
meanwhile the journal and the world continued their own battle for readership.
they sometimes stole each others stories rewriting them and claiming them as their own.
they also accused each other of publishing false stories.
at times they paid more attention to their own squabbles than to the war itself.
both papers spent a lot of money on the war however.
in fact they spent far more than they made back in sales.
by the wars end they were deeply in debt.
to cut their losses pulitzer and hearst agreed to cease their newspaper war.
they toned down their papers thus ending the golden age of yellow journalism.
the two men continued to leave their mark on the news business.
pulitzer funded the country s first journalism school at columbia university.
he also lent his name to the pulitzer prizes journalisms top awards.
hearst went on to build a giant media empire which included radio and film companies.
he continued to shape the news for years to come.
students from columbia university s school of journalism founded by joseph pulitzer celebrate their graduation.
today s journalists work in a wide range of media from television and the internetto newspapers like joseph pulitzer s.

chapter 25 the rise of industry did the benefits of industrialization outweigh the costs.
25 1 introduction the tragedy began late in the afternoon on march 25 1911.
the quitting bell had just sounded at the triangle shirtwaist factory in new york city.
nearly 500 employees most of them young immigrant women headed toward the exit.
it was saturday and they were looking forward to a day off with family and friends.
one woman sniffed the air.
something was burning.
another spotted flames leaping out of a pile of cloth scraps.
before she could react the wooden table above the fabric was ablaze.
from there the flames jumped to the paper fabric patterns hanging above the table.
flaming bits of paper and fabric whirled around the room setting other tables on fire.
the room filled with smoke.
the air became so hot that it burst the windows.
fresh air poured into the room sending the flames even higher.
the fire started to scorch workers clothing and hair.
i heard somebody cry fire i left everything and ran for the door recalled one woman.
the door was locked and immediately there was a great jam of girls before it she could see at once that if we couldnt get out we would all be roasted alive.
factories and their dangers were a relatively new part of life in the united states.
the industrial revolution spread to the united states in the early 1800s.
after the civil war new inventions and business methods allowed americans to create industry on a much larger scale than ever before.
the nation s new mills and factories produced an amazing assortment of goods that made life better for many.
industrial progress though brought not only economic benefits but also serious social costs.
the people who were employed in these new industries often lived and worked in the most miserable even dangerous conditions.
in this chapter you will read the rest of the story of the triangle shirtwaist factory fire.
you will also learn about both the benefits and the costs of industrialization.
this photograph taken around 1910 shows a typical workroom in a sewing factory.
firefighters could do little to stop the blaze that claimed 146 lives at the triangle shirtwaist factory fire in 1911.
unsafe working conditions contributed to the high death toll the rise of industry entrepreneur a person who assembles and organizes the resources necessary to produce goods and services.
entrepreneurs are willing and able to take the risks involved in starting and managing a business.
laissez faire a theory that economies work best when there is minimal involvement from government the granger collection new york industrialization produced a wide range of affordable consumer goods.
giant catalogs like this one offered american families everything from pots and pans to pianos.
25 2 a nation transformed industrialization clearly brought benefits to some.
on march 26 1883 alva vanderbilt threw a party to show off her familys new home in new york city.
it was not just a party it was a grand ball the most dazzling social event in the citys history.
and it was not just any home.
the vanderbilts had built a mansion in the style of a european castle complete with medieval furniture tapestries and armor.
but then the vanderbilts were not just any family.
mrs vanderbilts husband was william kissam vanderbilt a railroad industrialist.
he was the grandson of cornelius vanderbilt who had made a fortune in banking and shipping.
the vanderbilt clan was one of the countrys wealthiest and most powerful families.
more than 1 200 of new yorks social elite flocked to mrs vanderbilts ball dressed in glittering costumes.
many of the guests came as kings and queens.
but mrs vanderbilts sister in law decided to be more modern.
she came dressed as the electric light.
mrs vanderbilts party reflected the way industrialization was transforming american life in the decades after the civil war.
cities like new york were booming.
entrepreneurs in banking commerce and industry were gaining enormous wealth.
technological marvels like the electric light were changing how americans lived and worked.
but as the workers in the triangle shirtwaist factory knew not everyone benefited from this progress.
the growth of big business families like the vanderbilts made huge profits from the growth of big business after the civil war.
businesses got bigger in part because of new technology and manufacturing practices.
they also grew because there was more money to invest in them.
bankers and investors were happy to provide the necessary funds in hopes of earning large returns.
some of the money that fueled industrialization came from the large scale mining of gold and silver in the west.
government policies also contributed to the boom in big business.
according to the theory of laissez faire leh say fair economies work best with minimal government involvement.
laissez faire is french for to let alone.
the idea of laissez faire was that government should not regulate the price or quality of goods the working conditions of laborers or the business practices of bankers and industrialists.
some types of government involvement protected business and industry.
federal state and local governments helped business and industry through favorable laws and subsidies such as the land grants t25a roa s and farmers.
congress passed higher and higher ese made imported goods more expensive and therefore loss competitive with those produced in the united states.
e usiness boom fed the growth of american cities.
for 100 years americans had been going west to seek their fortunes.
in 1890 the ensus ureau said that the frontier line no longer existed.
this was 490 chapter 25 the imaginary line on the continent beyond which the countrys population density was less than two persons per square mile.
the 1890 census marked the closing of the frontier.
the new land of opportunity was located in the cities of the northeast and around the great lakes where factories provided thousands of new jobs.
outside the cities even farming was getting to be big business.
in the midwest commercial farmers used new machinery and techniques to grow crops on a larger scale than ever before.
the wildest dream has become reality marveled one writer in 1887.
nothing is too large for belief twenty and even thirty thousand acre farms and a hundred bushels to the acre.
the new west is a veritable wonderland the gilded age as businesses got bigger so did the fortunes of those who owned or invested in them.
between 1860 and 1892 the number of millionaires in the united states grew from 400 to more than 4 000.
the newly rich filled their palace like homes with elaborate decorations and european art and antiques.
in 1873 the great american writer mark twain dubbed this time of showy wealth the gilded age gilded means overlaid with gold.
twains name stuck but it did not describe the lives of most americans.
while wealthy capitalists lived like royalty many workers lived in dismal poverty.
those who were immigrants often faced prejudice and discrimination.
during business downturns many workers lost their jobs.
people were angry about the relationships between some business owners and politicians that resulted in widespread corruption.
as you will learn these conditions eventually sparked protests and calls for reform.
the vanderbilts were one of the wealthiest and most powerful families of the gilded age.
this is the lavishly decorated dining room of their summer home in newport rhode island.
the rise of industry 25 3 improved technology by the 1860s many of the factors necessary for the rapid industrializa tion of the united states were already in place.
machines had taken over much of the work once done by hand.
work had moved from homes to factories.
railroads had begun to connect customers and manufacturers with an efficient transportation system.
after the civil war new inventions and improved technology prompted the growth of new industries.
some of these innovations or new ideas helped businesses to grow and become more efficient.
others made daily life easier for many americans.
the nation s major steel plants in 1900 were located near or in regions with rich deposits of iron and coal.
railroads shipped ore to mills and finished steel to customers.
the age of steel before the civil war the nations railroads ran on iron rails that wore out quickly.
railroad owners knew that rails made of steel a mixture of iron carbon and sometimes other metals were stronger and would last longer.
steel however was difficult and costly to make.
in 1872 a scottish immigrant named andrew carnegie went to england to study a less expensive method of making steel a method invented by henry bessemer.
carnegie owned a company that made iron bridges for railroads.
he knew that his bridges would be better if they were made of steel.
carnegie was so impressed by the bessemer process that he brought it back to the united states.
the day of iron has passed he announced.
steel is king carnegie was right.
within a decade steel was replacing iron in rails locomotives and bridges.
other industries took advantage of steel which was less expensive than iron.
steel nails needles and knives became common household items.
many steel companies competed fiercely to supply steel for such products.
to remain the leader carnegie hired scientists to improve the quality of his companys steel.
he employed good managers to make his steel mill run efficiently.
his recipe for success was adopt every improvement have the best machinery and know the most.
to keep costs low carnegie set out to control every step in the steelmaking process.
he purchased iron mines to supply his ore coalfields to fire his furnaces and railroads to ship his finished steel to customers.
to reduce his competition carnegie also bought up several 492 chapter 25 rival steel companies.
he then combined them all to form the giant carnegie steel company.
by 1900 carnegie steel produced a quarter of the nations steel.
electric power in 1876 thomas edison opened an invention factory in new jersey.
with a team of workers he set out to create a minor invention every ten days and a major one every six months or so edison succeeded brilliantly.
more than any other inventor he helped turn electricity into an everyday source of light and power.
his workshop turned out the first practical electric lightbulb the phonograph record player the motion picture projector and many other inventions.
in 1882 edison built the first electrical power station and distribution system in new york city.
his team invented everything the system required including generators regulators meters switches light sockets fuse boxes and underground electric cables.
when he finally turned the generator on electricity began to flow to homes stores and factories.
the age of electricity had begun.
by 1900 some 25 million lightbulbs were glowing across the country.
many factories were replacing waterwheels and steam engines with electric motors.
streetcars powered by electricity carried workers and shoppers along city streets.
new electric powered devices such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners were making housework easier.
1 of the new york historical society negative 2946.
thomas edison s invention of the light bulb transformed the nation and gave birth to the age of electricity.
in this picture of new york in the late 1880s electric lines formed a crisscross canopy over the street.
at night these buildings glowed with electric light.
the rise of industry mass production the use of interchangeable parts and assembly lines to make large quantities of identical goods the telephone the telephone was invented by a scottish immigrant alexander graham bell.
in 1876 as he was getting ready to test his talking machine bell spilled acid on himself.
watson come here i want to see you he commanded his assistant.
thomas wat son who was in another room heard every word over bells telephone.
bells invention worked so well that by 1915 americans were communicating with one another over 9 million telephones.
all these telephones made american industry more efficient and competitive by allowing producers sellers and customers to communicate quickly and easily.
new production methods new methods of organizing work were also making businesses more efficient.
factory owners adopted eli whitneys idea of assembling a wide variety of products from interchangeable parts.
they also used the assembly line.
in a shoe factory for example one worker operated a heel cutting machine.
another operated a sole cutting machine.
another made shoelaces.
still other workers assembled labeled and packaged the shoes.
henry ford was one person who foresaw the great potential in the assembly line.
ford created a moving assembly line to mass produce automobiles.
in ford plants workers stood in place all day while a conveyor brought the work to them.
after each worker did one or two tasks the belt moved the product to the next workers station.
these techniques of mass production enabled workers to produce more goods per day at a lower cost.
as prices dropped more americans could afford to buy manufactured products.
more customers meant more factories.
by 1900 almost four times as many americans worked in factories as had a generation earlier.
the triangle factory mass production in new york the triangle shirtwaist factory was just one of many new businesses that took advantage of improved technology to mass produce a quality product at a good price.
the triangle factory specialized in a style of womens blouse known as a shirtwaist.
a shirtwaist had puffy sleeves a neat collar front buttons and a snug waist.
women liked shirtwaists so much that by 1909 new york city had more than 500 factories that made only this style of blouses.
sam bernstein the production manager at the triangle shirtwaist factory loved watching his workers use the newest tools and production methods.
each person at the cutting tables had a special steel knife.
this knife could slice through many layers of fabric at a time.
this meant that a worker could cut dozens of sleeves fronts and backs at one time.
on another floor of the building bernstein could hear the whirring of 240 sewing machines.
the machines were neatly laid out in 16 tightly packed rows.
flexible belts connected each machine to a rotating axle running down each row just above the floor.
this axle which was spun by an electric motor delivered power to the machines.
the machines clattered loudly as 494 chapter 25 lying flat on the lower wing of the 1903 wright flyer orville wright begins the first successful airplane flight in history as his brother wilbur runs alongside during takeoff.
the wright brothers designed and built the flyer out of wood and cloth.
itwas powered by a gasoline engine of the wrights own design.
air transport while henry ford was turning out cars on the assembly line brothers orville and wilbur wright were experimenting with flying.
in 1903 with his brother wilbur running alongside orville successfully piloted the first flying machine in kitty hawk north carolina.
although the flight was only 12 seconds in duration it sparked worldwide interest in flying.
by the late 1920s an industry based on air travel had emerged.
the u s postal service used planes to transport mail across the country while the military used planes for exploration and scouting.
at the same time wealthy americans took their first commercial flights across the country.
women sewed the pieces of shirtwaists together.
piles of finished blouses were then lifted to the floor above by electric freight elevators.
there two rows of workers gave the shirtwaists a final pressing.
finally shipping clerks packed the shirtwaists into boxes for shipment.
usually the factory almost ran itself.
but if a problem occurred the companys switchboard operator could reach bernstein by telephone on any of the factorys three floors.
the rise of industry corporation a business that is owned by many investors trust a group of corporations that unite in order to reduce competition and control prices in a business or an industry monopoly a company that controls all production and sales of a particular product or service in 1901 j p morgan bought carnegie s steel company and turned it into u s steel the nation s first billion dollar corporation.
25 4 the rise of big business when andrew carnegie opened his first factory in 1865 most businesses were still owned by one person or a few partners.
because the owners funds were limited businesses were small.
owners knew their employees and often treated them like family.
growth of corporations a partnership might work well for a garment or clothing factory.
but big businesses such as railroads needed much more capital money to start a business than a few partners could provide.
to raise larger sums of money entrepreneurs set up corporations.
a corporation is a business that is owned by many investors or people who help pay the businesss initial expenses.
a corporation raises funds by selling stock or shares in a business.
investors who buy the stock are known as stockholders.
in return for their investment stockholders hope to receive dividends or a share of the corporations profits.
the money invested by the stockholders is used to build the business.
to make sure their money is used properly stockholders electa board of directors.
the people on the board of directors oversee the running of the corporation.
after the civil war corporations attracted large amounts of money from investors.
by the 1880s thousands of corporations were doing business across the united states.
iiuvacicncr wii irusi a giant in the oil business john u ko efeller introduced another form of business organization thetrus a trust is a group of corporations run by a single board of directo rockefeller invested in his first oil refinery in 1862 at the age o at that time petroleum or oil found underground was just becor a valuable resource.
oil refineries purify petroleum into fuel oil.
e ing the 19th century oil was used to light homes cook food and r engines and generators.
before long many small refineries were competing fiercely in t oil business.
the amount of oil these firms produced rose and fell wildly along with prices.
rockefeller saw this as wasteful and inefl cient.
to reduce competition he did everything he could to drive 1 rivals out of business.
companies he could not destroy he bought.
li e carnegie rockefeller took control of every step of his bu ss.
he bought oil fields along with railroads pipelines and ship i rove is his own warehouses and even made his c oi barrels for storing oil products.
by 1880 rockefeller controllec 95 percent of the nations oil refining industry.

following rockefellers example entrepreneurs created trusts in other businesses such as railroads meatpacking sugar whiskey and tobacco.
the business leaders who controlled these huge trusts became fabulously wealthy because most had made their fortunes by crushing their competitors critics called them robber barons the evils of trusts the growth of trusts alarmed many americans.
they saw these monopolies as a threat to the free enterprise system.
this system depends on free competition among businesses to provide the public quality products at fair prices.
a monopoly people argued has little reason to improve its products or to keep prices low because it has no competition.
people also worried about the influence of trusts on the political process.
wealthy entrepreneurs they complained were using their enormous wealth to buy elections and corrupt public officials.
as the chicago tribune warned liberty and monopoly cannot live together.
the triangle factory the owners the triangle shirtwaist factory would never be the size of u s steel or standard oil.
however it was the largest shirtwaist factory in the entire country.
the two men who owned the factory max blanck and isaac harris were famous in the garment indus try and had been nicknamed the shirtwaist kings the owners worked well together.
while blanck entertained buyers from stores to convince them to carry triangle products harris ran the factory.
harris kept up with garment production machinery maintenance and work flow.
he did not however try to keep up with his workforce.
the factory had too many workers for him to get to know them all personally.
the shirtwaist business made blanck and harris very wealthy.
they drove fancy cars and enjoyed comforts that their workers could only dream about.
both had worked hard in a competitive business and probably felt they had earned their success.
the rise of industry 25 5 the growth of cities industrialization brought with it urbanization or city growth.
most of the nations new industries were located in urban areas.
immigrants and rural americans flocked to these industrial centers looking for jobs.
chicago for example more than tripled its population between 1880 and 1900.
urban tenements as urban populations increased demand for cheap housing exploded.
to meet this demand developers threw up cheap apartment buildings called tenements.
one person described tenements as great prison like structures of brick with narrow doors and windows cramped passages and steep rickety stairs by 1900 about two thirds of new yorkers lived in such buildings.
a poor family might occupy just one or two rooms in a tenement usually with no heat or water.
friends or family often took in newcomers who arrived in cities without money for rent.
as a result tenement neighborhoods were some of the most densely populated areas on earth.
tenements were unclean and even dangerous places to live.
only a few rooms had windows to provide light and fresh air.
the rest were this family is shown in a new york city tenement in the early 1900s.
cramped dirty dark and crowded tenements spread disease and misery among inhabitants.
the triangle factory the building and the workers blanck and harris located their thriving shirtwaist business on the top three floors of the ten story asch building in new york city.
they chose this space partly because of the morning sunlight that streamed in through the large windows.
their landlord joseph asch stated that when construction was completed in 1901 the architects claimed my building was ahead of any other building of its kind which had previously been constructed it may have been ahead of other buildings but the asch building was far from perfect.
it had only two staircases even though the city building code required three.
the city had agreed to count the buildings fire escape as the third staircase.
but the fire escape ended at the second floor.
nor was the asch building well de signed for evacuation during an emergency.
its staircases were narrow.
in addition instead of opening outward to let people escape easily the buildings doors opened inward.
despite previous scares from several small fires in the building asch had not addressed any of these problems.
the triangle factorys workforce was made up primarily of young immigrant women.
most of these women were italians and jews from eastern europe.
often their 498 chapter 25 dark and airless.
in some tenements the only source of water was a single faucet in a courtyard.
many lacked sewer services.
in such conditions diseases such as typhoid and cholera spread quickly killing infants and young children.
fire was another constant worry.
cities expand upward as cities expanded urban land costs shot up.
in new york land that had sold for 80 in 1804 was selling for 8 000 by 1880.
such prices inspired builders to construct more building space on less land by expanding upward.
using lightweight steel beams to support walls and ceilings builders constructed skyscrapers that rose ten or more stories into the air.
electric elevators whisked people and freight effortlessly from floor to floor.
businesspeople rented space in city skyscrapers for their offices and factories.
factory owners preferred the top floors.
rents were cheaper higher up and the natural light was better saving owners money on electric lighting.
the cost of insurance was low as well because steel buildings were thought to be fireproof.
by the early 1900s more than half of new york citys workers labored above the seventh floor.
urbanization the growth of cities city excitement for all their problems cities were also exciting places to live.
stores were filled with products never seen by people who had grown up on farms.
city dwellers enjoyed all sorts of entertainment from operas and art museums to dance halls and sporting events.
when writer hamlin garland came to chicago with his brother he found that everything interested us.
nothing was commonplace nothing was ugly to us jobs provided their familys only source of income.
even if these workers had been aware of the buildings safety problems they would have hesitated to demand improvements for fear of being fired.
like most factory workers triangle employees could afford housing only in crowded slums.
t lived in a two room tenement with my mother and two sisters and the bedroom had no windows recalled one employee.
there was nothing to look forward to the workers a the triangle shirtwaist factor lived in tenements like this one.
the were not paid enough to afford better housing.
ihe rise of industry this young girl stands between looms in a textile factory.
atthe turn of the century millions of children worked long hours in mines mills and factories.
25 6 working conditions working conditions in most industries were appalling.
gone were the days when business owners knew and cared about the people who worked for them.
men like carnegie and rockefeller knew little about their workers.
working families gone too were the days when factory workers could expect decent pay.
with so many people looking for jobs business owners could pay low wages.
many wages were so low that men the triangle factory a hazardous workplace saturday was payday at the triangle shirtwaist factory.
most workers earned only 9 per week with the most experienced employees making up to 12.
the younger workers some only 13 years old earned just 6 per week for sewing on buttons all day.
the very youngest earned even less.
worker pauline newman recalled we were young eight nine ten years old.
the hours were from 7 30 in the morning to 6 30 at night when it wasn t busy.
when the busy season was on we worked until 9 o clock.
no overtime pay not even supper money.
my wages were 1 50 for a seven day week.
these pay rates were what workers earned before deductions.
the company charged its employees for the thread and electricity they used for the chairs they sat on and even for using triangles coat lockers.
employees were expected to work at least 59 hours a week.
this included every saturday plus occasional sundays.
to keep workers from claiming overtime pay the managers sometimes set the clock back.
to keep workers from being interrupted the heavy steel doors to the hall and stairs were locked until closing time.
to make sure workers didnt steal the factory built a narrow corridor leading to the elevators.
every day at quitting time employees filed through this corridor one at a time so that a watchman could inspect each womans handbag.
working at triangle was unhealthy uncomfortable and unsafe.
managers seldom let workers leave to use the bathroom or to drink from the dirty 500 chapter 25 could not support their families.
to get by wives and children had to work as well usually at even lower wages.
most factory women earned about 1 to 3 per day.
if business was slow wages dropped.
a boss might not pay a new worker anything until she had learned her job.
then he would charge her for maintaining the sewing machine she worked on.
if a worker complained she could easily be replaced with a new one perhaps for less money.
millions of young children worked in mines mills and factories.
a newspaper reported that young boys hired by coal miners to separate lumps of coal from rocks go to work at seven oclock in the morning and work till it is too dark to see any longer.
for this they get 1 to 3 a week they also got curved spines from bending over piles of coal all day.
inside the factories mills and factories were hot in summer and cold in winter.
to keep costs low owners crowded workers together rather than finding additional space.
of all workplace dangers fire claimed the most lives.
in new york tall buildings often lacked fire escapes.
new york citys fire chief wanted buildings to have fire escapes and sprinkler systems that could put out fires quickly.
but factory owners objected to such expenses.
new york city did require that factory doors open outwardly and shall not be locked so workers might escape quickly in a fire.
the law was not enforced however.
in 1910 about 94 percent of all factory doors in the city opened inward instead of outward.
tap in the hallway.
in the sewing room women could barely squeeze by each others machines without catching their clothes in the moving parts.
the chairs often lacked backs to support the sewers while they worked.
with all the machines in use the noise could be deafening.
fire hazards abounded.
the city prohibited smoking but the factory rarely enforced that rule.
workers stuffed leftover fabric into wooden bins where it sat for months just waiting for a spark to set it ablaze.
the buildings only fire protection was a few hundred pails of water scattered throughout its ten floors.
the rise of industry labor union an organization that brings together workers in the same trade or job to fight for better wages and working conditions t strikes often pitted police against labor organizers.
this painting shows a policeman being shot on haymarket square in chicago during a strike of the knights of labor in 1886.
25 7 labor unions as a teenager rose schneiderman found work in a cap factory.
after three years she later wrote it began to dawn on me that we girls needed an organization.
we were helpless no one girl dare stand up for anything alone workers like schneiderman had been forming unions since the 1830s.
these early organizations were labor unions.
they organized workers in the same trade or job to fight for better wages and working conditions.
sometimes workers in these unions went out on strike refusing to work until their employers agreed to meet their demands.
the triangle factory fire ends in tragedy about 5 000 workers from the triangle shirtwaist factory were part of the strike of 1909.
their demands included unlocked doors during working hours and safer fire escapes in the asch building.
rather than meet those demands blanck and harris responded by locking the strikers out of the factory and advertising for replacements.
if the union had won we would have been safe said striker rose safran.
but the bosses defeated us and we didnt get the open doors or the better fire escapes because of that defeat 146 workers would die tragically.
the cause of the fire that swept through the triangle shirtwaist factory in 1911 was never known.
but one saturday afternoon people on the eighth floor began to cry fire within minutes the entire floor was a mass of flames escaping workers rushed to the stairs or pushed their way into the two small elevators.
the stairs however were soon ablaze and the elevators stopped running.
on the tenth floor mary alter was warned of the fire by telephone.
owner isaac harris and production manager sam bernstein led some people out onto the roof.
people from nearby buildings stretched ladders between the rooftops to help those on the roof escape.
workers on the ninth floor had no warning.
the fire just appeared.
some women died immediately.
firemen later found them as skeletons bending over sewing machines those who had time to escape found themselves trapped by the locked factory door.
in desperation they rushed to the windows and began to jump.
the crowd that gathered outside the asch building watched in horror as girls began to fall out of the sky ffte streaming back from their hair and dresses and drop to their deaths on the pavement below.
firefighters arrived quickly but had trouble bringing their equipment close to the build 502 chapter 25 knights of labor in 1869 uriah stephens organized a new union known as the knights of labor.
stephens hoped to unite men and women of every craft creed and color into one common brotherhood the knights led several successful strikes against telegraph and railroad companies.
with such victories the union grew to over 700 000 members.
in 1886 nearly 200 000 workers went on strike nationwide to demand an eight hour workday.
during a rally at haymarket square in chicago someone threw a bomb at police.
the police shot back injuring many workers.
four workers were sentenced to death for the bombing even though no evidence tied them to the bomb.
fearing more violence employers fired anyone associated with the knights.
membership dropped quickly and the organization faded away.
american federation of labor as the number of knights declined a group of local trade unions formed the american federation of labor.
led by samuel gompers the afl tried to negotiate agreements with employers on such issues as wages.
despite the afls peaceful approach many employers made their workers sign pledges not to join unions.
they also fired union members and exchanged lists of such troublemakers with other employers.

there was little the firemen could do however.
their ladders were not tall enough to reach beyond the sixth floor.
their safety nets were just as useless.
the workers fell with such force said one fireman that they went right through the life nets it was all over in half an hour.

the homestead strike some business owners used force to defeat unions.
when workers struck at a carnegie steel plant in homestead pennsylvania henry clay frick carnegies partner refused to talk about their demands.
instead frick made plans to reopen his plant with non union workers.
to protect these strikebreakers he hired 300 armed guards.
when the guards arrived in homestead they faced an angry crowd of strikers.
a battle broke out in which both guards and strikers died.
still frick went ahead with his plan.
when the homestead plant reopened with strikebreakers the union collapsed in defeat.
working women organize such tactics kept many women from joining unions but not rose schneiderman.
upset by pay cuts schneiderman organized the women in her factory as part of the national board of united cloth hat and cap makers.
soon after she joined the union she wrote a strike was declared in five of the biggest factories.
there are 30 factories in the city.
about 100 girls went out.
the result was a victory which netted us i mean the girls 2 increase in our wages on the average.
but all was not lovely by any means for the bosses were not at all pleased with their beating and had determined to fight us again.

a nation transformed rapid industrialization transformed american life in the decades following the civil war.
entrepreneurs in banking commerce and industry amassed enormous wealth.
businesses grew larger in part because of new technologies new investors and policies such as laissez faire.
according to this theory economies work best when governments do not interfere.
improved technology new inventions and manufacturing methods prompted the growth of new industries.
a less expensive method of making steel made it possible for businesses to grow in size and efficiency.
other inventions such as the electric light and the telephone made daily life easier for many americans.
the rise of big business while new innovations allowed more americans to afford manufactured items there was a hidden price.
with the rise of big business through corporations trusts such as rockefellers standard oil trust and monopolies the wealthy got wealthier and the poor got poorer.
ihe growth of cities as cities grew factories rose ten or more stories above the ground and people from all over came looking for jobs.

workers didn t dare speak up for fear of losing their jobs.
labor unions by joining labor unions workers could fight as a group for better wages and working conditions.
when organized workers went on strike factory owners often responded with violence or by hiring non union workers.
although labor unions had some successes many factories remained unsafe.

the rise of industry reading further edison suffered a hearing loss as a child.
but he turned his disability into an advantage in his career as a telegraph operator.
unlike other operators he said i was not bothered by the noise of the other instruments.
his efforts to improve the telegraph led eventually to his invention of the phonograph a machine that played recorded sound.
the celebrity inventor thomas alva edison was a legend in his own time.
in part his fame came from inventing things that changed peoples lives things we take for granted today like recorded music the lightbulb and movies.
edison was also a legend because he invented his own image.
he knew howto get publicity and make himself a star.
from her home in norton kansas mrs w g lathrop felt moved to write a fan letter.
the letter wasnt going to a rock star a movie star or a sports hero.
it was 1921 and mrs lathrop was writing a fan letter to her favorite inventor thomas edison.
dear sir she began it is not always the privilege of a woman to thank personally the inventor of articles which make life livable for her sex.
i feel that it is my duty as well as privilege to tell you how much we women of the small town are indebted to you.
positively as i hear my wash machine chugging along as i write this it does seem as though i am entirely dependent on the fertile brain of one who is thousand of miles away for every pleasure and labor saving device i have.
lathrop then filled in the specifics.
she described how edisons inventions affected a typical day in her life.
the house is lighted by electricity.
i cook on a westinghouse electric range wash dishes in an electric dishwasher.
an electric fan even helps to distribute the heat over part of the house.
i wash clothes with an electric machine and iron on an electric mangle pressing machine and with an electric iron.
i clean house with electric cleaners.
i rest take an electric massage and curl my hair on an electric iron.
then start the victrola record player and listen to music forgetting that tm living in a tiny town of two thousand where nothing much ever happens.
it is strange today to think about writing a letter like this one.
but thomas edison was a celebrity.
how did an inventor someone who worked in a laboratory that was anything but glamorous become so famous and well loved.
the invention that launched the legend no one but his mother would have guessed that little thomas edison wou d one day become a famous inventor.
he was a poor student w t 7 and distracted he doodled and didnt complete his lessons.
a such a hard time at school that after only three months his mother decided to teach him at home.
506 chapter 25 when he was 15 edison learned how to run a telegraph machine.
the telegraph used bursts of electric current to send messages quickly over long distances.
edison was fascinated by the machine.
it was while trying to improve the telegraph that edison made a momentous discovery.
he developed a machine that could record and transmit the sound of a human voice.
he called it a phonograph.
it is hard to imagine today just how amazing this was.
until the phonograph people had only heard the voices of those who were physically near them.
but edison had made a machine that could record a voice.
the recording could be played when the speaker was nowhere to be seen.
it could in fact be played long after the speaker had died.
the phonograph seemed magical.
soon a promoter was traveling the country demonstrating how the phonograph worked.
audiences were thrilled.
you should hear me bring down the house by singing in the phonograph.
the effect when they hear me is stupendous but when they hear the phonograph reproducing my song with all its imperfections they endanger the walls with clamor.
edward johnson 1878 the new york sun newspaper ran this headline about edison and his phonograph on february 22 1878 a man of thirty one revolutionizing the whole world thomas edison became a celebrity.
once edison saw the publics enthusiasm he was more than happy to promote the new machine.
by mid 1878 he published a list often possible uses for the phonograph.
the list included recording books music and lectures.
edison also thought the phonograph could be used to teach languages and write letters.
today we use recordings for all those purposes and many more that even edison could never have dreamed up.
the phonograph amazed people around the world.
in this advertisement a smiling uncle sam shows off one of the cylinders used to play recorded sound.
within aboutten years after its invention the phonograph had become a commercial product.
forthe first time people could listen and dance to recorded music.
genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration edison was fond of saying.
his adoring public loved both images inspired genius and hardworking inventor.
in his lab in menlo park new jersey edison worked with assistants for two years to create a successful electric light.
electricity and the lightbulb edison is most famous today for inventing the electric lightbulb.
in fact other inventors had been working on lightbulbs for 50 years.
but it was edison who solved the problem that had plagued them all how to make a bulb that would burn for more than just a few minutes.
a lightbulb works by electric current moving through a filament thread.
when the filament gets hot it gives off light.
other inventors knew this but they had not been able to figure out what kind of filament to use.
after years of trying to use platinum edison switched to carbon.
a carbon coated thread did the trick.
it would not melt or catch fire and it could produce light for hours.
in october 1879 the new york herald poetically described the light emitted by edison s bulb.
it was like the mellow sunset of an italian autumn a little globe of sunshine a veritable aladdins lamp reporter marshall fox gushed.
better yet it stayed lit for 13 and a half hours.
previous bulbs had lit up for only a few minutes.
a full year before he so impressed the new york herald edison had announced that making a lightbulb was so simple that everybody will wonder why they have never thought of it unfortunately it was not so simple.
when edison made that statement he was still strug g ing to get his electric lightbulb to work.
but he was happy to keep i c interested with promises that the light from his bulb would last almost forever at the same time that edison was working on the lightbulb he k m workin8 on a way to distribute electricity.
he planned to a pwer plant on pearl street in lower manhattan.
the power plan would ugh the whole neighborhood.

but it was not the earth shattering 508 chapter 25 event that some books describe.
it had taken edison four years to fulfill his promise of centrally generated electricity.
the public had become bored.
for his part edison was eager to start making money from his years of hard work.
he was also ready to cement his reputation as an earth changing inventor regardless of how long it took him to follow through on his promises.
an inventor who changed the world edison kept his inventions coming.
as the 1800s came to a close he applied himself and his staff to making moving pictures.
he called his device a kinetoscope which means an instrument for viewing movement he promised that it would do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear as with the phonograph edison did not immediately see how much people would like moving pictures.
and as with the lightbulb he was not the only inventor working on the device.
edison faced stiff competition.
but in 1897 he starred in his own 30 second moving picture mr edison at work in his chemical laboratory.
the public loved it.
thomas edison had indeed changed the world.
he invented and helped invent through his competition with others the phonograph the electric lightbulb the centralized distribution of electricity the movies and more.
it is nearly impossible to imagine life today without any one of these or the later inventions they led to.
decades before he died edison reached heights of celebrity and fame.
the man who defeated darkness the dean of inventors and the greatest citizen of the world are just some of the titles given to him.
he was happy to accept the praise and people today are happy to accept his inventions.
muj thomas edison was a savvy businessman.
when he boughtthe rights to another successful projector he took full credit for its invention and called it the vitascope.
the new movie projector could turn these 45 still pictures of a man sneezing right into a five second moving picture.

chapter 24 tensions in the west how did settlers change the west and affect american indians.
24 1 introduction in the spring of 1889 two white women arrived at the nez perce lands in lapwai idaho.
one of them jane gay had nursed soldiers during the civil war.
the other alice fletcher had been a leader in the growing movement for women s rights.
now a new cause had brought these women west.
they wanted to improve the lives of american indians.
gay and fletcher were just two of the thousands of americans who moved west after the civil war.
as you have read during this period politicians in the east were arguing over reconstruction.
meanwhile railroad builders miners ranchers and farmers continued to move westward.
in this chapter you will learn how the settlers dreams of freedom and opportunity clashed with the dreams of the american indians who already lived in the west.
the conflict between settlers and indians was not just a fight over land.
it was a conflict between two very different cultures and ways of seeing the world.
jane gay and alice fletcher discovered these deep differences soon after they arrived at lapwai.
like other indians the nez perce had already been forced onto reservations areas of land set aside by the government to make way for new settlers.
now fletcher told the indians that the government wanted to divide the lapwai reservation into farm plots.
each family would receive one plot.
then the nez perce could live like other americans.
the indians listened in stony silence.
settlers might think of owning a plot of land as a way to be free.
but to a nez perce being tied to one spot of earth would be like being in jail.
finally one man spoke we do not want our land cut up in little pieces the indian said.
we have not told you to do it.
this indians words show why tensions were bound to develop between settlers and american indians.
as you read about the nez perce and other indian groups you will discover the great impact that the settlement of the west had on american indians.
hardware stores like this one in nebraska in 1886 supplied tools for farmers and ranchers settling in the west.
the settlement of the west had a devastating effect on the indians who lived there.
chief joseph became the leader of the nez perce indians in 1871.
this portrait was made around 1897.
tensions in the west nez perce war chief looking glass shown here joined chief joseph in leading about700 nez perce on their flight to escape relocation to a reservation.
reservation an area of land set aside by the federal government for the use of an american indian tribe 24 2 the nez perce for centuries the nez perce freely roamed the lush mountains and valleys where oregon washington and idaho come together today.
their name which means pierced nose in french was given to them by french explorers.
the french had confused the nez perce with other indians who decorated their noses with pieces of shell.
in reality the nez perce did not usually pierce their noses or wear nose ornaments.
when horses arrived in the northwest in the 1700s the nez perce became expert riders and horse breeders.
they developed their own special breed the appaloosa.
these beautiful spotted horses were fast and strong.
the nez perce trained them to ride into stampeding buffalo herds and single out one animal for the kill.
the nez perce treasured their homeland and way of life.
but after the civil war more and more settlers came from the east to settle in the pacific northwest.
the world of the nez perce would never be the same.
friendship with whites for decades the nez perce were among the friendliest of all western indians toward whites.
in 1805 they saved lewis and clark and their expedition from starvation.
they were also friendly with the first trappers traders and missionaries who came to the northwest.
the nez perce had never killed a white person.
americans hunger for land and riches finally broke that friendship.
in the 1860s miners swarmed over nez perce land looking for gold.
settlers followed.
some nez perce signed treaties in which they agreed to give up their land and move to a reservation in lapwai idaho.
other members of the nez perce tribe refused to sign any treaty.
one of these no treaty groups of nez perce lived in the wallowa valley of eastern oregon.
it was led by a man whose indian name meant thunder rolling in the mountains the settlers called him chief joseph.
in 1877 representatives of the u s government presented chief joseph with a terrible choice.
you can give up your land peacefully and move to lapwai they told him or army troops will come and force you to relocate there.
fearing a war he could not win chief joseph agreed to move.
i would give up everything he said rather than have the blood of white men upon the hands of my people blood is shed that summer 700 nez perce left the wallowa valley their hearts filled with bitterness.
one night a group of angry young warriors slipped out of camp and murdered several whites.
chief joseph knew that the killings would bring soldiers to punish his people.
for the first time the nez perce would be at war with whites.
the soldiers came.
still hoping to avoid war indians carrying the white flag of peace came forward to talk.
the troops opened fire anyway.
minutes later 34 soldiers lay dead.
i have been in lots of apes reported a survivor but i never went up against anything like the nez perces in all my life 470 chapter 24 the flight to canada in desperation the nez perce headed for the one place where they might still live free canada.
for the next three months chief joseph led the u s army on a chase of more than 1 000 miles through rugged mountain country.
although greatly outnumbered his warriors won several battles.
the chase ended less than 40 miles from the canadian border.
forced to surrender chief joseph spoke his heart in these words i am tired of fighting.
our chiefs are killed.
the old men are all dead.
it is cold and we have no blankets.
the little children are freezing to death.
my people some of them have run away to the hills and have no blankets no food no one knows where they are.
hear me my chiefs.
i am tired my heart is sick and sad.
from where the sun now stands i will fight no more forever.
after their surrender in 1877 chief joseph and his followers were sent to a barren reservation in oklahoma.
there they began to fall sick and die.
soon they had a cemetery just for babies with more than a hundred graves.
chief joseph begged the government to allow his people to join the rest of the nez perce in lapwai.
although some did go to lapwai others including chief joseph were sent to the colville reservation in washington in 1885.
they never went back to their homeland.
when chief joseph died in 1904 the doctor listed the cause of death as a broken heart tensions in the west i 4 as settlers moved west they seized more and more land from the american indians who lived and hunted there.
here we see an american indian village near fort laramie in what is now wyoming.
24 3 new interest in the west settlers had been gradually forcing american indians from their land ever since the first colonists arrived in north america.
still by the start of the civil war the west was populated mostly by indians and huge herds of buffalo.
then in 1862 congress passed two laws that stirred new interest in the west the homestead act and the pacific railway act.
homesteader a farmer who is given a plot of public land or homestead in return for cultivating it transcontinental railroad a railroad that crosses a continent subsidy money or other things of value such as land that a government contributes to an enterprise considered to benefit the public the homestead act the homestead act offered farmers 160 acres of public land in the west for free.
all the farmer or homesteader had to do was clear the land and farm it for five years.
at the end of that time the homesteader received ownership of the land.
the impact of the new law was enormous.
year after year the promise of free land drew hopeful homesteaders westward.
between 1860 and 1910 the number of farms in the united states tripled from 2 million to more than 6 million.
i i the pacific railway act the pacific railway act called for the building of a transcontinental railroad to link the atlantic and pacific coasts.
this huge construction project was given to two railroad companies the union pacific and the central pacific.
to help the railroad companies pay for the project congress gave them subsidies in the form of sections of free land for every mile of track they laid.
the railroads could sell this land to settlers later.
the government also loaned the two companies more than 60 million.
472 chapter 24 the pacific railway act kicked off the greatest period of railroad construction in the nations history.
by 1900 the railroads had laid 170 000 miles of track much of it in the west.
rail barons like the central pacifics leland stanford and charles crocker made vast fortunes.
railroads opened the west to a flood of new settlers.
the newcomers included farmers and ranchers prospectors and preachers and more than a few crooks.
but most were ordinary people who dreamed of a new start.
for them the west was a place where a lot of hard work and a little luck could make their dreams come true.
24 4 railroad builders the plan for building a transcontinental railroad looked simple enough on paper.
the union pacific would start in nebraska and build tracks westward across the great plains and the rocky mountains.
meanwhile the central pacific would start in california and lay tracks eastward across the mountains of the sierra nevada and then across the great basin.
the two lines would meet somewhere in between the starting points.
the company that laid the most track would get more land more loans and more profits.
laying track was hard work.
first the surveyors studied the land and chose the route for the tracks.
they were followed by the graders who prepared the land.
armed with picks and shovels the graders cut through hills and filled up valleys to make the route as level as possible.
next came the tracklayers.
they put down wooden ties and hauled in heavy iron rails.
one rail weighed 700 pounds and there were 400 rails in each mile of track.
last came the spikers.
the spikers nailed the rails to the ties with spikes ten spikes per rail three hammer blows for every spike.
this group of workers photographed in 1866 paused to look atthe camera as they hauled heavy railsto lay trackfor the union pacific railroad.
american indians depended on the buffalo for food shelter and clothing.
as the railroad moved west hunters shot buffalo out the windows of trains.
by 1900 there were fewer than 50 buffalo left in the united states.
the union pacific builds west the union pacific railroad got off to a slow start.
then in 1866 a former civil war general named grenville dodge took charge of construction.
dodge had built railroads before the war and as a military officer he knew how to lead men.
now he commanded a force of 10 000 workers.
most of them were irish immigrants who were fleeing the slums of eastern cities.
they were joined by other immigrants ex soldiers mexicans and freed slaves.
all were young men who needed jobs.
most of all they hoped to start new lives in the open spaces of the west.
by 1867 dodges crews were laying as much as seven miles of track a day across the plains.
the workers lived in tent cities that followed the tracks west.
these portable towns were rough and often dangerous places.
a reporter wrote not a day passes but a dead body is found somewhere in the vicinity with pockets rifled of their contents for the plains indians the railroad was an invasion of their homeland.
they watched as millions of buffalo were slaughtered to feed railroad workers destroying their main source of food.
some indian warriors attacked the work crews and derailed supply trains by prying up sections of track.
grenville dodge demanded military help and soon he had 5 000 troops guarding his crews as they inched their way west.
474 chapter 24 chinese laborers were recruited to do the backbreaking work required to lay rails across the sierra nevada.
the central pacific builds east in california the central pacific railroad faced different problems.
soon after the company began laying track many of the workers dashed off to newly discovered silver mines in nevada.
construction practically stopped.
in desperation charles crocker the head of construction hired 50 chinese workers.
he doubted that the chinese were big enough to do heavy construction.
but the chinese surprised him.
they could do as much work in a day as any other crew and often more.
crocker was so impressed that he sent agents to china to hire more workers.
the agents were lucky.
war and unrest had driven millions of chinese into poverty and debt.
young men jumped at the chance of going to america to build a railroad.
most of them planned to save their money and return to china as wealthy men.
more than 12 000 chinese laborers worked for the central pacific.
they cleared trees shoveled dirt blasted tunnels and laid tracks.
at least 1 000 chinese workers lost their lives in explosions snow slides and other accidents.
despite these losses the workers managed to lay up to ten miles of track in a day.
the two lines meet on may 10 1869 the two lines came together at promontory summit in utah territory.
a golden spike was driven in to complete the 1 800 miles of track.
in time a network of railroads would bring new settlers encourage the construction of towns and cities and allow mail and supplies to be shipped clear across the country.
the chinese workers who had contributed so much to building the railroad were not acknowledged at the celebration.
their reward for their years of hard work was to lose their jobs.
a few of them fulfilled their dream of returning to china.
but most stayed on in america helping to build new farms and businesses across the west.
tensions in the west 4 the discovery of gold or silver often resulted in instant towns throughout the west.
pictured here is leadville colorado in the 1870s.
24 5 miners a second group of pioneers the miners dreamed of striking it rich.
the discovery of gold in california in 1848 set off a great treasure hunt in the mountains and deserts of the west.
by 1874 gold or silver had been found in what are now the states of california oregon washington nevada montana colorado arizona and new mexico.
although some immigrants also came to seek their fortunes most miners were young white american males who dreamed of striking it rich.
boomtowns and ghost towns mining in the west followed a predictable pattern.
first came the discovery of gold or silver.
soon fortune seekers from around the world flocked to the site.
almost overnight mining camps grew into fast growing settlements called boomtowns.
newspaper reporter j ross browne described the birth of one such town gila city in present day arizona enterprising men hurried to the spot with barrels of whiskey and billiards tables.
traders crowded in with wagons of pork and beans.
gamblers came with cards.
there was everything in gila city within a few months but a church and a jail.
boomtowns had no government no law and little order.
robbery an murder were common.
miners fought back by forming vigilant committees to control crime.
the members of these committees called 476 chapter 24 vigilantes handed out quick justice.
a suspected murderer might be arrested tried convicted and hanged all in the same day.
if asked about their methods the vigilantes pointed out that there were no courts or jails nearby.
no miner had time to waste guarding criminals.
when the easy to find gold or silver was gone most miners moved on.
just seven years after its birth for example gila city was a ghost town.
all that remained wrote browne were three chimneys and a coyote mining changes the west in many ways mining was destructive.
it damaged the land and displaced many american indians.
but most americans saw mining as a source of wealth and opportunity.
some boomtowns like reno and denver survived to become prosperous cities.
mining also opened up the wests mountains and deserts to other settlers.
some were businesspeople who invested in the heavy equipment needed to extract hard to find ore from western mountains.
others were farmers and ranchers.
these were the people who would turn territories into new western states.
24 6 ranchers and cowboys a third group of western settlers consisted of ranchers and the cowboys who tended their herds of cattle.
at the end of the civil war millions of longhorn cattle roamed the texas plains.
the cattle earned their name from their impressive horns which could measure more than seven feet from tip to tip.
the market for all this beef was the crowded cities of the east.
cattle worth 3 a head in texas might be sold for 50 in new york or chicago.
the problem was how to transport the cattle to the cities.
this challenge was complicated by the presence of indians and stampeding buffalo herds.
the extermination of the buffalo the railroads made the ranchers task much easier.
as the railroads moved onto the great plains buffalo hunters followed.
the hunters killed huge numbers of buffalo for their hides and bones which were shipped by rail for sale in the east.
the plains indians who depended on the buffalo for food were horrified by the slaughter.
so were some other americans.
in 1874 congress passed a bill outlawing the killing of more buffalo than could be used for food.
but president grant refused to sign the bill into law.
general philip sheridan supported grants decision.
you ought to give each hunter a medal he said.
let them kill skin and sell until the buffalo are exterminated wiped out.
then your prairies can be covered with cattle and the cowboy.
by 1880 the buffalo had all but vanished.
with their foodgone t e plains indians had little choice but to move to reservations.
the plains were now open to ranchers and their cattle.
cowboys like nat love moved out west to herd cattle.
many cowboys dreamed of getting their own herd and making their fortune in the rapidly growing cattle empire.
tensions in the i dodge city kansas was a wild cow town.
when cowboys reached the end of the drive they were ready for adventure.
the long drive the railroads also solved the ranchers transportation problem.
in 1867 joseph mccoy built a stockyard next to the railroad in abilene kansas.
a stockyard is a large holding pen where cattle are kept temporarily.
that summer cowboys herded a few thousand cattle from texas to the abilene stockyard in what they called the tong drive there the cattle were loaded into boxcars and shipped east.
over the next 20 years cowboys drove more than 5 million cattle to abilene and other cow towns beside the rails.
being a cowboy was dangerous and low paying work.
still life on the trail attracted many young adventurers.
most were texans.
about a third were of mexican or african american heritage.
rarely however were black cowboys promoted to trail boss.
jim perry for example was an expert rider roper and trail cook.
prejudice against blacks he believed was the only reason he was not the boss of his own team.
during the long drive cowboys worked 17 hours a day seven days a week for three to four months.
much of the work was boring except for moments of terror when a herd stampeded.
by the time they reached the end of the trail most cowboys were ready for rowdy fun including drinking gambling and brawling.
that made the cow towns wild noisy and often dangerous places.
the most notorious cow town was dodge city kansas.
an eastern newspaper described it as a wicked little town between 1872 and 1878 64 victims of gunfights were buried on the hill above the town.
later several graves were dug up to make way for a new school.
the gravediggers turned up a fine collection of skeletons most still wearing their cowboy boots.
to this day the dodge city cemetery is known as boot hill.

the winter of 1886 1887 was the worst anyone could remember.
whole herds of cattle froze to death.
ranchers called that terrible winter the great die up many of them lost everything.
the ranchers who were still in business reduced their herds and fenced their grazing lands.
they built barns and raised hay so that they could shelter and feed their animals in winter.
the days of the long drive were over.
wild cow towns became civilized ranching centers.
adventuresome cowboys settled down to work as ranch hands.
the cattlemens glory years faded into the past.
still they had left their mark on the west.
they had opened the great plains to settlement.
and they had created an industry that remains an important part of life in the west today.
cattle trails led from texas to rail centers in the midwest.
between 1867 and 1887 cowboys drove millions of cattle to rail centers where the cattle were shipped to meatpacking centers such as chicago st louis kansas city and omaha.
24 7 homesteaders farmers followed the ranchers onto the great plains.
for half a century the plains had been viewed as too dry for farming.
mapmakers labeled the area the great american desert then in the 1870s a few homesteaders plowed and planted the grassland.
they were lucky.
these were years of plentiful rain and their fields yielded fine crops.
the western railroads and land dealers made the most of this good luck.
maybe the plains used to be too dry for farming they said but not any more.
some even said that rain had followed the rails west.
the increase of railroads wrote a colorado journalist has the effect of producing more showers others gave farming the credit for the wet years claiming that rain follows the plow tensions in the il homesteaders arrive rain might not follow the rails or the plow but a rush of new settlers did.
by 1900 some 500 000 homesteaders had moved onto the great plains.
many were farm families from the east who were lured west by the promise of free or cheap land.
some were former slaves looking for a new start in freedom.
tens of thousands of european immigrants also settled the plains.
while most of them were seeking land one group russian mennonites came looking for religious freedom.
the plains greeted newcomers with miles and miles of treeless grassland.
since lumber was expensive or unavailable farmers built homes out of sod.
sod houses were cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
farming the dry plains the homesteaders faced huge challenges as they struggled to turn grasslands into grain fields.
rain was unreliable.
some years their crops withered under the hot prairie sun.
other years locusts large grasshoppers that travel in swarms swept across the plains eating everything in their path.
in addition the plains had few trees so there was little wood for homes.
over time the homesteaders solved these problems.
instead of using wood they built houses out of chunks of sod or soil held together by grassy roots.
they used windmills to pump water from deep in the ground.
they learned how to plow deeply to reach moist soil.
the mennonites introduced a type of winter wheat that thrived on the plains.
with hard work and the right crop homesteaders made the great plains the most productive wheat growing region in the world.

480 chapter 24 many american indians fought this effort to take away their land and change their way of life.
in the 1870s the wars on the plains would settle the issue once and for all.
reservation life the nomadic plains peoples hated the idea of being penned up on a reservation.
a sioux chief named sitting bull spoke for many indians when he said i will remain what i am until i die a hunter and when there are no buffalo or other game i will send my children to hunt and live on prairie mice for when an indian is shut in one place his body becomes weak.
despite sitting bulls words the buffalo were disappearing and most plains indians had little choice but to move to reservations.
once they did however the promised food often failed to arrive.
sometimes dishonest whites working as federal agents sold it to settlers instead.
often the food was spoiled by the time it reached the indians.
hungry and unhappy with reservation life many warriors left the reservations to look for game or to attack settlers.
when they did they were hunted down by army troops.
general george crook sympathized with the indians.
i do not wonder that when these indians see their wives and children starving they go to war he wrote.
and then we are sent out to kill.
it is an outrage.
sioux chief sitting bull resisted white settlement with passion and courage.
nevertheless his leadership was not enough to stop the massive loss of indian lands to white settlement.
tensions in the west this artist s depiction of the battle of the little big horn shows sioux warriors overhwleming custer s troops.
custer himself was killed by a gunshot to the head.
the battle lasted only half an hour.
the battle of the little big horn the most famous battle in this long struggle was fought near the little big horn river in present day montana.
the battle of the little big horn soon came to be known by another name custer s last stand.
the conflict began when soldiers led by a former civil war officer named george custer found gold in the black hills of dakota territory.
within months 15 000 goldhungry whites were swarming over sioux land.
rather than remove the miners the government demanded that the sioux sell the black hills.
the sioux refused.
i never want to leave this country a leader named wolf necklace told the government agents.
all of my relatives are lying here in the ground and when i fall to pieces i am going to fall to pieces here.
the army was ordered to force the indians out.
in june 1876 army scouts reported that several thousand sious and cheyenne were camped beside the little big horn river.
custer was ordered to locate the camp and then wait for reinforcements.
once custer spotted the indian camp however he decided to attack at once.
the attack ended in disaster.
custer split up his troops and the group that he led suddenly found itself surrounded by angry warriors.
the battle one warrior said lasted no longer than a hungry man needs to eat his dinner.
in those few minutes custer and all his men about 260 soldiers were killed.
angry whites called the battle a massacre.
over the next few months the army tracked down the sioux and cheyenne and forced them onto reservations.
ignoring earlier treaties congress took the black hills and another 40 million acres of land away from the sioux.
by 1887 most american indians had been moved onto reservations.
never again would indians room freely across the west.

the nez perce saved the lewis and clark expedition from starvation in 1805.
as settlers moved west american indians were pushed off their lands and onto reservations.
in 1877 when the nez perce resisted relocation the u s army chased them and their leader chief joseph almost to canada.
the indians surrendered and were sent to a barren reservation where many died.
the homestead act and the pacific railway act during the civil war two government acts aroused new interest in the west.
the homestead act of 1862 gave homesteaders a plot of land to cultivate.
the pacific railway act of 1862 resulted in the building of a transcontinental railroad that made it easier for settlers to travel westward.

some of these fliers made exaggerated claims which helped to promote kansas fever.
black exodus in the 1870s the end of reconstruction and the return of white man s rule caused many african americans to flee the south.
thousands moved west hoping to start a new life as homesteaders on the great plains.
what they found there was not a paradise but it did give them a taste of freedom.
in 1879 a remarkable event took place across the south.
thousands of african americans left their homes and set out on a great migration.
some of them traveled on foot following roads leading west.
others crowded onto the banks of the mississippi to catch riverboats bound for st louis.
from there they moved on to kansas and other western states.
the migrants called exodusters were part of a migration known as the exodus of 1879 the exodusters were trying to escape hardship and oppression in the south.
after reconstruction conditions had worsened for southern blacks.
white leaders restricted black voting rights and imposed segregation through jim crow laws.
they passed black codes laws that restricted african americans freedoms.
some of the laws prevented blacks from buying or leasing land thus keeping them under the control of white landowners.
whites also used violence to terrorize black communities.
although slavery had ended most african americans in the south still did not feel free.
as one black texan c p hicks noted in 1879 there are no words which can fully express or explain the real condition of my people throughout the south nor how deeply and keenly they feel the necessity of fleeing from the wrath and long pent up hatred of their old masters.
me migrants were not only being pushed out of the south by h conditions.
they were also being pulled out by the prospects of a bri er future elsewhere.
for many that future seemed to lie in kansas.
many southern bl believed that kansas was the promised land a place where they cc own their own land and live as free men and women.
this dream c not turn out quite the way they imagined.
but despite great challer many of the migrants would still find a better life outside the soutl black pioneers the 1879 exodus was not the first time african americans had gone west.
black explorers trappers and missionaries had roamed the west had gone west to seek their fortune in the early 1800s.
black miners during the california gold rush.
484 chapter 24 other african americans moved west to escape slavery.
in 1864 for example howard bruce and his future wife fled from bondage in missouri.
they went to leavenworth kansas where they settled down.
black families also moved west as pioneer settlers after the civil war.
nancy lewis went to leavenworth as a teenager in 1865.
she married a black soldier stationed there.
the two of them later joined a wagon train to colorado where they made their new home.
why kansas.
kansas appealed to migrants because it had lots of land for homesteading.
but it also held a special appeal for many former slaves who saw it as a symbol of freedom.
this idea stemmed from the antislavery struggles of the 1850s.
at the time some kansans had fought to prevent kansas from becoming a slave state.
one southern black man later wrote to the governor of kansas i am anxious to reach your state.
because of the sacredness of her soil washed by the blood of humanitarians for the cause of freedom in the early 1870s black leaders and businessmen began to promote kansas as a destination for migrants.
two important promoters were henry adams and benjamin pap singleton.
adams was a former slave and union soldier.
he favored black migration to the african country of liberia.
but he also backed migration to kansas as a way to get blacks out of the south.
singleton also a former slave was even more involved in the kansas migration.
he gave speeches and printed fliers praising the benefits of kansas.
with partners he formed several black colonies in the state and began to take settlers there.
he would later claim i am the whole cause of the kansas migration.
although this was an exaggeration singleton did play a major role in promoting migration.
by the late 1870s he had helped plant the seeds for the great exodus.
1 l for many exodusters the quickest route to kansas was up the mississippi river.
migrants waited for boats to take them to st louis though many could barely afford the passage.
african americans who made the exodus dreamed of better lives for their children.
these children of black pioneers posed for a photograph near their new home in nebraska.
kansas fever.
in the spring of 1879 interest in kansas suddenly exploded in a mass movement.
rumors began to circulate that the government was offering free land transportation and supplies to migrants who arrived in kansas.
these rumors were false but they sparked great excitement.
kansas fever quickly spread across the south.
many people began to pack up their belongings and head west.
six thousand exodusters moved in the first few months of 1879.
as many as 20 000 people had migrated by the end of the year.
they joined some 30 000 blacks who had already gone west during the 1870s.
this mass migration caused a panic among white southerners.
fearing the loss of black farmworkers they tried to prevent the exodusters from leaving.
they blocked roads and warned riverboat captains not to pick up black migrants.
they even threatened to sink boats carrying exodusters.
many migrants were left stranded along the mississippi with no way forward.
others got to st louis but then discovered there was no free transport to kansas.
some of them got stuck there and had to rely on donations of food and clothing to survive.
others returned to the south.
under these circumstances the exodus quickly lost steam.
within a few years it was over.
many of those who did get to kansas were overjoyed though.
when john solomon lewis arrived with his family in 1879 he said it was like a dream come true.
when 1 landed on the soil i looked on the ground and i says this is free ground.
then i looked on the heavens and i says them is free and beautiful heavens.
then i looked within my heart and i says to myself i wonder why i never was free before.
others had a different reaction.
williana hickman could hardly e reve her eyes when she arrived in nicodemus a black settlement on the treeless plains of western kansas in 1878 d where is nicodemus.
i dont see it my husband pointed out various smokes coming out of the ground and said that is icodemus.
the families lived in dugouts in the ground the scenery was not at all inviting and i began to cry life on the plains she t over her disappointment.
within a few years her hushed a managed to build a new life for themselves.
486 chapter 24 nicodemus was one of more than a half dozen black settlements in kansas and more successful than most.
founded in 1877 it took several years to get on its feet.
the first winter was especially hard.
the settlers lived in sod dugouts.
it was cold and many settlers went hungry.
but when spring came they planted their first crops and began building houses.
by 1880 around 700 people lived in nicodemus.
the town had three churches a bank two hotels several stores and a newspaper.
it continued to grow throughout the 1880s adding more churches a second newspaper and even a baseball team.
the residents of nicodemus hoped that the union pacific railroad would build a rail line through their town.
when it didnt the town began a slow steady decline.
today it has only a handful of residents.
but it remains the oldest surviving western town founded by african americans.
in 1996 it was declared a national historic site.
black migrants also settled in other plains states including nebraska.
by 1890 there were nearly 9 000 african americans living in nebraska.
one descendant of these early settlers ava speese day wrote about her experiences growing up in western nebraska in the early 1900s.
she and her family lived in a one room sod house.
they planted corn beans and vegetables.
they also raised cattle.
we fought tumbleweeds all year round she wrote.
it was a never ending battle.
in spring they came up thick come fall they dried and tumbled across the land.
some were bigger than we were tall.
poverty remained a problem for many african americans who moved west.
many also experienced racism and discrimination from white residents.
overall though life for most migrants seemed to improve.
blacks in the west were generally more prosperous than they were in the south.
they enjoyed more economic opportunity and more political freedom.
the black exodus of the 1870s may not have led to the promised land but it did lead to a better life for most migrants.
without trees settlers were unable to build wooden houses.
like many others the speese family cut brick shaped pieces of sod from the earth to build their house.
residents of nicodemus today honor both their community s past and the history of the exodusters in an annual homecoming celebration.

chapter 23 the reconstruction era to what extent did reconstruction bring african americans closer to full citizenship.
23 1 introduction by the end of the civil war americans longed for peace.
but what kind of peace.
one that punished the south for its rebellion.
a peace that helped rebuild the devastated region.
a peace that helped the 4 million african americans freed from slavery become full and equal citizens.
in his second inaugural address delivered in 1865 president abraham lincoln spoke of a healing peace with malice hatred toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish hold dear a just and lasting peace.
the nation would never know how lincoln planned to achieve such a peace.
on april 14 1865 just five days after the war ended the president was assassinated while attending a play at ford s theater in washington d c.
the assassin was an actor named john wilkes booth.
booth thought that killing lincoln would somehow save the confederacy.
after lincolns death vice president andrew johnson became president.
the task of rebuilding the south and bringing the southern states back into the union would not be easy for johnson s administration.
for while the nation was united again americans remained deeply divided.
as you read this chapter think about lincoln s dream of a just and lasting peace did the end of the war and the end of slavery lead to a peace based on liberty and justice for all.
did these events bring african americans closer to the ideals of liberty and justice including the rights of citizenship.
in the years following the civil war african american men were granted the right to vote.
five days after the civil war ended president lincoln was shot dead by an assassin.
the task of rebuilding the nation fell to vice president andrew johnson who became president when lincoln died.
pictured here is lincoln s funeral procession from the white house to the capitol on april 19 1865.
the reconstruction era 44.
reconstruction the period of time after the civil war in which southern states were rebuilt and brought back into the union thirteenth amendment a change to the constitution ratified in 1865 abolishing slavery in the united states freedmen s bureau an agency established by congress at the end of the civil war to help and protect newly freed black americans 23 2 presidential reconstruction as the civil war ended people in the united states had sharply different views about how to rebuild the southern states and bring them back into the union.
this period of time came to be called reconstruction for president andrew johnson a southerner from tennessee reconstruction had two major aims.
first southern states had to create new governments that were loyal to the union and that respected federal authority.
second slavery had to be abolished once and for all.
these aims left many issues to be resolved.
for example who would control the new state governments in the south former confederates.
would freed slaves have the same rights as other citizens.
and what would the relationship be between freed slaves and former slave owners.
many republicans in congress believed that strong measures would be needed to settle these issues.
to them reconstruction meant nothing less than a complete remaking of the south based on equal rights and a free labor economy.
the stage was set for a battle over the control and even the meaning of reconstruction.
during reconstruction former slaves gained the rights to marry and to reunite families divided by slavery.
forms such as this one allowed freedmen to keep family records.
president johnson s reconstruction plan in may 1865 president johnson announced his reconstruction plan.
a former confederate state could rejoin the union once it had written a new state constitution elected a new state government repealed its act of secession and canceled its war debts.
there was a final requirement as well.
every southern state had to ratify the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery throughout the united states.
by the fall of 1865 every southern state had met the presidents requirements.
the thirteenth amendment became part of the constitution.
presidential reconstruction had begun.
the freedmen s bureau for former slaves called freed men the freedom guaranteed by the thirteenth amendment brought problems as well as opportunities.
frederick douglass described the freedman as free from the individual master but a slave of society douglass wrote he had neither money property nor friends.
he was free from the old plantation but he had nothing but the dusty road under his feet.
he was turned loose naked hungry and destitute penniless to the open sky to assist former slaves congress established the freed men s bureau in march 1865.
over the next four years tltf ureau provided food and medical care to both blacks and w ites in the south.
it helped freedmen arrange for wages and good working conditions.
it also distributed some land n 40 acre plots to loyal refugees and freedmen 446 chapter 23 sr r i some whites however attacked the bureau as an example of northern interference in the south.
ultimately the hope of many freedmen for forty acres and a mule died when congress refused to take land away from southern whites.
the most lasting benefit of the freedmen s bureau was in education.
thousands of former slaves both young and old flocked to free schools built by the bureau.
long after the bureau was gone such institutions as howard university in washington d c continued to provide educational opportunities for african americans.
black codes as new state governments took power in the south many republicans in congress were alarmed to see that they were headed by the same people who had led the south before the war wealthy white planters.
once in office these leaders began passing laws known as black codes to control their former slaves.
the black codes served three purposes.
the first was to limit the rights of freedmen.
generally former slaves received the rights to marry to own property to work for wages and to sue in court.
but they did not have other rights of citizenship.
blacks for example could not vote or serve on juries in the south.
the second purpose of the black codes was to help planters find workers to replace their slaves.
the codes required freedmen to work.
those without jobs could be arrested and hired out to planters.
the codes also limited freedmen to farming or jobs requiring few skills.
african americans could not enter most trades or start businesses.
the third purpose of the black codes was to keep freedmen at the bottom of the social order in the south.
most codes called for the segregation of blacks and whites in public places.
the freedmen s bureau built more than 1 000 schools for african americans between 1865 and 1872 black codes laws passed in 1855 and 1856 in the former confederate states to limit the rights and freedoms of african americans the reconstruction civil rights the rights guaranteed by the constitution to all people as citizens especially equal treatment under the law fourteenth amendment a change to the constitution ratified in 1868 granting citizenship to anyone born in the united states and guaranteeing all citizens equal protection of the law 23 3 congressional reconstruction as 1865 came to a close president johnson announced that reconstruction was over.
the southern states were ready to rejoin the union.
a group of republicans in congress did not agree with johnson.
known as the radical republicans these lawmakers had an additional goal for reconstruction.
they believed that the south would not be completely rebuilt until freedmen were granted the full rights of citizenship.
radical republicans wanted the federal government to take a more active role in reconstruction a role that would involve tougher requirements for restoring southern governments.
in the house of representatives thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania led the radical republicans.
in the senate they were led by charles sumner of massachusetts.
early in 1866 radical republicans joined with more moderate lawmakers to enact two bills designed to help freedmen.
the first extended the life of the freedmens bureau.
the second was the civil rights act of 1866.
it struck at the black codes by declaring freedmen to be full citizens with the same civil rights as whites.
johnson declared both bills unconstitutional and vetoed them.
an angry congress overrode his vetoes.
based on the belief thatthe south had no legal governments congress reorganized the south into the five military districts shown here.
tennessee which metthe standards for readmission before the military districts were established in 1867 was not included in one.
the fourteenth amendment to further protect the rights of african americans congress approved the fourteenth amendment.
this amendment granted citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the united states it also guaranteed all citizens the equal protection of the laws.
this meant that state governments could not treat some citizens as less equal than others.
president johnson opposed the fourteenth amendment and called on voters to throw republican lawmakers out of office.
instead repub lican candidates won a two thirds majority in both houses of congress military reconstruction districts 1870 in the 1866 election.
from then on congress controlled reconstruction.
military reconstruction act early in 1867 congress passed the military reconstruction act.
once again it did so over johnsons veto.
this plan divided the south into five military districts each governed by a general supported by federal troops.
the state governments set up under johnsons reconstruction plan were declared illegal.
new governments were to be formed by southerners loyal to the united states both black and white.
southerners who had supported the confederacy were denied the right to vote.
448 chapter 23 congress also passed two acts designed to reduce johnsons power to interfere with congressional reconstruction.
the command of the army act limited his power over the army.
the tenure of office act barred him from firing certain federal officials without the senates consent.
president johnson blasted both laws as unconstitutional.
then to prove his point he fired one of the officials protected under the tenure of office act.
president johnson is impeached the house of representatives responded to johnsons challenge by voting to impeach the president.
besides violating the tenure of office act the house charged johnson had brought the high office of the president of the united states into contempt ridicule and disgrace to the scandal of all good citizens during his trial in the senate the presidents lawyers argued that johnsons only crime had been to oppose congress.
if he were removed from office for that reason they warned no future president will be safe who happens to differ with a majority of the house and senate two thirds of the senate had to find the president guilty to remove him from office.
despite heavy pressure to convict him 7 republicans and 12 democrats voted not guilty johnson escaped removal from office by one vote but he had lost his power.
sharecropping while congress and the president battled over reconstruction african americans in the south worked to build new lives.
most former slaves desperately wanted land to farm but had no money to buy it.
meanwhile former slave owners needed workers to farm their land but had no money to pay them.
out of the needs of both groups came a farming system called sharecropping.
planters who turned to sharecropping divided their land into small plots.
they rented these plots to individual tenant farmers farmers who paid rent for the land they worked.
a few tenants paid the rent for their plots in cash.
but most paid their rent by giving the landowner a portion of what they raised.
this payment of crops was called a share.
usually it was about a third or a half of the tenant s crop.
sharecropping looked promising to freedmen at first.
they liked being independent farmers who worked for themselves.
in time they hoped to earn enough money to buy a farm of their own.
however most sharecroppers had to bor row money from planters to buy the food seeds tools and supplies they needed to survive until harvest.
few ever earned enough from their crops to pay back what they owed.
rather than leading to independence share cropping usually led to a life time of poverty and debt.
sharecroppers such as these cotton growers rented their land from plantation owners.
in exchange most paid one third to one half of their crops back to the landowners.
fifteenth amendment a change to the constitution ratified in 1870 declaring that states cannot deny anyone the right to vote because of race or color or because the person was once a slave 23 4 southern reconstruction under the terms of the military reconstruction act the u s army returned to the south in 1867.
the first thing it did was begin to register voters.
because congress had banned former confederates from voting the right to vote in the south was limited to three groups freed men white southerners who had opposed the war and northerners who had moved south after the war.
the south s new voters african americans made up the souths largest group of new voters.
most black voters joined the republican party the party of lincoln and emancipation.
white southerners who had not supported secession were the next largest group.
many were poor farmers who had never voted before.
in their eyes the democratic party was the party of wealthy planters and secession.
as a result they also supported the republican party.
southern democrats were appalled.
they saw any white man who voted republican as a traitor to the south.
democrats scorned such people as scalawags or worthless scoundrels.
the last group of new voters were northerners who had moved south after the war.
southerners called these newcomers carpetbaggers after a type of handbag used by many travelers.
they saw carpetbaggers as fortune hunters who had come south to fatten themselves on southerners misfortunes.
this poster which pictures students soldiers preachers teachers and lawmakers celebrated the passage of the fifteenth amendment.
the election of 1868 new voters in the south cast their first ballots in the 1868 presidential election.
the republican candidate was former union general ulysses s grant.
grant supported reconstruction and promised to protect the rights of african americans in the south.
his democratic opponent horatio seymour promised to end reconstruction and return the south to its traditional leaders white democrats.
seymour won a majority of white votes.
grant however was elected with the help of half a million black votes.
the elections lesson to republicans was that if they wanted to keep control of the white house and congress they needed the support of african american voters.
the fifteenth amendment in 1869 at president grants urging congress passed the fifteenth amendment.
this amendment said that a citizens right to vote shall not be denied on account race color or previous condition of servitude.
it guaranteed every male citizen the right to vote regardless of race.
450 chapter 23 with the passage of this amendment most abolitionists felt their work was done.
the american anti slavery society declared the fifteenth amendment to be the capstone and completion of our movement the fulfillment of our pledge to the negro race since it secures to them equal political rights with the white race new state constitutions when the army finished registering voters southern reconstruction got underway.
across the south delegates were elected to constitutional conventions.
about a fourth of those elected were african americans.
ihe conventions met and wrote new constitutions for their states.
these constitutions were the most progressive or advanced in the nation.
they guaranteed the right to vote to every adult male regardless of race.
they ended imprisonment for debt.
they also established the first public schools in the south.
the georgia constitution stated that these schools should be forever free to all the children of the state however under the new state constitutions these schools were open only to whites.
new state governments elections were then held to fill state offices.
to the dismay of southern democrats a majority of those elected were republicans.
about a fifth were african americans.
the souths new state governments quickly ratified the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
by 1870 every southern state had finished this final step of reconstruction and rejoined the union.
next southern governments turned to the task of rebuilding.
work was begun on damaged roads bridges and railroads.
schools and hospitals were built.
to pay for these projects state legislatures raised taxes.
between 1860 and 1870 taxes in the south increased by up to 400 percent.
african americans in office about a fifth of the south s new officeholders were african americans.
blacks served in every southern legislature and held high offices in three states.
twenty two african americans represented their states in congress 20 in the house and 2 in the senate.
after watching these representatives many of whom had been born slaves pennsylvania congressman james g blaine sai during reconstruction many african americans were elected to the house of representatives and the senate.

they were as aru e studious earnest ambitious men whose public conduct would be honorable to any race.
the reconstruction era thomas nast s political cartoon is this a republican form of government.
condemns northern indifference to the violence african americans endured as reconstruction ended.
23 5 the end of reconstruction most whites in the south bitterly resented the southern reconstruction governments.
they hated the fact that these governments had been forced on them by yankees.
many taxpayers also blamed their soaring tax bills on corruption the misuse of public office for personal gain by the souths new leaders.
while some southern officeholders did line their pockets with public funds most whether black or white were honest capable leaders.
still when taxes increased opposition to the new state governments increased as well.
but what bothered many southerners most about their reconstruction governments was seeing former slaves voting and holding public office.
across the south democrats vowed to regain power and return their states to white mans rule violence against african americans at first democrats tried to win black voters away from the republican party.
when that tactic failed they attempted to use legal means to keep blacks from voting or from taking office.
in georgia for example the legislature refused to seat elected black lawmakers until they were forced to by the state supreme court.
when legal methods failed whites turned to violence.
throughout the south whites formed secret societies to drive african americans out of political life.
the most infamous of these groups was the ku klux kian.
dressed in long hooded robes and armed with guns and swords klansmen did their work at night.
they started by threatening black voters and officeholders.
african americans who did not heed their threats were beaten tarred and feathered and even murdered.
the enforcement acts in 1870 and 1871 congress passed three laws to combat violence against african americans.
known as the enforcement acts these laws made it illegal to prevent another person from voting by bribery force or scare tactics.
president grant sent troops into the south to enforce these acts.
hundreds of people were arrested for violence against blacks.
those who were brought to trial however were seldom convicted.
few witnesses and jurors wanted to risk the kians revenge by speaking out against one of its members.
the amnesty act of 1872 by this time most northerners were osing interest in reconstruction and the plight of the freedmen.
it was time many people said to let the south alone one indication of this changing attitude was the passage of the mnesty act of 1872.
amnesty means forgiveness for past offenses e mnesty act allowed most former confederates to vote once 452 chapter 23 the effects of the amnesty act were seen almost immediately.
by 1876 democrats had regained control of all but three states in the south.
republicans clung to power in south carolina louisiana and florida but only with the help of federal troops.
the disputed election of 1876 in 1876 americans went to the polls to choose a new president.
the democrats nominated new york governor samuel j tilden as their candidate.
rutherford b hayes was the republican nominee.
when the votes were counted tilden won a majority of popular votes and 184 electoral votes just one short of the 185 needed for election.
hayes received 165 electoral votes.
twenty electoral votes from four states were in dispute.
congress which was controlled by republicans appointed a commission to decide which candidate should get the disputed electoral votes.
the commission awarded all 20 to hayes giving him exactly the 185 electoral votes he needed to win.
the democrats threatened to block the commissions decision.
inauguration day grew near with no new president in sight.
the compromise of 1877 after weeks of negotiation democratic and republican leaders in congress agreed to a compromise.
the democrats accepted the electoral commissions decision allowing hayes to become president.
in return hayes agreed to withdraw the remaining federal troops still occupying southern states.
once president hayes withdrew all remaining federal troops from the south in 1877 reconstruction was officially over.
after that democrats quickly took control of the last southern states.
this is a white mans country boasted south carolina senator ben tillman and white men must govern it most white southerners celebrated the end of reconstruction.
but for freedmen the return of the south to white man s rule was a giant step backward.
the whole south every state in the south observed a louisiana freedman has got into the hands of the very men that held us as slaves safei i this cartoon compares the reconstruction policies of president grant and president hayes who succeeded grant in office.

which president do you think the cartoonist favored.
the reconstruction era 23 6 reconstruction reversed i the granger collection new york this painting shows a new south rising from the ashes of the civil war.
although southern leaders hoped this would be the future of the south most whites and blacks continued to live in poverty.
with reconstruction over southern leaders talked of building a new south humming with mills factories and cities.
between 1880 and 1900 the number of textile mills in the south grew rapidly.
birmingham alabama became a major iron making center.
still most southerners black and white remained trapped in an old south of poverty.
losing ground in education during reconstruc tion freedmen had pinned their hopes for a better life on education provided by the souths first public schools.
when southern democrats regained control of states however they cut spending on education.
free schools are not a necessity explained the governor of virginia.
schools he said are a luxury to be paid for like any other luxury by the people who wish their benefits as public funding dried up many schools closed.
those that stayed open often charged fees.
by the 1880s only about half of all black children in the south were attending school.
losing voting rights southern democrats also reversed political gains made by freedmen after the war.
many southern states passed laws requiring citizens who wanted to vote to pay a poll tax.
the tax was set high enough that voting like education became a luxury that many black southerners could not afford.
some southern states also required citizens to pass a literacy test to show they could read before allowing them to vote.
these tests were designed so that any african american regardless of his education would fail.
in theory these laws applied equally to blacks and whites and for that reason did not violate the fifteenth amendment.
in practice however whites were excused from paying poll taxes or taking literacy tests by a so called grandfather clause in the laws.
this clause said the taxes and tests did not apply to any man whose father or grandfather could vote on january 1 1867.
since no blacks could vote on that date the grandfather clause applied only to whites.
african americans protested that these laws denied them their constitutional right to vote.
the supreme court however found that the new voting laws did not violate the fifteenth amendment because they did not deny anyone the right to vote on the basis of race.
drawing a color line during reconstruction most southern states had outlawed segregation in public places.
when democrats returned to power they reversed these laws and drew a color line 454 chapter 23 between blacks and whites in public life.
whites called the new segregation acts jim crow laws.
jim crow was a black character in an entertainers act in the mid 1800s.
not all white southerners supported segregation.
when a jim crow law was proposed in south carolina a charleston news and courier editorial tried to show how unjust it was by taking segregation to ridiculous extremes.
if there must be jim crow cars on railroads there should be jim crow cars on the street railways.
also on all passenger boats.
there should be jim crow waiting saloons waiting rooms at all stations and jim crow eating houses.
there should be jim crow sections of the jury box and a separate jim crow.
witness stand in every court and a jim crow bible for colored witnesses to kiss.
instead of being a joke as intended most of these ridiculous suggestions soon became laws.
jim crow laws laws enforcing segregation of blacks and whites in the south after the civil war plessy v ferguson african americans argued that segregation laws violated the fourteenth amendments guarantee of equal protection of the laws.
homer plessy who was arrested for refusing to obey a jim crow law took his protest all the way to the supreme court.
the supreme court decided his case plessy v ferguson in 1896.
the majority of the supreme court justices found that segregation laws did not violate the fourteenth amendment as long as the facilities available to both races were roughly equal.
justice john marshall harlan a former slaveholder disagreed.
in his dissenting opinion he wrote our constitution is color blind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens after the supreme courts decision in plessy states passed additional jim crow laws.
blacks and whites attended separate schools played in separate parks and sat in separate sections in theaters.
despite the courts decision that these separate facilities must be equal those set aside for african americans were almost always inferior to facilities labeled whites only for decades african americans lived under segregation legalized by the plessy decision.
separate facilities for blacks were rarely equal.

two units of african american cavalrymen the ninth and tenth u s cavalry fought in the indian wars.
known as buffalo soldiers the men served loyally but were often mistreated by the white settlers they were protecting.
twenty three buffalo soldiers earned the medal of honorfor heroism.
23 7 responding to segregation african americans responded to segregation in many ways.
the boldest protested openly.
doing so however was dangerous.
blacks who spoke out risked being attacked by white mobs.
some were lynched or murdered often by hanging for speaking out against white rule during the 1890s an african american was lynched somewhere in the united states almost every day.
african american migration thousands of african americans responded to segregation by leaving the south.
a few chose to return to africa.
in 1878 some 200 southern blacks chartered a ship and sailed to liberia a nation in west africa that had been founded in 1821 for the settlement of freed american slaves.
many more african americans migrated to other parts of the united states.
not only were they pushed from the south by racism and poverty but they were pulled by the lure of better opportunities and more equal treatment.
some sought a new life as wage earners by migrating to cities in the north.
there they competed for jobs with recent immigrants from eruope and often faced racism if not southern style segregation.
others headed to the west where they found work as cowboys and indian fighters.
two all black u s calvary units known as the buffalo soldiers fought on the front lines of the indian wars.
some blacks found new homes with american indian nations.
thousands of black families left the south for kanses in the exodus of 1879.
the exodusters as the migrants were known faced many hardships on their journey west.
bands of armed whites patrolled roads in kansas in an effort to drive the migrants away.
still the exodusters pushed on saying we had rather suffer and be free.
self help most african americans however remained in the south.
they worked hard in their families churches and communities to improve their lives.
while most blacks farmed for a living a growing number started their own businesses.
between 1865 and 1903 the number of black owned businesses in the south soared from about 2 000 to 25 000.
456 chapter 23 families churches and communities also banded together to build schools and colleges for black children.
because of these efforts literacy among african americans rose rapidly.
when slavery ended in 1865 only 5 percent of african americans could read.
by 1900 more than 50 percent could read and write.

this thomas nast cartoon celebrates the civil rights bill of 1875.
this bill and other reconstruction legislation tried to give full citizenship rights to african americans.
reading further elizabeth eckford was one of the nine african american students who integrated central high school in little rock arkansas.
like the others she faced anger and harassment.
the long road to equal rights during reconstruction congress added three amendments to the constitution to guarantee equal rights to african americans.
still it took another 100 years and large scale political action to make those guarantees real.
the station wagon rolled down west 28th street in little rock arkansas.
it was part of a convoy with one jeep in front of it and another behind.
each jeep carried soldiers and a machine gun.
each soldier carried a rifle.
in the station wagon nine high school students sat nervously.
it was their first day of school at little rocks central high school.
more soldiers waited at the school for the convoy to arrive.
one of the students ernest green recalled that frightening moment.
the whole school was ringed with paratroopers and helicopters hovering around.
we marched up the steps with this circle of soldiers with bayonets drawn.
it was 1957.
the students who came to be known as the little rock nine would be the first african americans to attend the citys all white central high school.
the students had tried to enter the school twice before just a few weeks earlier but had met fierce resistance.
many of little rocks white citizens were determined to keep them out.
melba pattillo one of the students described what she went through.
on the first day the kinds of things that i endured were parents kicking parents hitting parents throwing things.
you would get tripped people would just walk up and hit you in the face.
and you couldn t hit back.
on those first days police had escorted the little rock nine into a side entrance of the school building.
but the principal had sent the nine students home.
he said he feared for their safety.
the third time the little rock nine began their school year they did so with military protection.
on national television that night president dwight eisenhower explained why.
i have today issued an executive order directing the use of troops under federal authority to aid in the execution of federal law at little rock the federal law that eisenhower referred to was the law to integrate public schools.
the military would be sure it was obeyed.
i uurteentn amendment comes of age efforts to integrate public schools began long before the little rod nine entered central high.
in a sense they began in 1868 during reconstruction.
that is when the fourteenth amendment was ratifi 458 chapter 23 it said that no state could limit privileges or deny any american equal protection under the law.
the amendment guaranteed freed slaves the same rights that white americans had.
unfortunately that guarantee was soon modified.
in 1896 the supreme court held that it was legal to segregate public places.
as long as facilities for blacks were equal to those for whites the court said segregation did not violate the fourteenth amendment.
so under this doctrine of separate but equal segregation continued.
although the constitution guaranteed equal rights african americans would have to fight to exercise those rights.
focused efforts to end segregation in schools began in the 1930s.
the long haul toward school integration began with a vision.
a young african american lawyer named charles houston believed that the way to get equal rights was for black lawyers to challenge segregation in court.
but there were very few black lawyers at the time.
most law schools were segregated or accepted only a few black students.
but houston had a plan.
at the historically black howard university in wash ington d c houston trained a generation of black lawyers.
among them was his star pupil ihurgood marshall.
those lawyers confronted segregation in one case after another for more than 20 years.
they started by arguing against segregated law schools and then segregated graduate schools.
it was not until the 1950s that they took on the segregated public schools.
their efforts culminated in the 1954 supreme court case brown v board of education of topeka t kansas.
in their decision the court held that separate schools could never be equal.
this meant that public schools would have to integrate.
three years later nearly 90 years after the fourteenth amendment was added to the constitution the little rock nine under armed guard followed that law and entered central high school.
the fifteenth amendment comes of age the struggle to integrate schools and other public places did not end at central high.
there would be other battles to win for african americans to have equal rights.
in 1963 to mark 100 years since abraham lincoln had emancipated the slaves more than 200 000 people marched to the steps of the lincoln memorial in washington.
linda brown front center had to cross railroad tracks and catch a bus to attend a segregated school in topeka kansas.
after the supreme court s decision in brown v board of education of topeka kansas linda could attend the formerly all white school in her neighborhood.
m the reconstruction era the voting rights movement urged blacks to register so they could vote.
so long as i do not possess the right to vote i do not possess myself martin luther king jr said.
at that historic event martin luther king jr spoke of the work that was still unfinished.
five score one hundred years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation.
but one hundred years later we must face the tragic fact that the negro is still not free.
one hundred years later the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity wealth.
one hundred years later the negro is still languishing suffering in the corners of american society and finds himself in exile in his own land.
voting rights like integration had been promised after the civil war but that promise had not been fulfilled when king spoke in 1963.
the fifteenth amendment which was ratified in 1870 granted african americans the right to vote.
but in the 1960s very few black citizens in the south were able to exercise that right.
the reason.
laws in many southern states made voting impossible for most african americans.
some places had literacy tests for example.
anyone who could not read and write was not allowed to register to vote.
the tests were often rigged with questions no one could answer so that even literate blacks could not pass them.
taxes and property requirements were other methods that made it impossible for most african americans to exercise their right to vote.
that is why in the 1960s african americans were fighting to register to vote in places like selma alabama.
in selma the registration office was only open two days a month.
the workers there often arrived late left early and took long breaks.
in 1963 only 156 of selmas 15 000 eligible black voters were registered.
through 1963 and 1964 black citizens of selma tried again and again to register to vote.
again and again the county sheriff and other white leaders tried to stop them h 1965 the situation in selma came to ahead.
in cities like selma alabama african americans lined up to register to vote.
often white officials intimidated them by asking does your employe know you re here.
the message was clear if your boss knows you are here you could lose your job.
has on sunday march 7 about 600 people gathered in selma.
they planned to march 50 miles to the state capital in montgomery to insist on their right to vote.
when they reached the edmund pettus bridge alabama state troopers ordered them to leave.
they stayed.
the police advanced.
they knocked people to the ground and fired teargas.
riding horses the police charged at the marchers.
that day which came to be called bloody sunday marked a turning point in the struggle for voting rights.
on television and in newspapers images of the violence in selma reached people across america.
many had not known about the extent of segregation or the violent methods used to enforce it.
they were horrified.
the mayor of selma joe smitherman remembered that the tide turned that day.
when that beating happened at the foot of the bridge it looked like war.
that went all over the country on the television news.
and the people the wrath of the nation came down on us.
john lewis a leader of the student nonviolent coordinating committee later said of the march you had to go it was more than an ordinary march.
to me there was never a march like this one before and there hasn t been one since.
the clashes in selma continued for days.
then president lyndon johnson put voting rights legislation before congress.
their cause must be our cause too johnson said to the american people.
because it is not just negroes but really it is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice days later thousands of people began the march from selma to montgomery.
five days after that 25 000 people gathered at the state capitol in montgomery.
they celebrated their success and braced themselves for the hard work ahead.
later that year congress passed the historic voting rights act of 1965.
the act supported the rights that the constitution had promised blacks nearly 100 years earlier.
some historians say that the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s was a second reconstruction they point out that the three reconstruction amendments the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth promised equal rights to african americans.
yet it took another century for those rights to be realized.

the union challenged 463 unit 8 setting the stage i population density of the united states 1870 population density of the united states 1890 466 unit 8 migration and industry in this unit you will learn about the growth of industry and agriculture in the decades after the civil war.
mining ranching and farming boomed on the great plains and farther west.
so did manufacturing in the east.
the key to this growth and the link that connected the nation geographically was the railroad.
the map on this page shows the nation s main railroad lines for two different years 1870 and 1890.
compare railroads in the country by 1870 with railroads by 1890.
notice the difference between the amount and location of track.
in fact the total miles of track in the united states more than tripled between 1870 and 1890.
think about being a farmer on the great plains in 1870.
it would be a hard life and for many a lonely one.
farm machinery and luxuries such as glass for windows would not be easy to obtain.
the cost of transporting such goods from eastern factories by wagon would make them very expensive.
but railroads changed that.
by 1890 such goods could travel most of the way to the great plains by train.
the people machinery and other goods that trains carried west spurred the growth of mining ranching and farming.
the same trains also moved ore livestock and farm products east to become raw materials for the nation s industries.
the growth of industry created jobs and people came to the nation s industrial cities to fill those jobs.
the maps on the opposite page show the nation s patterns of settlement in 1870 and 1890.
the population changes they show especially in the west are almost as dramatic as the changes in the railroad maps.
that is because to a great extent railroad growth was directly or indirectly responsible for them.
migration and industry 46 468 chapter 21.
chapter 22 the civil war what factors and events influenced the outcome of the civil war.
sjsil bmm8 22 1 introduction the confederate bombardment of fort sumter in charleston south carolina ended months of confusion.
the nation was at war.
the time had come to choose sides.
for most whites in the south the choice was dear.
early in 1861 representatives from six of the seven states that had seceded from the union met to form a new nation called the confederate states of america.
southerners believed that just as the states had once voluntarily joined the union they could voluntarily leave it now.
the men who fought for the south were proud defenders of southern independence.
for many northerners the choice was just as clear.
there can be no neutrals in this war declared senator stephen douglas after the attack of fort sumter only patriots or traitors most northerners viewed the secession of southern states as a traitorous act of rebellion against the united states.
they marched off to war eager to defend what they saw as their union their constitution and their flag.
choosing sides was harder for the eight slave states located between the confederacy and the free states.
four of these so called border states virginia arkansas tennessee and north carolina joined the confederacy.
the western counties of virginia however remained loyal to the union.
rather than fight for the south they broke away to form a new state called west virginia.
the other four border states delaware maryland kentucky and missouri remained in the union although many of their citizens fought for the south.
as americans took sides they began to see why a civil war a conflict between two groups of citizens in one country is the most painful kind of war.
this conflict divided not only states but also families and friends.
in this chapter you will learn how this brothers war turned into the most destructive of all american wars.
as you read put yourself in the shoes of the soldiers and civilians who were part of this long and tragic struggle.
the civil war divided americans into two opposing nations.
union solriiars left fnnnht fellow americans and confederate soldiers right.
more soldiers died during the civil war than in all other u s wars combined.
here some of the dead lay where they fell on the battlefield.
the civil war claimed the lives of more than 620 000 union and confederate soldiers.
the civil war 42 i the north and the south had different strengths at the beginning of the war.
the north had far more factories and railroad lines left.
the south had better military leadership right.
22 2 north versus south president abraham lincolns response to the attack on fort sumter was quick and clear.
he called for 75 000 volunteers to come forward to preserve the union.
at the same time jefferson davis the newly elected president of the confederacy called for volunteers to defend the south.
for the first time americans were fighting a civil war.
strengths and weaknesses of the north the north began the war with impressive strengths.
its population was about 22 million compared to the souths 9 million.
the north was both richer and more technologically advanced than the south.
about 90 percent of the nations manufacturing and most of its banks were in the north.
the north had geographic advantages too.
it had more farms than the south to provide food for troops.
its land contained most of the country s iron coal copper and gold.
the north controlled the seas and its 21 000 miles of railroad track allowed troops and supplies to be transported wherever they were needed.
the north s greatest weakness was its military leadership.
at the start of the war about one third of the nations military officers resigned and returned to their homes in the south.
during much of the war lincoln searched for effective generals who could lead the union confederacy another name for the confederate states of america made up of the 11 states that seceded from the union civil war a war between opposing groups of citizens from the same country daftnesses of the south in contrast to the north the south s great strength was its military leadership.
most of america s best military officers were southerners who chose to fight for the confederacy.
this was not an easy decision for many of them.
colonel robert e lee for example was not a supporter of either slavery or secession.
but he decided that he could not fight against his native virginia.
lee resigned from the u s army to become commander in chief of the confederate forces.
424 chapter 22 the south had geographic advantages as well.
to win the war the north would have to invade and conquer the south.
the sheer size of the south made this a daunting task.
the south in contrast could win simply by defending its territory until northerners grew tired of fighting.
the south did have an important geographic disadvantage.
if the union could control the mississippi river it could split the confed eracy in two.
the souths main weaknesses were its economy and its transportation systems.
the regions agriculturally based economy could not support a long war.
it had few factories to produce guns and other military supplies.
the confederacy also faced serious transportation problems.
the south lacked the railroads needed to haul troops or supplies over long distances.
abraham lincoln versus jefferson davis the norths greatest advantage was its newly elected president abraham lincoln.
through even the darkest days of the war lincoln never wavered from his belief that the union was perpetual never to be broken.
throughout his presidency lincoln related the preservation of the union to the ideals of the american revolution.
in his first inaugural address he said that the union was begun by the american revolution matured and continued by the declaration of independence and affirmed by the constitution.
at the time of the secession crisis jefferson davis was a u s senator from mississippi.
a firm believer in states rights he resigned his seat in the senate when mississippi left the union.
like lincoln davis often spoke of the american revolution.
when southerners formed their own government davis said in his inaugural address they merely asserted a right which the declaration of independence of 1776 had defined to be inalienable he believed the south was fighting for the same freedom cherished by the nation s founders.
abraham lincoln left and jefferson davis right atthe start of the civil war.
the civil war 22 3 bull run a great awakening in the spring of 1861 president lincoln and general winfield scott planned the unions war strategy.
step one was to surround the south by sea to cut off its trade.
step two was to divide the confederacy into sections so that one region could not help another.
step three was to capture richmond virginia the capital of the confederacy and destroy the confederate government.
journalists called this strategy the anaconda plan because it resembled the crushing death grip of an anaconda snake.
rose greenhow s dilemma most northern ers believed that the war could be won with a single union assault on richmond.
in 1861 thousands of volunteers poured into washington d c shouting on to richmond a young widow and washington social leader named rose oneal greenhow watched these eager troops carefully.
greenhow was a strong supporter of the southern cause.
she used her friendship with government officials to learn just when and how the union planned to attack richmond.
her challenge was to find a way to deliver this information to confederate leaders without being discovered.
the battle of bull run on a hot july morning long lines of union soldiers marched out of washington heading for richmond.
their voices could be heard singing and cheering across the countryside.
parties of civilians followed the army adding to the excitement.
they had come along to see the end of the rebellion.
the troops would not have been so cheerful had they known what was waiting for them at manassas a small town on the way to richmond.
greenhow had managed to warn southern military leaders of union plans.
she had smuggled a coded note to them in a young girl s curls.
southern troops were waiting for the union forces as they approached manassas.
the two armies met at a creek known as bull run.
rose greenhow is pictured here with her daughter.
greenhow collected valuable information about union plans to attack richmond and passed it on to confederate leaders through a coded message like the one shown above.
at first a union victory looked certain.
but confederate general thomas jackson and his regiment of virginians refused to give up.
look shouted south carolma general bernard bee to his men there is jackson with his irgimans standing like a stone wall thus inspired by stonewall vtt cnfederate lines held firm until reinforcements as thev c 1 at afternoon jackson urged his men to yell like furies pertenced t u ion charge overwhelmed the tnex mon troops who fled in panic back to washington.
426 chapter 22 the battle of bull run was a smashing victory for the south.
for the north it was a shocking blow.
lincoln and his generals now realized that ending the war would not be easy.
women support the war over the next year both the north and the south worked to build and train large armies.
as men went off to war women took their places on the home front.
wives and mothers supported their families by running farms and businesses.
many women went to work for the first time in factories.
others found jobs as nurses teachers or government workers.
women also served the military forces on both sides as messengers guides scouts smugglers soldiers and spies.
greenhow was arrested for spying shortly after the battle of bull run.
although she was kept under guard in her washington home she continued to smuggle military secrets to the confederates.
the following year greenhow was allowed to move to the south where president jefferson davis welcomed her as a hero.
women also volunteered to tend sick and wounded soldiers.
dorothea dix was already well known for her efforts to improve the treatment of the mentally ill she was appointed director of the union army s nursing service.
dix insisted that all female nurses be over 30 years old plain in appearance physically strong and willing to do unpleasant work.
her rules were so strict that she was known as dragon dix.
while most nurses worked in military hospitals clara barton followed union armies into battle tending troops where they fell.
later generations would remember barton as the founder of the american red cross.
to the soldiers she cared for during the war she was the angel of the battlefield during the civil war many women went to work in factories such as the munitions plant illustrated here.
the women replaced men who were away fighting.
22 4 antietam a bloody affair the battle of bull run ended northerners hopes for a quick victory.
in the months that followed that sobering defeat the union began to carry out the anaconda plan.
the anaconda plan in action step one of the anaconda plan was to blockade the souths ports and cut off its trade.
in 1861 the j xl 1 1 1 1 n.
anu lul un ns iraae.
in 1001 me union navy launched the blockade.
by the end of the year most ports in the south were closed to foreign ships.
the south had long exported its cotton to great britain and france.
the confederacy looked to great britain to send ships to break through the blockade.
the british however refused this request.
as a result the south could not export cotton to europe or import needed supplies.
early in 1862 the union began to put step two of the anaconda an into action.
the strategy was to divide the confederacy by gaining control of the mississippi river.
in april union admiral david arragut led 46 ships up the mississippi river to new orleans.
this was the largest american fleet ever assembled.
in the face of such overwhelming force the city surrendered without firing a shot eanw lie union forces headed by general ulysses s grant egan moving south toward the mississippi from illinois.

lee hoped this show of strength might persuade maryland to join the confederacy.
he also hoped that a confederate victory on union soil would convince european nations to support the south.
on a crisp september day in 1862 confederate and union armies met near the maryland town of sharpsburg along antietam creek.
all daylong mcclellans troops pounded lees badly outnumbered forces.
the following day lee retreated to virginia.
mcclellan claimed antietam as a union victory.
but many who fought there saw the battle as a defeat for both armies.
of the 75 000 union troops who fought at antietam about 2 100 were killed.
about 10 300 were wounded or missing.
of the 52 000 confederates who fought at antietam about 2 770 lost their lives while 11 000 were wounded or missing.
in that single day of fighting more americans were killed than in the war of 1812 and the mexican war combined.
the battle of antietam was the bloodiest day of the war.
the new realities of war the horrifying death toll at antietam reflected the new realities of warfare.
in past wars battles had been fought in hand to hand combat using bayonets.
during the civil war improved weapons made killing from a distance much easier.
rifles which replaced muskets were accurate over long distances.
improved cannons and artillery also made it easier for armies to attack forces some distance away.
as a result armies could meet fight die and part without either side winning a clear victory.
medical care was not as advanced as weaponry.
civil war doctors had no understanding of the causes of infections.
surgeons operated in dirty hospital tents with basic instruments.
few bothered to wash their hands between patients.
as a result infections spread rapidly from patient to patient.
the hospital death rate was so high that soldiers often refused medical care.
an injured ohio soldier wrote that he chose to return to battle rather than see a doctor thinking that i had better die by rebel bullets than union quackery unskilled medical care as staggering as the battle death tolls were far more soldiers died of diseases than wounds.
unsanitary conditions in army camps were so bad that about three men died of typhoid pneumonia and other diseases for every one who died in battle.
as one soldier observed these big battles are not as bad as the fever medical care was shockingly poor during the civil war.
thousands of soldiers died from infections or diseases.
nevertheless nurses performed heroically as they cared forthe sick and wounded.
22 5 gettysburg a turning point while neither side won the battle of antietam it was enough of a victory for lincoln to take his first steps toward ending slavery.
when the civil war began lincoln had resisted pleas from abolitionists to make emancipation or the freeing of slaves a reason for fighting the confederacy.
he himself opposed slavery.
but the purpose of the war he said is to save the union and is not either to save or destroy slavery in this illustration slaves waitfor the emancipation proclamation.
while the proclamation had little immediate effect it meantthe union was now fighting to end slavery.
the emancipation proclamation as the war dragged on lincoln changed his mind.
he decided to make abolition a goal of the union.
lincoln realized that european nations that opposed slavery would never support the side that did not want slavery to end.
freeing slaves could also deprive the confederacy of a large part of its workforce.
on january 1 1863 president lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation.
the proclamation or formal order declared slaves in all confederate states to be free.
this announcement had little immediate effect on slavery.
the confederate states ignored the document.
slaves living in states loyal to the union were not affected by the proclamation.
still for many in the north the emancipation proclamation changed the war into a crusade for freedom.
the declaration of independence had said that all men are created equal now the fight was about living up to those words.
emancipation proclamation an order issued by president lincoln on january 1 1863 declaring slaves in the confederate states to be free the battle of gettysburg in the summer of 1863 lee felt confident enough to risk another invasion of the north.
he hoped to capture a northern city and help convince the weary north to seek peace union and confederate troops met on july 1 1863 west of gettysburg pennsylvania.
the union troops about 90 000 strong were led by newly appointed general george c meade.
after a brief skirmish they occupied four miles of high ground along an area known as cem etery ridge.
about a mile to the west some 75 000 confederate troop.
gathered behind seminary ridge.
the following day the confederates attempted to find weak spots ir the union position.
the union lines held firm.
on the third day lee or dered an all out attack on the center of the union line.
cannons filled the air with smoke and thunder.
george pickett led 15 000 confederate soldiers in a charge across the low ground separating the two forces.
pickett s charge marked the northernmost point reached by southern troops during the war.
but as confederate troops pressed forward union gunners opened great holes in their advancing lines.
those mei who managed to make their way to cemetery ridge were struck down by union soldiers in hand to hand combat.
although gettysburg was a victory for the union the losses on both sides were staggering.
more than 17 500 union soldiers and 23 00 on ederate troops were killed or wounded in three days of battle ee who lost about a third of his army withdrew to virginia.
from is point on he would only wage a defensive war on southern soil.
430 chapter 22 opposition on the union home front despite the victory at gettysburg lincoln faced a number of problems on the home front.
one was opposition to the war itself.
a group of northern democrats were more interested in restoring peace than in saving the union or ending slavery.
republicans called these democrats copperheads after a poisonous snake with that name.
other northerners opposed the war because they were sympathetic to the confederate cause.
when a proslavery mob attacked union soldiers marching through maryland lincoln sent in troops to keep order.
he also used his constitutional power to temporarily suspend the right of habeas corpus.
during the national emergency citizens no longer had the right to appear before a court to face charges.
people who were suspected of disloyalty were jailed without being charged for a crime.
lincoln s gettysburg address in 1863 president lincoln traveled to gettysburg.
thousands of the men who died there had been buried in a new cemetery.
lincoln was among those invited to speak at the dedication of this new burial ground.
the nation would never forget lincoln s gettysburg address.
the president deliberately spoke of the war in words that echoed the declaration of independence.
the great civil war he said was testing whether a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to t e proposition that all men are created equal can long endure he spoke of the brave men living and dead who had fought to e en that ideal.
the world can never forget what they did here.
finally he called on americans to remain dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.
on july 3 1863 general george pickett led 15 000 confederate troops in a charge against the union lines.
row after row of confederate soldiers fell under a rain of bullets until they finally retreated.
habeas corpus the right of an accused person to appear in court so a judge can determine whether he or she is being imprisoned lawfully gettysburg address a speech by president abraham lincoln in 1863 at the site of the battle of gettysburg in memory of the union soldiers who had died trying to protect the ideals of freedom upon which the nation was founded the civil war 43 22 6 vicksburg a besieged city the civil war was a war of many technological firsts.
it was the first american war to use railroads to move troops and to keep them supplied.
it was the first war in which telegraphs were used to communicate with distant armies.
it was the first conflict to be recorded in photographs.
it was also the first to see combat between armor plated steamships.
the merrimac and the monitor early in the war union forces withdrew from the navy yard in norfolk virginia.
they left behind a warship named the merrimac.
the confederacy began the war with no navy.
they covered the wooden merrimac with iron plates and added a powerful ram to its prow.
in response the union navy built its own ironclad ship called the monitor.
completed in less than 100 days the monitor had a flat deck and two heavy guns in a revolving turret.
it was said to resemble a cheese box on a raft in march 1862 the merrimac which the confederates had renamed the virginia steamed into chesapeake bay to attack union ships.
with cannonballs harmlessly bouncing off its sides the iron monster destroyed three wooden ships and threatened the entire union blockade fleet.
the next morning the vir ginia was met by the monitor.
the two ironclads exchanged shots for hours before withdrawing.
neither could claim victory and neither was harmed.
the battle of the merrimac and the monitor showed that iron clad ships were superior to wooden vessels.
after that both sides added ironclads to their navies.
the south however was never able to build enough ships to end the union blockade of southern harbors.
in 1862 the monitor and the merrimac two iron clad ships fought to a standstill.
the battle signaled the end of wooden warships.
control of the mississippi ironclads were part of the unions campaign to divide the south by taking control of the mississippi river after seizing new orleans in 1862 admiral david farragut moved up the mississippi to capture the cities of baton rouge and natchez.
at the same time other union ships gained control of memphis tennessee.
the union now controlled both ends of the mississippi.
the south could no longer move men or supplies up and down the river.
but neither could the north as long as the confederates continued to control one key location vicksburg mississippi.
432 chapter 22 the siege of vicksburg the town of vicksburg was located on a bluff above a hairpin turn in the mississippi river.
the city was easy to defend and difficult to capture.
whoever held vicksburg could with a few well placed cannons control movement along the mississippi.
but even farragut had to admit with fellow officer david porter that ships cannot crawl up hills 300 feet high an army would be needed to take vicksburg.
in may 1863 general ulysses s grant battled his way to vicksburg with the needed army.
for six weeks union gunboats shelled the city from the river while grant s army bombarded it from land.
slowly but surely the union troops burrowed toward the city in trenches and tunnels.
as shells pounded the city people in vicksburg dug caves into the hillsides for protection.
to survive they ate horses mules and bread made of corn and dried peas.
it had the properties of indian rubber said one confederate soldier and was worse than leather to digest low on food and supplies vicksburg surrendered on july 4 1863.
the mississippi was now a union waterway and the confederacy was cut in two.
for more than a month union forces bom barded vicksburg with an average of 2 800 shells a day.
forced to eat horses mules dogs and rats the confederates finally surrendered.
problems on the confederate home front as the war raged on life in the south became grim.
because of the blockade imported goods disappeared from stores.
what few items were available were extremely expensive.
unable to sell their tobacco and cotton to the north or to other countries farmers planted food crops instead.
still the south was often hungry.
invading union armies destroyed crops.
they also cut fail lines making it difficult to move food and supplies to southern cities and army camps.
as clothing wore out southerners made do with patches and homespun cloth.
at the beginning of the war mary boykin chesnut had written in her journal of well dressed confederate troops.
by 1863 she was writing of soldiers dressed in rags and tags.
by 1864 southerners were writing letters like this one to soldiers on the battlefront we havent got nothing in the house to eat but a little bit o meal.
i dont want to you to stop lighten them yankees but try and get off and come home and fix us all up some.
many soldiers found it hard to resist such pleas even if going home meant deserting their units.
4 i african american soldiers displayed their courage during their attack on fort wagner.
the 54th massachusetts infantry charged across 200 yards of open beach in their effort to reach the fort.
22 7 fort wagner african americans and the war early in the war abolitionists had urged congress to recruit african americans for the army.
but at first most northerners regarded the conflict as a white mans war congress finally opened the door to black recruits in 1862.
about 186 000 african americans many of them former slaves enlisted in the union army.
another 30 000 african americans joined the union navy.
the massachusetts 54th regiment massachusetts was one of the first states to organize black regiments.
the most famous was the 54th massachusetts infantry commanded by colonel robert gould shaw.
two of the 54th infantry s 1 000 soldiers were sons of frederick douglass.
the men of the massachusetts 54th were paid less than white soldiers.
when the black soldiers learned this they protested the unequal treatment by refusing to accept any pay at all.
in a letter to lincoln corporal james henry gooding asked are we soldiers or are we laborers.
we have done a soldier s duty.
why can t we have a soldier s pay.
at lincoln s urging congress finally granted black soldiers equal pay.
after three months of training the massachusetts 54th was sent to south carolina to take part in an attack on fort wagner outside of charleston.
as they prepared for battle the ment of the 54th faced the usual worries of untested troops.
but they also faced the added fear that if captured they might be sold into slavery.
434 chapter 22 african americans at war the assault on fort wagner was an impossible mission.
to reach the fort troops had to cross 200 yards of open sandy beach.
rifle and cannon fire poured down on them.
after losing nearly half of their men the survivors of the 54th regiment retreated.
but their bravery won them widespread respect.
during the war 166 african american regiments fought in nearly 500 battles.
black soldiers often received little training poor equipment and less pay than white soldiers.
they also risked death or enslavement if captured.
still african americans fought with great courage to save the union.
22 8 appomattox total war brings an end during the first years of the war lincoln had searched for a commander who was willing to fight the confederates.
the president finally found the leader he needed in general grant.
he made grant commander of the union forces in march 1864.
grant s views on war were quite straightforward the art of war is simple enough.
find out where your enemy is.
get at him as soon as you can.
strike at him as hard as you can and as often as you can and keep moving on using this strategy grant mapped out a plan for ending the war.
he would lead a large force against lee to capture richmond.
at the same time general william tecumseh sherman would lead a second army into georgia to take atlanta.
in 1864 lincoln gave command of all union forces to ulysses s grant.
grant believed in using his larger army to wear down the enemy regardless of the casualties that his own forces suffered.
grant invades virginia in may 1864 general grant invaded virginia with a force of more than 100 000 men.
they met lees army of 60 000 in a dense forest known as the wilderness.
in two days of fierce fighting grant lost 18 000 men.
still grant would not retreat.
i propose to fight it out along this line he said if it takes all summer.
he followed lees army to cold harbor virginia where he lost 7 000 men in 15 minutes of fighting.
by the time the two forces reached petersburg a railroad center 20 miles south of richmond grants losses almost equaled lees entire army.
but he was able to reinforce his army with fresh troops.
lee who had also suffered heavy losses could not.
total war grant believed in total war war on the enemys will to fight and its ability to support an army.
with his army tied down in northern virginia grant ordered general philip sheridan to wage total war in virginias grain rich shenandoah valley.
let that valley be so left that crows flying over it will have to carry their rations along with them ordered grant.
general sherman a believer in total war cut a path of destruction through georgia.
this photograph shows the burned ruins of atlanta.
in may 1864 general sherman left tennessee for georgia with orders to inflict all the damage you can against their war resources in september sherman reached atlanta the souths most important rail and manufacturing center.
his army set the city ablaze.
the reelection of lincoln any hope of victory for the south lay in the defeat of president lincoln in the election of 1864.
northern democrats nominated general george mcclellan to run against lincoln.
knowing that the north was weary of war mcclellan urged an immediate end to the conflict.
lincoln doubted he would win reelection.
grant seemed stuck in northern virginia and there was no end in sight to the appalling bloodletting.
luckily for the president sheridan s destruction of the shenandoah valley and sherman s capture of atlanta came just in time to rescue his campaign.
these victories changed northern views of lincoln and his prospects for ending the war.
in november lincoln was reelected.
sherman s march through georgeia after burning atlanta sherman marched his army across the state toward savannah promising to make georgia howl.
his purpose was to destroy the last untouched supply base for the confederacy as they marched through georgia sherman s troops destroyed everything they found of value.
they trampled or burned fields and stripped houses of their valuables.
they burned supplies of hay and food.
dead horses hogs and cattle that his troops could not eat or carry away lined the roads.
the troops destroyed everything useful in a 60 mile wide path.
436 chapter 22 in december 1864 sherman captured savannah georgia.
from there he turned north and destroyed all opposition in the carolinas.
marching 425 miles in 50 days he reached raleigh north carolina by march 1865.
there he waited for grants final attack on richmond.

the civil war reading further benjamin hardin helm married emilietodd helm sisters mary todd lincoln abraham lincoln married 1 benjamin hardin helm s dilemma benjamin hardin helm was born in the southern state of kentucky and married a southern woman.
but that led to family connections and even job opportunities with the most powerful family in the north.
which side would he choose.
divided house divided families before the civil war abraham lincoln had warned a house divided against itself cannot stand.
but the nation did divide.
people took sides.
north or south.
for most of them the choice was clear.
but for some especially in the border states the decision was difficult and painful.
not only was the country divided but many families were too.
even as the civil war began benjamin hardin helm had the prospect of a bright future in front of him.
president lincoln had offered him a good job with the union army.
the position paid well and would not require helm to fight.
it was a job many people wanted.
the position you offer me is beyond what i had expected in my most hopeful dreams helm told the president.
still he could not decide.
helm was from kentucky a border state divided in its loyalties between north and south.
he came from a prominent family and had served in the state legislature.
he had also been an officer in the u s army.
helm favored the south and many of his family members and friends did too.
but he also had friends and family who supported the north.
even his father a former governor backed the union.
there was a further complication.
helm was married to emilie todd a sister of mary todd lincoln president lincolns wife.
that made helm the president s brother in law.
he and emilie were close to the lincolns.
helm struggled with his decision.
lincolns offer was generous.
by accepting it however helm would be turning against much of his family including members who had joined the confederate army.
by refusing it he would cut himself off from other members of the family such as the lincolns.
i had a bitter struggle with myself he told a friend.
in the end helm turned down the presidents offer.
it was the most painful moment of my life he said but he felt he could not take up arms against the south.
instead he joined the confederate cause and fought against the union.
helm s dilemma though difficult was not unusual.
many people found themselves torn between competing loyalties during the civil war.
this was especially true in border states like kentucky mary and missouri and delaware.
although these states remained in the union many of their citizens felt sympathy for the south.
families in border states were often deeply divided over the war.
lee s decision virginia was also a border state but one that joined the confederacy obert e lee was one of its military heroes.
like hardin helm lee a ol i decision.
he too was offered a key position in the union army.
and like helm he turned it down with great misgivings.
440 before the war lee was one of the most promising officers in the u s army.
a graduate of west point he had served with distinction during the mexican war.
as the civil war began lincoln sent word to lee offering him command of the union army.
lee was honored by the presidents offer.
he supported the union and thought secession was a mistake.
but he was a loyal virginian above all and would not turn against his home state.
with all my devotion to the union he wrote i have not been able to.
raise my hand against my relatives my children my home lee resigned his position and became a confederate general.
the man who might have led the union army eventually became the top commander of the confederate forces.
lincoln s family troubles robert e lees decision probably came as little surprise to lincoln.
he knew that southern officers had divided loyalties in the same way that states and families did.
lincolns own family was a case in point.
the president actually had little immediate family of his own.
but his wifes family the todds was quite large.
mary todd lincoln had 14 brothers and sisters all from kentucky.
of these 6 supported the union and 8 backed the confederacy.
several of her brothers fought in the confederate army.
the todds were important to lincoln and he did everything in his power to help them even when they turned against him.
just as he hied to hold the nation together he tried to keep the family together.
but this was too much for even the president to accomplish.
robert e lee was a brilliant soldier who left the u s army to fight for his home state.
he became the confederacy s top general and personal military adviserto the confederate president jefferson davis.
the civil war 4l henry lane stone joined the ninth kentucky cavalry led by general john h morgan.
he took part in various battles including a famous raid into union territory.
as kentucky goes so goes the nation president lincoln saw kentucky as a symbol of the nations divisions.
in fact the union and confederate leaders lincoln and jefferson davis were both from kentucky they were born just 100 miles apart.
the states white soldiers were split almost evenly between north and south.
two fifths fought for the confederacy and three fifths for the union.
no other state was so evenly divided.
lincoln believed it was essential to keep kentucky in the union.
i think to lose kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game he said.
kentucky gone we cannot hold missouri nor as i think maryland officially kentucky remained neutral in the war and lincoln did what he could to keep it from seceding.
i hope to have god on my side he supposedly said but i must have kentucky fathers and sons divided among kentucky families some of the bitterest divisions arose between fathers and sons.
the crittenden family was one example.
john j crittenden was a respected member of congress who had worked hard to prevent the civil war.
early in the war he wrote to his oldest son george urging him to remain loyal to the union.
kentucky loves the union he wrote and will cling to it as long as possible.
and so i hope will you his words were in vain.
george joined the confederate army and in turn crittenden cut off all contact with his son.
another case involved the breckenridge family.
robert j breckenridge was a strong union supporter.
but his son robert jr decided to join the confederacy.
he wrote his father be as lenient as possible in your thoughts of me.
breckenridge was stunned.
he wrote his other son willie saying your brother has hopelessly ruined himself then willie joined the confederacy too.
breckenridge was doubly stricken.
one young kentuckian henry lane stone ran away from home to join the rebel forces.
he did so in secret because he knew his father and brothers would object.
one of his brothers had already joined the union army.
a month later stone wrote home to his father.
i can imagine how your feelings are one son in the northern and another in the southern army he wrote.
but so it is.
your rebelling son henry.
442 chapter 22 brother against brother henry stone and his brother fought on opposing sides in the war.
this was not uncommon.
in fact the civil war was sometimes called the brothers war one notable case of brother against brother involved the campbell brothers from scotland.
james and alexander campbell came to america in the 1850s.
james settled in charleston south carolina.
alexander chose new york.
when the war began both signed up to fight though on opposite sides.
in june 1862 alexanders regiment was part of an invasion force sent to retake charleston from the confederates.
at the battle of seces sionville union troops attacked ft lamar one of the forts guarding the city.
although neither brother knew it at the time they were both involved in the battle.
alexander held the u s flag at the base of the forts walls while james stood above firing down on the attackers.
james later wrote his brother i was astonished to hear from the prisoners that you were color bearer of the regiment that assaulted the battery.
i hope you and i will never again meet on the battlefield but if such should be the case.
i will strive to discharge my duty to my country and my cause.
the two brothers fought in other battles of the war but never again in the same place.
after the war they corresponded with each other and remained on good terms.
another soldier matthew h peters later recounted his own experience of the brothers war in a poem both of us fought for what we thought right but of duty each took a different view both of us entered the perilous fight and did our duty as patriots do but he wore the gray and i wore the blue.
matthew h peters my brother and i 1893 unlike these soldiers hardin helm did not survive the war.
he was killed at the battle of chickamauga in 1863.
when lincoln got the news he was devastated.
i never saw mr lincoln more moved than when he heard of the death of his young brother in law said a friend.
helm had died fighting for the confederacy but he was still family.
for lincoln helms death was yet another tragedy of the divide nation.
families and communities had been torn apart by the war.
would take years for the wounds to heal.
at the end of the civil war grateful families welcomed the soldiers home.
in divided families the homecomings were not always easy.
i the civil war.
