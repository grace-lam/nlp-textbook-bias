254 chapter 11 cotton economies might have forced the region to shift its attention to other nonagricultural pursuits had it not been for the growing importance of a new product that soon short staple cotton overshadowed all else short staple cotton.
it was a hardier and coarser strain of cotton that could grow successfully in a variety of climates and soils.
it was harder to process than the long staple cotton because its seeds were difficult to remove from the fiber.
but the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 had largely solved that problem.
demand for cotton increased rapidly in britain in the 1820s and 1830s and in new england in the 1840s and 1850s.
from the western areas of south carolina and georgia production moved into alabama and mississippi and then into northern louisiana texas and arkansas.
by the 1850s cotton had become the linchpin of the southern economy.
by the time of the civil war cotton constituted nearly two thirds of the total export trade of the united states.
it was little wonder that southern politicians now proclaimed cotton is king cotton production boomed in the lower south later known as the deep south.
some began to call it the cotton kingdom the prospect of tremendous profits drew settlers to the lower south by the thousands.
some were wealthy planters from the older states but most were small slaveholders or slaveless farmers who hoped to move into the planter class.
a similar shift if an involuntary one occurred in the slave population.
between 1840 and 1860 hundreds of thousands of slaves moved from the upper south to the cotton states either accompanying masters who were themselves migrating to the lower south or more often sold to planters already there.
this second middle passage as the historian ira berlin has called it using a term usually associated with the transatlantic slave trade was a traumatic experience for perhaps a million dislocated african americans.
slave families were b roken up and scattered across the expand second middle passage ing cotton kingdom.
marched over hundreds of rugged miles tied together in coffles as on the earlier slave ships coming from africa they arrived in unfamiliar and usually forbidding territory where they were made to construct new plantations and work in cotton fields.
the sale of slaves to the lower south became an important economic activity for whites in the upper south where agricultural production was declining.
southern trade and industry in the face of this booming agricultural expansion other forms of economic activity were slow to develop in the south.
flour milling and textile and iron manufacturing grew particularly in the upper south but industry remained a relatively insignificant force in comparison with the agricultural economy.
the total value of southern textile manufactures in 1860 was 4 5 million a threefold increase over the value of those goods twenty years before.
but the value of the exports was approximately 200 million.
the limited nonfarm commercial sector that did develop in the south was largely intended to serve the needs of the plantation economy.
particularly important were the brokers or factors who in the absence of banks marketed the planters crops and provided them with credit.
other obstacles to economic development included the souths inadequate transportation system.
canals were almost nonexistent most roads were crude and unsuitable for heavy transport and railroads although they expanded substantially in the 1840s and 1850s failed to tie the region together effectively.
despite the lack of canals the principal means of transportation was still water.
planters generally shipped their crops to market along rivers or by sea most manufacturing was in or near port towns.
the south therefore was becoming more and more dependent on the industrial manufacturers merchants and professionals of the north.
concerned by this trend some cotton slavery and the old south 255 southerners began to advocate economic independence for the region among them james d b.
de bow of new orleans whose magazine de bows de bows commercial review commercial review called for southern commercial expansion and economic independence from the north.
yet even de bows commercial review was filled with advertisements from northern manufacturing firms and its circulation was far smaller in the south than such northern magazines as harpers weekly.
sources of southern difference an important question about antebellum southern history concerns why the region did so little to develop a larger industrial and commercial economy of its own.
why did it remain so different from the north.
part of the reason was the great profitability of the regions agricultural system.
in the northeast many people had turned to manufacturing as the agricultural economy of the region declined.
in the south the agricultural economy was booming and ambitious capitalists had little incentive to look elsewhere.
another reason was that wealthy southerners had so much capital invested in land and slaves that they had little left for other investments.
some historians have also suggested that the southern climate with its long hot steamy summers was less suitable for industrial development than the climate of the north.
edgar degas the renowned french painter painted this scene of cotton traders examining samples in the new orleans cotton exchange in 1873.
by this time the cotton trade was producing less impressive profits than those that had made it the driving force of the booming southern economy of the 1850s.
degass mother came from a creole family of cotton brokers in new orleans and two of the artists brothers depicted here reading a newspaper and leaning against a window joined the business in america.
musee des beaux arts pau france bridgeman images the new orleans cotton exchange 256 chapter 11 but this southern failure was also due in part to a set of values distinctive to the south.
many white southerners liked to think of themselves as representatives of a special way of life.
they argued that grace and refinement were more important than rapid growth and development.
but appealing as this image was to southern whites it conformed to the reality of southern society in very limited ways.
southern white society only a very small minority of southern whites owned slaves.
in 1860 when the white population was just above 8 million the number of slaveholders was only 383 637.
even with all members of slaveowning families included in the figures those living in slaveowning households still amounted to perhaps no more than one quarter of the white population.
and only a small proportion of this relatively small number of slaveowners owned slaves in substantial numbers.
yet as the cotton economy surged in the late 1850s white supporters championed its value to southern society and argued for a ruling planter class and working slave class.

cotton slavery and the old south 257 the planter class how then did the south come to be seen as a society dominated by wealthy slaveowning planters.
in large part it was because the planter aristocracy exercised power and influence far in excess of its numbers.
white southerners liked to compare their planter class to the old aristocracies of england and europe but the comparison was not a sound one.
in some areas of the upper south the great aristocrats were indeed people whose families had occupied positions of wealth and power for generations.
in most of the south however many of the great landowners were still first generation settlers as late as the 1850s who had only relatively recently started to live in the comfort and luxury for which they became famous.
large areas of the south had been settled and cultivated for less than two decades at the time of the civil war.
nor was the world of the planter nearly as leisured and genteel as the aristocratic myth would suggest.
growing staple crops was a tough business.
planters were just as much competitive capitalists as the industrialists of the north.
even many affluent planters lived rather modestly their wealth so heavily invested in land and slaves that there was often little left for personal comfort.
and white planters including some substantial ones tended to move frequently as new and presumably more productive areas opened up to cultivation.
wealthy southern whites sustained their image as aristocrats in many ways.
they adopted an elaborate code of chivalry which obligated white men to defend their honor often through dueling.
they tended to avoid such coarse occupations as trade and commerce those who did not become planters often gravitated toward the military.
the aristocratic ideal also found reflection in the definition of a special the aristocratic ideal role for southern white women.
the southern lady in some respects affluent white women in the south occupied roles very similar to those of middle class white women in the north.
their lives generally centered in the home where according to the souths social ideal they served as companions to and hostesses for their husbands and as nurturing mothers for their children.
genteel southern white women seldom engaged in public activities or found income producing employment.
but the life of the southern lady was also very different from that of her northern counterpart.
for one thing the cult of honor dictated that southern white men give particular importance to the defense of women.
in practice this generally meant that white men were even more dominant and white women even regional differences in womens lives more subordinate in southern culture than they were in the north.
social theorist george fitzhugh wrote in the 1850s women like children have but one right and that is the right to protection.
the right to protection involves the obligation to obey more important in determining the role of southern white women however was that the vast majority of them lived on farms with little access to the public world and thus few opportunities to look beyond their roles as wives and mothers.
for many white women living on farms of modest size meant a fuller engagement in the economic life of the family than was typical for middle class women in the north.
these women engaged in spinning weaving and other production they participated in agricultural tasks they helped supervise the slave workforce.
on the larger plantations however even these limited roles were often considered unsuitable for white women and the plantation mistress became in some cases more an ornament for her husband than an active part co ns ider t he s o urc e senator james henry hammond declares is king 1858 james henry hammond a u s senator from south carolina was a leading advocate for the overwhelming significance of cotton to the economy of the south and the nation.
he famously made his point in 1858 in his cotton is king speech.
if we never acquire another foot of territory for the south look at her.
eight hundred and fifty thousand square miles.
as large as great britain france austria prussia and spain.
is not that territory enough to make an empire that shall rule the world.
with the finest soil the most delightful climate whose staple productions none of those great countries can grow we have three thousand miles of continental shore line so indented with bays and crowded with islands that when their shore lines are added we have twelve thousand miles.
through the heart of our country runs the great mississippi the father of waters into whose bosom are poured thirty six thousand miles of tributary streams and beyond we have the desert prairie wastes to protect us in our rear.
can you hem in such a territory as that.
upon our muster rolls we have a million of militia.
in a defensive war upon an emergency every one of them would be available.
at any time the south can raise equip and maintain in the field a larger army than any power of the earth can send against her and an army of soldiers men brought up on horseback with guns in their hands.
it appears by going to the reports of the secretary of the treasury which are authentic that last year the united states exported in round numbers 279 000 000 worth of domestic produce excluding gold and foreign merchandise re exported.
of this amount 158 000 000 worth is the clear produce of the south.
w e have nothing to do but to take off restrictions on foreign merchandise and open our ports and the whole world will come to us to trade.
they will be too glad to bring and carry for us and we never shall dream of a war.
why the south has never yet had a just cause of war.
every time she has drawn her sword it has been on the point of honor and that point of honor has been mainly loyalty to her sister colonies and sister states who have ever since plundered and calumniated her.
but if there were no other reason why we should never have war would any sane nation make war on cotton.
without firing a gun without drawing a sword should they make war on us we can bring the whole world to our feet.
the south is perfectly competent to go on one two or three years without planting a seed of cotton.
i believe that if she was to plant but half her cotton for three years to come it would be an immense advantage to her.
i am not so sure but that after three total years abstinence she would come out stronger than ever she was before and better prepared to enter afresh upon her great career of enterprise.
england would topple headlong and carry the whole civilized world with her save the south.
no you dare not make war on cotton.
no power on earth dares to make war upon it.
cotton is king.
in all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties to perform the drudgery of life.
that is a class requiring but a low order of intellect and but little skill.
its requisites are vigor docility fidelity.
fortunately for the south she found a race adapted to that purpose to her hand a race inferior to her own but eminently qualified in temper in vigor in docility in capacity to stand the climate understand analyze evaluate to answer all her purposes.

of the economy or the society.
southern white women also had less access to education than their northern counterparts.
the few female academies in the south trained women primarily to be suitable wives.
southern white women had other special burdens as well.
the southern white birthrate remained nearly 20 percent higher than that of the nation as a whole but special burdens infant mortality in the region remained higher than elsewhere.
the slave labor system also had a mixed impact on white women.
it helped spare many of them from certain kinds of arduous labor but it also damaged their relationships with their husbands.
male slaveowners had frequent forced sexual relationships with the female slaves on their plantations the children of those unions served as a constant reminder to white women of their husbands infidelities.
black women and men were obviously the most important victims of such practices but white women suffered too.
the plain folk the typical white southerner was a yeoman farmer.
some of these plain folk as they became known owned a few slaves with whom they worked and lived more closely than did the larger planters.
some plain folk most of whom owned their own land devoted themselves largely to subsistence farming others grew cotton or other crops for the market but usually could not produce enough to allow them to expand their operations or even get out of debt.
one reason was the southern educational system.
for the sons of wealthy planters the region provided ample opportunities to gain an education.
in 1860 there were 260 southern colleges and universities public and private with 25 000 students enrolled in them.
but as in the rest of the united states universities were only within the reach of the upper class.
the elementary and secondary schools of the south were not only fewer than but also inferior to those of the northeast.
the south had more than 500 000 illiterate whites over half the nations total.
the subordination of the plain folk to the planter class raises an important question why did lower class whites not oppose the aristocratic social system from which they benefited so little.
259 260 chapter 11 some nonslaveowning whites did oppose the planter elite but for the most part in limited ways and in isolated areas.
these were mainly the hill people who lived in the appalachian ranges east of the mississippi in the ozarks to the west of the river and in other hill country or backcountry areas.
they practiced a simple form of subsistence agriculture owned practically no slaves and were in most respects unconnected to the cotton economy.
such whites frequently expressed animosity toward the planter aristocracy.
unsurprisingly the mountain regions were the only parts of the south to resist the movement toward secession in the early 1860s.
even during the civil war itself many refused to support the confederacy.
far greater in number however were the nonslaveowning whites who lived in the midst of the plantation system.
many perhaps most of them accepted that system because they were tied to it in important ways.
small farmers depended on the local plantation aristocracy for access to cotton gins markets for their modest crops and their livestock and credit or other financial assistance in time of need.
in many areas moreover the poorest resident of a county might easily be a cousin of the richest aristocrat.
in the 1850s the cotton boom allowed many small farmers to improve their economic fortunes.
some bought more land became s laveowners and moved into at least the fringes of plantation society.
others simply felt more secure in their positions as independent yeomen and hence were more likely to embrace the fierce regional loyalty that was spreading throughout the white south in these years.
there were other white southerners however who were known at the time variously as crackers sand hillers or poor white trash occupying the infertile lands of the pine barrens the red hills and the swamps they lived in genuine squalor.
many owned no land poorest whites and supported themselves by foraging or hunting.
others worked at times as common laborers for their neighbors.
their degradation resulted partly from dietary deficiencies and disease.
forced to resort at times to eating clay hence the tendency of moreaffluent whites to refer to them disparagingly as clay eaters they suffered from pellagra hookworm and malaria.
planters and small farmers alike held them in contempt.
even among these southerners the true outcasts of white society there was no real opposition to the plantation system or slavery.
in part this was because they were so benumbed by shared sense of racial supremacy poverty that they had little strength to protest.
but the single greatest unifying factor among the southern white population was their perception of race.
however poor and miserable white southerners might be they could still look down on the black population of the region and feel a bond with their fellow whites and a sense of racial supremacy.
hill people slavery the peculiar institution white southerners often referred to slavery as the peculiar institution meaning that it was distinctive special.
and indeed it was.
the south in the mid nineteenth century was the only area in the western world except for brazil cuba and puerto rico where slavery still existed.
slavery more than any other single factor isolated the south from the rest of american society and much of the world.
within the south itself slavery produced paradoxical results.
on one hand it isolated blacks from whites.
as a result african americans under slavery began to develop a society and culture of their own.
on the other hand slavery created a unique bond between blacks and whites slaves and masters in the south.
the two groups may have maintained separate spheres but each sphere was deeply influenced by the other.
in both cases slavery profoundly affected all aspects of southern and even american society.
see debating the past the character of slavery cotton slavery and the old south 261 varieties of slavery southern slave codes forbade slaves to hold property to leave their masters premises without permission to be out after dark to congregate with other slaves except slave codes at church to carry firearms to testify in court against white people or to strike a white person even in self defense.
the codes prohibited whites from teaching slaves to read or write.
the laws contained no provisions to legalize slave marriages or divorces.
if an owner killed a slave while punishing him the act was generally not considered a crime.
slaves however faced the death penalty for killing or even resisting a white person and for inciting revolt.
the codes also contained extraordinarily rigid provisions for defining a persons race.
anyone with a trace or often even a rumor of african ancestry was defined as black.
enforcement of the codes however was spotty and uneven.
some slaves did acquire property did become literate and did assemble with other slaves.
white owners themselves handled most transgressions by their slaves and inflicted widely varying punishments.
in other words despite the rigid provisions of law there was in reality considerable difference within the slave system.
some slaves lived in almost prisonlike conditions rigidly and harshly controlled by their masters.
many probably most others experienced considerable flexibility and autonomy.
the nature of the relationship between masters and slaves depended in part on the size of the plantation.
white farmers with few slaves generally plantation size and slave experience supervised their workers directly and often worked closely alongside them.
the paternal relationship between such masters and their slaves could be warm and benevolent or tyrannical and cruel.
in general african americans themselves preferred to live on larger plantations where they had a chance for a social world of their own.
although the majority of slaveowners were small farmers the majority of slaves lived on plantations of medium or large size with substantial slave workforces.
thus the relationship between master and slave was much less intimate for the typical slave than for the typical slaveowner.
substantial planters often hired overseers and even assistant overseers to represent them.
head drivers trusted and responsible slaves often assisted by several subdrivers acted under the overseer as foremen.
life under slavery most but not all slaves received an adequate if rude diet consisting mainly of cornmeal salt pork molasses and on rare occasions fresh meat or poultry.
many slaves cultivated gardens for their own use.
their masters provided them with cheap clothing and shoes.
they lived in rough cabins called slave quarters.
the plantation mistress or a doctor retained by the owner provided some medical care but slave women themselves as healers midwives or simply as mothers often were the more important source of medical attention.
slaves worked hard beginning with light tasks as children.
their workdays were longest at harvesttime.
slave women worked particularly hard.
they work conditions generally labored in the fields with the men and they also handled cooking cleaning and child rearing.
many slave families were divided.
husbands and fathers often lived on neighboring plantations at times one spouse usually the male would be sold to a plantation owner far away.
as a result black women often found themselves acting in effect as single parents.
slaves were as a group much less healthy than southern whites.
after 1808 when the importation of slaves became illegal the proportion of blacks to whites in the nation as a whole steadily declined as a result of the comparatively high black death rate.
debating the past the character of slavery no issue in american history has produced a more spirited debate than the nature of plantation slavery.
the debate began well before the civil war when a bolitionists strove to expose slavery to the world as a brutal dehumanizing institution while southern defenders of slavery tried to depict it as a benevolent and paternalistic system.
but by the late nineteenth century with white americans eager for sectional conciliation most northern and southern chroniclers of slavery began to accept a romanticized and unthreatening picture of the old south and its peculiar institution.
the first major scholarly examination of slavery was ulrich b phillipss american negro slavery 1918 which portrayed slavery as an essentially benign institution in which kindly masters looked after submissive and generally contented african americans.
phillipss apologia for slavery remained the authoritative work on the subject for nearly thirty years.
in the 1940s challenges to phillips began to emerge.
melville j herskovits disputed phillipss contention that black americans retained little of their african cultural inheritance.
herbert aptheker published a chronicle of slave revolts as a way of refuting phillipss claim that blacks were submissive and content.
a somewhat different challenge to phillips emerged in the 1950s from historians who emphasized the brutality of the institution.
kenneth stampps the peculiar institution 1956 and stanley elkinss slavery 1959 described a labor system that did serious physical and psychological damage to its victims.
they portrayed slavery as something like a prison in which men and women 262 had virtually no space to develop their own social and cultural lives.
elkins compared the system to nazi concentration camps and likened the childlike sambo personality of slavery to tragic distortions of character produced by the holocaust.
in the early 1970s an explosion of new scholarship on slavery shifted the emphasis away from the damage the system inflicted on african americans and toward the striking success of the slaves themselves in building a culture of their own.
john blassingame in 1973 argued that the most remarkable aspect of the whole process of enslavement is the extent to which the american born slaves were able to retain their ancestors culture herbert gutman in the black family in slavery and freedom 1976 challenged the prevailing belief that slavery had weakened and even destroyed the african american family.
on the contrary gutman argued the black family survived slavery with impressive strength although with some significant differences from the prevailing form of the white family.
eugene genoveses roll jordan roll 1974 revealed how african americans manipulated white paternalist assumptions to build a large c ultural space of their own where they could develop their own family life social traditions and religious patterns.
that same year robert fogel and stanley engerman published the controversial time on the cross a highly quantitative study that supported some of the claims of gutman and genovese about black achievement but that went much further in portraying slavery as a successful and reasonably humane if u ltimately immoral system.
slave workers they argued were better treated and lived in greater this 1855 photograph of a slave woman and masters child is documentary evidence of the complex relationships that historians of slavery have studied.
the library of congress nursing the masters child comfort than most northern i ndustrial workers of the same era.
their conclusions produced a storm of criticism.
other important scholarship includes african american slave women.
elizabeth fox genoveses within the plantation household 1988 examined the lives of both white and black women on the plantation.
she portrayed slave women as defined by their dual roles as members of the plantation workforce and anchors of the black family.
slave women she argued professed loyalty to their mistresses when forced to serve them as domestics but their real loyalty remained to their own communities and families.
more recent studies by walter johnson and ira berlin mark an at least partial return to the damage approach to slavery of the 1970s.
johnsons soul by soul 2000 examines the souths largest slave market new orleans.
for whites he argues purchasing slaves was a way of fulfilling the middle class male fantasy of success and independence.
for the slaves themselves the trade was dehumanizing and destructive to black families and communities.
berlins many thousands gone 2000 and generation of captivity 2003 among the most important studies of slavery in a generation similarly emphasize the dehumanizing character of the slave market and show that whatever white slaveowners might say slavery was less a social system than a commodification of human beings.

why might the conclusions drawn by robert fogel and stanley engerman in time on the cross have provoked vehement criticism.
what might be some reasons for the resurrection of focus on the damage thesis of slavery as in the works by walter johnson and ira berlin.
263 264 chapter 11 clear starching in louisiana this 1837 etching by french artist auguste hervieu depicts a plantation mistress verbally abusing a slave woman and child.
hervieu traveled to america with british writer and abolitionist frances trollope.
this illustration is from trollopes 1836 novel the life and adventures of jonathan jefferson whitlaw or scenes on the mississippi a work that exposed the degrading effects of slavery on both slaves and slaveowners.
the life and adventures of jonathan jefferson whitlaw by frances trollope 1836 slave mothers had large families but the enforced poverty in which virtually all african americans lived ensured that fewer of their children would survive to adulthood than the high mortality rates children of white parents.
even those who did survive typically died at a younger age than the average white person.
household servants had a somewhat easier life physically at least than did field hands.
on a small plantation the same slaves might do both field work and housework.
but on a large estate there would generally be a separate domestic staff nursemaids housemaids cooks butlers coachmen.
these people lived close to the master and his family eating the leftovers from the family table.
between the blacks and whites of such households affectionate almost familial relationships might develop.
more often however house servants resented their isolation from their fellow slaves and the lack of privacy and increased discipline that came with living in such close proximity to the masters family.
when emancipation came after the civil war it was often the house servants who were the first to leave the plantations of their former owners.
female household servants were especially vulnerable to sexual abuse by their masters and sexual abuse white overseers.
in addition to being subjected to unwanted sexual attention from white men female slaves often received vindictive treatment from white women.
plantation mistresses naturally resented the sexual liaisons between their husbands and female slaves.
punishing their husbands was not usually possible so they often punished the slaves instead with arbitrary beatings increased workloads and various forms of psychological torment.
slavery in the cities the conditions of urban slavery differed significantly from those in the countryside.
on the relatively isolated plantations slaves had little contact with free blacks and lower class whites and masters maintained a fairly direct and effective control.
in the city however cotton slavery and the old south 265 a master often could not supervise his slaves closely and at the same time use them profitably.
even if they slept at night in carefully watched backyard barracks they moved about during the day alone performing errands of various kinds.
there was a considerable market in the south for common laborers particularly since unlike in the north there were few european immigrants to perform menial chores.
as a result masters often hired out slaves for such tasks.
slaves on contract worked in mining and lumbering often far from cities but others worked on the docks and on construction sites drove wagons and performed other unskilled jobs in cities and towns.
slave women and children worked in the regions few textile mills.
particularly skilled workers such as blacksmiths or carpenters were also often hired out.
after regular working hours many of them fended for themselves thus urban slaves gained numerous opportunities to mingle with free blacks and with whites.
in the cities the line between slavery and freedom was less distinct than on the plantation.
free african americans over 250 000 free african americans lived in the slaveholding states by the start of the civil war more than half of them in virginia and maryland.
in some cases they were slaves who had somehow earned money to buy their own and their families freedom.
it was most often urban blacks with their greater freedom of movement and activity who could take that route.
one example was elizabeth keckley a slave woman elizabeth keckley who bought freedom for herself and her son with proceeds from sewing.
she later became a seamstress personal servant and companion to mary todd lincoln in the white house.
but few masters had any incentive or inclination to give up their slaves so this route was open to relatively few people.
some slaves were set free by a master who had moral qualms about slavery or by a masters will after his death for example the more than 400 slaves belonging to john randolph of roanoke freed in 1833.
from the 1830s on new restrictions on manumission however state laws governing slavery became stricter in part in response to the fears nat turners revolt created among white southerners.
the new laws made it more difficult and in some cases practically impossible for owners to set free or manumit their slaves.
a few free blacks attained wealth and prominence.
some even owned slaves themselves usually relatives whom they had bought to ensure their ultimate emancipation.
in a few cities new orleans natchez and charleston free black communities managed to flourish with relatively little interference from whites and with some economic stability.
most southern free blacks however lived in abject poverty.
yet great as were the hardships of freedom blacks much preferred it to slavery.
the slave trade the transfer of slaves from one part of the south to another was one of the most important and terrible consequences of slavery.
sometimes slaves moved to the new cotton lands in the company of their original owners who were migrating themselves.
more often however the transfer occurred through the efforts of professional slave traders.
the traders took slaves to such central markets as natchez new orleans mobile and charleston where purchasers bid for them.
a sound young field hand could fetch a price that might vary in the 1840s and 1850s from 500 to 1 700 depending on fluctuations in the market and the health and age of the slaves.
266 chapter 11 the domestic slave trade essential to the growth and prosperity of the system was one of its most horrible aspects.
the trade dehumanized all who were involved in it.
it separated children from parents and parents from each other.
even families kept together by scrupulous owners might be broken up in the division of the estate after the masters death.
planters might deplore the trade but they eased their consciences by holding the traders in contempt.
the foreign slave trade was bad or worse.
although federal law had prohibited the importation of slaves from 1808 on some continued to be smuggled into the united states as late as the 1850s when the supply of slaves was inadequate.
at the annual southern commercial conventions planters began to discuss the legal reopening of the trade.
if it is right to buy slaves in virginia and carry them to new orleans william l yancey asked his fellow delegates in 1858 why is it not right to buy them in cuba brazil or africa the convention that year voted to repeal all the laws against slave imports but the government never acted on their proposal.
the continued smuggling of slaves was not without resistance.
in 1839 a group of 53 slaves in cuba took charge of a ship the amistad that was transporting them to another port in cuba.
their goal was to sail back to their homelands in africa.
the slaves had no experience with sailing and they tried to compel the crew to steer them across the atlantic.
instead the ship sailed up the atlantic coast until it was captured by a ship of the united states revenue service.
many americans including president van buren thought the slaves should be returned to cuba.
but at the request of a group of abolitionists former president john quincy adams went before the supreme court to argue that they should be freed.
adams argued that the foreign slave trade was illegal and thus the amistad rebels could not be returned to slavery.
the court accepted his argument in 1841 and most of the former slaves were returned to africa with funding from american abolitionists.
the offices of slave dealers were familiar sights on the streets of pre civil war southern cities and towns.
they provide testimony to the way in which slavery was not just a social system but a business deeply woven into the fabric of southern economic life.
the library of congress the business of slavery cotton slavery and the old south 267 two years later another group of slaves revolted on board a ship and took control of it this time an american vessel bound from norfolk virginia to new orleans louisiana and steered it and its 135 slaves to the british bahamas where slavery was illegal and the slaves were given sanctuary.
such shipboard revolts were rare but they were symbols of the continued effort by africans to resist slavery.
slave resistance slaveowners liked to argue that the slaves were generally content happy with their lot but it is clear that the vast majority of southern blacks yearned for freedom and detested the peculiar institution.
evidence for that can be found if nowhere else in the reaction of slaves when emancipation finally came.
virtually all reacted to freedom with great joy few chose to remain in the service of the whites who had owned them before the civil war.
rather than contented acceptance the dominant response of african americans to slavery was a complex one a combination of adaptation and resistance.
at the extremes slavery could produce two very different reactions each of which served as the basis for a powerful stereotype in white society.
one extreme was what became known as the sambo the shuffling grinning head scratching deferential slave who acted out what he recognized as the role the white world expected of him.
but the sambo pattern of behavior was a charade put on by blacks a faade assumed in the presence of whites.
the other extreme was the slave rebel the african american who resisted either acceptance or accommodation but remained forever rebellious.
actual slave revolts were extremely rare but the knowledge that they were slave revolts possible struck terror into the hearts of white southerners.
in 1800 gabriel prosser gathered 1 000 rebellious slaves outside richmond but two african americans gave away the plot and the virginia militia stymied the uprising before it could begin.
prosser and thirty five others were executed.
in 1822 the charleston free black denmark vesey and his followers rumored to total 9 000 made preparations for revolt but again word leaked out and suppression and retribution followed.
on a summer night in 1831 nat turner a slave preacher led a band of african americans armed with guns and axes from house to house in southampton county virginia.
they killed sixty white men women and children before being overpowered by state and federal troops.
more than a hundred blacks were executed in the aftermath.
for the most part however resistance to slavery took other less violent forms.
some blacks attempted to resist by running away.
a small number managed to escape to the north or to canada especially after sympathetic whites and free blacks began organizing secret escape routes known as the underground railroad to assist them in flight.
but the odds against a successful escape were very high.
the hazards of distance and the slaves ignorance of geography were serious obstacles as were the white slave patrols which stopped wandering blacks on sight and demanded to see travel permits.
despite all the obstacles to success however blacks continued to run away from their masters in large numbers.
perhaps the most important method of resistance was simply a pattern of everyday behavior by which blacks defied their masters.
that whites so often considered day to day slave resistance blacks to be lazy and shiftless suggests one means of resistance refusal to work hard.
some slaves stole from their masters or from neighboring whites.
others performed isolated acts of sabotage losing or breaking tools or performing tasks improperly.
in extreme cases blacks might make themselves useless by cutting off their fingers or even committing suicide.
a few turned on their masters and killed them.
the extremes however were rare.
for the most part blacks resisted by building subtle methods of rebellion into their normal patterns of behavior.
268 chapter 11 the culture of slavery resistance was only part of the slave response to slavery.
another was an elaborate process of adaptation.
one of the ways blacks adapted was by developing their own separate culture one that enabled them to sustain a sense of racial pride and unity.
slave religion almost all african americans were christians by the early nineteenth century.
some had converted voluntarily and others in response to coercion from their masters and protestant missionaries who evangelized among them.
masters expected their slaves to join their denominations and worship under the supervision of white ministers.
a separate slave religion was not supposed to exist.
indeed autonomous black churches were banned by law.
nevertheless blacks throughout the south developed their own version of christianity at times incorporating into it such practices as voodoo or other polytheistic religious traditions of africa.
or they simply bent religion to the special circumstances of bondage.
african american religion was often more emotional than its white counterpart and reflected the influence of african customs and practices.
slave prayer meetings routinely involved fervent chanting spontaneous exclamations from the congregation and ecstatic praying for freedom conversion experiences.
black religion was also generally more joyful and affirming than that of many white denominations.
and above all african american religion emphasized the dream of freedom and deliverance.

language and music in many areas slaves retained a language of their own.
having arrived in america speaking many different african languages the first generations of slaves had as much difficulty communicating with one another as they did with white people.
to overcome these barriers they learned a simple common language known to linguists as pidgin.
it pidgin retained some african words but it drew primarily if selectively from english.
and while slave language grew more sophisticated as blacks spent more time in america some features of this early pidgin survived in black speech for many generations.
music was especially important in slave society.
again the african heritage was an important influence.
african music relied heavily on rhythm and so did black music in america.
slaves often created instruments for themselves out of whatever materials were at hand.
the banjo became important to slave music.
but more important were voices and song.
field workers often used songs to pass the time since they sang them in the presence of the whites they usually attached relatively innocuous words to them.
but african americans also created more politically challenging music in the relative privacy of their own religious services.
it was there that the tradition of the spiritual emerged.
importance of slave spirituals through the spiritual africans in america not only expressed their religious faith but also lamented their bondage and expressed continuing hope for freedom.
slave songs were rarely written down and often seemed entirely spontaneous but much slave music was really derived from african and caribbean traditions passed on through generations.
performers also improvised variations on songs they had heard.
when the setting permitted it african americans danced to their music dances very different from and much more spontaneous than the formal steps that nineteenth century whites generally learned.
they also used music to accompany another of their important cultural traditions storytelling.
the slave family the slave family was the other crucial institution of black culture in the south.
like religion it suffered from legal restrictions.
nevertheless what we now call the nuclear family consistently emerged as the dominant kinship model among african americans.
black women generally began bearing children at younger ages than most whites often as early as fourteen or fifteen sometimes as a result of unwanted sexual relations with their masters.
slave communities did not condemn premarital pregnancy in the way white society did and black couples would often begin living together before marrying.
it was customary however for couples to marry in a ceremony involving slave marriages formal vows soon after conceiving a child.
husbands and wives on neighboring plantations sometimes visited each other with the permission of their masters but often such visits had to be in secret at night.
family ties among slaves were generally no less strong than those of whites.
270 chapter 11 when marriages did not survive it was often because of circumstances over which blacks had no control.
up to a third of all black families were broken apart by the slave trade.
extended kinship networks were strong and important and often helped compensate for the breakup of nuclear families.
a slave forced suddenly to move to a new area far from his or her family might create fictional kinship ties and become adopted by a family in the new community.
even so the impulse to maintain contact with a spouse and children remained strong long after the breakup of a family.
one of the most frequent causes of flight from the plantation was a slaves desire to find a husband wife or child who had been sent elsewhere.
after the civil war white and black newspapers were filled with notices from former slaves seeking to reconnect with family members separated during bondage.
however much blacks resented their lack of freedom they often found it difficult to maintain an entirely hostile attitude toward their owners.
they depended on whites for the material means of existence food clothing and shelter and they relied on them as well for security and protection.
there was in short a paternal relationship between slave paternalism and master sometimes harsh at other times kindly but always important.
that paternalism in fact became a vital instrument of white control.
by creating a sense of mutual dependence whites helped minimize though never eliminated resistance to an institution that served only the interests of the ruling race.
conclusion while the north was creating a complex and rapidly developing commercial industrial economy the south was expanding its agrarian economy without making many fundamental changes in the regions character.
great migrations took many southern whites and even more african american slaves into new agricultural areas in the deep south where they created a booming cotton kingdom the cotton economy created many great fortunes and some modest ones.
it also entrenched the planter class as the dominant force within southern society both as owners of vast numbers of slaves and as patrons creditors politicians landlords and marketers for the large number of poor whites who lived on the edge of the planter world.
the differences between the north and the south were a result of differences in natural resources social structure climate and culture.
above all they were the result of the existence within the south of an unfree labor system that prevented the kind of social fluidity that an industrializing society usually requires.
within that system however slaves created a vital independent culture and religion in the face of white subjugation.

how did an american national culture of art literature philosophy and communal living develop in the nineteenth century.
what were the issues on which social and moral reformers tried to remake the nation.
how successful were their efforts.
why did the crusade against slavery become the preeminent issue of the reform movement.
the united states in the mid nineteenth century was growing rapidly in size population and economic complexity.
most americans were excited by the new possibilities these changes produced.
but many people were also painfully aware of the problems that accompanied them.
one result of these conflicting attitudes was the emergence of movements to reform the nation.
some reforms rested on an optimistic faith in human nature a belief that within every individual resided a spirit that was basically good and that society should attempt to unleash.
a second impulse was a desire for order and control.
with their traditional values and institutions being challenged and eroded many americans yearned above all for stability and discipline.
by the end of the 1840s however one issue slavery had come to overshadow all others.
and one group of reformers the abolitionists had become the most influential of all.
272 the romantic impulse in the four quarters of the globe wrote the english wit sydney smith in 1820 who reads an american book.
or goes to an american play.
or looks at an american picture or statue the answer he assumed was obvious no one.
american intellectuals were painfully aware of the low regard in which europeans held their culture and they tried to create an artistic life that would express their own nations special virtues.
at the same time many of the nations cultural leaders were striving for another kind of liberation which was ironically largely an import from europe the spirit of romanticism.
in literature in philosophy in art even in politics and economics american intellectuals were committing themselves to the liberation of the human spirit.
nationalism and romanticism in american painting despite sydney smiths contemptuous question a great many people in the united states were in fact looking at american paintings and they were doing so because they believed americans were creating important new artistic traditions of their own.
american painters sought to capture the power of nature by portraying some of the nations most spectacular and undeveloped areas.
the first great school of american painters known as the hudson river school emerged in new york.
frederic church thomas cole thomas doughty asher durand and others painted the spectacular vistas of the rugged and still largely untamed hudson valley.
like ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau whom many of the painters read and admired they considered nature far more than civilization the best source of wisdom and fulfillment.

382 chapter 16 the plains warriors proved to be the most formidable foes the white settlers had encountered.
but the tribes were usually unable to unite against white aggression.
at times tribal warriors even faced white forces who were being assisted by guides and even fighters from rival tribes.
some tribes however were able to overcome their divisions and cooperate effectively.
by the mid nineteenth century for example the sioux arapaho plains warriors vulnerabilities and cheyenne had forged a powerful alliance that dominated the northern plains.
that proved no protection however against the greatest danger to the tribes ecological and economic decline.
indians were highly vulnerable to eastern infectious diseases such as the smallpox epidemics that decimated the pawnee in nebraska in the 1840s.
and the tribes were of course at a considerable disadvantage in any longterm battle with an economically and industrially advanced people.
hispanic new mexico for centuries much of the far west had been part of the spanish empire and later the mexican republic.
when the united states acquired its new lands there in the 1840s it also acquired many mexican residents.
in new mexico the centers of spanish speaking society were farming and trading communities established in the seventeenth century.
descendants of the original spanish settlers and more recent migrants from mexico engaged primarily in cattle and sheep ranching.
when the united states acquired title to new mexico in the aftermath of the mexican war general stephen kearny who had commanded the american troops in the region tried to establish a territorial government out of the approximately 1 000 anglo americans in the region ignoring the more than 50 000 hispanics.
there were widespread fears among hispanics and indians that the new american rulers would confiscate their lands.
in 1847 before the new government had established itself taos indians taos indian rebellion rebelled killing the new governor and other anglo american officials before being subdued by united states army forces.
new mexico remained under military rule for three years until the united states finally organized a territorial government there in 1850.
the united states army finally broke the power of the navajo apache and other tribes in the region.
the defeat of the tribes led to substantial hispanic migration into other areas of the southwest and as far north as colorado.
the anglo american presence in the southwest grew rapidly once the railroads penetrated the region in the 1880s and early 1890s.
with the railroads came extensive new ranching farming and mining.
this expansion of economic activity attracted a new wave of mexican immigrants who moved across the border in search of work.
the englishspeaking proprietors of the new enterprises however commonly restricted most mexicans to the lowest paying and least stable jobs.
hispanic california and texas in california spanish settlement began in the eighteenth century with a string of catholic missions along the pacific coast.
the missionaries and the soldiers who accompanied them gathered most of the coastal indians into their communities some forcibly and others by persuasion.
in the 1830s after the new mexican government began reducing the power of the church the mission society largely collapsed.
in its place emerged a secular mexican aristocracy which controlled a chain of large estates in the fertile lands west of the sierra mountains.
for them the acquisition of california by the united states was the conquest of the far west 383 the spanish term tejano or texano refers to texans of mexican descent.
the mounted rancher has roped a white mustang a saddle is ready nearby.
small independent ranches were well established in south texas before large anglo american enterprises moved in.
private collection peter newark pictures bridgeman images tejano ranchers 1877 by james walker disastrous.
so vast were the numbers of english speaking immigrants that the californios as the hispanic residents of the region were known had little power plight of californios to resist the onslaught.
english speaking prospectors organized to exclude them sometimes violently from the mines during the gold rush.
many californios also lost their lands either through corrupt business deals or through outright seizure.
increasingly mexicans and mexican americans became part of the lower end of the states working class clustered in barrios in los angeles or elsewhere or laboring as migrant farmworkers.
even small hispanic landowners who managed to hang on to their farms found themselves unable to raise livestock as once communal grazing lands fell under the control of powerful anglo ranchers.
a similar pattern occurred in texas after it joined the united states.
many mexican landowners lost their land some as a result of fraud and coercion o thers mexicans in texas because even the most substantial mexican ranchers could not compete with the emerging anglo american ranching kingdoms.
in 1859 angry mexicans led by the rancher juan cortina raided the jail in brownsville and freed all the mexican prisoners inside.
but such resistance had little long term effect.
as in california mexicans in southern texas became an increasingly impoverished working class relegated largely to unskilled farm or industrial labor.
the chinese migration at the same time that ambitious or impoverished europeans were crossing the atlantic in search of opportunities in the new world many chinese were crossing the pacific in hopes of better lives.
not all came to the united states.
many chinese some coolies as coolies indentured servants whose condition was close to slavery moved to hawaii australia latin america south africa and even the caribbean.
384 chapter 16 this portrait of chun duck chin and his seven year old son chun jan yut was taken in a studio in san francisco in the 1870s.
both father and son appear to have dressed up for the occasion in traditional chinese garb and the studio which likely took many such portraits of chinese families provided a formal chinese backdrop.
the son is holding what appears to be a chicken perhaps to impress relatives in china with the familys prosperity.
national archives and records administration a chinese family in san francisco a few chinese traveled to the american west even before the gold rush but after 1848 the flow increased dramatically.
by 1880 more than 200 000 chinese had settled in the united states.
almost all came as free laborers.
for a time white americans welcomed the chinese as a conscientious hardworking people.
very quickly however white opinion turned hostile in part because the chinese were so industrious and successful that some white americans began considering them rivals.
in the early 1850s large numbers of chinese immigrants joined the hunt for gold.
many of them were well organized hardworking prospectors and for a time some enjoyed considerable success.
but opportunities for the chinese to prosper in the mines were fleeting.
in 1852 the california legislature began trying to exclude the chinese from gold mining by enacting a foreign miners tax.
gradually the effect of the discriminatory laws the hostility of white miners and the declining profitability of the surface mines drove most chinese out of prospecting.
the conquest of the far west 385 as mining declined as a source of wealth and jobs for the chinese railroad employment grew.
beginning in 1865 over 12 000 chinese found work building the transcontinental railroad forming 90 percent of the labor force of the central pacific.
railroad workers the company preferred them to white laborers because they worked hard made few demands and accepted relatively low wages.
work on the central pacific was arduous and often dangerous.
in the winter many chinese tunneled into snowbanks at night to create warm sleeping areas for themselves even though such tunnels frequently collapsed suffocating those inside.
in the spring of 1866 5 000 chinese railroad workers rebelled against the terrible conditions and went on strike to demand higher wages and a shorter workday.
the company isolated them surrounded them with strikebreakers and starved them into submission.
in 1869 the transcontinental railroad was completed and thousands of chinese lost their jobs.
some moved into agricultural work usually in menial positions.
increasingly however the chinese flocked to cities.
by far the largest single chinese community was in san francisco.
much of community life there and in other chinatowns throughout the west revolved around organizations somewhat like chinatowns benevolent societies that filled many of the roles that political machines often served in immigrant communities in eastern cities.
often led by prominent merchants in san francisco the leading merchants known as the six companies often worked together to advance their interests in the city and state these organizations became in effect employment brokers unions arbitrators of disputes defenders against outside persecution and dispensers of social services.
they also organized elaborate festivals and celebrations that were a conspicuous and important part of life in chinatowns.
other chinese organizations were secret societies known as tongs some of the tongs were violent criminal organizations involved in the opium trade and prostitution.
few people outside the chinese communities were aware of their existence except when rival tongs engaged in violent conflict or tong wars.
in san francisco and other western cities the chinese usually occupied the lower rungs of the employment ladder.
many worked as common laborers servants and unskilled factory hands.
some established their own small businesses especially laundries.
there were few commercial laundries in china but they could be started in america with very little capital and required only limited command of english.
by the 1890s chinese constituted over two thirds of all the laundry workers in california.
during the earliest chinese migrations to california virtually all the relatively small number of women who made the journey did so because they had been sold into prostitution.
as late as 1880 nearly half the chinese women in california were chinese families prostitutes.
gradually however the number of chinese women increased and chinese men in america became more likely to seek companionship in families.
anti chinese sentiments as chinese communities grew larger and more visible anti chinese sentiment among white residents intensified.
anti chinese activities some of them bloody reflected the resentment of many white workers toward chinese laborers for accepting lower wages.
as the political value of attacking the chinese grew in california the democratic party took up the call.
so did the workingmens party of california founded in 1878 by denis kearney an irish immigrant which gained significant power in the state largely because 386 chapter 16 of its hostility to the chinese.
by the mid 1880s anti chinese agitation and violence had spread up and down the pacific coast and into other areas of the west.
in 1882 congress responded to the political pressure and the growing racial violence chinese exclusion act by passing the chinese exclusion act which banned chinese immigration into the united states for ten years and barred chinese already in the country from becoming naturalized citizens.
congress renewed the law for another ten years in 1892 and made it permanent in 1902.
it had a dramatic effect on the chinese population which declined by more than 40 percent in the forty years after the acts passage.
migration from the east the scale of post civil war white migration to the american west dwarfed everything that had preceded it.
in previous decades the settlers had come in thousands.
now they came in millions.
most of the new settlers were from the established anglo american societies of the eastern united states but substantial numbers over 2 million between 1870 and 1900 were foreign born immigrants from europe scandinavians germans irish russians czechs and others.
they came to the west for many reasons.
settlers were attracted by gold and silver deposits by the short grass pasture for cattle and sheep and ultimately by the rich sod of the plains and the meadowlands of the mountains.
the completion of the great transcontinental railroad line in 1869 and the construction of the many subsidiary lines that spidered out from it encouraged rapid settlement.
so did the land policies of the federal homestead act government.
the homestead act of 1862 permitted settlers to buy plots of 160 acres for a small fee if they occupied the land they purchased for five years and improved it.
supporters of the homestead act believed it would create new markets and new outposts of commercial agriculture for the nations growing economy.
but a unit of 160 acres while ample in much of the east was too small for the grazing and grain farming of the great plains.
eventually the federal government provided some relief.
the timber culture act 1873 permitted homesteaders to receive grants of 160 additional acres if they planted 40 acres of trees on them.
the desert land act 1877 allowed claimants to buy 640 acres at 1 25 an acre provided they irrigated part of their holdings within three years.
these and other laws ultimately made it possible for individuals to acquire as much as 1 280 acres of land at little cost.
political organization followed on the hard heels of settlement.
by the mid 1860s territorial governments were in operation in the new provinces of nevada colorado new western states dakota arizona idaho montana and wyoming.
statehood rapidly followed.
nevada became a state in 1864 nebraska in 1867 and colorado in 1876.
in 1889 north and south dakota montana and washington won admission wyoming and idaho entered the next year.
congress denied utah statehood until its mormon leaders convinced the government in 1896 that polygamy the practice of men taking several wives had been abandoned.
at the turn of the century only arizona new mexico and oklahoma remained outside the union.
the changing western economy the great wave of anglo american and european settlement transformed the economy of the far west and tied the region firmly to the growing industrial economy of the east.
the conquest of the far west 387 labor in the west as commercial activity increased many farmers ranchers and miners found it necessary to recruit a paid labor force not an easy task given the small labor pool compared to that found in established cities.
this labor shortage led to higher wages for some workers than were typical in the east.
but working conditions were often treacherous and job security was almost nonexistent.
once a railroad was built a crop harvested a herd sent to market a mine played out hundreds and even thousands of workers could find themselves suddenly unemployed.
the western working class was highly multiracial.
english speaking whites worked alongside african americans and immigrants from southern and multiracial working class eastern europe as they did in the east.
even more they worked with chinese filipinos mexicans and indians.
but the workforce was highly stratified along racial lines.
in almost every area of the western economy white workers whatever their ethnicity occupied the upper tiers of employment management and skilled labor.
the lower tiers unskilled work in the mines on the railroads or in agriculture were filled overwhelmingly by nonwhites.
the western economy was however no more a single entity than the economy of the east.
in the late nineteenth century the region produced three major industries each with distinctive history and characteristics mining ranching and commercial farming.
the arrival of the miners the first economic boom in the far west was the result of mining.
the mining boom began around 1860 and flourished until the 1890s.
then it abruptly declined.
at first it was news of a gold or silver strike that would start a stampede.
the california gold rush of 1849 was the first and most famous gold rush.
but it was followed by others.
individual prospectors would pan for gold extracting the first shallow deposits of ore largely by hand a method known as placer mining.
after these surface deposits dwindled corporations moved in to engage in lode or quartz mining which dug deeper beneath the surface.
then as those deposits dwindled commercial mining declined and ranchers and farmers moved in and established a more permanent economy.
the first great mineral strikes other than the california gold rush occurred just before the civil war.
in 1858 gold was discovered in the pikes peak district of what would soon be the territory of colorado the following year 50 000 prospectors stormed in.
denver and other mining camps blossomed into cities overnight.
almost as rapidly as they had developed the booms ended.
later the discovery of silver near leadville supplied a new source of mineral wealth.
while the colorado rush of 1859 was still in progress news of another strike drew miners to nevada.
gold had been found in the washoe district.
even more plentiful and more valuable was the silver found in the great comstock lode first comstock lode discovered in 1858 by henry comstock and other washoe veins.
the first prospectors to reach the washoe fields came from california and from the beginning californians dominated the settlement and development of nevada.
a remote desert without railroad transportation the territory produced no supplies of its own and everything had to be shipped from california to virginia city carson city and other roaring camp towns.
when the first placer or surface deposits ran out californian and eastern capitalists bought the claims of the pioneer prospectors and began to use the more difficult process of quartz mining which enabled them to retrieve silver from deeper veins.
for a few 388 chapter 16 years these outside owners reaped tremendous profits from 1860 to 1880 the nevada lodes yielded bullion worth 306 million.
after that the mines quickly played out.
the next important mineral discoveries came in 1874 when gold was found in the black hills of southwestern dakota territory.
prospectors swarmed into the remote area.
like the others the boom flared for a time until surface resources faded and corporations took over above all the enormous homestake mining company and came to dominate the fields.
the dakotas like other boom areas of the mineral empire ultimately developed a largely agricultural economy.
the gold and silver discoveries generated the most popular excitement.
but less glamorous natural resources proved more important to western development.
the great anaconda copper mine launched by william clark in 1881 marked the beginning of an industry that would remain important to montana for many decades.
in other areas mining operations had significant success with lead tin quartz and zinc.
men greatly outnumbered women in the mining towns and younger men in particular gender disparity had difficulty finding female companions of comparable age.
those women who did gravitate to the new communities often came with their husbands.
single women or women whose husbands were earning no money did work for wages at times as cooks laundresses and tavernkeepers.
and in the sexually imbalanced mining communities there was always a ready market for prostitutes.
the thousands of people who flocked to the mining towns in search of quick wealth and failed to find it often remained as wage laborers in corporate mines after the boom period working in almost uniformly terrible conditions.
in the 1870s one worker in every thirty was disabled in the mines and one in every eighty was killed.
that rate fell later in the nineteenth century but mining remained one of the most dangerous and arduous working environments in the united states.
the cattle kingdom a second important element of the changing economy of the far west was cattle ranching.
the open range the vast grasslands of the public domain provided a huge area on the great plains where cattle raisers could graze their herds.
the western cattle industry was born slowly and through the pioneering work of mexican roots mexicans texans white settlers and free and enslaved blacks.
long before citizens of the united states entered the southwest mexican ranchers had developed the techniques and equipment that the cattlemen and cowboys of the great plains later employed branding roundups roping and the gear of the herders their lariats saddles leather chaps and spurs.
americans in texas with the largest herds of cattle in the country adopted these methods and carried them to the northernmost ranges of the cattle kingdom.
from texas too came the small muscular horses broncos and mustangs that enabled cowboys to control the herds.
at the end of the civil war an estimated 5 million cattle roamed the texas ranges.
eastern markets offered good prices for steers.
the challenge facing the cattle industry lay in getting the animals from the range to the railroad centers.
early in 1866 some texas cattle ranchers began driving their combined herds up to 260 000 steers north to sedalia missouri on the missouri pacific railroad.
the caravan suffered heavy losses.
but the drive proved that cattle could be driven to distant markets and pastured along the trail.
this earliest of the long drives established the first tentative link between the isolated cattle breeders of west texas and the booming urban markets of the east.

but they were also hardheaded businesses made possible by the growing eastern market for beef and the availability of reasonably inexpensive transportation thanks to the dense network of trails and railroads to take cattle to the urban markets.
why was the open range necessary for the great cattle drives and what eventually ended the cattle trails.
the cattle kingdom ca.
1866 1887 market facilities soon grew up at abilene kansas on the kansas pacific railroad and for years the town reigned as the railhead of the cattle kingdom.
but by the mid 1870s agricultural development in western kansas had eaten away at the open range land.
cattlemen had to develop other trails and other market outlets.
as the railroads reached farther west other locations began to rival abilene as major centers of stock herding dodge city and wichita in kansas ogallala and sidney in nebraska cheyenne and laramie in wyoming and miles city and glendive in montana.
there had always been an element of risk and speculation in the open range cattle business.
rustlers and indians frequently seized large numbers of animals.
but as the settlement of the plains increased new forms of competition arose.
sheep breeders from 390 chapter 16 california and oregon brought their flocks onto the range to compete for grass.
farmers nesters from the east threw fences around their claims blocking trails and breaking range wars up the open range.
a series of range wars between sheepmen and cattlemen ranchers and farmers erupted out of the tensions among these competing groups.
accounts of the lofty profits to be made in the cattle business tempted eastern english and scottish capital to the plains.
increasingly the structure of the cattle economy became decline of the open range industry corporate in one year twenty corporations with a combined capital of 12 million were chartered in wyoming.
the result of this frenzied speculative expansion was that the ranges already shrunk by the railroads and the farmers became overstocked.
there was not enough grass to support the crowding herds or sustain the long drives.
two severe winters in 1885 1886 and 1886 1887 and a searing summer between them scorched the plains.
streams and grass dried up.
hundreds of thousands of cattle died.
princely ranches and costly investments disappeared in a season.
the open range industry never recovered and the long drive finally disappeared for good.
railroads displaced the trail as the route to market for livestock.
but some established cattle ranches survived grew and prospered eventually producing more beef than ever.
the romance of the west the rapidly developing west occupied a special place in the anglo american imagination.
many white americans continued to consider it a romantic place a wilderness where individuals could experience true freedom.
but such thinking was more fiction than fact.
the western landscape and the cowboy part of the attraction of the west was its spectacular natural landscape.
painters of the new rocky mountain school of whom the best known were albert bierstadt and thomas moran celebrated the new west in grandiose canvases some of which toured the eastern and midwestern states and attracted enormous crowds eager for a vision of the great west.
gradually paintings and photographs inspired a growing wave of tourism among people eager to see the natural wonders of the region.
in the 1880s and 1890s resort hotels began to spring up near some of the regions most spectacular landscapes.
even more appealing was the rugged free spirited lifestyle that many americans associated with the west.
many nineteenth century americans came especially to idealize the figure of the cowboy.
western novels such as owen wisters the virginian 1902 romancowboys in fiction ticized the cowboys supposed freedom from traditional social constraints his affinity with nature even his supposed propensity for violence.
wisters character one of the most enduring in popular american literature was a semi educated man whose natural decency courage and compassion made him a powerful symbol of the supposed virtues of the frontier but the virginian was only the most famous example of a type of literature that soon swept throughout the united states.
novels and stories glorified the west and the lives of cowboys in particular in boys magazines pulp novels theater and serious literature.
among the reasons for the widespread admiration of the cowboy were the remarkably popular wild west shows that traveled throughout the united states and europe.
most successful were the shows of buffalo bill cody a former pony express rider indian rocky mountain school the conquest of the far west 391 fighter and hero of popular dime novels for children.
codys wild west show which spawned dozens of imitators exploited his own fame and romanticized the life of the cowboy through reenactments of indian battles and displays of horsemanship and riflery many of them by the famous sharpshooter annie oakley.
buffalo bill and his imitators confirmed the popular image of the west as a place of romance and glamour and helped keep that image alive for later generations.
the idea of the frontier it was not simply the particular character of the new west that resonated in the nations imagination.
it was also that many americans considered it the last natural frontier.
since the earliest moments of european settlement in america the image of uncharted territory to the west had always comforted and inspired those who dreamed of starting life anew.
mark twain gave voice to this romantic vision of the frontier in a mark twain series of novels and memoirs.
in the adventures of tom sawyer 1876 and the adventures of huckleberry finn 1885 he produced characters who repudiated the constraints of organized society and attempted to escape into a more natural world.
for huck finn the vehicle of escape was a small raft on the mississippi.
this yearning for freedom reflected a larger vision of the west as the last refuge from the constraints of civilization.

the library of congress debating the past the frontier and the west the emergence of the history of the american west as an important field of scholarship can be traced to a paper frederick jackson turner delivered to the american historical association in 1893 the significance of the frontier in american history turner stated his thesis simply.
the settlement of the west by white americans the existence of an area of free land its continuous recession and the advance of american settlement westward was the central story of the nations history.
the process of westward expansion had transformed a desolate and savage land into modern civilization and had continually renewed american ideas of democracy and individualism.
in the first half of the twentieth century virtually everyone who wrote about the west echoed at least part of turners argument.
ray allen billingtons westward expansion 1949 was almost wholly consistent with the turnerian model.
in the great plains 1931 and the great frontier 1952 walter prescott webb similarly emphasized the bravery and ingenuity of white settlers in the southwest.
serious efforts to displace the turner thesis as the explanation of western american history began after world war ii.
in virgin land 1950 henry nash smith examined many of the same heroic images of the west that turner and his disciples had presented but he treated those images less as descriptions of reality than as myths.
earl pomeroy challenged turners notion of the west as a place of individualism innovation and democratic renewal.
conservatism inheritance and continuity bulked at least as large he claimed.
howard lamar in dakota territory 1861 1889 1956 and the far southwest 392 1966 emphasized the highly diverse character of the west.
the western historians who emerged since the late 1970s launched an even more emphatic attack on the turner thesis and the idea of the frontier new western historians such as richard white patricia nelson limerick william cronon donald worster peggy pascoe and many others challenged the turnerians on a number of points.
turner saw the nineteenth century west as free land awaiting the expansion of anglo american settlement and american democracy.
the more recent western historians reject the concept of an empty frontier emphasizing instead the elaborate and highly developed civilizations that already existed in the region.
white englishspeaking americans they have argued did not so much settle the west as conquer it.
and they continued to share the region not only with the indians and hispanics who preceded them there but also with african americans asians latin americans and others who flowed into the west at the same time they did.
the turnerian west was a place of heroism triumph and above all progress dominated by the feats of brave white men.
the west that the new western historians describe was a less triumphant and less masculine place in which bravery and success coexisted with oppression greed and failure in which decaying ghost towns bleak indian reservations impoverished barrios and ecologically devastated landscapes have been as characteristic of western development as great ranches rich farms and prosperous cities.
to turner and his disciples the nineteenth century west was a place where rugged individualism flourished and replenished american democracy.
the newer scholars point out that the region was inextricably tied to a national and international capitalist economy.
westerners depended on government subsidized railroads for access to markets federal troops for protection from indians and later government funded dams and canals for irrigating their fields and sustaining their towns.
and while turner defined the west as a process a process of settlement that came to an end with the closing of the frontier in the late nineteenth century the newer historians see the west as a region.
its distinctive history did not end in 1890 but continues into our own time.

how and why did the portrayal of the west by the newer western historians differ from the west that turner described.
why did the newer western historians challenge turners views and why has their depiction of the west in turn provoked such controversy.
one of the most beloved and successful artists of the nineteenth century was frederic remington a painter and sculptor whose works came to represent the frederic remington romance of the west.
he portrayed the cowboy as a natural aristocrat much like wisters the virginian living in a natural world in which all the normal supporting structures of civilization were missing.
theodore roosevelt also contributed to the romanticizing of the west.
he traveled to the dakota badlands in the mid 1880s to recover from the sudden death of his young wife.
in the 1890s he published a four volume history the winning of the west with a heroic account of the spread of white civilization into the frontier.
perhaps the most influential statement of the romantic vision of the frontier came from the young historian frederick jackson turner in a memorable paper he delivered as a thirtytwo year old in chicago in 1893 titled the significance of the frontier in american history in it he boldly claimed that the experience of western expansion had stimulated individualism nationalism and democracy kept opportunities for advancement alive and made americans the distinctive people that they were.
now turner concluded portentously the frontier has gone and with its going has closed the first period of american history the turner thesis was widely accepted by his contemporaries but later historians have turner thesis challenged it.
see debating the past the frontier and the west in accepting the idea of the passing of the frontier many americans were acknowledging the end of one of their most cherished myths.
as long as it had been possible for them to see the west as an empty open land it was possible to believe that there were constantly revitalizing opportunities in american life.
but by the end of the nineteenth century there was a vague and ominous sense of opportunities foreclosed.
the dispersal of the tribes having imagined the west as a virgin land awaiting civilization by white people many americans tried to force the region to match their image of it.
that meant above all ensuring that the indian tribes would not be obstacles to the spread of white society.
393 394 chapter 16 white tribal policies the traditional policy of the federal government was to regard the tribes simultaneously as independent nations with which the united states could negotiate treaties and as wards of the president who would exercise paternalistic authority over the indians.
the concept of indian sovereignty had supported the governments attempt before 1860 to erect a permanent frontier between whites and indians.
but the belief in tribal sovereignty and the treaties or agreements with the indians were not strong enough to withstand the desire of white settlers for more and more indian lands.
by the early 1850s the government created a new reservations policy known as concentration policy concentration in 1851 the government assigned each tribe its own defined reservation confirmed by individual treaties treaties often illegitimately negotiated with unauthorized indian representatives chosen by whites people known sarcastically as treaty chiefs the new arrangement had many benefits for whites and few for the indians.
it divided the tribes from one another and made them easier to control.
it allowed the government to force tribes into scattered locations and to take over the most desirable lands for white settlement.
but concentration did not survive as the basis of indian policy for long.
in 1867 congress established the indian peace commission composed of both soldiers and civilians to recommend a new and presumably permanent indian policy.
the commission recommended that the government move all the plains tribes into two large reservations one in indian territory oklahoma the other in the dakotas.
at a series of meetings with the tribes government agents cajoled bribed and tricked their representatives into agreeing to treaties establishing the new reservations.
but this solution worked little better than previous ones for indians.
part of the problem was the corrupt or incompetent agents of the bureau of indian affairs who held up by buffalo once among the most numerous creatures in north america the buffalo almost became extinct as a result of indiscriminate slaughter by white settlers and travelers who often fired at herds from moving trains simply for the sport of it.
private collection peter newark american pictures bridgeman images the conquest of the far west 395 administered the reservations.
but the problem was also exacerbated by the relentless slaughter of buffalo herds by whites that destroyed the tribes way of life.
after the civil war professional and amateur hunters even casual visitors shooting from passing trains swarmed over the plains slaughtering the huge animals.
some indian tribes notably the blackfeet also began killing large numbers of buffalo buffalo herds decimated to sell in the booming new market for their hides and meat.
in 1865 there had been at least 15 million buffalo two decades later fewer than 1 000 of the great beasts survived.
by destroying the buffalo herds whites were destroying the indians source of food and supplies and their ability to resist white advance.
the indian wars whites and indians fought incessantly from the 1850s to the 1880s as indians struggled against the growing threats to their civilizations.
indian warriors attacked wagon trains stagecoaches and isolated ranches often in retaliation for earlier attacks on them by whites.
as the united states army became more deeply involved in the fighting the tribes began to focus more of their attacks on white soldiers.
at times this small scale fighting escalated.
during the civil war the eastern sioux in minnesota cramped on a small reservation and exploited by corrupt white agents suddenly rebelled.
led by little crow they killed more than 700 whites before being subdued.
thirty eight of the indians were hanged and the tribe was exiled to the dakotas.
at the same time fighting flared up in eastern colorado where the arapaho and cheyenne were coming into conflict with white miners settling in the region.
bands of indians attacked stagecoach lines and settlements in an effort to regain territory they had lost.
in response to these incidents whites called up a large territorial militia.
the governor urged all friendly indians to congregate at army posts for protection before the army began its campaign.
one arapaho and cheyenne band under black kettle apparently in response to the invitation camped near fort lyon on sand creek in november 1864.
some members of the party were warriors but black kettle believed he was under official protection and exhibited no hostile intention.
nevertheless colonel j m chivington led a volunteer militia force largely consisting of unemployed miners many of whom were apparently drunk to the unsuspecting camp and massacred 133 people 105 of them women and children.
black kettle himself escaped the sand creek massacre.
but four years later in 1868 he and cheyenne soldiers went to war with the whites.
the indians george a custer were caught on the washita river near the texas border by colonel george a custer.
white troops killed the chief and his people.
at the end of the civil war white troops stepped up their wars against the western indians on several fronts.
the most serious and sustained conflict was in montana where the army was attempting to build a road the bozeman trail to connect fort laramie wyoming to the new mining centers.
the western sioux resented this intrusion into the heart of their buffalo range.
led by one of their great chiefs red cloud they so harried the soldiers and the construction party that the road could not be used.
but it was not only the united states military that harassed the tribes.
it was also unofficial violence by white vigilantes who engaged in what became known as indian hunting sometimes the killing was in response to indian raids on white indian hunting communities.
but considerable numbers of whites were committed to the goal of literal elimination of the tribes whatever their behavior a goal that rested on the belief in the essential inhumanity of indians and the impossibility of white coexistence with them.

california civilians killed close to 5 000 indians between 1850 and 1880 one of many factors disease and poverty being the more important that reduced the indian population of the state from 150 000 before the civil war to 30 000 in 1870.
the treaties negotiated in 1867 brought a temporary lull to many of the conflicts.
but new forces soon shattered the peace again.
in the early 1870s more waves of white settlers mostly miners began to penetrate the lands in dakota territory supposedly guaranteed to the tribes in 1867.
indian resistance flared anew.
in the northern plains the sioux rose up in 1875 and left their reservation.
when white officials ordered them to return bands of warriors gathered in montana and united under two great leaders crazy horse and sitting bull.
three army columns set out to round them up and force them back onto the reservation.
with the expedition as colonel of the famous seventh cavalry was the colorful and controversial george a custer.
at the battle of the little bighorn battle of the little bighorn in southern montana in 1876 an unprecedentedly large army perhaps 2 500 tribal warriors surprised custer and part of his regiment surrounded them and killed every soldier.
but the indians did not have the political organization or the supplies to keep their troops united.
soon the warriors drifted off in bands to elude pursuit or search for food and the army ran them down and returned them to dakota.
the power of the sioux quickly collapsed.
they accepted defeat and life on reservations.
one of the most dramatic episodes in indian history occurred in idaho in 1877.
the nez perc were a small and relatively peaceful tribe some of whose members had managed to live unmolested in oregon into the 1870s without ever signing a treaty with the united states.
but under pressure from white settlers the u s government forced them to move onto a reservation.
with no realistic prospect of resisting the indians began the journey to the reservation but on the way several younger indians drunk and angry killed four white settlers.
the conquest of the far west 397 the leader of the band chief joseph persuaded his followers to flee from the inevitable retribution.
american troops pursued and attacked them only to be chief joseph driven off in a battle at white bird canyon.
after that the nez perc scattered in several directions and became part of a remarkable chase.
joseph moved with 200 warriors and 350 women children and old people in an effort to reach canada.
pursued by four columns of american soldiers the indians covered 1 321 miles in seventy five days repelling or evading the army time and again.
they were finally caught just short of the canadian boundary.
some escaped and slipped across the border but joseph and most of his followers weary and discouraged finally gave up.
hear me my chiefs joseph said after meeting with the american general nelson miles i am tired.
my heart is sick and sad.
from where the sun now stands i will fight no more forever the last indians to maintain organized resistance against the whites were the chiricahua apache.
the two ablest chiefs of this fierce tribe were mangas colorados and cochise.
mangas was murdered during the civil war by white soldiers who tricked him into surrendering.
in 1872 cochise agreed to peace in exchange for a reservation that included some of the tribes traditional land.
but cochise died in 1874 and his successor geronimo geronimo fought on for more than a decade longer establishing bases in the mountains of arizona and mexico and leading warriors in intermittent raids against white outposts.
with each raid however the number of warring apache dwindled as some warriors died and others drifted away to the reservation.
by 1886 geronimos band consisted of only about 30 people including women and children while his white pursuers numbered perhaps 10 000.
geronimo recognized the odds and surrendered.
the apache wars the most violent of all the indian conflicts produced brutality on both sides.
but it was the whites who committed the most flagrant atrocities.
that did not end with the conclusion of the apache wars.
another tragic encounter occurred in 1890 as a result of a religious revival among the sioux a revival that itself symbolized the catastrophic effects of the white assaults on indian civilization.
as other tribes had done in trying times in the past many of these indians turned to a prophet who led them in a religious revival.
this time the prophet was wovoka a paiute who inspired a fervent spiritual awakening that began in nevada and spread quickly to the plains.
wovoka predicted the imminent coming of a messiah.
the new revivals most conspicuous feature was a mass emotional ghost dance which inspired ecstatic mystical visions including images ghost dance of the retreat of white people from the plains and a restoration of the great buffalo herds.
white agents on the sioux reservation bewildered and fearful warned the army that dances might be the prelude to hostilities.
on december 29 1890 the seventh cavalry tried to round up a group of about 350 cold and starving sioux at wounded knee south dakota.
fighting broke out in which about 40 white soldiers and up to 200 indians died.
an indian may wounded knee massacre have fired the first shot but the battle soon turned into a one sided massacre as the white soldiers turned their new machine guns on the indians and mowed them down in the snow.
the dawes act even before the ghost dance and the wounded knee tragedies the federal government had moved to destroy forever the tribal structure that was the cornerstone of indian culture.
reversing its policy of nearly fifty years congress abolished the practice by which tribes owned reservation lands communally.
the new policy required indians to 398 chapter 16 become landowners and farmers to abandon their collective society and culture and become part of white civilization.
some supporters of the new policy believed they were acting for the good of the indians whom they considered a vanishing race in need of rescue by and assimilation into white society.
the dawes severalty act of 1887 provided for the gradual elimination of most tribal ownership of land and the allotment of tracts to individual owners 160 acres to the head of a family 80 acres to a single adult or orphan 40 acres to each dependent child.
adult owners were given united states citizenship but unlike other citizens they could not gain full title to their property for twenty five years supposedly to prevent them from selling the land to speculators.
in applying the dawes act the bureau of indian affairs relentlessly promoted the idea of assimilation that lay behind it.
not only did agents of the bureau try to move indian families onto their own plots of land they also took many indian children away from their families and sent them to boarding schools run by whites.
they moved as well to stop indian religious rituals and encouraged the spread of christianity and the creation of christian churches on the reservations.
few indians were prepared for this wrenching change.
in any case white administration of the dawes act was so corrupt and inept that ultimately the government simply abandoned most efforts to enforce it.
much of the reservation land therefore was never distributed to individual owners.
the rise and decline of the western farmer the arrival of the miners the empire building of the cattle ranchers the dispersal of the indian tribes all served as a prelude to the decisive phase of white settlement of the far west.
even before the civil war farmers had begun moving into the plains region challenging the dominance of the ranchers and the indians.
by the 1870s what was once a trickle had become a deluge.
western journalists and visitors alike told tall tales of money to be had for the taking the regions healthy climate pure water fertile soil and nutrientrich grasses they crowed made industries like cattle ranching into cant miss investment opportunities.
see consider the source walter baron von richthofen cattle raising on the plains in north america and they came.
farmers poured into the plains and beyond enclosed land that had once been hunting territory for indians and open range for cattle and established a new agricultural region.
for a time in the late 1870s and early 1880s the new western farmers flourished enjoying the fruits of an agricultural economic boom.
beginning in the mid 1880s however the boom turned to bust and the western agricultural economy began a long steady decline.
farming on the plains many factors combined to produce the surge of post civil war western agricultural settlement but the most important was the railroads.
before the war the great plains had been accessible only through a difficult journey by wagon.
but beginning in the 1860s a great new network of railroad lines made huge areas of settlement accessible for the first time.
the conquest of the far west 399 the building of the transcontinental train line completed in 1869 when the two lines met at promontory point utah was a dramatic and monumental achievement.
but the construction of subsidiary lines in the following years proved of greater importance to the west.
state governments imitating washington subsidized railroad development by offering direct financial aid favorable loans and more than 50 million acres of land on top of the 130 million acres the federal government had already provided.
although built and operated by private corporations the railroads were in many respects public projects.
the railroad companies also actively promoted settlement.
the companies set rates so low for settlers that almost anyone could afford the trip west.
and they cheap rail rates sold much of their land at very low prices and with liberal credit to prospective settlers.
contributing further to the great surge of white agricultural expansion was a pronounced but temporary change in the climate of the great plains.
for several years in succession beginning in the 1870s rainfall in the plains states was well above average.
white americans now rejected the old idea that the region was the great american desert but even under the most favorable conditions farming on the plains presented special problems.
first was the problem of fencing.
farmers had to enclose their land but materials for traditional wood or stone fences were unavailable.
in the mid 1870s however two illinois farmers joseph h glidden and i l ellwood solved this problem by developing and marketing barbed wire which became standard equipment on the plains and revolutionized fencing practices all over the world.
the second problem was water.
water was scarce even when rainfall was above average.
after 1887 a series of dry seasons began and lands that had been fertile scarce water now returned to semidesert.
some farmers dealt with the problem by using deep wells pumped by steel windmills by turning to dryland farming a system of tillage designed to conserve moisture in the soil by covering it with a dust blanket or by planting droughtresistant crops.
in many areas of the plains however only large scale irrigation could save the endangered farms.
but irrigation projects of the necessary magnitude required government assistance and neither the federal nor the state governments were prepared to fund the projects.
most of the people who moved into the region had previously been farmers in the midwest the east or europe.
in the booming years of the early 1880s with land values rising the new farmers had no problem obtaining extensive and easy credit.
but the arid years of the late 1880s during which crop prices fell while production became more expensive changed the farmers prospects.
tens of thousands of farmers could not pay their debts and were forced to abandon their farms.
there was in effect a reverse migration reverse migration white settlers moving back east sometimes turning once flourishing western communities into desolate ghost towns.
those who remained continued to suffer from falling prices for example wheat which had sold for 1 60 a bushel at the end of the civil war dropped to 49 cents in the 1890s and persistent indebtedness.
commercial agriculture by the late nineteenth century the sturdy independent farmer of popular myth was being replaced by the commercial farmer attempting to do in the agricultural economy what industrialists were doing in the manufacturing economy.
commercial farmers specialized in cash crops that were sold in national or world markets.
they did not often make their own household supplies or grow their own food but bought them from merchants.
this kind of farming when it was successful raised farmers living standards.
but it also made co ns ider t he s o urc e walter baron von richthofen cattle raising on the plains in north america 1885 boosters of the wests lucrative economy were plentiful.
walter baron von richthofen an immigrant and scion of an aristocratic german austrian family lauded cattle ranching as a western industry that begged for investors eager to make easy money.
the immense profits which have been universally realized in the western cattle business for the past and which will be increased in the future owing to the more economical methods pursued so long as ranges can be purchased at present prices may seem incredible to many of my readers who no doubt have considered the stories of the fortunes realized as myths.
yet it is true that many men who started only a few years ago with comparatively few cattle are now wealthy and in some cases millionaires.
they certainly did not find the gold upon the prairies nor did they have any source of revenue beyond the increase of their cattle.
the agencies producing this immense wealth are very natural and apparent.
the climate of the west is the healthiest on the earth the pure high mountain air and dry atmosphere are the natural remedies or rather preventives against sickness among cattle in general and against all epidemic diseases in particular for nowhere in the western states do we find any traces of pleuro pneumonia foot or mouth and such like contagious diseases the pure clear water of the mountain rivers affords to cattle another health preserver and the fine nutritious and bountiful grasses and in winter the naturally cured hay furnish to them the healthiest natural food.
formerly these pastures cost nothing and at present only a trifle.
so that the interest on the investment in purchasing land is of little importance in the estimate of the cost of keeping a herd.
in fact ownership 400 of land is now indispensable for a herdowner.
this land in less than ten years will be a considerable factor in the profits of the cattle business as the value of pastures will constantly increase.
the principal cost of raising cattle is only the herding and watching the cattle by herders without any cost for sheltering or feeding.
in time even these expenses will be reduced as now already herds are kept in large fenced ranges and many of the herders are dispensed with.
the losses of cattle as shown by statistics are larger among eastern and european herds which are sheltered in stables and fed the whole year round than among the shelterless herds of the west.
the losses in the west.
are practically reduced by long experience to a certain percentage which enables the stockmen to calculate infallibly the profits and losses of their business.
this annual loss is found to average 2 to 3 per cent.
we may safely put the loss in the extreme northern states at about 3 per cent and in the more southern and temperate districts at 2 or less per cent.
the annual cost of herding the cattle.
is about 70 per head adding the other expenses such as taxes loss of interest on the purchase money of land etc we find that the entire annual expense is less than 1 50 per head.
now let me illustrate the profits realized from one texas cow worth 30 00.
in ten years she will have eight calves which if they are all steers will have produced at the end of fourteen years 320 or a profit of 272 00.
the cow herself still remains and is worth about her original cost for the butcher.
these figures are made without reference to any increase in the value of cattle or beef and without reference to any improvement of the stock by crossing it with better blood.
ten years ago an irish servant girl wanted money due her amounting to 150 from a cattle raiser who lived in montana.
cattle had been dull and he could not dispose of any of his herd but agreed to her to brand fifteen cows in her name give her the increase and carry them with his herd free of cost until she was ready to sell he to have the first privilege of purchase.
she accepted held on to her purchase and last may sold out her master for 25 000.

and unlike the capitalists of the industrial order they could not regulate their production or influence the prices of what they sold.
between 1865 and 1900 farm output increased dramatically not only in the united states but in brazil argentina canada australia new zealand russia and elsewhere.
beginning in the 1880s worldwide overproduction led to a drop in worldwide overproduction prices for most agricultural goods and hence to great economic distress for many of the more than 6 million american farm families.
by the 1890s 27 percent of the farms in the country were mortgaged by 1910 33 percent.
in 1880 25 percent of all farms had been operated by tenants by 1910 the proportion had grown to 37 percent.
commercial farming made some people fabulously wealthy.
but the farm economy as a whole was suffering a significant decline relative to the rest of the nation.
the farmers grievances american farmers were painfully aware that something was wrong.
but few people yet understood the implications of national and world overproduction.
instead they concentrated their attention and anger on more immediate more comprehensible and no less real problems inequitable freight rates high interest charges and an inadequate currency.
the farmers first and most burning grievance was against the railroads.
in many cases the railroads charged higher rates for farm goods than for other goods and higher rates in the south and west than in the northeast.
railroads also controlled elevator and warehouse facilities in buying centers and charged arbitrary storage rates.
farmers also resented the institutions controlling credit banks loan companies insurance corporations.
since sources of credit in the west and south were few farmers had to take loans on whatever terms they could get often at interest rates ranging from 10 to 25 percent.
many farmers had to pay these loans back in years when prices were dropping and currency was becoming scarce.
as a result expansion of the currency became an increasingly important issue to farmers.
401 402 chapter 16 a third grievance concerned prices.
a farmer could plant a large crop at a moment when its price was high and find that by the time of the harvest the price had declined.
farmers fortunes rose and fell in response to unpredictable forces.
but many farmers became convinced often with some reason that intermediaries speculators bankers regional and local agents were conspiring with one another to fix prices so as to benefit themselves at the growers expense.
many farmers also came to believe again not entirely without reason that manufacturers in the east were colluding to keep the prices of farm goods low and the prices of industrial goods high.
although farmers sold their crops in a competitive world market they bought manufactured goods in a domestic market protected by tariffs and dominated by trusts and corporations.
the agrarian malaise these economic difficulties helped produce social and cultural resentments.
among them was the isolation of farm life.
farm families in some parts of the country were virtually cut off from the outside world.
during the winter months the loneliness and boredom could reasons for discontent become nearly unbearable.
many farmers lacked access to adequate education for their children.
they had few or no proper medical facilities.
there were few organized recreational or cultural activities.
older farmers felt the sting of watching their children leave the farm for the city.
they felt the humiliation of being ridiculed as hayseeds by the new urban culture that was coming to dominate american life.
this sense of isolation and obsolescence led to a growing malaise among many farmers a discontent that helped create a great national political movement in the 1890s.
it found reflection too in some of the literature that emerged from rural america.
writers in the late nineteenth century might romanticize the rugged life of the cowboy and the western miner.
for the farmers however the image of the agricultural world was different.
hamlin garland for example reflected the growing disillusionment in a series of novels and short stories.
in the introduction to his novel jason edwards 1891 he wrote that in the past the agrarian frontier had seemed to be the golden west the land of wealth and freedom and happiness now however the bright promise had faded.
the trials of rural life were crushing the human spirit.
so this is the reality of the dream a character in jason edwards exclaims a shanty on a barren plain hot and lone as a desert.
my god once sturdy yeoman farmers had viewed themselves as the backbone of american life.
now they were becoming painfully aware that their position was declining in relation to the rising urban industrial society to the east.
conclusion to many americans in the late nineteenth century the west seemed an untamed frontier in which hardy pioneers were creating a new society.
the reality of the west in these years however was very different from this enduring image.
white americans moved into the vast regions west of the mississippi at a remarkable rate in the years after the civil war and many of them indeed settled in lands far from any civilization they had ever known.
but the west was not an empty place.
it contained a large population of indians with whom the white settlers sometimes lived uneasily and with whom they sometimes battled but almost always in the end the indians were pushed aside and with help from the federal government relocated onto lands whites did not want.
there were the conquest of the far west 403 significant numbers of mexicans in some areas small populations of asians in others and african americans moving in from the south in search of land and freedom.
the west was no barren frontier but a place of many cultures.
the west was also closely and increasingly tied to the emerging capitalist industrial economy of the east.
the miners who flooded into california colorado nevada the dakotas and elsewhere were responding to the demand in the east for gold and silver but even more for iron ore copper lead zinc and quartz.
cattle and sheep ranchers produced meat wool and leather for eastern consumers and manufacturers.
farmers grew crops for sale in national and international commodities markets.
the west certainly looked different from the east.
but the growth of the west was very much a part of the growth of the rest of the nation.
and the culture of the west despite the romantic images of pioneering individuals embraced by easterners and westerners alike was at its heart as much a culture of economic growth and capitalist ambition as was that of the rest of the nation.

what factors drove americas industrial expansion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
2 who were the critics of americas new industrial economy what were their criticisms and what solutions did they propose.
how did the conditions and characteristics of the workforce change during this period of rapid industrialization.
years after the death of lincoln america had become in the quantity and value of her products the leading manufacturing nation of the world.
what england had accomplished in a hundred years the united states had achieved in half the time so boasted the historians charles and mary beard in the 1920s expressing the amazement many americans felt when they considered the remarkable expansion of their industrial economy in the late nineteenth century.
in fact americas rise to industrial supremacy was not as sudden as such observers suggested.
the nation had been building a manufacturing economy since early in the nineteenth century.
but americans were clearly correct in observing that the accomplishments of the last three decades of the nineteenth century overshadowed all the earlier progress.
the remarkable growth did much to increase the wealth and improve the lives of many americans.
but such benefits were very unequally shared.
while industrial titans and a growing middle class were enjoying a prosperity without precedent in the nations history workers farmers and others were experiencing an often painful ordeal that slowly edged the united states toward a great economic and political crisis.
404 sources of industrial growth time line many factors contributed to the growth of american industry abundant raw materials a large and growing labor supply a surge in technological innovation the emergence of a talented and often ruthless group of entrepreneurs a federal government eager to assist the growth of business and an expanding domestic market for the products of manufacturing.
first oil well drilled industrial technologies the rapid emergence of new technologies together with the discovery of new materials and productive processes was one of the principal sources of late nineteenth century industrial growth.
some of the most important innovations were in communications.
in 1866 cyrus w field laid a transatlantic telegraph cable to europe.
during the next decade alexander graham bell developed the first telephone with commercial capacity.
by 1900 there were 1 35 million telephones and by 1920 13 3 million.
and the italian inventor guglielmo marconi was taking the first steps toward the development of radio in the 1890s the technology he developed quickly found its way to the united states.
other inventions that speeded the pace of business organization were the typewriter by christopher l sholes in 1868 the cash register by james ritty in 1879 and the calculating or adding machine by william s burroughs in 1891.
among the most revolutionary innovations was the introduction in the 1870s of electricity as a source of light and power.
the pioneers of electric lighting included charles f brush who devised the arc lamp for street illumination and thomas a edison who invented the incandescent lamp or lightbulb.
edison and others designed improved generators and built large power plants to furnish electricity to national labor union founded first transatlantic cable rockefeller founds standard oil carnegie steel founded economic panic bell invents telephone nationwide railroad strike edison invents electric lightbulb american federation of labor founded haymarket bombing bellamys looking backward depression begins homestead steel strike pullman strike carnegie publishes the gospel of wealth wright brothers airplane flight ford introduces factory assembly lines 405.
406 chapter 17 whole cities.
by the turn of the century electric power was becoming commonplace in street railway systems in the elevators of urban skyscrapers in factories and increasingly in offices and homes.
particularly important to trade and industry was the development of new high efficiency steam engines capable of powering larger ships at faster speeds than ever before.
the new high speed freighters for example made it cheaper for britain to buy wheat grown in canada and the united states than to grow it at home.
the introduction of refrigerated ships in the 1870s made it possible to transport meat from north america and even australia and asia to europe.
the technology of iron and steel production iron production had developed slowly in the united states through most of the nineteenth century mostly driven by the demand for iron rails steel production had developed hardly at all by the end of the civil war.
in the 1870s and 1880s however iron production soared as railroads added 40 000 new miles of track and steel production made great strides toward its eventual dominance in the metals industry.
an englishman henry bessemer and an american william kelly developed almost simultaneously a process for converting iron into the much more durable and versatile steel.
the process which took bessemers name consisted of blowing air through molten iron to burn out the impurities and create a much stronger metal.
the bessemer process also relied on the discovery by the british metallurgist robert mushet that ingredients could be added during the conversion process to give steel additional strength.
in 1868 the new jersey ironmaster abram s hewitt introduced from europe another method of making steel the open hearth process.
these techniques made possible the production of steel in great quantities and large dimensions for use in the manufacture of locomotives rails and girders for the construction of tall buildings.
the steel industry emerged first in western pennsylvania and eastern ohio partly because iron ore could be found there in abundance.
it was also because the new forms of steel production created a demand for new kinds of fuel and particularly for the anthracite or hard coal that was plentiful in pennsylvania.
later new techniques made it possible to use bituminous or soft coal also easily mined in western pennsylvania.
as a result pittsburgh quickly became the center of the steel world.
but the industry was growing fast and new sources of ore soon emerged.
the upper peninsula of michigan the mesabi range in minnesota and the area around birmingham alabama became important ore producing locales and new centers of steel production grew up near them cleveland detroit chicago and birmingham among others.
until the civil war iron and steel furnaces were mostly made of stone and usually built against the side of a hill to reduce construction demands.
by the 1870s however furnaces were redesigned as cylindrical iron shells lined with brick.
these massive new furnaces were 75 feet tall and higher and could produce over 500 tons a week.
as the steel industry spread new transportation systems emerged to serve it.
steel production in the great lakes region produced steam freighters that could carry ore on the lakes.
shippers used new steam engines to speed the unloading of ore.
the demand for vessels capable of transporting oil and the development of new and more powerful steam engines led to the design of larger and heavier freighters.
there was an even closer relationship between the emerging steel companies and the railroads.
steel manufacturers provided rails and parts for cars railroads were both m arkets industrial supremacy 407 the american oil industry emerged first in western pennsylvania where speculators built makeshift facilities almost overnight.
an oil field on the other side of the hill depicted here had been producing 600 barrels a day and the wells quickly spilled over the hill and down the slope shown in the photograph.
the library of congress pioneer oil run 1865 for and transporters of manufactured steel.
but the relationship soon became more intimate than that.
the pennsylvania railroad for example actually created the steel and railroads pennsylvania steel company.
the steel industrys need for lubrication for its machines helped create another important new industry in the late nineteenth century oil.
not until later did oil become important primarily for its potential as a fuel.
the existence of petroleum reserves in western pennsylvania had been common knowledge for some time.
the pennsylvania businessman george bissell showed that the substance could be burned in lamps and that it could also yield such products as paraffin naphtha and lubricating oil.
bissell raised money to begin drilling and in 1859 edwin l drake one of bissells employees established the first oil well near titusville pennsylvania which soon produced 500 barrels of oil a month.
demand for petroleum grew quickly and promoters soon developed other oil fields in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia.
the automobile and the airplane among the most important technological innovations was the invention of the automobile.
two technologies led to its development.
first was the creation of gasoline or petrol the product of an extraction process developed in the late nineteenth century in the united states by which lubricating oil and fuel oil were removed separately from crude oil.
the second technology was the development of a self contained engine.
as early as the 1870s designers in france germany and austria had begun to develop an internal combustion engine which used the expanding power of burning gas to drive pistons.
a german nicolaus august otto created a gas powered four stroke engine in the mid 1860s which was a precursor to automobile engines.
but he did not develop a way to untether 408 chapter 17 it from gas lines to be used portably in machines.
one of ottos former employees gottfried daimler later perfected an engine that could be used in automobiles.
the american automobile industry developed rapidly in the aftermath of these european breakthroughs.
charles and frank duryea built the first gasoline driven motor vehicle in henry ford america in 1893.
three years later henry ford produced the first of the famous cars that would bear his name.
in 1895 there were only four automobiles on the american highways.
by 1917 there were nearly 5 million.
the search for a means of human flight as old as civilization had been almost entirely futile until the late nineteenth century when engineers scientists and tinkerers in both the united states and europe began to experiment with a wide range of aeronautic devices.
balloonists began to consider ways to make dirigibles useful vehicles of transportation.
others experimented with kites and gliders.
two brothers in ohio wilbur and orville wright began to construct a glider in 1899 the wright brothers that could be propelled through the air by an internal combustion engine.
four years later orville made a celebrated test flight near kitty hawk north carolina in which an airplane took off by itself and traveled 120 feet in 12 seconds under its own power before settling back to earth.
by the fall of 1904 the wright brothers had improved the plane to the point where they were able to fly over 23 miles and in the following year they began to take a few passengers on their flights with them.
although the first working airplane was built in the united states aviation technology was slow to gain a foothold in america.
most of the early progress in airplane design occurred in france where there was substantial government funding for research and development.
the u s government created the national advisory committee on aeronautics in 1915 twelve years after the wright brothers flight and american airplanes became a significant presence in europe during world war i.
but the prospects for commercial flight seemed dim until the 1920s when charles lindberghs famous solo flight from new york to paris electrified the nation and the world.
research and development new industrial technologies persuaded many businesses to build their own research operations.
the corporate research and development r d laboratories coincided with a decline in government support for research helping corporations attract skilled researchers.
it also decentralized the sources of research funding and ensured that inquiry would move in many directions and not just along paths determined by the government.
a rift began to emerge between scientists and engineers.
engineers both inside and outside of universities became increasingly tied up with the r d agendas of corporations.
many scientists continued to scorn this commercialization of knowledge and preferred to stick to basic research that had no immediate practical applications.
but many american scientists were more closely connected to practical challenges than were their european counterparts and some joined engineers in corporate r d laboratories which over time began to sponsor both practical and basic research.
the science of production central to the growth of the automobile and other industries were changes in the techniques of production.
by the turn of the century many industrialists were embracing the industrial supremacy 409 this photograph from 1902 shows women at work on the lock and drill department assembly line at the national cash register company in dayton ohio.
everett collection historical alamy women on the assembly line new principles of scientific management often known as taylorism after taylorism its leading theoretician frederick winslow taylor.
taylor and his many admirers argued that scientific management made human labor compatible with the demands of the machine age.
he persuaded employers to take control of the workplace.
taylor also urged employers to reorganize the production process by subdividing tasks.
this sped up production and made workers more interchangeable thus diminishing a managers dependence on any particular employee.
if properly managed by trained experts he claimed workers using modern machines could perform simple tasks at much greater speed greatly increasing productive efficiency.
the most important change in industrial technology was the emergence of mass production and along with it the moving assembly line which henry ford assembly line introduced in his automobile plants in 1914.
the assembly line was a particular place a factory through which automobiles moved as they were assembled by workers who specialized in particular tasks.
it was also a concept.
the concept stressed the complete interchangeability of parts.
general motors adopted the same philosophy.
automobile production relied on other technologies too in particular the intensive use of electricity to drive the assembly line to light the factories and to run the critical ventilating systems that kept dust from interfering with the machines.
the revolutionary assemblyline technique enabled ford to raise wages and reduce hours while cutting the base price of his model t from 950 in 1914 to 290 in 1929.
it became a standard for many other industries.
410 chapter 17 railroad expansion and the corporation the principal agent of industrial development in the late nineteenth century was still the expansion of the railroads.
railroads gave industrialists access to distant markets and remote sources of raw materials.
they were americas biggest investors stimulating economic growth through their own enormous expenditures on construction and equipment and sale of their vast tracks of land.
total railroad trackage increased from 30 000 miles in 1860 to 193 000 in 1900.
importance of government subsidies subsidies from federal state and local governments along with foreign loans and investments were vital to this expansion.
equally important was the emergence of great railroad combinations mergers many of them dominated by one or two individuals.
the achievements and excesses of these tycoons cornelius vanderbilt james j hill collis p huntington and others became symbols to much of the nation of concentrated economic power.
but railroad development was less significant for the individual barons it created than for its contribution to the growth of a new institution the modern corporation.
there had been various forms of corporations in america since colonial times but the modern corporation emerged as a major force only after the civil war.
by then railroad magnates and other industrialists realized that their great ventures could not be financed by any single person.
under the laws of incorporation passed in many states in the 1830s and 1840s business organizations could raise money by selling stock to members of the public after the civil war one industry after another began doing so.
what made these stocks appealing was that investors now had only limited liability they risked only the amount of their c anada pacific time zone mountain time zone seattle portland central time zone eastern time zone helena boston boise st paul buffalo detroit cent r al pacif unio ic chicago n pacific omaha kansas city kansas p acific m i ss ouri pac ific santa fe iso n e topeka santa f los angeles atc norfolk st louis memphis h atlanta phoenix charleston el paso houston major railroads added 1870 1890 m exico atlantic ocean dallas major railroads in 1870 transcontinental railroad philadelphia washington d c denver san francisco pacific ocean pittsburgh salt lake city reno new york cleveland mobile new orleans gulf of mexico this map illustrates the rapid expansion of railroads in the late nineteenth century.
in 1870 there was already a dense network of rail lines in the northeast and midwest illustrated here by the green lines.
the red lines show the further expansion of rail coverage between 1870 and 1890 much of it in the south and the areas west of the mississippi river.
why were railroads so essential to the nations economic growth in these years.
railroads 1870 1890 industrial supremacy 411 investments and were not liable for any debts the corporation might accumulate beyond that point.
the ability to sell stock to a broad public made it possible for entrepreneurs to gather vast sums of capital and undertake great projects with manageable financial risk.
the pennsylvania and other railroads were among the first to adopt the new corporate form of organization.
but incorporation quickly spread beyond the railroad industry.
andrew carnegie a scottish immigrant worked his way up from modest beginnings and in 1873 opened his own steelworks in pittsburgh.
soon he dominated the industry.
with his associate henry clay frick he bought up coal mines and carnegie frick and morgan leased part of the mesabi iron range in minnesota operated a fleet of ore ships on the great lakes and acquired railroads.
he financed his vast undertakings not only out of his own profits but also out of the sale of stock.
then in 1901 he sold out for 450 million to the banker j pierpont morgan who merged the carnegie interests with others to create the giant united states steel corporation a 14 billion enterprise that controlled almost two thirds of the nations steel production.
other industries developed similarly.
gustavus swift forged a relatively small meatpacking company into a great national corporation.
isaac singer patented a sewing machine in 1851 and created i m singer and company one of the first modern manufacturing corporations.
large national business enterprises needed systematic administrative structures.
as a result corporate leaders introduced managerial techniques that relied on the systematic division of responsibilities.
companies built carefully designed hierarchies of control strict cost accounting procedures and a new breed of business executives the middle managers who formed a layer of command between workers and owners.
efficient administrative capabilities helped make possible another major feature of the modern corporation consolidation.
businessmen created large consolidated organizations primarily through two methods.
horizontal integration combined a number of firms engaged in the same enterprise into a single corporation such as the consolidation of many different railroad lines into one company.
through vertical integration a company took over all the different businesses on which it relied for its primary function for example carnegie steel which came to control not only steel mills but also mines railroads and other enterprises.
the most celebrated corporate empire of the late nineteenth century was john d rockefellers standard oil.
shortly after the civil war rockefeller rockefellers standard oil launched a refining company in cleveland and immediately began trying to eliminate his competition.
allying himself with other wealthy capitalists he formed the standard oil company of ohio in 1870 which in a few years had acquired twenty of the twenty five refineries in cleveland as well as plants in pittsburgh philadelphia new york and baltimore.
so far rockefeller had expanded only horizontally buying many refineries.
but soon he began expanding vertically as well.
he built his own barrel factories terminal warehouses and pipelines.
standard oil owned its own freight cars and developed its own marketing organization.
by the 1880s rockefeller had established such dominance within the petroleum industry that to much of the nation he served as a leading symbol of monopoly.
rockefeller and other industrialists saw consolidation as a way to cope with what they believed was the greatest curse of the modern economy cutthroat competition most businessmen claimed to believe in free enterprise and a competitive marketplace but in fact they feared that substantial competition could spell instability and ruin for all.
412 chapter 17 as the movement toward consolidation accelerated new vehicles emerged to facilitate it.
the railroads began with so called pool arrangements informal agreements among various companies to stabilize rates and divide markets arrangements that would in later years be known as cartels.
but the pool arrangements were too weak and could not ensure cost stability.
the failure of the pools led to new techniques of consolidation.
the next effort to trusts stabilize prices was the creation of the trust pioneered by standard oil in the early 1880s and the banker j p morgan.
under a trust agreement stockholders in individual corporations transferred their stocks to a small group of trustees in exchange for shares in the trust itself.
owners of trust certificates often had no direct control over the decisions of the trustees they simply received a share of the profits of the combination.
the trustees themselves on the other hand might literally own only a few companies but could exercise effective control over many.
in 1889 the state of new jersey helped produce a third form of consolidation by changing its laws of incorporation to permit companies to buy up rivals.
other states soon followed.
once actual corporate mergers were permitted the original trusts became unnecessary.
rockefeller for example quickly relocated standard oil to new jersey and created what became known as a holding company a central corporate body holding companies that would buy up the stock of various members of the standard oil trust and establish direct formal ownership of them.
by the end of the nineteenth century 1 percent of the corporations in america were able to control more than 33 percent of the manufacturing.
a system of economic organization was emerging that lodged enormous power in the hands of concentration of power very few men the great bankers of new york such as morgan industrial titans such as rockefeller who himself gained control of a major bank and others.
the industrial giants of the era clearly contributed to substantial economic growth.
they were also creating the basis for one of the greatest public controversies of their era a raging debate over concentrated economic and political power that continued well into the twentieth century.
capitalist conservatism and its critics the inequality of the roaring capitalism of the late nineteenth century was not without its critics.
farmers workers middle class businessmen and many others considered the new capitalism to be a threat to their own destinies.
but the industrial titans built a powerful defense for the new corporate economy.
survival of the fittest the new rationale for capitalism was based on the belief of individualism an ideology that would remain at the heart of american conservatism for many decades.
wealthy capitalists defended their wealth by saying that they had earned their wealth and power through their own hard work and their acquisitiveness and thrift.
those who failed had only themselves to blame a result of ignorance stupidity or laziness.
conservative social theories helped support the belief that through survival of the fittest wealthy capitalists deserved their success.
among them was the theory of social darwinism.
darwins theories argued that the fittest forms of life survived over thousands ideology of individualism industrial supremacy 413 of years because of their biological fitness.
social darwinism argued that individuals rose or fell in society because of their innate fitness darwin himself along with most scientists debunked social darwinism but many americans embraced it nevertheless.
the english philosopher and biologist herbert spencer introduced the theory of social darwinism in his book principles of biology 1864.
society he argued benefited from the elimination of the unfit and the survival of the strong and talented.
william graham sumner a sociologist at yale borrowed from spencers theory and created a theory of his own in his famous 1906 book folkways.
those who failed he argued in a 1913 essay were unfit for success before the tribunal of nature a man has no more right to life than a rattlesnake he has no more right to liberty than any wild beast his right to pursuit of happiness is nothing but a license to maintain the struggle for existence wealthy corporate leaders were attracted to the ideas of spencer and sumner.
their success confirmed their own virtues and fitness capitalists argued that they earned their wealth through the honest all american virtues of competition and the free market.
but critics of the industrial and financial titans claimed that they earned their wealth not because of the innate fitness of those who succeeded but because they replaced the natural workings of the marketplace by building great monopolies that would protect them from competition.
the gospel of wealth some businessmen attempted to temper the harsh philosophy of social darwinism with a gentler if in some ways equally self serving idea the gospel of wealth people of great wealth they argued had not only great power but also a great responsibility to use their riches to advance social progress.
elaborating on this creed in his 1889 article the gospel of wealth and elaborated on in the 1901 book of the same title andrew carnegie wrote that people of wealth should consider all revenues in excess of their own needs to be trust funds used for the good of the community.
see consider the source andrew carnegie explains the gospel of wealth carnegie was only one of many industrialists who devoted large parts of their fortunes to philanthropic works.
the idea of private wealth as a public blessing existed alongside another popular concept the notion of great wealth as something available to all.
russell h conwell a baptist minister became one of the most prominent spokesmen for the idea by delivering one lecture acres of diamonds more than 6 000 times between 1880 and 1900.
conwell told a series of stories which he claimed were true of individuals who had found opportunities for extraordinary wealth in their own backyards.
one such story involved a modest farmer who discovered a vast diamond mine in his own fields.
most of the millionaires in the country conwell claimed inaccurately had begun on the lowest rung of the economic ladder and had worked their way to success.
but the most famous promoter of the success story was horatio alger.
he was originally a minister in a small town in massachusetts but was driven from his horatio alger pulpit as a result of sexual scandals.
he moved to new york where he wrote over 100 celebrated novels all of them tributes to social mobility and the ability of americans to rise from rags to riches see patterns of popular culture the novels of horatio alger if algers rags to riches tales captured the aspiration of many men louisa may alcotts enormously popular novels helped give voice to the often unstated louisa may alcott ambitions of many women.
alcott was the daughter of a noted new england reformer co ns ider t he s o urc e andrew carnegie explains the gospel of wealth 1889 writing for a general audience in the literary and culture magazine the north american review billionaire andrew carnegie made one of the industrial ages most famous arguments about the inherent justness of the unequal distribution of economic power and wealth.
the problem of our age is the proper administration of wealth that the ties of brotherhood may still bind together the rich and poor in harmonious relationship.
the conditions of human life have not only been changed but revolutionized within the past few hundred years.
in former days there was little difference between the dwelling dress food and environment of the chief and those of his retainers.
the indians are today where civilized man then was.
the contrast between the palace of the millionaire and the cottage of the laborer with us to day measures the change which has come with civilization.
this change however is not to be deplored but welcomed as highly beneficial.
it is well nay essential for the progress of the race that the houses of some should be homes for all that is highest and best in literature and the arts and for all the refinements of civilization rather than that none should be so.
much better this great irregularity than universal squalor.
the good old times were not good old times.
neither master nor servant was as well situated then as to day.
a relapse to old conditions would be disastrous to both not the least so to him who serves and would sweep away civilization with it.
but whether the change be for good or ill it is upon us beyond our power to alter and therefore to be accepted and made the best of.
it is a waste of time to criticize the inevitable.
it is easy to see how the change has come.
in the manufacture of products we have the whole story.
to day the world 414 obtains commodities of excellent quality at prices which even the preceding generation would have deemed incredible.
the poor enjoy what the rich could not before afford.
what were the luxuries have become the necessaries of life.
the laborer has now more comforts than the farmer had a few generations ago.
the farmer has more luxuries than the landlord had and is more richly clad and better housed.
the landlord has books and pictures rarer and appointments more artistic than the king could then obtain.
the price we pay for this salutary change is no doubt great.
under the law of competition the employer of thousands is forced into the strictest economies among which the rates paid to labor figure prominently and often there is friction between the employer and the employed between capital and labor between rich and poor.
human society loses homogeneity.
the price which society pays for the law of competition like the price it pays for cheap comforts and luxuries is also great but the advantages of this law are also greater still than its cost for it is to this law that we owe our wonderful material development which brings improved conditions in its train.
but whether the law be benign or not we must say of it as we say of the change in the conditions of men to which we have referred it is here we cannot evade it no substitutes for it have been found and while the law may be sometimes hard for the individual it is best for the race because it insures the survival of the fittest in every department.
what is the proper mode of administering wealth after the laws upon which civilization is founded have thrown it into the hands of the few.
there remains.
only one mode of using great fortunes in this we have the true antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth the reconciliation of the rich and the poor a reign of harmony.
it is founded upon the present most intense individualism and the race is prepared to put it in practice by degrees whenever it pleases.
under its sway we shall have an ideal state in which the surplus wealth of the few will become in the best sense the property of the many because administered for the common good and this wealth passing through the hands of the few can be made a much more potent force for the elevation of our race than if distributed in small sums to the people themselves.
even the poorest can be made to see this and to agree that great sums gathered by some of their fellow citizens and spent for public purposes from which the masses reap the principal benefit are more valuable to them than if scattered among themselves in trifling amounts through the course of many years.
poor and restricted are our opportunities in this life narrow our horizon our best work most imperfect but rich men should be thankful for one inestimable boon.
they have it in their power during their lives to busy themselves in organizing benefactions from which the masses of their fellows will derive lasting advantage and thus dignify their own lives.
the highest life is probably to be reached not by such imitation of the life of christ as count tolstoi gives us but while animated by christs spirit by recognizing the changed conditions of this age and adopting modes of expressing this spirit suitable to the changed conditions under which we live still laboring for the good of our fellows which was the essence of his life and teaching but laboring in a different manner.
this then is held to be the duty of the man of wealth to set an example of modest unostentatious living shunning display or extravagance to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds which he is called upon to administer and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which in his judgment is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community the man of wealth thus becoming the mere trustee and agent for his poorer brethren bringing to their service his superior wisdom experience and ability to administer doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves.
t he best means of benefiting the community is to place within its reach the ladders upon which the aspiring can rise free libraries parks and means of recreation by which men are helped in body and mind works of art certain to give pleasure and improve the public taste and public institutions of various kinds which will improve the general condition of the people in this manner returning their surplus wealth to the mass of their fellows in the forms best calculated to do them lasting good.

415 patterns of popular culture the novels of horatio alger a young boy perhaps an orphan makes his way through life on the rough streets of the city by selling newspapers or peddling matches.
one day his energy and determination catch the eye of a wealthy man who gives him a chance to improve himself.
through honesty charm hard work and aggressiveness the boy rises in the world to become a successful man.
that in a nutshell is the story that horatio alger presented to his vast public in novel after novel over 100 of them in all for over forty years.
during his lifetime americans bought millions of copies of his novels.
after his death in 1899 his books and others written in his name continued to sell at an astonishing rate.
even today when the books themselves are largely forgotten the name horatio alger has come to represent the idea of individual advancement through in a phrase alger coined pluck and luck alger was born in 1832 into a middleclass new england family attended harvard and spent a short time as a unitarian minister.
in the mid 1850s he turned to writing stories and books and he continued to do so for the rest of his life.
his most famous novel ragged dick was published in 1868.
almost all of his books were fables of a young mans rise from rags to riches the purpose of his writing he claimed was twofold.
he wanted to exert a salutary influence upon the class of whom he was writing by setting before them inspiring examples of what energy ambition and an honest purpose may achieve he also wanted to show his largely middle class readers the life and experiences of the friendless and vagrant children to be found in all our cities 416 most americans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were attracted to algers stories because the stories helped them believe in one of the most cherished national myths that with willpower and hard work individuals could rise in the world.
that belief was all the more important in the late nineteenth century when large scale corporate industrialization was making it increasingly difficult for individuals to control their own fates.
a newsboys story algers novels were even more popular after his death in 1899 than they had been in his lifetime.
this reprint of one of his many rags to riches stories about a new york newsboys rise to wealth and success was typical of his work.

alger placed great emphasis on the moral qualities of his heroes their success was a reward for their virtue.
but many of his readers ignored the moral message and clung simply to the image of sudden and dramatic success.
after the authors death his publishers abridged many of algers works eliminating the parts of his stories where the heroes do good deeds and focusing solely on the success of algers heroes in rising in the world.
alger himself had very mixed feelings about the new industrial order he described.
his books were meant to reveal not just the opportunities for advancement it sometimes created but also its cruelty.
that was one reason that in almost all his books his heroes triumphed not just because of their own virtues or efforts but because of some amazing stroke of luck.
to alger at least the modern age did not guarantee success through hard work alone there had to be some providential assistance as well.
over time however algers admirers ignored his own m isgivings about industrialism and portrayed his books purely as celebrations of and justifications for laissez faire capitalism and the accumulation of wealth.
an example of the transformation of alger into a symbol of individual achievement is the horatio alger award established in 1947 by the american schools and colleges association to honor living individuals who by their own efforts have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps in the american tradition among its recipients have been presidents dwight d eisenhower and ronald reagan evangelist billy graham and supreme court justice clarence thomas.

how do algers novels both defend in dustrial capitalism and criticize it.
according to the essay alger placed great emphasis on the moral qualities of his heroes but his publishers later eliminated that aspect of the novels.
but her family nevertheless experienced considerable hardship.
after serving as a nurse in the civil war and writing a series of popular adventure novels under a pen name a m barnard that disguised her gender she became a major literary figure with the publication of little women in 1869 and two sequels over the next twenty years.
the main character in these novels jo march struggles to build a life for herself that is not defined by conventional womens roles and ambitions.
she spurns a conventional marriage and eventually weds a professor who appears to support her literary ambitions.
girls write to ask who the little women marry as if that was the only end and aim of a womans life alcott wrote a friend.
i wont marry jo to laurie the attractive wealthy neighbor who proposes to her to please any one alcotts female characters in some ways like algers male ones are remarkable for their independence and drive.
jo march is willful rebellious stubborn ambitious and often selfish far from the posed romantic submissive women in most popular sentimental novels of alcotts time aimed at female audiences.
alternative visions alongside the celebrations of competition and the justifications for great wealth stood a group of alternative philosophies challenging the corporate ethos and at times capitalism itself.
one such philosophy came from the sociologist lester frank ward.
in dynamic sociology 1883 and other books he argued that civilization was not governed by n atural selection but by human intelligence which could shape society as it wished.
in contrast to 417 418 chapter 17 cornelius vanderbilt known as the commodore accumulated one of americas great fortunes by consolidating several large railroad companies in the 1860s.

niday picture library alamy modern colossus of rail roads sumner who believed that state intervention to remodel the environment was futile ward thought that an active government engaged in positive planning was societys best hope.
other americans adopted more radical approaches to reform.
some dissenters found a home in the socialist labor party founded in the 1870s and led for many years by daniel de leon an immigrant from the west indies.
although de leon attracted a following in industrial supremacy 419 the industrial cities the party never became a major political force and never polled more than 82 000 votes.
a dissident faction of de leons party eager to forge stronger ties with organized labor broke away and in 1901 formed the more american socialist party enduring american socialist party.
other radicals gained a wider following.
among them was the california writer and activist henry george.
his angrily eloquent progress and poverty published in 1879 henry george became one of the best selling nonfiction works in american publishing history.
george blamed social problems on the ability of a few monopolists to grow wealthy as a result of rising land values.
an increase in the value of land he claimed was not a result of any effort by the owner but an unearned increment produced by the growth of society around the land.
such profits were rightfully the property of the community.
and so george proposed a single tax on land to replace all other taxes which would return the increment to the people.
the tax he argued would destroy monopolies distribute wealth more equally and eliminate poverty.
rivaling george in popularity was edward bellamy whose utopian novel looking backward published in 1888 sold more than 1 million copies.
it described edward bellamy the experiences of a young bostonian who went into a hypnotic sleep in 1887 and awoke in the year 2000 to find a new social order in which want politics and vice were unknown.
the new society had emerged through a peaceful evolutionary process the large trusts of the late nineteenth century had continued to grow in size and to combine with one another until ultimately they formed a single great trust controlled by the government which distributed the abundance of the industrial economy equally among all the people.
fraternal cooperation had replaced competition.
class divisions had disappeared.
bellamy labeled the philosophy behind this vision nationalism the problems of monopoly relatively few americans shared the views of those who questioned capitalism itself.
but as time went on a growing number of people were becoming deeply concerned about the growth of monopoly.
by the end of the century a wide range of groups had begun to assail monopoly and economic concentration.
in the absence of competition they argued monopolistic industries could charge whatever prices they wished.
railroads in particular charged very high rates along some routes because they knew their customers had no choice but to pay them.
beginning in 1873 the economy fluctuated erratically producing severe recessions every five or six years each worse than the last.
the ordeal of the worker most workers in the late nineteenth century experienced a real rise in their standard of living.
but they did so at the cost of arduous and often dangerous working conditions diminishing control over their own work and a growing sense of powerlessness.
the immigrant workforce the industrial workforce expanded dramatically in the late nineteenth century as a result of massive migration into industrial cities.
rural americans continued to flow into factory towns and cities people disillusioned with or bankrupted by life on the farm.
there was 420 chapter 17 also a great wave of immigration from abroad primarily from europe but also from asia canada mexico and other areas in the decades following the civil war an influx greater than that of any previous era.
the 25 million immigrants who arrived in the united states between 1865 and 1915 were more than four times the number who had arrived in the previous fifty years.
in the 1870s and 1880s most of the immigrants came from england ireland and northern europe.
by the end of the century however the major sources of immigrants had shifted with large numbers of southern and eastern europeans italians poles russians greeks slavs and others moving into the country and into the industrial workforce.
the new immigrants came to america in part to escape poverty and oppression in their homelands.
but they were also attracted by expectations of new opportunities.
railroads lured immigrants into their western landholdings by distributing misleading advertisements overseas.
industrial employers actively recruited immigrant workers under the labor contract law which until its repeal in 1885 permitted them to pay for the passage of workers in advance and deduct the amount later from their wages.
even after the repeal of the law employers continued to encourage the immigration of unskilled laborers often with the assistance of foreign born labor brokers such as the greek and italian padrones who recruited work gangs of their fellow nationals.
the arrival of these new groups heightened ethnic tensions within the working class.
job competition low paid poles greeks and french canadians began to displace higherpaid british and irish workers in the textile factories of new england.
italians slavs and poles emerged as a major source of labor for the mining industry.
chinese and mexicans competed with anglo americans and african americans in mining farmwork and factory labor in california colorado and texas.
wages and working conditions at the turn of the century the average income of the american worker was 400 to 500 a year below the 600 figure that many believed was required to maintain a reasonable level of comfort.
nor did workers have much job security.
all were vulnerable to the boom and bust cycle of the industrial economy and the instability caused by technological advances.
even those who kept their jobs could find their wages suddenly and substantially cut in hard times.
few workers in other words were ever very far from poverty.
many first generation workers accustomed to the patterns of agrarian life had trouble adjusting to the nature of modern industrial labor routine repetitive tasks on a strict and monotonous schedule.
skilled artisans whose once valued tasks were now performed by machines found the new system impersonal and demeaning.
most factory laborers worked ten hours a day six days a week in the steel industry they worked twelve hours a day.
industrial accidents were frequent.
the decreasing need for skilled work in factories induced many employers to increase the use of women and children whom they could hire for lower wages than adult males.
by 1900 20 percent of all manufacturing workers were women.
women labored in all areas of industry even in some of the most arduous jobs.
most women however worked in a few industries where unskilled and semiskilled machine labor as opposed to heavy manual labor prevailed.
the textile industry remained the largest single industrial employer of women.
domestic service though remained the most common female occupation overall.
women worked for wages well below the minimum necessary for survival and well below the wages paid to men working the same jobs.
industrial supremacy 421 young boys some of them barefoot clamber among the great textile machines in a georgia cotton mill mending broken threads and replacing empty bobbins.
many of them were the children or siblings of women who worked in the plant.
the photograph is by lewis hine who traveled around the country documenting abuses for the national child labor committee.
bettmann corbis spindle boys at least 1 7 million children under sixteen years of age were employed in factories and fields 10 percent of all girls aged ten to fifteen and 20 percent of all boys held jobs.
under public pressure thirty eight states passed child labor laws in the late child labor nineteenth century.
but 60 percent of child workers were employed in agriculture which was typically exempt from the laws.
for children employed in factories the laws merely set a minimum age of twelve years and a maximum workday of ten hours standards that employers often ignored in any case.
emerging unionization laborers attempted to fight back against such conditions by creating national unions.
by the end of the century however their efforts had met with little success.
there had been craft unions in america representing small groups of skilled workers since well before the civil war.
but most unions could not hope to exert significant power in the economy.
and during the turbulent recession years of the 1870s unions faced the additional problem of widespread public hostility.
when labor disputes with employers turned bitter and violent as they occasionally did much of the public instinctively blamed the workers for the trouble rarely the employers.
particularly alarming to middle class americans was the emergence of the molly maguires molly maguires 422 chapter 17 an irish secret society in the anthracite coal region of western pennsylvania.
this militant labor organization sometimes used violence and even murder in its battle with coal operators.
excitement over the molly maguires paled beside the near hysteria that gripped the railroad strike of 1877 country during the railroad strike of 1877 which began when the eastern railroads announced a 10 percent wage cut and soon expanded into something approaching a class war.
strikers disrupted rail service from baltimore to st louis destroyed equipment and rioted in the streets of pittsburgh and other cities.
state militias were called out and in july president hayes ordered federal troops to suppress the disorders.
in baltimore eleven demonstrators died and forty were wounded in a conflict between workers and militiamen.
in philadelphia the state militia killed twenty people when the troops opened fire on thousands of workers and their families who were attempting to block the railroad crossings.
in all over 100 people died before the strike finally collapsed several weeks after it had begun.
the great railroad strike was americas first major national labor conflict.
the knights of labor in the first major effort to create a genuinely national labor organization the noble order of the knights of labor was founded in 1869 under the leadership of uriah s stephens.
membership was open to all who toiled a definition that included all workers most business and professional people and virtually all women whether they worked in factories as domestic servants or in their own homes.
only lawyers bankers liquor dealers and professional gamblers were excluded.
the knights of labor championed an eight hour workday and the abolition of child labor but they were more interested in long range reform of the economy.
the knights hoped to replace the wage system with a new cooperative system in which workers would themselves control their workplaces.
for several years the knights remained a secret fraternal organization.
but in the late 1870s under the leadership of terence v powderly the order moved into the open and entered a period of spectacular expansion.
by 1886 it claimed a total membership of over 700 000.
local unions or assemblies associated with the knights launched a series of railroad and other strikes in the 1880s in defiance of powderlys wishes.
their failures to win any meaningful concessions helped discredit the organization.
by 1890 membership of the knights had shrunk to 100 000.
a few years later the organization disappeared altogether.
the american federation of labor even before the knights began to decline a rival association appeared.
in 1881 representatives of a number of craft unions formed the federation of organized trade and labor unions of the united states and canada.
five years later this body took the name it has borne ever since the american federation of labor afl.
rejecting the knights idea of one big union for everybody the federation was an association of essentially autonomous craft unions that represented mainly skilled workers.
samuel gompers samuel gompers the powerful leader of the afl concentrated on labors immediate objectives wages hours and working conditions.
as one of its first objectives the afl demanded a national eight hour workday and called for a general strike if the industrial supremacy 423 goal was not achieved by may 1 1886.
on that day strikes and demonstrations for a shorter workday took place all over the country.
in chicago a center of labor and radical strength a strike was already in progress at the mccormick harvester company.
city police had been harassing the strikers and labor and radical leaders called a protest meeting at haymarket square on may 1.
haymarket bombing when the police ordered the crowd to disperse someone threw a bomb that killed seven policemen and injured sixty seven others.
the police who had killed four strikers the day before fired into the crowd and killed four more people.
conservative property conscious americans frightened and outraged demanded retribution.
chicago officials finally rounded up eight anarchists and charged them with murder on the grounds that their statements had incited whoever had hurled the bomb.
all eight scapegoats were found guilty after a remarkably injudicious trial.
seven were sentenced to death.
one of them committed suicide four were executed and two had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.
to most middle class americans the haymarket bombing was an alarming symbol of social chaos and radicalism.
anarchism now became in the public mind a code word for terrorism and violence even though most anarchists were relatively peaceful.
for the next thirty years the specter of anarchism remained one of the most frightening concepts in the american imagination.
business owners exploited it to smear labor leaders and disrupt their activities.
it became a constant obstacle to the goals of the afl and other labor organizations and it did particular damage to the knights of labor.
however much they tried to distance themselves from radicals labor leaders were always vulnerable to accusations of anarchism as the violent strikes of the 1890s occasionally illustrated.
the homestead strike the amalgamated association of iron and steel workers was the most powerful trade union in the country in the late 1800s.
its members were skilled workers in great demand by employers and they had long been able to exercise significant power in the workplace.
in the mid 1880s however demand for skilled workers declined as new production methods changed the steelmaking process.
in the streamlined carnegie system which was coming to dominate the steel industry the union was able to maintain a foothold in only one of the corporations three major factories the homestead plant near pittsburgh.
by 1890 carnegie and his chief lieutenant henry clay frick had decided that the amalgamated had to go over the next two years they repeatedly cut wages at homestead.
at first the union acquiesced aware that it was not strong enough to wage a successful strike.
but in 1892 when the company stopped even discussing its decisions with the union and gave it two days to accept another wage cut the amalgamated called for a strike.
frick abruptly shut down the plant and called in 300 guards from the pinkerton detective agency well known as strikebreakers to enable the company to hire pinkertons nonunion workers.
they approached the plant by river on barges on july 6 1892.
the strikers poured gasoline on the water set it on fire and then met the pinkertons at the docks with guns and dynamite.
after several hours of fighting which killed three guards and ten strikers and injured many others the pinkertons surrendered and were escorted roughly out of town.
but the workers victory was temporary.
the governor of pennsylvania at the companys request sent the states entire national guard contingent some 8 000 men to 424 chapter 17 homestead.
production resumed with strikebreakers now protected by troops.
and public opinion turned against the strikers when a radical made an attempt to assassinate frick.
slowly workers drifted back to their jobs and finally four months after the strike began the amalgamated surrendered.
by 1900 every major steel plant in the northeast had broken with the amalgamated.
its membership shrank from a high of 24 000 in 1891 two thirds of all eligible steelworkers to fewer than 7 000 a decade later.
the pullman strike a dispute of greater magnitude if less violence was the pullman strike in 1894.
the pullman palace car company manufactured railroad sleeping and parlor cars at a plant near chicago.
there the company constructed a 600 acre town pullman and rented its trim orderly houses to the employees.
george m pullman owner of the company saw the town as a model a solution to the problems of industrial workers.
but many residents chafed at the regimentation and the high rents.
in the winter of 1893 1894 the pullman company slashed wages by about 25 percent citing its own declining revenues in the depression without reducing the rent it charged its employees.
workers went on strike and persuaded the militant american railway union led by eugene v debs to support eugene v debs and the railway union them by refusing to handle pullman cars and equipment.
within a few days thousands of railroad workers in twenty seven states and territories were on strike and transportation from chicago to the pacific coast shut down.
unlike most elected politicians the governor of illinois john peter altgeld was a man with demonstrated sympathies for workers and their grievances.
he refused to call out the militia to protect employers.
infuriated railroad operators bypassed altgeld and asked the federal government to send regular army troops to illinois using the pretext that the strike was preventing the movement of mail on the trains.
in july 1894 president grover cleveland ordered 2 000 troops to the chicago area.
a federal court issued an injunction forbidding the union to continue the strike.
when debs and his associates defied it they were arrested and imprisoned.
with federal troops protecting the hiring of new workers and with the union leaders in a federal jail the strike quickly collapsed.
sources of labor weakness in the last decades of the nineteenth century labor made few real gains despite militant organizing efforts.
industrial wages rose hardly at all.
to be sure labor leaders won a few legislative victories the abolition of the contract labor law the establishment of an eight hour day for government employees compensation for some workers injured on the job and others.
but many such laws were not enforced.
widespread strikes and protests and many other working class forms of resistance large and small led to few enduring gains.
the end of the century found most workers with less political power and less control of the workplace than they had had forty years before.
workers failed to make greater gains for many reasons.
the principal labor organizations represented only a small percentage of the industrial workforce the afl the most important blatantly excluded unskilled workers and most women blacks and recent immigrants.
divisions within the workforce such as tensions among different ethnic and racial groups contributed further to union weakness.
another source of labor weakness was the shifting nature of the workforce.
many immigrant workers came to america intending to earn some money and then return home.
industrial supremacy 425 the assumption that they had no long range future in the country tamed their enthusiasm to organize.
other workers were in constant motion moving from one job to another one town to another seldom in a single place long enough to establish any institutional ties or exert any real power.
above all perhaps workers made few gains in the late nineteenth century because they faced corporate organizations of vast wealth and power which were generally determined to crush any efforts by workers to challenge their prerogatives.
and as the homestead and pullman strikes suggest the corporations usually had the support of local state and federal authorities who were willing to send in troops to preserve order and crush labor uprisings on demand.
despite the creation of new labor unions and a wave of strikes and protests workers in the late nineteenth century failed on the whole to create successful organizations or to protect their interests.
in the battle for power within the emerging industrial economy almost all the advantages seemed to lie with capital.
conclusion in the four decades after the civil war the united states propelled itself into the forefront of the industrializing nations of the world.
large areas of the nation remained overwhelmingly rural to be sure.
but even so americas economy and along with it the nations society and culture was being profoundly transformed.
new technologies new forms of corporate management and new supplies of labor helped make possible the rapid growth of the nations industries and the construction of its railroads.
the factory system contributed to the growth of the nations cities.
immigration provided a steady supply of new workers for the growing industrial economy.
the result was a steady increase in national wealth rising living standards for much of the population and the creation of great new fortunes.
but industrialization did not spread its fruits evenly.
large areas of the country most notably the south and large groups in the population most notably minorities women and recent immigrants profited relatively little from economic growth.
industrial workers experienced arduous conditions of labor.
small merchants and manufacturers found themselves overmatched by great new combinations.
industrialists strove to create a rationale for their power and to persuade the public that everyone had something to gain from it.
but many americans remained skeptical of modern capitalism and some workers struggling to form unions reformers denouncing trusts socialists envisioning a new world and many others created broad and powerful critiques of the new economic order.
industrialization brought both progress and pain to late nineteenth century america.
controversies over its effects defined the era and would continue to define the first decades of the twentieth century.

the face of american society was transformed in countless ways by the growth of industry and commerce.
but no change was more profound than the growing size and influence of cities.
having begun its life as a primarily agrarian republic the united states in the late nineteenth century was becoming an urban nation.

the urban population increased sevenfold in the half century after the civil war.
and in 1920 the census revealed that for the first time a majority of the american people lived in urban areas defined as communities of 2 500 people or more.
natural increase accounted for only a small part of the urban growth.
families in cities experienced a high rate of infant mortality a declining fertility rate and a high death rate from disease.
it was immigration rather that expanded the urban population so dramatically.
the migrations in the late nineteenth century americans left the declining agricultural regions of the east at a dramatic rate.
some moved to the newly developing farmlands of the west.
but almost as many moved to the growing cities of the east and the midwest.
among those leaving rural america for industrial cities in the 1880s were black men and women trying to escape the poverty debt violence and oppression they faced in the rural south.
they were also seeking new opportunities in cities.
factory jobs for african americans were rare and professional opportunities almost nonexistent.
urban blacks tended to work in service occupations as cooks janitors domestic servants and so on.
because many such jobs were considered womens work black women often outnumbered black men in the cities.
the most important source of urban population growth however was the great number of new immigrants from abroad part of a larger pattern of mobility around the age of the city 429 the world.
see america in the world global migrations some came from canada latin america and particularly on the west coast china and japan.
but the greatest number came from europe.
after 1880 the flow of new arrivals began to include large numbers of people from southern and eastern europe.
by the 1890s more than half of all immigrants came from these regions.
in earlier years most new immigrants from europe particularly germans and scandinavians had arrived with at least some money and education.
most of them arrived at one of the major port cities on the atlantic coast the greatest number landing at new yorks immigrant depot at castle garden and then headed west.
but the new immigrants of the late nineteenth century generally lacked the capital to buy farmland and lacked the education to establish themselves in professions.
so like similarly poor irish immigrants before the civil war they settled overwhelmingly in industrial cities where they worked largely in unskilled jobs.
the ethnic city by 1890 most of the population of the major cities consisted of immigrants 87 percent of the population in chicago 80 percent in new york 84 percent in milwaukee and 2 98 total immigration during five year periods in millions 2 27 2 12 1 73 1 56 1 51 1 09 80 1861 1866 1871 1876 1881 1886 1891 1896 1865 1870 1875 1880 1885 1890 1895 1900 year over 10 million immigrants from abroad entered the united states in the last forty years of the nineteenth century with particularly high numbers arriving in the 1880s and 1890s.

total immigration 1861 1900.
354 chapter 15 as it became known helped feed clothe educate and provide medical care for ex slaves.
it also settled land disputes and set labor contracts between freedmen and white property owners.
headed by general oliver o howard the freedmans bureau operated on a shoestring budget with fewer than 1 000 agents some of whom were corrupt yet it still emerged as a key federal institution shaping black and white life in the south after the war.
the freedmens bureau for a while at least also supported the redistribution of land overseeing the allocation of 850 000 acres of confiscated land to former slaves.
general howard instructed his agents in his famous circular 13 to lease the land in 40 acre plots to former slaves with the intention of eventually selling it to them.
a small number of freedmen land redistribution purchased land outright under the southern homestead act of 1866 that howard had championed the act made 46 million acres of public land for sale in 160 acre plots in alabama arkansas florida louisiana and mississippi.
the law was repealed before many ex slaves were able to take advantage of it.
some of howards officials and other army personnel secured mules for freed people as well fulfilling the common wisdom that 40 acres and a mule were the building block of any stable household.
the bureau also settled land disputes and set labor contracts between freedmen and white property owners.
plans for reconstruction political control of reconstruction rested in the hands of the republicans who were deeply divided in their approach to the issue.
conservatives within the party insisted that the south accept abolition but they proposed few other conditions for the readmission of the radical republicans the seceded states.
the radicals led by representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania and senator charles sumner of massachusetts urged a much harsher course including disenfranchising large numbers of southern whites protecting black civil rights confiscating the property of wealthy whites who had aided the confederacy and distributing the land among the freedmen.
republican moderates rejected the most stringent demands of the radicals but supported extracting at least some concessions from the south on black rights.
president lincoln favored a lenient reconstruction policy believing that southern unionists mostly former whigs could become the nucleus of new loyal state governments in the south.
lincoln announced his reconstruction plan in december 1863 more than a year before the war ended.
it offered a general amnesty to white southerners other than high officials of the confederacy who would pledge an oath of loyalty to the government and accept the abolition of slavery.
when 10 percent of a states total number of voters in 1860 took the oath those loyal voters could set up a state government.
lincoln also proposed extending suffrage to african americans who were educated owned property or had served in the union army.
three southern states louisiana arkansas and tennessee all under union occupation reestablished loyal governments under the lincoln formula in 1864.
outraged at the mildness of lincolns program the radical republicans refused to admit representatives from the three reconstructed states to congress.
in july 1864 they wade davis bill pushed their own plan through congress the wade davis bill.
named for senator benjamin wade of ohio and representative henry davis of maryland it called for the president to appoint a provisional governor for each conquered state.
when a majority of the white males of a state pledged their allegiance to the union the governor could summon a state constitutional convention whose delegates were to be elected by voters who had never borne arms against the united states.
the new state constitutions reconstruction and the new south 355 would be required to abolish slavery disenfranchise confederate civil and military leaders and repudiate debts accumulated by the state governments during the war.
only then would congress readmit the states to the union.
like the presidents proposal the wadedavis bill left the question of political rights for blacks up to the states.
congress passed the bill a few days before it adjourned in 1864 but lincoln disposed of it with a pocket veto that enraged the radical leaders forcing the pragmatic lincoln to recognize he would have to accept at least some of the radical demands.
the debate between congress and lincoln over the proper course of reconstruction and its purpose and objectives was one that scholars would soon pick up.
indeed beginning in the latter stages of reconstruction historians struggled to make sense of its meaning to america.
they continue to do so today.
see debating the past reconstruction the death of lincoln what plan the president might have produced no one can say.
on the night of april 14 1865 lincoln and his wife attended a play at fords theater in lincolns assassination washington.
john wilkes booth an actor fervently committed to the southern cause entered the presidential box from the rear and shot lincoln in the head.
early the next morning the president died.

the library of congress debating the past reconstruction debate over the nature of reconstruction has been unusually intense.
indeed few issues in american history have raised such deep and enduring passions.
beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing well into the twentieth a relatively uniform and highly critical view of reconstruction prevailed among historians.
william a dunnings reconstruction political and economic 1907 was the principal scholarly expression of this view.
dunning portrayed reconstruction as a corrupt and oppressive outrage imposed on a prostrate south by a vindictive group of northern republican radicals.
unscrupulous carpetbaggers flooded the south and plundered the region.
ignorant and unfit african americans were thrust into political offices.
reconstruction governments were awash in corruption and compiled enormous levels of debt.
the dunning interpretation dominated several generations of historical scholarship and helped shape such popular images of reconstruction as those in the novel and film gone with the wind.
du bois the great african american scholar offered one of the first alternative views in black reconstruction 1935.
to du bois reconstruction was an effort by freed blacks and their white allies to create a more democratic society in the south and it was responsible for many valuable social innovations.
in the early 1960s john hope franklin and kenneth stampp building on a generation of work by other scholars published new histories of reconstruction that also radically revised the dunning interpretation.
reconstruction they argued was a genuine if inadequate effort to solve the problem of race in the south.
congressional radicals were not saints but they were genuinely concerned with protecting the rights of former slaves.
reconstruction had brought important if temporary progress to the south and had created no more corruption there than was evident african american students and teachers stand outside a school for former slaves one of many run by the freedmens bureau throughout the defeated confederacy in the first years after the war.
corbis a freedmens bureau school 356 in the north at the same time.
what was tragic about reconstruction the revisionists claimed was not what it did to southern whites but what it failed to do for southern blacks.
it was in the end too weak and too short lived to guarantee african americans genuine equality.
in more recent years some historians have begun to question the assessment of the first revisionists that in the end reconstruction accomplished relatively little.
leon litwack argued in been in the storm so long 1979 that former slaves used the protections reconstruction offered them to carve out a certain level of independence for themselves within southern society strengthening churches reuniting families and resisting the efforts of white planters to revive the gang labor system.
eric foners reconstruction americas unfinished revolution 1988 and forever free 2005 also emphasized how far african americans moved toward freedom and independence in a short time and how important they were in shaping the execution of reconstruction policies.
reconstruction he argues can only be judged a failure as an effort to secure blacks rights as citizens and free laborers but it closed off even more oppressive alternatives.
the post reconstruction labor system embodied neither a return to the closely supervised gang labor of antebellum days nor the complete dispossession and immobilization of the black labor force and coercive apprenticeship systems envisioned by white southerners in 1865 and 1866.
the doors of economic opportunity that had opened could never be completely closed understand analyze evaluate 1.
what are the popular interpretations of reconstruction today.
do romanticized ideals of a benighted old south as seen in gone with the wind still persist.
a new view of reconstruction began to emerge in the 1960s the end of the civil rights movement.
why do you think the civil rights movement might have encouraged historians and others to reexamine reconstruction.
the circumstances of lincolns death earned him immediate martyrdom.
they also produced something close to hysteria throughout the north especially because it quickly became clear that booth had been the leader of a conspiracy.
one of his associates shot and wounded secretary of state william h seward on the night of the assassination and another abandoned at the last moment a plan to murder vice president andrew johnson.
booth himself escaped on horseback into the maryland countryside where on april 26 he was cornered by union troops and shot to death in a blazing barn.
eight other people were convicted by a military tribunal of participating in the conspiracy.
four were hanged.
to many northerners however the murder of the president seemed evidence of an even darker conspiracy one masterminded and directed by the unrepentant leaders of the defeated south to challenge the very authority of the nations elected officials.
militant republicans exploited such suspicions relentlessly in the ensuing months.
johnson and restoration leadership of the moderates and conservatives fell immediately to lincolns successor andrew johnson of tennessee.
a democrat until he had joined the union ticket in 1864 he became president at a time of growing partisan passions.
357 358 chapter 15 johnson revealed his plan for reconstruction or restoration as he preferred to call it soon after he took office and implemented it during the summer of 1865 when congress was in recess.
like lincoln he offered some form of amnesty to southerners who would take an oath of allegiance.
in most other respects however his plan resembled the wade davis bill.
the new president appointed a provisional governor in each state and charged him with inviting qualified voters to elect delegates to a constitutional convention.
to win readmission to congress a state had to revoke its ordinance of secession abolish slavery and ratify the thirteenth amendment and repudiate confederate and state war debts.
by the end of 1865 all the seceded states had formed new governments some under lincolns plan others under johnsons and awaited congressional approval of them.
but radicals in congress vowed not to recognize the johnson governments for by now northern opinion had become more hostile toward the south.
delegates to the southern conventions had angered much of the north by their apparent reluctance to abolish slavery and by their refusal to grant suffrage to any blacks.
southern states had also seemed to defy the north by electing prominent confederate leaders to represent them in congress such as alexander stephens of georgia the former vice president of the confederacy.
johnsons reconstruction plan radical reconstruction reconstruction under johnsons plan often known as presidential reconstruction continued only until congress reconvened in december 1865.
at that point congress refused to seat the representatives of the restored states and created a new joint committee on reconstruction to frame a policy of its own.
the period of congressional or radical reconstruction had begun.
the black codes meanwhile events in the south were driving northern opinion in still more radical directions.
throughout the south in 1865 and early 1866 state legislatures enacted sets of laws known as the black codes which authorized local officials to apprehend unemployed blacks fine them for vagrancy and hire them out to private employers to satisfy the fines.
some codes forbade blacks to own or lease farms or to take any jobs other than as plantation workers or domestic servants jobs formerly held by slaves.
former slaves raised an alarm immediately and called for swift intervention by the federal troops and for new legislation to protect them.
see consider the source southern blacks ask for help congress first responded to the black codes by passing an act extending the life and expanding the powers of the freedmens bureau so that it could nullify work agreements forced on freedmen under the black codes.
then in april 1866 congress passed the first johnsons vetoes civil rights act which declared blacks to be fully fledged citizens of the united states and gave the federal government power to intervene in state affairs to protect the rights of citizens.
johnson vetoed both bills but congress overrode him on each of them.
the fourteenth amendment in april 1866 the joint committee on reconstruction proposed the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.
congress approved it in early summer and sent it to the states for ratification.
it offered the first constitutional definition of american citizenship.
everyone reconstruction and the new south 359 born in the united states and everyone naturalized was automatically a citizen and entitled to all the privileges and immunities guaranteed by citizenship for african americans the constitution including equal protection of the laws by both the state and national governments.
there could be no other requirements for citizenship.
the amendment also imposed penalties on states that denied suffrage to any adult male inhabitants.
supporters of woman suffrage were dismayed by the addition of the word male to the amendment.
finally it prohibited former members of congress or other former federal officials who had aided the confederacy from holding any state or federal office unless two thirds of congress voted to pardon them.
congressional radicals offered to readmit to the union any state whose legislature ratified the fourteenth amendment.
only tennessee did so.
all the other former confederate states along with delaware and kentucky refused leaving the amendment temporarily without the necessary approval of three fourths of the states.
but by now the radicals were growing more confident and determined.
bloody race riots in new orleans and other southern cities were among the events that strengthened their hand.
in the 1866 congressional elections johnson actively campaigned for conservative candidates but he did his own cause more harm than good with his intemperate speeches.
the voters returned an overwhelming majority of republicans most of them radicals to congress.
in the senate there were now 42 republicans to 11 democrats in the house 143 republicans to 49 democrats.
congressional republicans were now strong enough to enact a plan of their own even over the presidents objections.
the congressional plan the radicals passed three reconstruction bills early in 1867 and overrode johnsons vetoes of all of them.
these bills finally established nearly two years after the end of the war a coherent plan for reconstruction.
under the congressional plan tennessee which had ratified the fourteenth amendment was promptly readmitted.
but congress rejected the lincoln johnson governments of the other ten confederate states and instead combined those states into five military districts.
a military commander governed each district and had orders to register qualified voters defined as all adult black males and those white males who had not participated in the rebellion.
once registered voters would elect conventions to prepare new state constitutions which had to include provisions for black suffrage.
once voters ratified the new constitutions they could elect state governments.
congress had to approve a states constitution and the state legislature had to ratify the fourteenth amendment.
once enough states ratified the amendment to make it part of the constitution the former confederate states could be restored to the union.
by 1868 seven of the ten remaining former confederate states had fulfilled these conditions and were readmitted to the union.
conservative whites held up the return of virginia and texas until 1869 and mississippi until 1870.
by then congress had added an additional requirement for readmission ratification of another fifteenth amendment constitutional amendment the fifteenth which forbade the states and the federal government to deny suffrage to any citizen on account of race color or previous condition of servitude ratification by the states was completed in 1870.
to stop johnson from interfering with their plans the congressional radicals passed two remarkable laws of dubious constitutionality in 1867.
one the tenure of office act co ns ider t he s o urc e southern blacks ask for help 1865 even before the war ended groups of former slaves gathered in conventions to petition the federal government for steady support for black civil rights including the use of the u s army to subdue unrepentant ex confederates.
in this example african americans from virginia publicly air their hopes and fears only three months after appomattox.
we the undersigned members of a convention of colored citizens of the state of virginia would respectfully represent that although we have been held as slaves and denied all recognition as a constituent of your nationality for almost the entire period of the duration of your government and that by your permission we have been denied either home or country and deprived of the dearest rights of human nature yet when you and our immediate oppressors met in deadly conflict upon the field of battle the one to destroy and the other to save your government and nationality we with scarce an exception in our inmost souls espoused your cause and watched and prayed and waited and labored for your success.
when the contest waxed long and the result hung doubtfully you appealed to us for help and how well we answered is written in the rosters of the two hundred thousand colored troops now enrolled in your service and as to our undying devotion to your cause let the uniform acclamation of escaped prisoners whenever we saw a black face we felt sure of a friend answer.
well the war is over the rebellion is put down and we are declared free.
four fifths of our enemies are paroled or amnestied and the other fifth are being pardoned and the president has in his efforts at the reconstruction of the civil government of the 360 states late in rebellion left us entirely at the mercy of these subjugated but unconverted rebels in everything save the privilege of bringing us our wives and little ones to the auction block.
we know these men know them well and we assure you that with the majority of them loyalty is only lip deep and that their professions of loyalty are used as a cover to the cherished design of getting restored to their former relations with the federal government and then by all sorts of unfriendly legislation to render the freedom you have given us more intolerable than the slavery they intended for us.
we warn you in time that our only safety is in keeping them under governors of the military persuasion until you have so amended the federal constitution that it will prohibit the states from making any distinction between citizens on account of race or color.
in one word the only salvation for us besides the power of the government is in the possession of the ballot.
give us this and we will protect ourselves.
but tis said we are ignorant.
yet who denies we know a traitor from a loyal man a gentleman from a rowdy a friend from an enemy.
all we ask is an equal chance with the white traitors varnished and japanned with the oath of amnesty.
can you deny us this and still keep faith with us.
we are sheep in the midst of wolves and nothing but the military arm of the government prevents us and all the truly loyal white men from being driven from the land of our birth.
do not then we beseech you give to one of these wayward sisters the rights they abandoned and forfeited when they rebelled until you have secured our rights by the aforementioned amendment to the constitution.

361 362 chapter 15 the congressional radicals also took action to stop the supreme court from interfering with their plans.
in 1866 the court had declared in the case of ex parte milligan that military tribunals were unconstitutional in places where civil courts were functioning.
radicals in congress immediately proposed several bills that would require two thirds of the justices to support any decision overruling a law of congress would deny the court jurisdiction in reconstruction cases would reduce its membership to three and would even abolish it.
the justices apparently took notice.
over the next two years the court refused to accept jurisdiction in any cases involving reconstruction.
the impeachment of andrew johnson president johnson had long since ceased to be a serious obstacle to the passage of radical legislation but he was still the official charged with administering the reconstruction programs.
as such the radicals believed he remained a major impediment to their plans.
early in 1867 they began looking for a way to remove him from office and a search for grounds for impeachment began.
republicans found it they believed when johnson dismissed secretary of war stanton despite congresss refusal to agree.
elated radicals in the house quickly impeached the president and sent the case to the senate for trial.
the trial lasted throughout april and may 1868.
the radicals put heavy pressure on all the republican senators but the moderates vacillated.
on the first three charges to johnson acquitted come to a vote seven republicans joined the democrats and independents to support acquittal.
the vote was 35 to 19 one vote short of the constitutionally required two thirds majority.
after that the radicals dropped the impeachment effort.
the south in reconstruction reconstruction may not have immediately accomplished what its framers intended but it did have profound effects on the south.
the reconstruction governments critics labeled southern white republicans with the derogatory terms scalawags and carpetbaggers.
many of the scalawags were former whigs who had never felt comfortable in the democratic party or farmers who lived in remote areas where there had been little or no slavery.
the carpetbaggers were white men from the north most of them veterans of the union army who looked on the south as a more promising frontier than the west and had settled there at wars end as hopeful planters businessmen or professionals.
the most numerous republicans in the south were the black freedmen few of whom had any previous experience in politics.
they tried to build institutions through which they could learn to exercise their power.
in several states african american voters held their own conventions to chart their future course.
their newfound religious independence from white churches also helped give them unity and self confidence.
african americans played significant roles in the politics of the reconstruction south.
they served as delegates to the constitutional conventions and held public scalawags and carpetbaggers reconstruction and the new south 363 this reconstruction era cartoon expresses the view held by southern white democrats that they were being oppressed by northern republicans.
president grant whose hat bears abraham lincolns initials rides in comfort in a giant carpetbag guarded by bayonet wielding soldiers as the south staggers under the burden in chains.
evidence of military occupation is in the scarred background.
granger nyc all rights reserved.
critics view of reconstruction offices of practically every kind.
between 1869 and 1901 twenty blacks served in the united states house of representatives two in the senate.
blacks served too in state legislatures and in various other state offices.
southern whites freedmen in politics complained loudly about negro rule but in the south as a whole the percentage of black officeholders was small and always far lower than the percentage of blacks in the population.
the record of the reconstruction governments is mixed.
critics at the time and later denounced them for corruption and financial extravagance and there is some truth to both charges.
but the corruption in the south real as it was was hardly unique to the reconstruction governments.
corruption had been rife in some antebellum and confederate governments and it was at least as rampant in the northern states.
and the large state expenditures of the reconstruction years were huge only in comparison with the meager budgets of the antebellum era.
they represented an effort to provide the south with desperately needed services that antebellum governments had never provided.
364 chapter 15 education perhaps the most important accomplishment of the reconstruction governments was a dramatic improvement in southern education.
much of the impetus for educational reform in the south came from outside groups the freedmens bureau northern private philanthropic organizations the many northern white women who traveled to the south to teach in freedmens schools and from african americans themselves.
over the opposition of many southern whites who feared that education would give blacks false notions of equality these reformers established a large network of schools for former slaves 4 000 schools by 1870 staffed by 9 000 teachers half of them black teaching 200 000 students.
in the 1870s reconstruction governments began to build a comprehensive public school system.
by 1876 more than half of all white children and about 40 percent of all black children were attending schools in the south although almost all such schools were racially segregated.
several black academies offering more advanced education also began operating.
gradually these academies grew into an important network of black colleges and universities.
landownership and tenancy the most ambitious goal of the freedmens bureau and of some republican radicals in congress was to reform landownership in the south.
the effort failed.
by june 1865 the bureau had settled nearly 10 000 black families on their own land most of it drawn from abandoned plantations in areas occupied by the union armies.
by the end of that year however southern plantation owners were returning and demanding the restoration of their property.
president johnson supported their demands and the government eventually returned most of the confiscated lands to their original white owners.
even so the distribution of landownership in the south changed considerably in the postwar years.
among whites there was a striking decline in landownership from 80 percent before the war to 67 percent by the end of reconstruction.
some whites lost their land because of unpaid debt or increased taxes others left the marginal lands they had owned to move to more fertile areas where they rented.
among blacks during the same period the proportion of landowners rose from virtually none to more than 20 percent.
still most blacks and a growing minority of whites did not own their own land during reconstruction and instead worked for others in one form or another.
many black agricultural laborers perhaps 25 percent of the total simply worked for wages.
most however became tenants of white landowners that is they worked their own plots of land and paid their landlords either a fixed rent or a share of their crops hence the term sharecropping.
as tenants and sharecroppers blacks enjoyed at least a physical independence from their landlords and had the sense of working their own land even if in most cases they could never hope to buy it.
but tenantry also benefited landlords in some ways relieving them of the cost of purchasing slaves and of responsibility for the physical well being of their workers.
land reform thwarted incomes and credit in some respects the postwar years were a period of remarkable economic progress for african americans in the south.
the per capita income of blacks when the material reconstruction and the new south 365 benefits of slavery are counted as income rose 46 percent between 1857 and 1879 while the per capita income of whites declined 35 percent.
african americans were also able to work less than they had under slavery.
women and children were less likely to labor in the fields and adult men tended to work shorter days.
in all the black labor force worked about one third fewer hours during reconstruction than it had been compelled to work under slavery a reduction that brought the working schedule of blacks roughly into accord with that of white farm laborers.
but other developments limited these gains.
while the black share of profits was increasing the total profits of southern agriculture were declining.
nor did the income redistribution of the postwar years lift many blacks out of poverty.
persistent black poverty black per capita income rose from about one quarter of white per capita income which was itself low to about one half in the first few years after the war.
after this initial increase however it rose hardly at all.
blacks and poor whites alike found themselves virtually imprisoned by the crop lien system.
few of the traditional institutions of credit in the south the the crop lien system factors and banks returned after the war.
in their stead emerged a new credit system centered in large part on local country stores some of them owned by planters others owned by independent merchants.
blacks and whites landowners and tenants all depended on these stores.
and since farmers did not have the same steady cash flow as other workers customers usually had to rely on credit from these merchants to purchase what they needed.
most local stores had no competition and thus could set interest rates as high as 50 or 60 percent.
farmers had to give the merchants a lien or claim on their crops as collateral for the loans thus the term crop lien system.
farmers who suffered a few bad years in a row as many did could become trapped in a cycle of debt from which they could never escape.
as a result of this burdensome credit system some blacks who had acquired land during the early years of reconstruction and many poor whites who had owned land for years gradually lost it as they fell into debt.
southern farmers also became almost wholly dependent on cash crops and most of all on cotton because only such marketable commodities seemed to offer any possibility of escape from debt.
the relentless planting of cotton ultimately contributed to soil exhaustion which undermined the southern agricultural economy over time.
the african american family in freedom a major reason for the rapid departure of so many blacks from plantations was the desire to find lost relatives and reunite families.
thousands of african americans families reunited wandered through the south looking for husbands wives children or other relatives from whom they had been separated.
former slaves rushed to have their marriages previously without legal standing sanctified by church and law.
within the black family the definition of male and female roles quickly came to resemble that within white families.
many women and children at first ceased working in the fields.
such work they believed was a badge of slavery.
instead many women restricted themselves largely to domestic tasks.
still economic necessity often compelled black women to engage in income producing activities working as domestic servants taking in laundry even helping their husbands in the fields.
by the end of reconstruction half of all black women over the age of sixteen were working for wages.
366 chapter 15 laboring over laundry one of the most common occupations of women recently emancipated from slavery was taking in laundry from white families who no longer had enslaved servants.
this photograph illustrates how arduous a task laundry was.
the library of congress the grant administration american voters in 1868 yearned for a strong stable figure to guide them through the troubled years of reconstruction.
they turned trustingly to general ulysses s grant.
the soldier president grant could have had the nomination of either party in 1868.
but believing that republican reconstruction policies were more popular in the north he accepted the republican nomination.
the democrats nominated former governor horatio seymour of new york.
grant elected the campaign was a bitter one and grants triumph was surprisingly narrow.
without the 500 000 new black republican voters in the south he would have had a minority of the popular vote.
grant entered the white house with no political experience and his performance was clumsy and ineffectual from the start.
except for hamilton fish whom grant appointed secretary of state most members of the cabinet were ill equipped for their tasks.
grant relied chiefly on established party leaders the group most ardently devoted to patronage and his administration used the spoils system even more blatantly than most of its predecessors.
grant also alienated the many northerners who were growing disillusioned with the radical reconstruction policies which the president continued to support.
some reconstruction and the new south 367 republicans suspected correctly that there was also corruption in the grant administration itself.
by the end of grants first term therefore members of a substantial faction of the party who referred to themselves as liberal republicans had come to oppose what they called grantism in 1872 hoping to prevent grants reelection they bolted the party and nominated their own presidential candidate horace greeley opposition from liberal republicans veteran editor and publisher of the new york tribune.
the democrats somewhat reluctantly named greeley their candidate as well hoping that the alliance with the liberals would enable them to defeat grant.
but the effort was in vain.
grant won a substantial victory polling 286 electoral votes to greeleys 66.
the grant scandals during the 1872 campaign the first of a series of political scandals came to light that would plague grant and the republicans for the next four years.
it involved the frenchowned crdit mobilier construction company which had helped build the union pacific railroad.
the heads of crdit mobilier had used their positions as union pacific stockholders to steer large fraudulent contracts to their construction company thus bilking the union pacific of millions.
to prevent investigations the directors had given crdit mobilier stock to key members of congress.
but in 1872 congress conducted an investigation which revealed that some highly placed republicans including schuyler colfax now grants vice president had accepted stock.
one dreary episode followed another in grants second term.
benjamin h bristow grants third treasury secretary discovered that some of his officials and a group of distillers operating as a whiskey ring were cheating the government the whiskey ring out of taxes by filing false reports.
then a house investigation revealed that william w belknap secretary of war had accepted bribes to retain an indian post trader in office the so called indian ring.
other lesser scandals also added to the growing impression that grantism had brought rampant corruption to government.
the greenback question compounding grants problems was a financial crisis known as the panic of 1873.
it began with the failure of a leading investment banking firm jay cooke the panic of 1873 and company which had invested too heavily in postwar railroad building.
there had been panics before in 1819 1837 and 1857 but this was the worst one yet.
debtors now pressured the government to redeem federal war bonds with greenbacks which would increase the amount of money in circulation.
but grant and most republicans wanted a sound currency based solidly on gold reserves which would favor the interests of banks and other creditors.
there was approximately 356 million in paper currency issued during the civil war that was still in circulation.
in 1873 the treasury issued more in response to the panic.
but in 1875 republican leaders in congress passed the specie resumption act which provided that after january 1 1879 greenback dollars would be redeemed by the government and replaced with new certificates firmly pegged to the price of gold.
the law satisfied creditors who had worried that debts would be repaid in paper currency of uncertain value.
but resumption made things more difficult for debtors because the gold based money supply could not easily expand.
368 chapter 15 in 1875 the greenbackers formed their own political organization the national greenback party.
it failed to gain widespread support but the money issue was to remain one of the most controversial and enduring issues in late nineteenth century american politics.
national greenback party republican diplomacy the johnson and grant administrations achieved their greatest successes in foreign affairs as a result of the work not of the presidents themselves but of two outstanding secretaries of state william h seward and hamilton fish.
an ardent expansionist seward acted with as much daring as the demands of reconstruction politics and the republican hatred of president johnson would permit.
he accepted a russian offer to buy alaska for 7 2 million despite criticism from sewards purchase of alaska many who derided the purchase as sewards folly in 1867 seward also engineered the american annexation of the tiny midway islands west of hawaii.
hamilton fishs first major challenge was resolving the long standing controversy over the american claims that britain had violated neutrality laws during the civil war by permitting english shipyards to build ships among them the alabama for the confederacy.
american demands that england pay for the damage these vessels had caused became hamilton fish and the alabama claims known as the alabama claims in 1871 after a number of failed efforts fish forged an agreement the treaty of washington which provided for international arbitration.
the abandonment of reconstruction as the north grew increasingly preoccupied with its own political and economic problems interest in reconstruction began to wane.
by the time grant left office democrats had taken back seven of the governments of the former confederate states.
for three other states south carolina louisiana and florida the end of reconstruction had to wait for the withdrawal of the last federal troops in 1877.
the southern states redeemed in the states where whites constituted a majority the states of the upper south overthrowing republican control was relatively simple.
by 1872 all but a handful of southern whites had regained suffrage.
now a clear majority they needed only to organize and elect their candidates.
in other states where blacks were a majority or where the populations of the two races were almost equal whites used outright intimidation and violence to undermine the ku klux klan reconstruction regimes.
secret societies the ku klux klan the knights of the white camellia and others used terrorism to frighten or physically bar blacks from voting.
paramilitary organizations the red shirts and white leagues armed themselves to police elections and worked to force all white males to join the democratic party.
strongest of all however was the simple weapon of economic pressure.
some planters refused to rent land to republican blacks storekeepers refused to extend them credit employers refused to give them work.
reconstruction and the new south 369 the republican congress responded to this wave of repression with the enforcement acts of 1870 and 1871 better known as the ku klux klan acts which enforcement acts prohibited states from discriminating against voters on the basis of race and gave the national government the authority to prosecute crimes by individuals under federal law.
the laws also authorized the president to use federal troops to protect civil rights a provision president grant used in 1871 in nine counties of south carolina.
the enforcement acts although seldom enforced discouraged klan violence which declined by 1872.
waning northern commitment but this northern commitment to civil rights did not last long.
after the adoption of the fifteenth amendment in 1870 some reformers convinced themselves that their long campaign on behalf of black people was now over that with the flagging interest in civil rights vote blacks ought to be able to take care of themselves.
former radical leaders such as charles sumner and horace greeley now began calling themselves liberals cooperating with the democrats and even denouncing what they viewed as black and carpetbag misgovernment.
within the south itself many white republicans now moved into the democratic party as voters threw out republican politicians whom they blamed for the financial crisis.
the panic of 1873 further undermined support for reconstruction.
in the congressional elections of 1874 the democrats won control of the house of representatives for the first time since 1861.
to appeal to southern white voters grant even reduced the use of military force to prop up the republican regimes in the south.
the compromise of 1877 grant had hoped to run for another term in 1876 but most republican leaders shaken by recent democratic successes and scandals by the white house resisted.
instead they settled on rutherford b hayes three time governor of ohio and a champion of civil service reform.
the democrats united behind samuel j tilden the reform governor of new york who had been instrumental in overthrowing the corrupt tweed ring of new york citys tammany hall.
although the campaign was a bitter one few differences of principle distinguished the candidates from one another.
the election produced an apparent democratic victory.
tilden carried the south and several large northern states and his popular disputed election margin over hayes was nearly 300 000 votes.
but disputed returns from louisiana south carolina florida and oregon whose electoral votes totaled 20 threw the election in doubt.
hayes could still win if he managed to receive all 20 disputed votes.
the constitution had established no method to determine the validity of disputed returns.
the decision clearly lay with congress but it was not obvious with which house or through what method.
the senate was republican and the house was victory for hayes democratic.
members of each party naturally supported a solution that would yield them the victory.
finally late in january 1877 congress tried to break the deadlock by creating a special electoral commission composed of five senators five representatives and five justices of the supreme court.
the congressional delegation consisted of five republicans and five democrats.
the court delegation would include two republicans two democrats and the only independent justice david davis.
but when the illinois legislature elected davis to the united states senate the justice resigned from the 370 chapter 15 21 15 22 5 11 candidate party rutherford b hayes republican samuel j tilden democratic electoral vote popular vote 4 036 298 48 4 300 590 51 81 8 of electorate voting the election of 1876 the election of 1876 was one of the most controversial in american history.
as in the elections of 1824 1888 and 2000 the winner of the popular vote samuel j tilden was not the winner of the electoral vote which he lost by one vote.
the final decision as to who would be president was not made until the day before the official inauguration in march.
how did the republicans turn this apparent defeat into a victory.
c ommission.
his seat went instead to a republican justice.
the commission voted along straight party lines 8 to 7 awarding every disputed vote to hayes.
behind this seemingly partisan victory however lay a series of elaborate and sneaky compromises among leaders of both parties.
when a democratic filibuster threatened to derail the electoral commissions report republican senate leaders met secretly with southern democratic leaders.
as the price of their cooperation the southern democrats exacted several pledges from the republicans the appointment of at least one southerner to the hayes cabinet control of federal patronage in their areas generous internal improvements federal aid for the texas and pacific railroad and most important withdrawal of the remaining federal troops from the south.
in his inaugural address hayes announced that the souths most pressing need was the restoration of wise honest and peaceful local self government and he soon withdrew the troops and let white democrats take over the remaining southern state governments.
federal troops withdrawn that produced charges that he was paying off the south for acquiescing in his election charges that were not wholly untrue.
the outcome of the election created such bitterness that not even hayess promise to serve only one term could mollify his critics.
the president and his party hoped to build up a new republican organization in the south committed to modest support for black rights.
although many white southern leaders sympathized with republican economic policies resentment of reconstruction was so deep that supporting the party became politically impossible.
the solid democratic south which would survive until the mid twentieth century was taking shape.
reconstruction and the new south 371 the legacy of reconstruction reconstruction made important contributions to the efforts of former slaves to achieve dignity and equality in american life.
there was a significant redistribution of income and a more limited but not unimportant redistribution of landownership.
perhaps most important african americans themselves managed to carve out a society and culture of their own and to create or strengthen their own institutions.
reconstruction was not as disastrous for southern white elites as most believed at the time.
within little more than a decade after a devastating war the white south had regained control of its own institutions and to a great extent restored its traditional ruling class to power.
the federal government imposed no drastic economic reforms on the region and indeed few lasting political changes of any kind other than the abolition of slavery.
reconstruction was notable finally for its limitations.
for in those years the united states failed in its first serious effort to resolve its oldest and deepest social problem the problem of race.
the experience so disillusioned white americans that it would be nearly a century before they would try again to combat racial injustice.
given the odds confronting them however african americans had reason for considerable pride in the gains they were able to make during reconstruction.
and future generations would be grateful for the two great charters of freedom the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution which although widely ignored at the time would one day serve as the basis for a second reconstruction that would renew the drive to bring freedom to all americans.
the new south the compromise of 1877 was supposed to be the first step toward developing a stable permanent republican party in the south.
in that respect at least it failed.
in the years following the end of reconstruction white southerners established the democratic party as the only viable political organization for the regions whites.
even so the south did change in some of the ways the framers of the compromise had hoped.
the redeemers many white southerners rejoiced at the restoration of what they liked to call home rule but in reality political power in the region was soon more restricted than at home rule any time since the civil war.
once again most of the south fell under the control of a powerful conservative oligarchy whose members were known variously as the redeemers or the bourbons in some places this post reconstruction ruling class was much the same as the ruling class of the antebellum period.
in alabama for example the old planter elite retained much of its former power.
in other areas however the redeemers constituted a genuinely new ruling class of merchants industrialists railroad developers and financiers.
some of them were former planters some of them northern immigrants some of them ambitious upwardly mobile white southerners from the regions lower social tiers.
they combined a defense of home rule and social conservatism with a commitment to economic development.
372 chapter 15 the various bourbon governments of the new south behaved in many respects quite similarly.
virtually all the new democratic regimes lowered taxes reduced spending and drastically diminished state services.
one state after another eliminated or reduced its support for public school systems.
industrialization and the new south many white southern leaders in the post reconstruction era hoped to see their region develop a vigorous industrial economy a new south henry grady editor of the atlanta constitution and other new south advocates seldom challenged white supremacy but they did promote the virtues of thrift industry and progress qualities that prewar southerners had often denounced in northern society.
southern industry did expand dramatically in the years after reconstruction most visibly in textile manufacturing.
in the past southern planters had usually shipped their cotton to manufacturers in the north or in europe.
now textile factories appeared in the textiles tobacco and iron south itself many of them drawn to the region from new england by the abundance of water power the ready supply of cheap labor the low taxes and the accommodating conservative governments.
the tobacco processing industry similarly established an important foothold in the region.
in the lower south and particularly in birmingham alabama the iron and later steel industry grew rapidly.
railroad development also increased substantially in the post reconstruction years.
between 1880 and 1890 trackage in the south more than doubled.
and in 1886 the south changed the gauge width of its trackage to correspond with the standards of the north.
no longer would it be necessary for cargoes heading into the substantial railroad development south to be transferred from one train to another at the borders of the region.
yet southern industry developed within strict limits and its effects on the region were never even remotely comparable to the effects of industrialization on the north.
the southern share of national manufacturing doubled in the last twenty years of the century but it was still only 10 percent of the total.
similarly the regions per capita income increased 21 percent in the same period but average income in the south was still only 40 percent of that in the north in 1860 it had been more than 60 percent.
and even in those industries where development had been most rapid textiles iron railroads much of the capital had come from and many of the profits thus flowed to the north.
the growth of southern industry required the region to recruit a substantial industrial workforce for the first time.
from the beginning a high percentage of the factory workers were women.
heavy male casualties in the civil war had helped create a large population of unmarried women who desperately needed employment.
hours were long often as much as twelve hours a day and wages were far below the northern equivalent indeed one of the greatest attractions of the south to industrialists was that employers were able worker exploitation to pay workers there as little as one half of what northern workers received.
life in most mill towns was rigidly controlled by the owners and managers of the factories who rigorously suppressed attempts at protest or union organization.
company stores sold goods to workers at inflated prices and issued credit at exorbitant rates much as country stores did in agrarian areas and mill owners ensured that no competing merchants were able to establish themselves in the community.
some industries such as textiles offered virtually no opportunities to african american workers.
others tobacco iron and lumber for example did provide some employment reconstruction and the new south 373 southern counties percentage of farms sharecropped 35 80 26 34 20 25 13 19 0 12 300 mi 600 km commercial center urban cotton center rural cotton center the crop lien system in 1880 in the years after the civil war more and more southern farmers white and black became tenants or sharecroppers on land owned by others.
this map shows the percentage of farms that were within the so called crop lien system the system by which people worked their lands for someone else who had a claim or lien on a part of the farmers crops.
note the high density of sharecropping and tenant farming in the most fertile areas of the deep south the same areas where slaveholding had been most dominant before the civil war.
how did the crop lien system contribute to the shift in southern agriculture toward one crop farming.
for blacks.
some mill towns therefore were places where the black and white cultures came into close contact increasing the determination of white leaders to take additional measures to protect white supremacy.
tenants and sharecroppers the most important economic problem in the post reconstruction south was the impoverished state of agriculture.
the 1870s and 1880s saw an acceleration of growth of tenantry the process that had begun in the immediate postwar years the imposition of systems of tenantry and debt peonage on much of the region the reliance on a few cash crops rather than on a diversified agricultural system and increasing absentee ownership of valuable farmlands.
during reconstruction perhaps a third or more of the farmers in the south were tenants by 1900 the figure had increased to 70 percent.
african americans and the new south the new south creed was not the property of whites alone.
many african americans were attracted to the vision of progress and self improvement as well.
some former slaves and as the decades passed their offspring succeeded in elevating themselves into the middle class acquired property established small businesses or entered professions.
believing strongly that education was vital to the future of their people they expanded 374 chapter 15 the network of black colleges and institutes that had taken root during reconstruction into an important educational system.
the chief spokesman for this commitment to education was booker t washington booker t washington founder and president of the tuskegee institute in alabama.
born into slavery washington had worked his way out of poverty after acquiring an education at virginias hampton institute.
he urged other blacks to follow the same road to selfimprovement.
washingtons message was both cautious and hopeful.
african americans should attend school learn skills and establish a solid footing in agriculture and the trades.
industrial not classical education should be their goal.
blacks should moreover refine their speech improve their dress and adopt habits of thrift and personal cleanliness they should in short adopt the standards of the white middle class.
only thus washington claimed could they win the respect of the white population.
in a famous speech in georgia in 1895 washington outlined a controversial philosophy of atlanta compromise race relations that became widely known as the atlanta compromise.
blacks he said should forgo agitation for political rights and concentrate on self improvement and preparation for equality.
washington offered a powerful challenge to those whites who wanted to discourage african americans from acquiring an education or winning any e conomic gains.
but his message was also intended to assure whites that blacks would not challenge the emerging system of segregation.
the birth of jim crow few white southerners had ever accepted the idea of racial equality.
that the former slaves acquired any legal and political rights at all after emancipation was in large part the result of their own efforts and crucial federal support.
that outside support all but vanished after 1877 when federal troops withdrew and the supreme court stripped the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of much of their significance.
in the so called civil rights cases of 1883 the court ruled that the fourteenth amendment prohibited state governments from discriminating against people because of race but did not restrict private organizations or individuals from doing so.
popular culture reflected these frightening political developments.
the rise of minstrel shows slapstick dramatic representations of black culture typically embodied racist ideas.
corked up whites or whites using heavy makeup to appear black grossly caricatured african american culture as silly unintelligent sensual and immoral.
late in the 1800s however blacks founded their own minstrel shows in part to modify these stereotypes though with only modest success.
see patterns of popular culture the minstrel show eventually the court also validated state legislation that institutionalized the separaplessy v ferguson tion of the races.
in plessy v ferguson 1896 a case involving a louisiana law that required segregated seating on railroads the court held that separate accommodations did not deprive blacks of equal rights if the accommodations were equal.
in cumming v county board of education 1899 the court ruled that communities could establish schools for whites only even if there were no comparable schools for blacks.
even before these dubious decisions white southerners were working to separate the races to the greatest extent possible and were particularly determined to strip african americans of the right to vote.
in some states disenfranchisement had begun almost as soon as reconstruction ended.
but in other areas black voting continued for some time reconstruction and the new south 375 after reconstruction largely because conservative whites believed they could control the black electorate and use it to beat back the attempts of poor white farmers to take control of the democratic party.
in the 1890s however franchise restrictions became much more rigid.
during those years some small white farmers began to demand complete black black disenfranchisement disenfranchisement because they objected to the black vote being used against them by the bourbons.
at the same time many members of the conservative elite began to doubt their ability to influence black voters and fear that poor whites might unite politically with poor blacks to challenge them.
in devising laws to disenfranchise black males the southern states had to find ways to evade the fifteenth amendment which prohibited states from denying anyone the right to vote because of race.
two devices emerged before 1900 to accomplish this goal the poll tax or some form of property qualification few blacks were prosperous enough to meet such requirements and the literacy or understanding test which required voters to demonstrate an ability to read and to interpret the constitution.
even those african americans who could read had a hard time passing the difficult test white officials gave them which often required them to interpret an arcane part of the constitution to the satisfaction of a white elected official.
the laws affected poor white voters as well as blacks.
by the late 1890s the black vote had decreased by 62 percent the white vote by 26 percent.
laws restricting the franchise and segregating schools were only part of a network of state and local statutes collectively known as the jim crow laws that by jim crow laws the first years of the twentieth century had institutionalized an elaborate system of racial hierarchy reaching into almost every area of southern life.
blacks and whites could not ride together in the same railroad cars sit in the same waiting rooms use the same washrooms eat in the same restaurants or sit in the same theaters.
blacks had no access to many public parks beaches or picnic areas they could not be patients in many hospitals.
much of the new legal structure did no more than confirm what had already been widespread social practice in the south.
but the jim crow laws also stripped blacks of many of the modest social economic and political gains they had made in the late nineteenth century.
more than legal efforts were involved in this process.
the 1890s witnessed a dramatic increase in white violence against blacks which along with the jim crow laws served to inhibit black agitation for equal rights.
the worst such violence lynching of blacks by white mobs reached appalling levels.
in the nation as a whole in the 1890s there was an average of 187 lynchings each year more than 80 percent of them in the south.
the vast majority of victims were black.
those who participated in lynchings often saw their actions as a legitimate form of law enforcement and some victims of lynchings had in fact committed crimes.
but lynchings were also a means by which whites controlled the black population through terror and intimidation.
the rise of lynchings shocked the conscience of many white americans in a way that other forms of racial injustice did not.
in 1892 ida b.
wells a committed ida b.
wells black journalist published a series of impassioned articles after the lynching of three of her hometown friends in memphis tennessee her articles launched what became an international antilynching movement.
the movement gradually attracted substantial support from whites in both the north and the south particularly from white women.
its goal was a federal antilynching law which would allow the national government to do what state and local governments in the south were generally unwilling to do punish those responsible for lynchings.
patterns of popular culture the minstrel show the minstrel show was one of the most popular forms of entertainment in america in the second half of the nineteenth century.
it was also a testament to the high awareness of race and the high level of racism in american society both before and after the civil war.
minstrel performers were mostly white usually disguised as black.
but african american performers also formed their own minstrel shows and transformed them into vehicles for training black entertainers and developing new forms of music and dance.
before and during the civil war when minstrel shows consisted almost entirely of white performers performers blackened their faces with cork and presented grotesque stereotypes of the slave culture of the american south.
among the most popular of the stumbling ridiculously ignorant characters invented for these shows were such figures as zip coon and jim crow whose name later resurfaced as a label for late nineteenth century segregation laws.
a typical minstrel show presented a group of seventeen or more men seated in a semicircle facing the audience.
the man in the center ran the show played the straight man for the jokes of others and led the music lively minstrelsy at high tide the primrose west minstrel troupe a lavish and expensive entertainment that drew large crowds in the 1800s was one of many companies to offer this brand of entertainment to eager audiences all over the country.
although minstrelsy began with white musicians performing in blackface the popularity of real african american minstrels encouraged the impresarios of the troupe to include groups of white and black performers alike.
the library of congress 376 dances and sentimental ballads played on banjos castanets and other instruments and sung by soloists or the entire group.
after the civil war white minstrels began to expand their repertoire.
drawing from the famous and successful freak shows of p t barnum and other entertainment entrepreneurs some began to include siamese twins bearded ladies and even a supposedly 8 foot 2 inch chinese giant in their shows.
they also incorporated sex both by including women in some shows and even more popularly by recruiting female impersonators.
one of the most successful minstrel performers of the 1870s was francis leon who delighted crowds with his female portrayal of a flamboyant prima donna one reason white minstrels began to move in these new directions was that they were now facing competition from black performers who could provide more authentic versions of black music dance and humor.
they usually brought more talent to the task than white performers.
the georgia minstrels organized in 1865 was one of the first all black minstrel troupes and it had great success in attracting white audiences in the northeast for several years.
by the 1870s touring african american minstrel groups were numerous.
the black minstrels used many of the conventions of the white shows.
there were dances music comic routines and sentimental recitations.
some black performers even chalked their faces to make themselves look as dark as the white blackface performers with whom they were competing.
black minstrels sometimes denounced slavery at least indirectly and did not often speak demeaningly of the capacities of their race.
but they could not entirely escape caricaturing african american life as they struggled to meet the expectations of their white audiences.
the black minstrel shows had few openly political aims.
they did help develop some important forms of african american entertainment and transform them into a part of the national culture.
black minstrels introduced new forms of dance derived from the informal traditions of slavery and black community life.
they showed the buck and wing the stop time and the virginia essence which established the foundations for the tap and jazz dancing of the early twentieth century.
they also improvised musically and began experimenting with forms that over time contributed to the growth of ragtime jazz and rhythm and blues.
eventually black minstrelsy like its white counterpart evolved into other forms of theater including the beginnings of serious black drama.
at ambrose park in brooklyn in the 1890s for example the celebrated black comedian sam lucas a veteran of the minstrel circuit starred in the play darkest america which one black newspaper later described as a delineation of negro life carrying the race through all their historical phases from the plantation into reconstruction days and finally painting our people as they are today cultured and accomplished in the social graces holding the mirror faithfully up to nature but interest in the minstrel show did not die altogether.
in 1927 hollywood released the jazz singer the first feature film with sound.
it was about the career of a white minstrel performer and its star was one of the most popular singers of the twentieth century al jolson whose career had begun on the blackface minstrel circuit years before.

how did minstrel shows performed by white minstrels reinforce prevailing attitudes toward african americans.
minstrel shows performed by black minstrels often conformed to existing stereotypes of african americans.
can you think of any popular entertainments today that carry remnants of the minstrel shows of the nineteenth century.
377 378 chapter 15 a large almost festive crowd gathers to watch the lynching of a black man accused of the murder of a three year old white girl.
lynchings remained frequent in the south until as late as the 1930s but they reached their peak in the 1890s and the first years of the twentieth century.
lynchings such as this one publicized well in advance and attracting whole families who traveled great distances to see them were relatively infrequent.
most lynchings were the work of smaller groups operating with less visibility.
the library of congress a lynch mob 1893 but the substantial southern white opposition to lynchings stood as an exception to the general white support for suppression of african americans.
indeed just as in the antebellum period the shared commitment to white supremacy helped dilute class animosities between poorer whites and the bourbon oligarchies.
economic issues tended to play a secondary role to race in southern politics distracting people from the glaring social inequalities that afflicted blacks and whites alike.
conclusion reconstruction was a profoundly important moment in american history.
despite the bitter political battles in washington and throughout the south culminating in the unsuccessful effort to remove president andrew johnson from office the most important result of the effort to reunite the nation after its long and bloody war was a reshaping of the lives of ordinary people in all regions.
in the north reconstruction solidified the power of the republican party.
the rapid expansion of the northern economy accelerated drawing more and more of its residents into a burgeoning commercial world.
in the south reconstruction fundamentally rearranged the relationship between white and black citizens.
african americans initially participated actively and effectively in southern politics.
after a few years of widespread black voting and significant black officeholding however the forces of white supremacy shoved most african americans to the margins of the southern political world where they would mostly remain until the 1960s.
reconstruction and the new south 379 in other ways however the lives of southern blacks changed dramatically and permanently.
overwhelmingly they left the plantations.
some sought work in towns and cities.
others left the region altogether.
but the great majority began farming on small farms of their own not as landowners except in rare cases but as tenants and sharecroppers on land owned by whites.
the result was a form of economic bondage driven by debt only scarcely less oppressive than the legal bondage of slavery.
within this system however african americans managed to carve out a much larger sphere of social and cultural activity than they had ever been able to create under slavery.
black churches proliferated in great numbers.
african american schools and printing presses emerged in some communities and black colleges began to operate in the region.
some former slaves owned businesses and flourished.
strenuous efforts by new south advocates to advance industry and commerce in the region produced impressive results in a few areas.
but the south on the whole remained what it had always been a largely rural society with a sharply defined class structure.
it also maintained a deep commitment among its white citizens to the subordination of african americans a commitment solidified in the 1890s and the early twentieth century when white southerners erected an elaborate legal system of segregation the jim crow laws.
tragically the promise of the great reconstruction amendments to the constitution the fourteenth and fifteenth remained largely unfulfilled in the south as the century drew to its close.

how did the arrival and settlement of substantial numbers of anglo americans transform the society and economy of the west.
what role did the federal government play in shaping the development of the west.
by the mid 1840s white american migrants along with many others from the eastern regions of the nation had settled in the west in substantial numbers.
farmers ranchers and miners all found opportunity in the western lands.
by the end of the civil war the west had become legendary in the eastern states.
no longer the great american desert it was now widely viewed as the frontier an empty land awaiting settlement and civilization a place of wealth adventure opportunity and untrammeled individualism.
in fact the real west of the mid nineteenth century bore little resemblance to its popular image.
it was a diverse land with many different regions climates and stores of natural resources.
and it was extensively populated.
the english speaking migrants of the late nineteenth century did not find an empty desolate land.
they found indians mexicans african americans french and british canadians asians and others some of whose families had been living in the west for generations.
380 the societies of the far west the far west was in fact a composite of many lands.
it contained both the most arid regions and some of the wettest and lushest areas of the united states.
it contained the flattest plains and the highest mountains.
it also contained many peoples.

they supported themselves through a combination of fishing foraging and simple agriculture.
the pueblos of the southwest had long lived largely as farmers and had established permanent settlements there.
the most widespread indian groups in the west were the plains indians.
they were in fact made up of many different tribal and language groups.

otherwise beyond the timeless motivations of comradeship honor and adventure shared by soldiers in many wars union troops generally fought to sustain the best government on earth 1 like his union counterpart the average confederate soldier rarely had proper military training and tended to serve with comrades from the same area.
when on the march fully provisioned southern soldiers carried an ammunition cartridge box on their belts a rolledup blanket a haversack a tin cup frying pan and cloth covered canteen.
many confederate soldiers supplied their own shotguns hunting rifles or ancient flintlock muskets and cavalrymen often provided their own horses.
regiments wore different uniforms and even after the confederacy adopted gray the government was never able to clothe every soldier.
meals were meager with soldiers on both sides subsisting on dried vegetables salt pork and beef coffee and tough crackers known as hardtack.
southerners saw themselves as the protectors of sacred american values.
they defended the right of states to secede if they found the federal government oppressive just as the colonies had claimed the right to declare independence from an oppressive britain in the revolutionary war.
and they interpreted their defense of slavery as a defense of individual property rights in general.
indeed slavery was at the heart of the rights confederates sought to protect and of the life and economy they fought to preserve.

the mobilization of the north in the north the war produced considerable discord frustration and suffering.
but it also produced prosperity and economic growth.
with the south now gone from congress the republican party enjoyed almost unchallenged supremacy.
during the war it enacted an aggressively nationalistic program to promote economic development.
economic nationalism two 1862 acts assisted the rapid development of the west.
the homestead act permitted any citizen or prospective citizen to purchase 160 acres of public land for a small fee after homestead and morrill acts living on it for five years.
the morrill act transferred substantial public acreage to the state governments which could now sell the land and use the proceeds to finance public education.
this act led to the creation of many new state colleges and universities the so called land grant institutions.
congress also passed a series of tariff bills that by the end of the war had raised duties to the highest level in the nations history a great boon to domestic industries eager for protection from foreign competition but a hardship for many farmers and other consumers.
without the seceding states to block their legislation congress bent to the political will of the northern and western factions.

the civil war 327 congress also moved to spur completion of a transcontinental railroad.
it created two new federally chartered corporations the union pacific railroad company which was to build westward from omaha and the central pacific which was to build eastward from california.
the two projects were to meet in the middle and complete the link which they did in 1869 at promontory point utah.
the national bank acts of 1863 1864 created a new national banking system.
existing or newly formed banks could join the system if they had enough capital national bank acts and were willing to invest one third of it in government securities.
in return they could issue united states treasury notes as currency.
this eliminated much although not all of the chaos and uncertainty surrounding the nations currency.
more difficult was financing the war itself.
the government tried to do so in three ways levying taxes issuing paper currency and borrowing.
congress levied new taxes on almost all goods and services and in 1861 levied an income tax for the first time.
but taxation raised only a small proportion needed to fight the war and strong popular resistance prevented the government from raising the rates.
at least equally controversial was the printing of paper currency or greenbacks the new currency was backed not by gold or silver but as today simply by the good faith and credit of the government.
the value of the greenbacks fluctuated according to the fortunes of the northern armies.
early in 1864 with the war effort bogged down a greenback dollar was worth only 39 percent of a gold dollar.
but at the close of the war with confidence high it was worth 67 percent of a gold dollar.
by far the largest source of financing for the war was loans.
the treasury persuaded ordinary citizens to buy over 400 million worth of bonds.
yet public bond purchases constituted only a small part of the governments borrowing which in the end totaled 2 6 billion most of it from banks and large financial interests.
raising the union armies at the beginning of 1861 the regular army of the united states consisted of only 16 000 troops many of them stationed in the west.
so the union like the confederacy had to raise its army mostly from scratch.
lincoln called for an increase of 23 000 in the regular army but the bulk of the fighting he knew would have to be done by volunteers in state militias.
when congress convened in july 1861 it authorized enlisting 500 000 volunteers for three year as opposed to the customary three month terms.
this voluntary system of recruitment produced adequate forces only briefly during the first flush of enthusiasm for the war.
by march 1863 congress was forced to the draft pass a national draft law.
virtually all young adult males were eligible to be drafted although a man could escape service by hiring someone to go in his place or by paying the government a fee of 300.
to many who were accustomed to a remote and inactive national government conscription was strange and threatening.
opposition to the draft law was widespread particularly among laborers immigrants and democrats opposed to the war known as peace democrats or copperheads by their opponents.
occasionally opposition to the draft erupted into violence such as when demonstrators rioted in new york city for four days in july 1863 after the first names were selected for conscription.
new york city draft riots more than 100 people died.
irish workers were at the center of violence.
they were angry because black strikebreakers had been used against them in a recent longshoremens strike.
they blamed african americans generally for the war which they thought 328 chapter 14 was being fought for the benefit of slaves.
the rioters lynched several african americans and burned down black homes businesses and even an orphanage leaving more than 100 dead.
only the arrival of federal troops direct from the battle of gettysburg halted the violence.
wartime politics when abraham lincoln arrived in washington many republicans considered him a minor prairie politician who would be easily controlled by the real leaders of his party.
but lincoln was not cowed by the distinguished figures around him.
the new president understood his own and his partys weaknesses and he assembled a cabinet representing every faction of the republican party and every segment of northern opinion.
he moved boldly to use the war powers of the presidency blithely ignoring inconvenient parts of the constitution because he said it would be foolish to lose the whole by being afraid to disregard a part.
and so he sent troops into battle without asking congress for a declaration of war arguing that the conflict was a domestic insurrection.
he increased the size of the regular army without receiving legislative authority to do so.
and he unilaterally proclaimed a naval blockade of the south.
lincolns greatest political problem was the widespread popular opposition to the war in the north.
lincoln ordered military arrests of civilian dissenters and suspended the right of habeas corpus the right of an arrested person to receive a speedy trial.
at first lincoln used these methods only in sensitive areas such as the border states but by 1862 he proclaimed that all persons who discouraged enlistments or engaged in disloyal practices were subject to martial law.
repression was not the only tool the north used to strengthen support for the war.
in addition to arresting disloyal northerners lincolns administration used new tools of persuasion to build popular opinion in favor of the war.
in addition to pro war pamphlets posters speeches and songs the war mobilized a significant corps of photographers organized by the renowned mathew brady one of the first important photographers in american history to take pictures of the war.
the photographs that resulted from this effort new to warfare were among the grimmest ever made to that point many of them displaying the vast numbers of dead on the civil war battlefields.
for some northerners the images of death contributed to a revulsion for the war.
but for most they gave evidence of the level of sacrifice that had been made for the preservation of the union and thus spurred the nation on to victory.
southerners used similar propaganda in the confederacy although less effectively.
by the time of the 1864 election the north was in political turmoil.
the republicans had suffered heavy losses in the midterm elections of 1862 and in response party leaders tried to create a broad coalition of all the groups that supported the war.
they called the new organization the union party but it was in reality little more than the republican party and a small faction of war democrats.
they nominated lincoln for a second term and andrew johnson of tennessee a war democrat who had opposed his states decision to secede for the vice presidency.
the democrats nominated george b mcclellan a celebrated former union general.
george b mcclellan the party adopted a platform denouncing the war and calling for a truce.
mcclellan repudiated that demand but the democrats were clearly the peace party in the campaign trying to profit from growing war weariness.
for a time lincolns prospects for reelection seemed doubtful.
presidential war powers the civil war 329 at this crucial moment however several northern military victories particularly the capture of atlanta georgia early in september 1864 rejuvenated northern morale and boosted republican prospects.
with the overwhelming support of union troops lincoln won reelection comfortably with 212 electoral votes to mcclellans 21.
the politics of emancipation despite their surface unity in supporting the war and their general agreement on most economic matters the republicans disagreed sharply with one another on the issue of slavery.
radical republicans led in congress by such men as representative thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania and senators charles sumner of massachusetts and benjamin wade of ohio wanted to use the war to abolish slavery immediately and completely.
conservative republicans favored a more cautious policy in part to placate the slave states that remained precariously within the union.
nevertheless momentum began to gather behind emancipation early in the war.
in 1861 congress passed the confiscation act which declared that all slaves confiscation act used for insurrectionary purposes that is in support of the confederate military effort would be considered freed.
subsequent laws in the spring of 1862 abolished slavery in the district of columbia and the western territories and provided for the compensation of owners.
in july 1862 radicals pushed through congress the second confiscation act which declared free the slaves of persons supporting the insurrection and authorized the president to employ african americans as soldiers.
as the war progressed many in the north slowly accepted emancipation as a central war aim nothing less they believed would justify the enormous sacrifices the struggle had required.
as a result the radicals gained increasing influence within the republican party a development that did not go unnoticed by the president who decided to seize the leadership of the rising antislavery sentiment himself.
on september 22 1862 after the union victory at the battle of antietam the president announced his intention to use his war powers to issue an executive order freeing all slaves in the confederacy.
and on january 1 1863 he formally signed the emancipation proclamation which declared forever free the slaves inside the the emancipation proclamation confederacy.
the proclamation did not apply to the union slave states nor did it affect those parts of the confederacy already under union control tennessee western virginia and southern louisiana.
it applied in short only to slaves over whom the union had no control.
still the document was of great importance.
it clearly and irrevocably established that the war was being fought not only to preserve the union but also to eliminate slavery.
eventually as federal armies occupied much of the south the proclamation became a practical reality and led directly to the freeing of thousands of slaves.
even in areas not directly affected by the proclamation the antislavery impulse gained strength.
the u s governments tentative measures against slavery were not at first a major factor in the liberation of slaves.
instead the war helped african americans liberate themselves and they did so in increasing numbers as the war progressed.
many slaves were taken from their plantations and put to work as workers building defenses and other chores.
once transported to the front many of them found ways to escape across northern lines where they were treated as contraband goods seized from people who had no right to them.
they could not be returned to their masters.
by 1862 the union army often penetrated deep into the confederacy.
almost everywhere they went escaped slaves flocked to join them by the thousands often whole families.
some of them joined the 330 chapter 14 union army others simply stayed with the troops until they could find their way to free states.
when the union captured new orleans and much of southern louisiana slaves refused to work for their former masters even though the union occupiers had not made any provisions for liberating african americans.
by the end of the war two union slave states maryland and missouri and three confederate states occupied by union forces tennessee arkansas and louisiana had abolished slavery.
in 1865 congress finally approved and the states ratified the the thirteenth amendment thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery in all parts of the united states.
after more than two centuries legalized slavery finally ceased to exist in the united states.
african americans and the union cause about 186 000 emancipated blacks served as soldiers sailors and laborers for the union forces.
yet in the first months of the war african americans were largely excluded from the military.
a few black regiments eventually took shape in some of the union occupied areas of the confederacy.
but once lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation black enlistment increased rapidly and the union military began actively to recruit african american soldiers and sailors in both the north and where possible the south.
some of these men were organized into fighting units of which the best known was probably the fifty fourth massachusetts infantry which like most black regiments had a white commander robert gould shaw a member of an aristocratic boston family.
most black soldiers however were assigned menial tasks behind the lines such as digging trenches and transporting water.
even though many fewer blacks than whites died in combat the african american mortality rate was actually higher than the rate for white soldiers because so many black soldiers died of diseases contracted while working long arduous hours in unsanitary conditions.
conditions for blacks and whites were unequal in although most of the black soldiers who enlisted in the union army performed noncombat jobs behind the lines some black combat regiments members of one of which are pictured here fought with great success and valor in critical battles.
the library of congress african american troops the civil war 331 other ways as well.
until 1869 black soldiers were paid a third less than were white soldiers.
but however dangerous onerous or menial the tasks that black soldiers were given most of them felt enormous pride in their service pride they retained throughout their lives and often through the lives of their descendants.
many moved from the army into politics and other forms of leadership in both the north and after the war the reconstruction south.
black fighting men captured by the confederates were sent back to their masters if they were escaped slaves or executed.
in 1864 confederate soldiers killed over 260 black union soldiers after capturing them in tennessee.
women nursing and the war thrust into new and often unfamiliar roles by the war women took over positions vacated by men as teachers salesclerks office workers mill and factory hands and above all nursing.
the united states sanitary commission an organization u s sanitary commission of civilian volunteers mobilized large numbers of female nurses to serve in field hospitals.
by the end of the war women were the dominant force in nursing.
female nurses encountered considerable resistance from male doctors many of whom thought it inappropriate for women to take care of male strangers.
the sanitary commission countered such arguments by presenting nursing in domestic terms as a profession that made use of the same maternal nurturing roles women played as wives and mothers.
some women came to see the war as an opportunity to win support for their own goals.
elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony together founded the womens national loyal league in 1863 and worked simultaneously for the abolition of slavery and the awarding of suffrage to women.
the mobilization of the south early in february 1861 representatives of the seven seceding states met at montgomery alabama to create a new southern nation.
when virginia seceded several months later the leaders of the confederacy moved to richmond.
there were of course important differences between the new confederate nation and the nation it had left.
but there were also significant similarities.
the confederate government the confederate constitution was almost identical to the constitution of the united states with several significant exceptions.
it explicitly acknowledged the sovereignty of the individual states although not the right of secession.
and it specifically sanctioned slavery and made its abolition even by one of the states practically impossible.
the constitutional convention at montgomery named a provisional president and vice president jefferson davis of mississippi and alexander h stephens of jefferson davis georgia who were later elected by the general public without opposition for six year terms.
davis had been a moderate secessionist before the war.
stephens had argued against secession.
the confederate government like the union government was dominated throughout the war by men of the political center.
davis was a reasonably able administrator and encountered little interference from the generally tame members of his unstable cabinet.
but he rarely provided genuinely national 332 chapter 14 leadership spending too much time on routine items.
unlike lincoln he displayed a punctiliousness about legal and constitutional requirements.
although there were no formal political parties in the confederacy its politics were fiercely divided nevertheless.
some white southerners opposed secession and war altogether.
most white southerners supported the war but as in the north many were openly critical of the government and the military particularly as the tide of battle turned against the south.
states rights had become such a cult among many white southerners that they resisted states rights within the confederacy virtually all efforts to exert national authority even those necessary to win the war.
states rights enthusiasts obstructed conscription and restricted daviss ability to impose martial law and suspend habeas corpus.
governors such as joseph brown of georgia and zebulon m vance of north carolina tried at times to keep their own troops apart from the confederate forces.
but the national government was not impotent.
it experimented successfully for a time with a food draft which permitted soldiers to feed themselves by seizing crops from farms in their path.
the confederacy also seized control of the railroads and shipping it impressed slaves to work as laborers on military projects and imposed regulations on industry it limited corporate profits.
states rights sentiment was a significant handicap but the south nevertheless took important steps in the direction of centralization.
money and manpower financing the confederate war effort was a monumental task.
the confederate congress tried at first to requisition funds from the individual states but the states were as reluctant to tax their citizens as the congress was.
in 1863 therefore the congress enacted an income tax.
but taxation produced only about 1 percent of the governments total income.
borrowing was not much more successful.
the confederate government issued bonds in such vast amounts that the public lost faith in them and efforts to borrow money in europe using cotton as collateral fared no better.
as a result the confederacy had to pay for the war through the least stable most destructive form of financing paper currency which it began issuing in 1861.
by 1864 the confederacy had issued the staggering total of 1 5 billion in paper money.
the result inflation was a disastrous inflation a 9 000 percent increase in prices in the course of the war in contrast to 80 percent in the north.
like the united states the confederacy first raised armies by calling for volunteers.
and as in the north by the end of 1861 voluntary enlistments were declining.
in april conscription act 1862 therefore the congress enacted the conscription act which subjected all white males between the ages of eighteen and thirty five to military service for three years.
as in the north a draftee could avoid service if he furnished a substitute.
but since the price of substitutes was high the provision aroused such opposition from poorer whites that it was repealed in 1863.
even so conscription worked for a time in part because enthusiasm for the war was intense and widespread among white men in most of the south.
at the end of 1862 about 500 000 soldiers were in the confederate army not including the many slave men and women recruited by the military to perform such services as cooking laundry and manual labor.
small numbers of slaves and free blacks enlisted in the confederate army and a few participated in combat.
after 1862 however conscription began producing fewer men and by 1864 the confederate government faced a critical manpower shortage.
the south was suffering the civil war 333 from intense war weariness and many southerners had concluded that defeat was inevitable.
nothing could attract or retain an adequate army any longer.
troop shortage in a frantic final attempt to raise men the congress authorized the conscription of 300 000 slaves but the war ended before the government could attempt this incongruous experiment.
economic and social effects of the war the war cut off southern planters and producers from northern markets and a union blockade of confederate ports made the sale of cotton overseas much more difficult.
in the north production of all goods increased during the war in the south it declined by more than a third.
above all the fighting itself wreaked havoc on the southern landscape destroying farmland towns cities and railroads.
as the war continued the shortages the inflation and the carnage created increasing instability in southern society.
resistance to conscription food impressment and taxation increased throughout the confederacy as did hoarding and black market commerce.
some recreational pursuits found new popularity.
baseball emerged as a favorite pastime for confederate and union troops alike who set up makeshift games within their ranks to relieve the pressures of the war.
at the same time civilians in northern cities flocked to cheer on local teams in the newly founded national association of base ball players.
see patterns of popular culture baseball and the civil war the war forced many women and some men to perform untraditional nondomestic tasks during the conflict.
because the war decimated the male new roles for southern women population women soon outnumbered men in most southern states by significant margins.
the result was a large number of unmarried or widowed women who had no choice but to find employment.
even before emancipation the war had far reaching effects on the lives of slaves.
confederate leaders enforced slave codes with particular severity.
even so many slaves especially those near the front escaped their masters and crossed union lines.
strategy and diplomacy the military initiative in the civil war lay mainly with the north since it needed to destroy the confederacy as quickly as possible.
southerners needed only to survive however survival required diplomatic recognition from other nations especially great britain and the financial and military aid that would accompany it.
lincoln and his diplomatic corps worked tirelessly to keep foreign powers and their resources out of the confederacy while the union navy blockaded southern ports.
the commanders the most important union military leader was abraham lincoln.
he ultimately succeeded as commander in chief because he recognized the norths material advantages and he realized that the proper objective of his armies was to destroy the confederate armies ability to fight.
despite his missteps and inexperience the north was fortunate to have lincoln but the president struggled to find a general as well suited for his task as lincoln was for his.
patterns of popular culture baseball and the civil war long before the great urban stadiums the lights the cameras and the multimilliondollar salaries baseball was the most popular game in america.
during the civil war it was a treasured pastime for soldiers and for thousands of men and some women behind the lines in both the north and the south.
the legend that baseball was invented by abner doubleday who probably never even saw the game was created by albert g spalding a patriotic sporting goods manufacturer eager to prove that the game had purely american origins.
in fact baseball was derived from a variety of earlier games especially the english pastimes of cricket and rounders.
american baseball took its own distinctive form beginning in the 1840s when alexander cartwright a shipping clerk formed the new york knickerbockers laid out a diamond shaped field with four bases and declared that batters with three strikes were out and that teams with three outs were retired.
cartwright moved west in search of gold in 1849 settling finally in hawaii where he introduced the game to americans in the pacific.
but the game did not languish in his absence.
henry chadwick an english born journalist spent much of the 1850s popularizing the game and regularizing its rules.
by 1860 baseball was being played by college students and irish workers by urban elites and provincial farmers by people of all classes and ethnic groups from new england to louisiana.
students at vassar college formed ladies teams in the 1860s and in philadelphia free black men formed the pythians the first of what was to become a great network of african american 334 baseball teams.
from the beginning they were barred from playing against most white teams.
when young men marched off to war in 1861 some took their bats and balls with them.
almost from the start of the fighting soldiers in both armies took advantage of idle moments to lay out baseball diamonds and organize games.
games on battlefields were sometimes interrupted by gunfire and cannon fire.
it is astonishing how indifferent a person can become to danger a soldier wrote home to ohio in 1862.
the report of musketry is heard but a very little distance from us.
yet over there on the other side of the road is most of our company playing bat ball after a skirmish in texas another union soldier lamented that in addition to casualties his company had lost the only baseball in alexandria texas far from discouraging baseball military commanders and the united states sanitary commission the union armys medical arm actively encouraged the game during the war.
it would they believed help keep up the soldiers morale.
away from the battlefield baseball continued to flourish.
in new york city games between local teams drew crowds of ten thousand to twenty thousand.
the national association of base ball players founded in 1859 had recruited ninety one clubs in ten northern states by 1865 a north western association of baseball players organized in chicago in 1865 indicated that the game was becoming well established in the west as well.
in brooklyn william cammeyer drained a skating pond on his property built a board fence around it and created the first enclosed baseball field in america the union grounds.
he charged ten cents for admission.
the professionalization of the game had begun.
despite all the commercialization and spectacle that came to be associated with baseball in the years after the civil war the game remained for many americans what it was to millions of young men fighting in the most savage war in the nations history an american passion that at times even if briefly erased the barriers dividing groups from one another.
officers and men forget for a time the differences in rank a massachusetts private wrote in 1863 and indulge in the invigorating sport with a schoolboys ardor understand analyze evaluate 1.
how could a competitive game of base ball erase the barriers dividing groups from one another.
baseball during the civil war crossed the lines of cultural differences between the north and the south.
does baseball today professional or amateur continue to cross lines of cultural differences.
from 1861 to 1864 lincoln tried repeatedly to find a chief of staff capable of orchestrating the union war effort.
he turned first to general winfield scott the ailing 74 yearold hero of the mexican war who had already contributed strategic advice to the president but scott was no longer physically capable of leading an army.
lincoln then appointed the young george b mcclellan the commander of the union forces in the east the army of the potomac.
unfortunately the proud and overly cautious mcclellan seemed too slow to act for lincolns tastes.
lincoln returned mcclellan to his previous command in march 1862.
for most of the rest of the year lincoln had no chief of staff at all.
when he eventually appointed general henry w halleck to the post he found him ineffectual as well.
not until march 1864 did lincoln finally find a general he trusted to command the war effort ulysses s grant who shared lincolns belief in unremitting ulysses s grant combat and in making enemy armies and resources the target of military efforts.
lincolns handling of the war effort faced constant scrutiny from the committee on the conduct of the war a joint investigative committee of the two houses of congress.
established in december 1861 and chaired by senator benjamin e wade of ohio the committee complained constantly of the inadequate ruthlessness of northern generals which radicals on the committee attributed largely inaccurately to a secret sympathy among the officers for slavery.
the committees efforts often seriously interfered with the conduct of the war.
southern military leadership centered on president davis a trained soldier who nonetheless failed to create an effective central command system.
early in 1862 davis named general robert e lee as his principal military adviser.
but in fact davis had no intention of sharing control of strategy with anyone.
after a few months lee left richmond to command forces in the field and for the next two years davis planned strategy alone.
in february 1864 he named general braxton bragg as a military adviser but bragg never provided much more than technical advice.
at lower levels of command men of markedly similar backgrounds controlled the war in both the north and the south.
many of the professional officers on both sides were graduates of the united states military academy at west point and the united states naval academy at annapolis.
amateur officers played an important role in both armies as commanders of volunteer regiments.
in both the north and the south such men were usually economic or social leaders in their communities who rounded up troops to lead.
sometimes this system produced officers of real ability more often it did not.
335 336 chapter 14 grant left and lee of the union general an observer said he habitually wears an expression as if he had determined to drive his head through a brick wall and was about to do it it was an apt metaphor for grants military philosophy which relied on constant unrelenting assault.
the confederate general in contrast was known for his dignified and disciplined demeanor.
he became a symbol to white southerners of the lost cause grant the library of congress lee bettmann corbis the role of sea power the union had an overwhelming advantage in naval power.
it played two important roles in the war enforcing a blockade of the southern coast and assisting the union armies in field operations.
the blockade which began in the first weeks of the war kept most oceangoing ships out of confederate ports but for a time small blockade runners continued to slip through.
gradually however federal forces tightened the blockade by seizing the confederate ports themselves.
the last important port in confederate hands wilmington north carolina fell to the union early in 1865.
the confederates made a bold attempt to break the blockade with an ironclad warship constructed by plating with iron a former united states frigate the merrimac.
on march 8 1862 the refitted merrimac renamed the virginia left norfolk to attack a blockading squadron of wooden ships at nearby hampton roads.
it destroyed two of the ships and union blockade the civil war 337 scattered the rest.
but the union government had already built ironclads of its own including the monitor which arrived only a few hours after the virginias monitor versus merrimac dramatic foray.
the next day it met the virginia in battle.
neither vessel was able to sink the other but the monitor put an end to the virginias raids and preserved the blockade.
the union navy was particularly important in the western theater of the war where the major rivers were navigable by large vessels.
the navy transported supplies and troops and joined in attacking confederate strong points.
the south had no significant navy of its own and could defend against the union gunboats only with ineffective fixed land fortifications.
europe and the disunited states judah p benjamin the confederate secretary of state for most of the war was an intelligent but undynamic man who attended mostly to routine administrative tasks.
william seward his counterpart in washington gradually became one of the outstanding american secretaries of state.
he had invaluable assistance from charles francis adams the american minister to london.
this gap between the diplomatic skills of the union and the confederacy was a decisive factor in the war.
at the beginning of the conflict the sympathies of the ruling classes of england and france lay largely with the confederacy partly because the arguments for supporting each side two nations imported much southern cotton but it was also because they were eager to weaken the united states an increasingly powerful rival to them in world commerce.
france was unwilling to take sides in the conflict unless england did so first.
and in england the government was reluctant to act because there was powerful popular support for the union particularly from the large and influential english antislavery movement.
after lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation antislavery groups worked particularly avidly for the union.
southern leaders hoped to counter the strength of the british antislavery forces by arguing that access to southern cotton was vital to the english and french textile industries.
but english manufacturers had a surplus of both raw cotton and finished goods on hand in 1861 and could withstand a temporary loss of access to american cotton.
later as the supply began to diminish both england and france managed to keep at least some of their mills open by importing cotton from egypt india and elsewhere.
equally important even the 500 000 english textile workers thrown out of jobs as a result of mill closings continued to support the north.
in the end therefore no european nation offered diplomatic recognition financial support or military aid to the confederacy.
no nation wanted to antagonize the united states unless the confederacy seemed likely to win and the south never came close enough to victory to convince its potential allies to support it.
in the end the confederacy was on its own.
even so tension and on occasion near hostilities continued between the united states and britain.
the union government was angry when great britain france and other nations declared themselves neutral early in the war thus implying that the two sides to the conflict had equal stature.
leaders in washington insisted that the conflict was simply a domestic insurrection not a war between two legitimate governments.
a more serious crisis the so called trent affair began in late 1861.
two confederate diplomats james m mason and john slidell had slipped through the then the trent affair ineffective union blockade to havana cuba where they boarded an english steamer the trent for england.
waiting in cuban waters was the american frigate san jacinto commanded by the impetuous charles wilkes.
acting without authorization wilkes stopped the 338 chapter 14 british vessel arrested the diplomats and carried them in triumph to boston.
the british government demanded the release of the prisoners reparations and an apology.
lincoln and seward were aware that wilkes had violated maritime law.
they were unwilling to risk war with england and they eventually released the diplomats with an indirect apology.
campaigns and battles in the absence of direct intervention by the european powers the two contestants in north america were left to resolve the conflict between themselves.
they did so in four long staggering casualties years of bloody combat.
more than 618 000 americans died in the course of the civil war far more than the 112 000 who perished in world war i or the 405 000 who died in world war ii.
there were nearly 2 000 deaths for every 100 000 of population during the civil war.
in world war i the comparable figure was only 109 and in world war ii the comparable figure was 241.
in some respects the civil war was the bloodiest war in modern times.
the technology of war much of what happened on the battlefield in the civil war was a result of new technologies that transformed the nature of combat.
the most obvious change was the nature of the armaments.
among the most important was the introduction of repeating weapons.
samuel colt had patented a repeating pistol the revolver in 1835 but more important for military purposes was the repeating rifle introduced in 1860 by oliver winchester.
also significant were greatly improved cannons and artillery a result of earlier advances in iron and steel technology.
these new armaments made it impossibly deadly to fight battles as they had been fought for centuries with lines of infantry soldiers standing erect in the field firing volleys at their opponents until one side withdrew.
soldiers quickly learned that the proper position for combat was staying low to the ground and behind cover.
for the first time in the deadlier weaponry history of organized warfare therefore infantry did not fight in formation and the battlefields became more chaotic places.
gradually the deadliness of the new weapons encouraged armies on both sides to spend a great deal of time building elaborate fortifications and trenches to protect themselves from enemy fire.
the sieges of vicksburg and petersburg the defense of richmond and many other military events all produced the construction of vast fortifications around both cities and attacking armies.
they were the predecessors to the vast network of trenches of world war i.
other weapons technologies were less central to the fighting of the war but important nevertheless.
the relatively new technology of hot air balloons was employed intermittently to provide a view of enemy formations in the field.
the ironclad ships and even torpedoes and submarine technology which made fleeting appearances in the 1860s suggested the dramatic changes that would soon overtake naval warfare.
critical to the conduct of the war however were two other relatively new technologies the railroad and the telegraph.
the railroad was particularly important in mobilizing millions of soldiers and transferring them to the front.
transporting such enormous numbers military importance of railroads of soldiers and the supplies necessary to sustain them by foot or by horse and wagon would have been almost impossible.
but ironically railroads also limited the mobility of the armies.
commanders were forced to organize their campaigns the civil war 339 at least in part around the location of the railroads rather than on the basis of the best topography or most direct land route to a destination.
the dependence on the rails and the resulting necessity of concentrating huge numbers of men in a few places also encouraged commanders to prefer great battles with large armies rather than smaller engagements with fewer troops.
the impact of the telegraph on the war was limited both by the scarcity of qualified telegraph operators and by the difficulty of bringing telegraph wires into the fields where battles were being fought.
things improved somewhat after the new u s military telegraph corps headed by thomas scott and andrew carnegie trained and employed over 1 200 operators.
gradually too both the union and confederate armies learned to string telegraph wires along the routes of their troops so that field commanders were able to stay in close touch with one another during battles.
the opening clashes 1861 the union and the confederacy fought their first major battle of the war in northern virginia.
a union army of over 30 000 men under general irvin mcdowell was stationed just outside washington.
about thirty miles away at manassas sat a slightly smaller confederate army commanded by general p g t beauregard.
if the northern army could destroy the southern one union leaders believed the war might end at once.
in mid july mcdowell marched his inexperienced troops toward manassas.
beauregard moved his troops behind bull run a small stream north of manassas and called for reinforcements which reached him the day before the battle.
on july 21 in the first battle of bull run or first battle of first battle of bull run manassas mcdowell almost succeeded in dispersing the confederate forces.
but the southerners managed to fight off a last strong union assault.
the confederates then began a savage counterattack.
the union troops suddenly panicked broke ranks and retreated chaotically.
mcdowell was unable to reorganize them and he had to order a retreat to washington a disorderly withdrawal complicated by the presence along the route of many civilians who had ridden down from the capital picnic baskets in hand to watch the battle from nearby hills.
the confederates as disorganized by victory as the union forces were by defeat did not pursue.
the battle was a severe blow to union morale and to the presidents confidence in his officers.
elsewhere union forces achieved some small but significant victories in 1861.
a union force under general george b mcclellan moved east from ohio into western virginia.
by the end of 1861 it had liberated the antisecession west virginia established mountain people of the region who created their own state government loyal to the union the state was admitted to the union as west virginia in 1863.
the western theater after the battle at bull run military operations in the east settled into a long and frustrating stalemate.
the first decisive operations occurred in the western theater in 1862.
here union forces were trying to seize control of the southern part of the mississippi river from both the north and south moving down the river from kentucky and up from the gulf of mexico toward new orleans.
in april a union squadron commanded by flag officer david g farragut smashed past weak confederate forts near the mouth of the mississippi and from there sailed up 340 chapter 14 200 mi ohio 400 km missouri r indiana illinois.

this map shows a series of union drives in the western confederacy.
flag officer david farraguts ironclads led to the capture of new orleans a critical confederate port in april 1862 while forces farther north under the command of ulysses s grant drove the confederate army out of kentucky and western tennessee.
these battles culminated in the union victory at shiloh which led to union control of the upper mississippi river.
why was control of the mississippi so important to both sides.
to new orleans.
the city was virtually defenseless because the confederate high command had expected the attack to come from the north.
the surrender of new orleans on april 25 1862 was an important turning point in the war.
from then on the mouth of the mississippi was closed to confederate trade and the souths largest city and most important banking center was in union hands.
farther north in the western theater confederate troops under general albert sidney johnston were stretched out in a long defensive line around two forts in tennessee fort henry and fort donelson.
early in 1862 ulysses s grant attacked fort henry whose defenders awed by the ironclad riverboats accompanying the union army surrendered with almost no resistance.
grant then moved both his naval and ground forces to fort donelson where the confederates put up a stronger fight but finally on february 16 had to surrender.
grant thus gained control of river communications and forced confederate troops out of kentucky and half of tennessee.
new orleans seized the civil war 341 with about 40 000 men grant now advanced south along the tennessee river.
at shiloh tennessee he met a force almost equal to his own commanded by albert shiloh sidney johnston and p g t beauregard.
the result was the battle of shiloh april 6 7 1862.
in the first days fighting during which johnston was killed the southerners drove grant back to the river.
but the next day reinforced by 25 000 fresh troops grant recovered the lost ground and forced beauregard to withdraw.
after the narrow union victory at shiloh northern forces occupied corinth mississippi and took control of the mississippi river as far south as memphis.
general braxton bragg now in command of the confederate army in the west gathered his forces at chattanooga in eastern tennessee where he faced a union army trying to capture the city.
the two armies maneuvered for advantage inconclusively in northern tennessee and southern kentucky for several months until december 31 january 2 when they finally clashed in the battle of murfreesboro or stones river.
bragg was forced to withdraw to the south in defeat.
by the end of 1862 union forces had made considerable progress in the west.
but the heart of the war remained in the east.
the virginia front 1862 during the winter of 1861 1862 george b mcclellan commander of the army of the potomac concentrated on training his army of 150 000 men near washington.
finally he designed a spring campaign to capture the confederate capital at richmond.
but instead of heading overland directly mcclellan chose a complicated route that he thought would circumvent the confederate defenses.
the navy would carry his troops down the potomac to a peninsula east of richmond between the york and james rivers the army would approach the city from there in what became known as the peninsular campaign.
mcclellan set off with 100 000 men reluctantly leaving 30 000 members of his army behind under general irvin mcdowell to protect washington.
mcclellan eventually persuaded lincoln to send him the additional men.
but before the president could do so a confederate army under general thomas j.
stonewall jackson stonewall jackson staged a rapid march north through the shenandoah valley as if preparing to cross the potomac and attack washington.
lincoln postponed sending reinforcements to mcclellan retaining mcdowells corps to head off jackson.
in the valley campaign of may 4 june 9 1862 jackson defeated two separate union forces and slipped away before mcdowell could catch him.
meanwhile mcclellan was fighting confederate troops under general joseph e johnston outside richmond in the two day battle of fair oaks or seven pines may 31 june 1 and holding his ground.
johnston badly wounded was replaced by robert e lee who then recalled stonewall jackson from the shenandoah robert e lee valley.
with a combined force of 85 000 to face mcclellans 100 000 lee launched a new offensive known as the battle of the seven days june 25 july 1 in an effort to cut mcclellan off from his base on the york river.
but mcclellan fought his way across the peninsula and set up a new base on the james.
mcclellan was now only twenty five miles from richmond and in a good position to renew the campaign.
but despite continuing pressure from lincoln he did not advance.
hoping to force a new offensive against richmond along the direct overland route he had always preferred lincoln finally ordered the army to move back to northern virginia and join up with a smaller force under general john pope.

the union hoped for a quick victory over the newly created confederate army.
but as these maps show the southern forces consistently thwarted such hopes.
the map at top left shows the battles of 1861 and the first half of 1862 almost all of them won by the confederates.
the map at lower left shows the last months of 1862 during which the southerners again defeated the union in most of their engagements although northern forces drove the confederates back from maryland in september.
the map on the right shows the troop movements that led to the climactic battle of gettysburg in 1863.
why were the union forces unable to profit more from material advantages during these first years of the war.
the peninsula by water lee moved north with the army of northern virginia to strike pope before mcclellan could join him.
pope was as rash as mcclellan was cautious and he attacked the approaching confederates without waiting for the arrival of all of mcclellans troops.
in the second battle of bull run or manassas august 29 30 lee threw back the assault and routed popes army which fled to washington.
with hopes the civil war 343 for an overland campaign against richmond now in disarray lincoln removed pope from command and put mcclellan back in charge of all the federal forces in the region.
lee soon went on the offensive again heading north through western maryland and mcclellan moved out to meet him.
mcclellan had the good luck to get a copy of lees orders which revealed that a part of the confederate army under stonewall jackson had separated from the rest to attack harpers ferry.
but instead of attacking quickly before the confederates could recombine mcclellan stalled again giving lee time to pull most of his forces back together behind antietam creek near the town of sharpsburg.
antietam there on september 17 mcclellans 87 000 man army repeatedly attacked lees force of 50 000 with staggering casualties on both sides.
late in the day just as the confederate line seemed ready to break the last of jacksons troops arrived from harpers ferry to reinforce it.
mcclellan might have broken through with one more assault.
instead he allowed lee to retreat into virginia.
technically antietam was a union victory but in reality mcclellan had squandered an opportunity to destroy much of the confederate army.
in november lincoln finally removed mcclellan from command for good.
mcclellans replacement general ambrose e burnside was a short lived mediocrity.
he tried to move toward richmond by crossing the rappahannock river at fredericksburg.
there on december 13 he launched a series of attacks against lee all of them bloody all of them hopeless.
after losing a large part of his army he withdrew to the north bank of the rappahannock.
he was relieved at his own request.
the year 1862 ended therefore with a series of frustrations for the union.
the progress of the war why did the union with its much greater population its much larger population and its much better transportation and technology than the confederacy make so little progress in the first two years of the war.
had there been a decisive and dramatic victory by either side early in the war for example a major victory by the union at the first battle of bull run the conflict might have ended quickly by destroying the confederacys morale.
but no such decisive victory occurred in the first two years of the war.
many northerners blamed the military stalemate on timid or incompetent union generals and there was some truth to that view.
but the more important reason for the drawnout conflict was that it was not a war of traditional tactics and military strategy.
it was even if the leaders of both sides were not yet fully aware of it a war of attrition and the confederacy could survive only if the union quit fighting.
winning or losing battles here and there would not determine the outcome of the war.
what would bring the war to a conclusion was the steady destruction of the resources that were necessary for victory.
more than two bloody years of fighting were still to come.
but those last years were a testimony to the slow steady deterioration of the confederacys ability to maintain the war and the consistent growth of the resources that allowed the union armies to grow steadily stronger.
1863 year of decision at the beginning of 1863 general joseph hooker was commanding the still formidable army of the potomac which remained north of the rappahannock opposite fredericksburg.
taking part of his army hooker crossed the river above fredericksburg and moved toward the town and lees army.
but at the last minute he drew back to a defensive position in a desolate area of brush and scrub trees known as the wilderness.

to do that required capturing the southern stronghold at vicksburg a well defended city sitting above the river.
vicksburgs main defenses were to the north so grant boldly moved men and supplies around the city and attacked it from the south.
eventually he cut off the citys access to the outside world and after a six week siege its residents finally surrendered.
what impact did the combined victories at vicksburg and gettysburg have on northern commitment to the war.
assault on the union army.
in the battle of chancellorsville may 1 5 stonewall jackson attacked the union right and lee himself charged the front.
hooker barely managed to escape with his army.
lee had frustrated union objectives but he had not destroyed the union army.
and his ablest officer jackson was fatally wounded in the course of the battle.
while the union forces were suffering repeated frustrations in the east they were winning some important victories in the west.
in the spring of 1863 ulysses s grant chancellorsville the civil war 345 was driving at vicksburg on the mississippi river.
vicksburg was well protected vicksburg on land and had good artillery coverage of the river itself.
but in may grant boldly moved men and supplies over land and by water to an area south of the city where the terrain was reasonably good.
he then attacked vicksburg from the rear.
six weeks later on july 4 vicksburg whose residents were by then starving as a result of the prolonged siege surrendered.
at almost the same time the other confederate strongpoint on the river port hudson louisiana also surrendered to a union force that had moved north from new orleans.
with the achievement of one of the unions basic military aims control of the whole length of the mississippi the confederacy was split in two with louisiana arkansas and texas cut off from the other seceded states.
the victories on the mississippi were one of the great turning points of the war.
during the siege of vicksburg lee proposed an invasion of pennsylvania which would he argued divert union troops north.
further he argued if he could win a major victory on northern soil england and france might come to the confederacys aid.
the war weary north might even quit the war before vicksburg fell.
in june 1863 lee moved up the shenandoah valley into maryland and then entered pennsylvania.
the union army of the potomac commanded first by hooker and then after june 28 by general george c meade moved north too.
the two armies finally encountered each other at the small town of gettysburg pennsylvania.
there on july 1 3 1863 they fought the most celebrated battle of the war.
meades army established a strong well protected position on the hills south of the town.
lee attacked but his first assault on the union forces on cemetery ridge failed.

the map on the right reveals the pattern of the attacks on july 2 and 3.
note in particular picketts bold and costly charge whose failure on july 3 was the turning point in the battle and some chroniclers have argued the war.
why did robert e lee believe that an invasion of pennsylvania would advance the confederate cause.
co ns ider t he s o urc e the gettysburg address november 19 1863 lincoln gave this speech on the occasion of the dedication of the soldiers national cemetery in gettysburg pennsylvania four months after the famous battle.
four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
we are met on a great battlefield of that war.
we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
but in a larger sense we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground.
the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here.
it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.

a day later he ordered a second larger effort.
in what is remembered as picketts charge a force of 15 000 confederate soldiers advanced for almost a mile across open country while being swept by union fire.
only about 5 000 made it up the ridge and this remnant finally had to surrender or retreat.
by now lee had lost nearly a third of his army.
on gettysburg july 4 the same day as the surrender of vicksburg lee withdrew from gettysburg.
the retreat was another major turning point in the war.
never again were the weakened confederate forces able seriously to threaten northern territory.
months later lincoln visited the battlefield site and delivered one of the most famous speeches in american history.
see consider the source the gettysburg address before the end of the year there was one more important turning point this time in tennessee.

the two armies engaged in western georgia in the battle of chickamauga september 19 20.
union forces could not break the confederate lines and retreated back to chattanooga.

grant came to the rescue.

grant like lincoln believed in using the norths great advantage in troops and material resources to overwhelm the south.
he planned two great offensives for 1864.
in virginia the army of the potomac would advance toward richmond and force lee into a decisive battle.
in georgia the western army under general william t sherman would advance east toward atlanta and destroy the remaining confederate force now under the command of joseph e johnston.
the northern campaign began when the army of the potomac 115 000 strong plunged into the rough wooded wilderness area of northwestern virginia in pursuit of lees 75 000man army.
after avoiding an engagement for several weeks lee turned grant back in the 50 mi 100 km from the confederate defeat at and retreat from gettysburg until the end of the war most of the eastern fighting took place in virginia.
by now ulysses s grant was commander of all union forces and had taken over the army of the potomac.
although confederate forces won a number of important battles during the virginia campaign the union army grew steadily stronger and the southern forces steadily weaker.
grant believed that the union strategy should reflect the norths greatest advantage its superiority in men and equipment.
what effect did this decision have on the level of casualties.
virginia campaigns 1864 1865 348 chapter 14 battle of the wilderness may 5 7.
without stopping to rest or reorganize grant resumed his march toward richmond and met lee again in the bloody battle of spotsylvania court house may 8 21 in which 12 000 union troops and a large but unknown number of confederates fell.
grant kept moving but victory continued to elude him.
lee kept his army between grant and the confederate capital and on june 1 3 repulsed the union forces again just northeast of richmond at cold harbor.
grant now moved his army east of richmond and headed south toward the railroad center at petersburg.
if he could seize petersburg he could cut off the capitals communications with the rest of the confederacy.
but petersburg had strong defenses and once lee came to the citys relief the assault became a prolonged siege.
in georgia meanwhile sherman was facing less ferocious resistance.
with 90 000 men he confronted confederate forces of 60 000 under johnston.
as sherman advanced johnston tried to delay him by maneuvering.
the two armies fought only one real battle kennesaw mountain northwest of atlanta on june 27 where johnston scored an impressive victory.
even so he was unable to stop the union advance toward atlanta prompting davis to replace atlanta taken him with general john b.
sherman took the city on september 2 and burned it.
hood now tried unsuccessfully to draw sherman out of atlanta by moving back up through tennessee and threatening an invasion of the north.

note that after capturing savannah by christmas 1864 sherman began moving north through the carolinas.
a few days after lee surrendered to grant at appomattox confederate forces farther south surrendered to sherman.
what did sherman believe his devastating march to the sea would accomplish.
shermans march to the sea 1864 1865 the civil war 349 to reinforce nashville.
in the battle of nashville on december 15 16 1864 northern forces practically destroyed what was left of hoods army.
meanwhile sherman had left atlanta to begin his soon to be famous march to the sea living off the land destroying supplies it could not use shermans march to the sea his army cut a sixty mile wide swath of desolation across georgia.
sherman sought not only to deprive the confederate army of war materials and railroad communications.
he was also determined to break the will of the southern people by burning towns and plantations along his route.
by december 20 he had reached savannah which surrendered two days later.
early in 1865 sherman continued his destructive march moving northward through south carolina.
he was virtually unopposed until he was well inside north carolina where a small force under johnston could do no more than cause a brief delay.
in april 1865 grants army of the potomac still engaged in the prolonged siege at petersburg finally captured a vital railroad junction southwest of the town.
without rail access to the south and plagued by heavy casualties and massive desertions lee informed the confederate government that he could no longer defend richmond.
within hours jefferson davis his cabinet and as much of the white population as could find transportation fled.
that night mobs roamed the city setting devastating fires.
and the next morning northern forces entered the confederate capital.
with them was abraham lincoln who walked through the streets of the burned out city surrounded by black men and women cheering him as the messiah and father abraham in one particularly stirring moment the president turned to a former slave kneeling on the street before him and said dont kneel to me.
you must kneel to god only and thank him for the liberty you will enjoy hereafter with the remnant of his army now about 25 000 men lee began moving west in the forlorn hope of finding a way around the union forces so that he could move south and link up with johnston in north carolina.
but the union army pursued him and blocked his escape route.
lee finally recognized that further bloodshed was futile.
he arranged to meet grant at a private home in the small town of appomattox court house virginia appomattox court house where on april 9 he surrendered what was left of his forces.
nine days later near durham north carolina johnston surrendered to sherman.
the long war was now effectively over.
jefferson davis was finally captured in georgia.
a few southern diehards continued to fight but even their resistance collapsed before long.
general george meades shout its all over described in simple terms one of the most momentous events in the nations history.
the war ensured the permanence of the union but many other issues remained far from settled.
what would happen to the freedmen the term used for slaves who were now liberated.
could the south and the north reconcile.
would the massive industrial growth in the north during the civil war spread to the south or would the south remain an agrarian region with much less wealth than in the north.
the end of the war was the beginning of more than a generation of struggle to determine the legacy of the civil war.
conclusion the american civil war began with high hopes and high ideals on both sides.
in the north and the south alike thousands of men enthusiastically enlisted in local regiments and went off to war.
four years later over 600 000 of them were dead and many more maimed and traumatized for life.
a fight for principles and ideals a fight few people had thought would last more than a few months had become one of the longest wars and by far the bloodiest war in american history before or since.
350 chapter 14 during the first two years of fighting the confederate forces seemed to have all the advantages.
they were fighting on their own soil.
their troops seemed more committed to the cause than those of the north.
their commanders were exceptionally talented while union forces were for a time erratically led.
gradually however the unions advantages began to assert themselves.
the north had a stabler political system led by one of the greatest leaders in the nations history.
it had a much larger population a far more developed industrial economy superior financial institutions and a better railroad system.
by the middle of 1863 the tide of the war had shifted over the next two years union forces gradually wore down the confederate armies before finally triumphing in 1865.
the war strengthened the norths economy giving a spur to industry and railroad development.
it greatly weakened the souths by destroying millions of dollars of property and depleting the regions young male population.
southerners had gone to war in part because of their fears of growing northern dominance.
ironically the war itself confirmed and strengthened that dominance.
but most of all the civil war was a victory for millions of african american slaves.
the war produced abraham lincolns epochal emancipation proclamation and later the thirteenth amendment to the constitution which abolished slavery altogether.
it also encouraged hundreds of thousands of slaves literally to free themselves to desert their masters and seek refuge behind union lines at times to fight in the union armies.
the future of the freed slaves was not to be an easy one but three and a half million people who had once lived in bondage emerged from the war as free men and women.

few periods in the history of the united states have produced as much bitterness or created such enduring controversy as the era of reconstruction the years following the civil war during which americans attempted to reunite their shattered nation.
to many white southerners reconstruction was a vicious and destructive experience a period when vindictive northerners inflicted humiliation and revenge on the defeated south.
northern defenders of reconstruction in contrast argued that their policies were the only way to prevent unrepentant confederates from restoring southern society to what it had been before the war.
to most african americans at the time and to many people of all races since reconstruction was notable for other reasons.
neither a vicious tyranny as white southerners charged nor a thoroughgoing reform as many northerners hoped it was instead an important first step in the effort to secure civil rights and economic power for the former slaves.
reconstruction did not provide african americans with either the enduring legal protections or the material resources to ensure anything like real equality.
most black men and women still had little formal power to overturn their oppression for many decades.
and yet for all its shortcomings reconstruction did help african americans create new institutions and some important legal precedents that helped them survive and that ultimately well into the twentieth century became the basis of later efforts to win greater freedom and equality.

as soon as the war ended hundreds of thousands of them left their plantations in search of a new life in freedom.
but most had nowhere to go and few had any possessions except the clothes they wore.
competing notions of freedom for blacks and whites alike reconstruction became a struggle to define the meaning of the war and above all the meaning of freedom.
but the former slaves and the defeated whites had very different conceptions of what freedom meant.
for most white southerners freedom meant the ability to control their own reconstruction and the new south 353 richmond 1865 by the time union forces captured richmond in early 1865 the confederate capital had been under siege for months and much of the city lay in ruins as this photograph reveals.
on april 4 president lincoln accompanied by his son tad visited richmond.

it was a great deliverer among the delivered.
no wonder tears came to his eyes the library of congress d estinies without interference from the north or the federal government.
and in the immediate aftermath of the war this meant trying to restore their society to its antebellum form.
when these white southerners fought for what they considered freedom they were fighting above all to preserve local and regional autonomy and white supremacy.
for african americans freedom meant independence from white control.
in the wake of advancing union armies millions of black southerners sought to secure that freedom with economic opportunity which for many meant landownership.

456 chapter 19 balance was similarly stable with the republicans generally controlling the senate and the democrats generally controlling the house.
despite the relatively modest differences most eligible americans had strong loyalties high voter turnout to their chosen party.
voter turnout in presidential elections between 1860 and 1900 averaged over 78 percent of all eligible voters.
large groups of potential voters were disenfranchised in these years women in most states and almost all blacks and many poor whites in the south.
but for adult white males there were few restrictions on voting.
what explains this extraordinary loyalty to the two political parties.
it was not that the parties took distinct positions on important public issues.
they did so rarely.
reasons for party loyalties party loyalties reflected other factors.
region was perhaps the most important.
to white southerners loyalty to the democratic party the vehicle by which they had triumphed over reconstruction and preserved white supremacy was a matter of unquestioned faith.
republican loyalties were equally intense in the north.
to many the party of lincoln remained a bulwark against slavery and treason.
religious and ethnic differences also shaped party loyalties.
the democratic party attracted most of the catholic voters recent immigrants and poorer workers.
the republican party appealed to northern protestants citizens of old stock and much of the middle class.
among the few substantive issues on which the parties took clearly different stands were immigration matters.
republicans tended to support immigration restriction and to favor temperance legislation which many believed would help discipline immigrant communities.
catholics and immigrants viewed such proposals as assaults on them and their cultures and the democratic party followed their lead.
party identification then was usually more a reflection of cultural inclinations than a calculation of economic interest.
individuals might affiliate with a party because their parents had done so or because it was the party of their region their church or their ethnic group.
the national government one reason the parties avoided most substantive issues was that the federal government did relatively little.
the government in washington was responsible for delivering the mail maintaining a military conducting foreign policy and collecting tariffs and taxes.
it had few other responsibilities and few institutions capable of undertaking additional responsibilities even if it had chosen to do so.
there was one significant exception.
from the end of the civil war to the early twentieth century the federal government administered a system of annual pensions for retired union civil war veterans and their widows.
at its peak this pension system was making payments first pension system to a majority of the male citizens black and white of the north and to many women as well.
some reformers hoped to make the system permanent and universal others found it corrupt and expensive.
when the civil war generation died out the pension system died with it.
in most other respects the united states in the late nineteenth century was a society without a modern national government.
the most powerful institutions were the two political parties and the bosses and machines that dominated them and the federal courts.
from crisis to empire 457 presidents and patronage presidents in the late nineteenth century had great symbolic importance but they were unable to do very much except distribute government appointments.
a new president and his tiny staff had to make almost 100 000 appointments.
it sometimes proved impossible for a president to avoid factional conflict as the presidency of rutherford b hayes demonstrated.
by the end of his term two groups the stalwarts led by roscoe conkling of new york and the half breeds stalwarts and half breeds captained by james g blaine of maine were competing for control of the republican party.
rhetorically the stalwarts favored traditional professional machine politics while the halfbreeds favored reform.
in fact both groups were mainly interested in a larger share of patronage.
hayes tried to satisfy both and ended up satisfying neither.
the battle over patronage overshadowed all else during hayess unhappy presidency.
his one important substantive initiative an effort to create a civil service system attracted no support from either party.
and his early announcement that he would not seek reelection only weakened him further.
the republicans managed to retain the presidency in 1880 in part because they agreed on a ticket that included a stalwart and a half breed.
they nominated james a garfield a veteran congressman from ohio and a half breed for president and chester a arthur of new york a stalwart for vice president.
the democrats nominated general winfield scott hancock a minor civil war commander with no national following.
benefiting from the end of the recession of 1879 garfield won a decisive electoral victory although his popular vote margin was thin.
president chester a arthur although originally a stalwart arthur attempted to reform the spoils system.
in this puck cartoon he is catching heat from a variety of republican factions including the stalwarts and half breeds.
the library of congress 458 chapter 19 garfield began his presidency by defying the stalwarts and supporting civil service reform.
he soon found himself embroiled in an ugly public quarrel with conkling and the stalwarts.
the dispute was never resolved.
on july 2 1881 only four months after garfield assassinated his inauguration garfield was shot twice while standing in the washington railroad station by an apparently deranged gunman and unsuccessful office seeker who shouted i am a stalwart and arthur is president now garfield lingered for nearly three months but finally died.
garfields successor chester a arthur had spent his political lifetime as a devoted skilled and open spoilsman and a close ally of the new york political boss roscoe conkling.
but on becoming president he tried like hayes and garfield before him to follow an independent course and even to promote reform.
to the dismay of the stalwarts arthur kept most of garfields appointees in office and supported civil service reform.
in pendleton act 1883 congress passed the first national civil service measure the pendleton act which required that some federal jobs be filled by competitive written examinations rather than by patronage.
relatively few offices fell under civil service at first but its reach steadily widened.
cleveland harrison and the tariff in the unsavory election of 1884 the republican candidate for president was senator james g blaine of maine known to his admirers as the plumed knight but to many others as a symbol of seamy party politics.
a group of disgruntled liberal republicans known by their critics as the mugwumps announced that they would bolt the party and support an honest democrat.
rising to the bait the democrats nominated grover cleveland the reform governor of new york.
in a campaign filled with personal invective what may have decided the election was the last minute introduction of a religious controversy.
shortly before the election a delegation of protestant ministers called on blaine in new york city their spokesman dr samuel burchard referred to the democrats as the party of rum romanism and rebellion blaine was slow to repudiate burchards indiscretion and democrats quickly cleveland elected spread the news that blaine had tolerated a slander on the catholic church.
clevelands narrow victory probably resulted from an unusually heavy catholic vote for the democrats in new york.
grover cleveland was respected if not often liked for his stern and righteous opposition to politicians grafters pressure groups and tammany hall.
he embodied an era in which few americans believed the federal government could or should do very much.
cleveland had always doubted the wisdom of protective tariffs taxes on imported goods designed to protect domestic producers.
the existing high rates he believed were responsible for the annual surplus in federal revenues which was tempting congress to pass reckless and extravagant legislation which he frequently vetoed.
in december 1887 therefore he asked congress to reduce the tariff rates.
democrats in the house approved a tariff reduction but senate republicans defiantly passed a bill of their own actually raising the rates.
the resulting deadlock made the tariff an issue in the election of 1888.
the democrats renominated cleveland and supported tariff reductions.
endorsing protection republicans settled on former senator benjamin harrison of indiana who was obscure but respectable and the grandson of president william henry harrison.
it was harrison elected one of the most corrupt elections in american history.
cleveland won the popular vote by 100 000 but harrison won an electoral majority of 233 to 168.
from crisis to empire 459 new public issues benjamin harrisons record as president was little more substantial than that of his grandfather who had died a month after taking office.
harrison had few visible convictions and he made no effort to influence congress.
and yet during harrisons passive administration public opinion was beginning to force the government to confront some of the pressing social and economic issues of the day most notably the power of trusts.
by the mid 1880s fifteen western and southern states had adopted laws prohibiting combinations that restrained competition.
but corporations found it easy to escape limitations by incorporating in states such as new jersey and delaware that offered them special privileges.
if antitrust legislation was to be effective its supporters believed it would have to come from the national government.
in july 1890 both houses of congress passed the sherman antitrust act almost without dissent.
for over a sherman antitrust act decade after its passage the sherman act indifferently enforced and steadily weakened by the courts had no impact.
as of 1901 the justice department had instituted many antitrust suits against unions but only fourteen against business combinations.
the republicans were more interested in the issue they believed had won them the 1888 election the tariff.
representative william mckinley of ohio and senator nelson w aldrich of rhode island drafted the highest protective measure ever proposed to congress.
known as the mckinley tariff it became law in october 1890.
but republican leaders mckinley tariff apparently misinterpreted public sentiment.
many voters saw the high tariff as a way to enrich producers and starve consumers.
the party suffered a stunning reversal in the 1890 congressional election.
the republicans substantial senate majority was slashed to 8 in the house the party retained only 86 of the 332 seats losing its majority in that chamber.
nor were the republicans able to recover over the next two years.
in the presidential election of 1892 benjamin harrison once again supported protection grover cleveland renominated by the democrats once again opposed it.
a new third party the peoples party with james b weaver as its candidate advocated substantial economic reform.
cleveland won 277 electoral votes to harrisons 145 and had a popular margin of 380 000.
weaver ran far behind.
the policies of clevelands second term were much like those of his first.
again he supported a tariff reduction which the house approved but the senate weakened.
cleveland denounced the result but allowed it to become law as the wilson gorman tariff.
public pressure had been growing since the 1880s for other reforms among them regulation of the railroads.
farm organizations in the midwest most notably the grangers had persuaded several state legislatures to pass regulatory legislation in the early 1870s.
but in 1886 the supreme court in wabash st louis and pacific railway co v illinois known as the wabash case ruled one of the granger laws in illinois unconstitutional.
according to the court the law was an attempt to control interstate commerce and thus infringed on the exclusive power of congress.
later the courts limited the powers of the states to regulate commerce even within their own boundaries.
effective railroad regulation it was now clear could come only from the federal government.
congress responded to public pressure in 1887 with the interstate commerce act interstate commerce act which banned discrimination in rates between long and short hauls required that railroads publish their rate schedules and file them with the government and declared that all interstate rail rates must be reasonable and just a fiveperson agency the interstate commerce commission icc was to administer the act.
but it had to rely on the courts to enforce its rulings.
for almost twenty years after its passage the interstate commerce act which was like the sherman act haphazardly enforced and narrowly interpreted by the courts had little practical effect.
460 chapter 19 the agrarian revolt no group watched the performance of the federal government in the 1880s with greater dismay than american farmers.
they helped produce the populist upheaval one of the most powerful movements of political protest in american history.
the grangers farmers had been making efforts to organize politically for several decades before the 1880s.
the first major farm organization was the national grange of the patrons of husbandry founded in 1867.
from it emerged a network of local organizations that tried to teach new scientific agricultural techniques to their members.
when the depression of 1873 caused a sharp decline in farm prices membership rapidly increased and the direction of the organization changed.
granges in the midwest began to organize marketing cooperatives and to promote political action to curb monopolistic practices by railroads and warehouses.
at their peak grange supporters controlled the legislatures in most of the midwestern states.
the result was the granger laws of the early 1870s by which many states imposed strict regulations on railroad rates and practices.
but the destruction of the new regulations by the courts combined with the political inexperience of many grange leaders and the return of prosperity in the late 1870s produced a dramatic decline in the power of the association.
the farmers alliances as early as 1875 farmers in parts of the south were banding together in so called farmers alliances just as the granges were weakening.
by 1880 the southern alliance had more than 4 million members a comparable northwestern alliance was taking root in the plains states and the midwest largely replacing the grange.
like the granges the alliances formed cooperatives and other marketing mechanisms.
they established stores banks processing plants and other facilities to free their members from dependence on the hated furnishing merchants who kept so many farmers in debt.
some alliance leaders however saw the movement in larger terms as an effort to build a society in which economic competition might give way to cooperation.
alliance lecturers traveled throughout rural areas lambasting the concentrated power of great corporations and financial institutions.
although the alliances quickly became far more widespread than the granges had ever been they suffered from similar problems.
their cooperatives did not always work well partly because of mismanagement and partly because of the strength of opposing market forces.
these economic frustrations helped push the movement into a new phase at the end of the 1880s the creation of a national political organization.
in 1889 the southern and northwestern alliances agreed to a loose merger.
the next year the alliances held a national convention at ocala florida and issued the so called ocala demands ocala demands which were in effect a party platform.
in the 1890 off year elections candidates supported by the alliances won partial or complete control of the legislatures in twelve states.
they also won six governorships three seats in the u s senate and approximately fifty in the u s house of representatives.
many of the successful alliance candidates were democrats who had benefited often passively from from crisis to empire 461 the fiery populist orator mary e lease was a fixture on the alliance lecture circuit in the 1890s.
she made some 160 speeches in 1890 alone.
her critics called her the kansas pythoness but she was popular among farmers with her denunciations of banks railroads and middlemen and her famous advice to raise less corn and more hell corbis mary e lease alliance endorsements.
but dissident farmers drew enough encouragement from the results to contemplate further political action.
alliance leaders discussed plans for a third party at meetings in cincinnati in may 1891 and st louis in february 1892.
then in july 1892 1 300 exultant delegates poured into omaha nebraska to proclaim the creation of the new party approve an official set of principles and nominate candidates for the presidency and vice peoples party established presidency.
the new organizations official name was the peoples party but the movement was more commonly referred to as populism.
the election of 1892 demonstrated the potential power of the new movement.
the populist presidential candidate james b weaver of iowa a former greenbacker polled more than 1 million votes.
nearly 1 500 populist candidates won election to seats in state legislatures.
the party elected three governors five senators and ten congressmen.
it could also claim the support of many republicans and democrats in congress who had been elected by appealing to populist sentiment.
462 chapter 19 the populist constituency already however there were signs of the limits of populist strength.
populism had great appeal to farmers particularly to small farmers with little long range economic security.
but populism failed to move much beyond that group.
its leaders made energetic efforts to include labor within the coalition by courting the knights of labor and adding a labor plank to its platform.
but populism never attracted significant labor support in part because the economic interests of labor and the interests of farmers were often at odds.
in the south white populists struggled with the question of whether to accept african americans into the party.
there was an important black component to the movement a network of colored alliances that by 1890 numbered over 1 25 million members.
but most white populists accepted the assistance of african americans only as long as it was clear that whites would remain indisputably in control.
when southern conservatives began to attack the populists for undermining white supremacy the interracial character of the movement quickly faded.
populist ideas the populists spelled out their program first in the ocala demands of 1890 and then more clearly in the omaha platform of 1892.
they proposed a system of subtreasuries a network of government owned warehouses where farmers could deposit their crops to allow them to borrow money from the government at low rates of interest until the price the populists reform program of their goods went up.
in addition the populists called for the abolition of national banks which they believed were dangerous institutions of concentrated power the end of absentee ownership of land the direct election of united states senators which would weaken the power of conservative state legislatures and other devices to improve the ability of the people to influence the political process.
they called as well for regulation and after 1892 government ownership of railroads telephones and telegraphs.
and they demanded a system of government operated postal savings banks a graduated income tax the inflation of the currency and later the remonetization of silver.
some populists were anti semitic anti intellectual anti eastern and antiurban.
but bigotry was not the dominant force behind populism.
it was rather a serious and usually responsible effort to find solutions to real problems.
populists emphatically rejected the laissez faire orthodoxies of their time including the idea that the rights of ownership are absolute and in fact called on the federal government to promote a dramatic redistribution of wealth and power.
in short the populists raised one of the most overt and powerful challenges of the era to the direction in which american industrial capitalism was moving.
the crisis of the 1890s the agrarian protest was only one of many indications of the national political crisis emerging in the 1890s.
there was a severe depression widespread labor unrest and violence and the continuing failure of either major party to respond to the growing distress.
grover cleveland who took office for the second time just as the economy was collapsing remained convinced that any government action would be a violation of principle.
from crisis to empire 463 the panic of 1893 the panic of 1893 launched the most severe depression the nation had ever experienced.
it began in march 1893 when the philadelphia and reading railroad unable to meet payments on loans declared bankruptcy.
two months later the national cordage company failed as well.
together these two corporate failures triggered a stock market collapse.
and since many of the major new york banks were heavy investors in the market a wave of bank failures soon began.
that caused a contraction of credit which meant that many of the new aggressive and loan dependent businesses soon went bankrupt.
the depression reflected among other things the degree to which all parts of the american economy were now interconnected.
and it showed how dependent the economy was on the health of the railroads which remained the nations most powerful corporate and financial institutions.
when the railroads suffered as they did beginning in 1893 everyone suffered.
once the panic began it spread with startling speed.
within six months more than 8 000 businesses 156 railroads and 400 banks failed.
already low agricultural prices tumbled further.
up to 1 million workers 20 percent of the labor force lost their jobs.
the depression was unprecedented not only in its severity but also in its persistence.
although conditions improved slightly beginning in 1895 prosperity did not fully return until 1901.
the depression produced widespread social unrest especially among the enormous numbers of unemployed workers.
in 1894 jacob s coxey an ohio businessman and populist began advocating a massive public works program to create jobs for the unemployed.
jacob s coxey leads his army of unemployed men through the town of allegheny pennsylvania in 1894 en route to washington where he hoped to pressure congress to approve his plans for a massive public works program to put people back to work.
photo by fotosearch getty images coxeys army 464 chapter 19 when it became clear that congress was ignoring his proposals coxey organized a march of the unemployed known as coxeys army to washington d c to present his demands to the government.
congress continued to ignore them.
to many middle class americans the labor turmoil of the time the homestead and pullman strikes for example see chapter 17 was a sign of a dangerous instability even perhaps a revolution.
labor radicalism some of it real more of it imagined by the frightened middle class heightened the general sense of crisis among the public.
coxeys army the silver question the financial panic weakened the governments monetary system.
president cleveland believed that the instability of the currency was the primary cause of the depression.
the money question therefore became one of the burning issues of the era.
the debate centered on what would form the basis of the dollar what would lie behind it and give it value.
today the value of the dollar rests on little more than public confidence in the government.
but in the nineteenth century many people believed that currency was worthless if there was not something concrete behind it precious metal specie which holders of paper money could collect if they presented their currency to a bank or to the treasury.
during most of its existence as a nation the united states had recognized two metals gold and silver as a basis for the dollar a system known as bimetallism in the 1870s however that had changed.
the official ratio of the value of silver to the value of gold for purposes of creating currency the mint ratio was 16 to 1 sixteen ounces of silver equaled one ounce of gold.
but the actual commercial value of silver the market ratio was much higher than that.
owners of silver could get more by selling it for manufacture into jewelry and other objects than they could by taking it to the mint for conversion into coins.
so they stopped taking it to the mint and the mint stopped coining silver.
in 1873 congress passed a law that seemed simply to recognize the existing situation by officially discontinuing silver coinage.
few objected at the time.
but later in the 1870s the market value of silver fell well below the official mint ratio of 16 to 1.
silver was suddenly available for coinage again and it soon became clear that congress had foreclosed a potential method of expanding the currency.
before long many americans concluded that a conspiracy of big bankers had been responsible for the demonetization of silver and referred to the law as the crime of 73 two groups of americans were especially determined to undo the crime of 73.
one consisted of the silver mine owners now understandably eager to have the government take their surplus silver and pay them much more than the market price.
the other group consisted of discontented farmers who wanted an increase in the quantity of money an inflation of the currency as a means of raising the prices of farm products and easing payment of the farmers debts.
the inflationists demanded that the government return at once to the free and free silver advocates unlimited coinage of silver at the old ratio of 16 to 1.
congress responded weakly to these demands with the sherman silver purchase act of 1890 which required the government to purchase silver and pay for it in gold.
but the government allowed only existing silver coinage.
it did not allow any newly minted silver money.
at the same time the nations gold reserves were steadily dropping.
president cleveland believed that the chief cause of the weakening gold reserves was the sherman silver purchase act.
early in his second administration therefore congress responded to his request and repealed the sherman act although only after a bitter and divisive battle that helped create a split in the democratic party.
from crisis to empire 465 a cross of gold republicans watching the failure of the democrats to deal effectively with the depression were confident of success in 1896.
party leaders led by the ohio boss marcus a hanna settled on former congressman william mckinley author of the 1890 mckinley nominated tariff act and now governor of ohio as the partys presidential candidate.
the tariff they believed should be the key issue in the campaign.
but they also opposed the free coinage of silver except by agreement with the leading commercial nations which everyone realized was unlikely.
thirty four delegates from the mountain and plains states walked out of the convention in protest and joined the democratic party.
the cartoonist grant hamilton created this image of william jennings bryan shortly after he made his famous cross of gold speech at the democratic national convention which subsequently nominated him for president.
the cartoon highlights two of the most powerful images in bryans speech a crown of thorns and a cross of gold both biblical references and both designed to represent the oppression that the gold standard imposed on working people.
granger nyc all rights reserved.
bearing the cross of gold 466 chapter 19 the democratic convention of 1896 was unusually tumultuous.
southern and western delegates eager for a way to compete with the populists were determined to seize control of the party from conservative easterners incorporate some populist demands among them free silver into the democratic platform and nominate a pro silver candidate.
defenders of the gold standard seemed to dominate the debate until william jennings bryan a handsome thirty six year old congressman from nebraska mounted the podium to address the convention.
his great voice echoed through the hall as he delivered what became one of the bryans cross of gold speech most famous political speeches in american history.
the closing passage sent his audience into something close to a frenzy having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world supported by the commercial interests the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold it became known as the cross of gold speech.
in the glow of bryans speech the convention voted to adopt a pro silver platform.
and the following day bryan as he had eagerly and not entirely secretly hoped was nominated for president on the fifth ballot.
the choice of bryan and the democratic platform created a quandary for the populists.
they had expected both major parties to adopt conservative programs and nominate conservative candidates leaving the populists to represent the growing forces of protest.
but now the democrats had stolen much of their thunder.
the populists faced the choice of naming their own candidate and splitting the protest vote or endorsing bryan and losing their identity as a party.
many populists argued that fusion with the democrats would destroy their party.
but the majority concluded that there was no viable alternative.
amid considerable acrimony the convention voted to nominate bryan as the populist candidate.
the conservative victory the campaign of 1896 produced panic among conservatives.
the business and financial community frightened beyond reason at the prospect of a bryan victory contributed lavishly to the republican campaign.
from his home in canton ohio mckinley conducted a traditional front porch campaign by receiving pilgrimages of the republican faithful organized and paid for by hanna.
bryan showed no such restraint.
he became the first presidential candidate in american history to stump every section of the country systematically.
he traveled 18 000 miles and addressed an estimated 5 million people.
on election day mckinley polled 271 electoral votes to bryans 176 and received 51 1 percent of the popular vote to bryans 47 7.
bryan carried the areas of the south and west where miners or struggling staple farmers predominated.
the democratic program like that of the populists had been too narrow to win a national election.
for the populists and their allies the election results were a disaster.
they had gambled end of the peoples party everything on their fusion with the democratic party and lost.
within months of the election the peoples party began to dissolve.
mckinley and recovery the administration of william mckinley saw a return to relative calm.
one reason was the exhaustion of dissent.
another reason was the shrewd character of the mckinley administration itself committed as it was to reassuring stability.
most important however was the gradual easing of the economic crisis a development that undercut many of those who were agitating for change.

william mckinley won the election by a comfortable if not enormous margin but his victory was not broad based.
he carried all the states of the northeast and the industrial midwest along with california and oregon but virtually nothing else.
bryan carried the entire south and almost all of the agrarian west.
what campaign issues in 1896 helped account for the regional character of the results.
mckinley and his allies committed themselves fully to only one issue the need for higher tariff rates.
within weeks of his inauguration the administration won approval of the dingley tariff raising duties to the highest point in american history.
the administration dealt more gingerly with the explosive silver question an issue that mckinley himself had never considered very important.
he sent a commission to europe to explore the possibility of a silver agreement with great britain and france.
as he and everyone else anticipated the effort produced nothing.
the republicans then enacted the currency or gold standard act gold standard act of 1900 which confirmed the nations commitment to the gold standard.
and so the battle of the standards ended in victory for the forces of conservatism.
economic developments at the time seemed to vindicate the republicans.
prosperity began to return in 1898.
foreign crop failures drove farm prices upward and american business entered another cycle of expansion.
prosperity and the gold standard it seemed were closely allied.
but while the free silver movement had failed it had raised an important question for the american economy.
in the quarter century before 1900 the countries of the western world had experienced a spectacular growth in productive facilities and population.
yet the supply of money had not kept pace with economic progress.
had it not been for a dramatic increase in the gold supply in the late 1890s a result of new techniques for extracting gold from low content ores and the discovery of huge new gold deposits in alaska south africa and australia populist predictions of financial disaster might in fact have proved correct.
in 1898 two and a half times as much gold was produced as in 1890 and the currency supply was soon inflated far beyond anything bryan and the free silver forces had anticipated.
468 chapter 19 by then however bryan like many other americans was becoming engaged with another major issue the nations growing involvement in world affairs and its increasing flirtation with imperialism.
stirrings of imperialism as the nineteenth century drew to a close many americans hoped to translate the eras great industrial feats into global economic political and military power.
the depression of 1893 further pushed observers to call for greater overseas trade to stimulate the economy.
these expansionists some called them jingoes hoped to resume the course of manifest destiny.
the new manifest destiny in addition to their economic and political motivations jingoes believed that domestic tensions in the country might be resolved by a more robust foreign policy and stronger american nationalistic spirit or even by war.
it had been a generation since the civil war and some jingoes felt the nations masculinity had withered in the meantime.
mass industrial wage labor the same line of reasoning went had turned american workers from independent producers into faceless cogs in a machine.
some critics of woman suffrage thought it threatened to feminize and weaken the traditional male preserve of politics.
waves of immigration and wars of labor had divided the country.
a more stout assertion of power abroad jingoes hoped might restore american vitality and unity.
expansionists were also driven by competitive impulses.
americans were well aware of the imperialist fever that was raging through europe leading the major powers to partition much of africa among themselves and to turn eager eyes on the far east and the chinese empire.
see america in the world imperialism some americans feared that their nation would soon be left out of all these potential markets.
scholars and others found a philosophic justification for expansionism in charles darwins theories.
they contended that nations or races like biological species struggled constantly for existence and that only the fittest could survive.
for strong nations to dominate weak ones was therefore in accordance with the laws of nature.
the most effective apostle of imperialism was alfred thayer mahan a captain and later admiral in the united states navy.
mahans thesis presented in the influence of sea power upon history 1890 and other works was simple counsea power and colonies tries with sea power were the great nations of history.
effective sea power required among other things colonies.
mahan believed that the united states should at the least acquire defensive bases in the caribbean and the pacific and take possession of hawaii and other pacific islands.
he feared that the united states did not have a large enough navy to play the great role he envisioned.
but during the 1870s and 1880s the government launched a shipbuilding program that by 1898 had moved the united states to fifth place among the worlds naval powers and by 1900 to third place.
hawaii and samoa the islands of hawaii in the mid pacific had been an important way station for american ships in the china trade since the early nineteenth century.
by the 1880s officers of the expanding united states navy were looking covetously at pearl harbor on the island of from crisis to empire 469 oahu as a possible permanent base for u s ships.
the growing number of americans who had taken up residence on the islands also pressed for an increased american presence in hawaii.
settled by polynesian people beginning in about 1500 b c hawaii had developed an agricultural and fishing society in which different islands and different communities on the same islands each with its own chieftain lived more or less self sufficiently.
when the first americans arrived in hawaii in the 1790s on merchant ships from new england there were perhaps half a million people living there.
battles among rival communities were frequent as ambitious chieftains tried to consolidate power over their neighbors.
first sugar plantation in 1810 after a series of such battles king kamehameha i established his dominance welcomed american traders and helped them develop a thriving trade between hawaii and china.
but americans soon wanted more than trade.
missionaries began settling there in the early nineteenth century and in the 1830s william hooper a boston trader became the first of many americans to buy land and establish a sugar plantation on the islands.
the arrival of these merchants missionaries and planters was devastating to traditional hawaiian society.
the newcomers inadvertently brought infectious diseases to which the hawaiians like the american indians before them were tragically vulnerable.
by the mid nineteenth century more than half the native population had died.
the americans brought other incursions as well.
missionaries worked to replace native religion with christianity.
other white settlers introduced liquor firearms and a commercial economy all of which eroded the traditional character of hawaiian society.
by the 1840s american planters had spread throughout the islands and an american settler g p judd had become prime minister of hawaii under king kamehameha iii who had agreed to establish a constitutional monarchy.
judd governed hawaii for over a decade.
in 1887 the united states negotiated a treaty with hawaii that permitted it to open a naval base at pearl harbor.
by then growing sugar for export to america had become the basis of the hawaiian economy as a result of an 1875 agreement allowing hawaiian sugar to enter the united states duty free.
the american dominated sugar plantation system displaced native hawaiians from their lands and relied heavily on asian immigrants whom the americans considered more reliable and more docile than the natives.
native hawaiians did not accept their subordination without protest.
in 1891 they elevated a powerful nationalist to the throne queen liliuokalani who queen liliuokalani set out to challenge the growing american control of the islands.
but she remained in power only two years.
in 1890 the united states had eliminated the exemption from american tariffs in hawaiian sugar trade.
the result was devastating to the economy of the islands and american planters concluded that the only way for them to recover was to become part of the united states and hence exempt from its tariffs.
in 1893 they staged a revolution and called on the united states for protection.
after the american minister ordered marines from a warship in honolulu harbor to go ashore to aid the american rebels the queen yielded her authority.
a provisional government dominated by americans immediately sent a delegation to washington to negotiate a treaty of annexation.
debate over the treaty hawaii annexed continued until 1898 when congress finally approved the agreement.
three thousand miles south of hawaii the samoan islands had also long served as a way station for american ships in the pacific trade.
as american commerce with asia increased business groups in the united states regarded samoa with new interest and the american navy began eyeing the samoan harbor at pago pago.
in 1878 the hayes administration extracted a treaty from samoan leaders for an american naval station at pago pago.
america in the world imperialism empires were not of course new to the nineteenth century when the united states acquired its first overseas colonies.
they had existed since the early moments of recorded history and they have continued into our own time.
but in the second half of the nineteenth century the construction of empires took on a new form and the word imperialism emerged for the first time to describe it.
in many places european powers now created colonies not by sending large numbers of migrants to settle and populate new lands but instead by creating military political and business structures that allowed them to dominate and profit from the existing populations.
this new imperialism changed the character of the colonizing nations enriching them greatly and producing new classes of people whose lives were shaped by the demands of imperial business and administration.
it changed the character of colonized societies even more drawing them into the vast nexus of global industrial capitalism and introducing western customs institutions and technologies to the subject peoples.
as the popularity of empire grew in the west efforts to justify it grew as well.
champions of imperialism argued that the acquisition of colonies was essential for the health even the survival of their own industrializing nations.
colonies were sources of raw materials vital to industrial production they were markets for manufactured goods and they were suppliers of cheap labor.
defenders of empire also argued that imperialism was good for the colonized people.
many saw colonization as an opportunity to export christianity to heathen lands and new missionary movements emerged in europe and america in response.
more secular apologists argued that imperialism 470 helped bring colonized people into the modern world.
the invention of steamships railroads telegraphs and other modern vehicles of transportation and communication the construction of canals particularly the suez canal completed in 1869 and the panama canal completed in 1914 the creation of new military technologies repeating rifles machine guns and modern artillery all contributed to the ability of western nations to reach conquer and control distant lands.
the greatest imperial power of the nineteenth century was great britain.
by 1800 despite its recent loss of the colonies that became the united states it already possessed vast territory in north america the caribbean and the pacific.
in the second half of the nineteenth century britain greatly expanded its empire.
its most important acquisition was india one of the largest and most populous countries in the world and a nation in which great britain had long exerted informal authority.
in 1857 when native indians revolted against british influence british forces brutally crushed the rebellion and established formal colonial control over india.
british officials backed by substantial military power now governed india through a large civil service staffed mostly by people from england and scotland but with some indians serving in minor positions.
the british invested heavily in railroads telegraphs canals harbors and agricultural improvements to enhance the economic opportunities available to them.
they created schools for indian children in an effort to draw them into british culture and make them supporters of the imperial system.
the british also extended their empire into africa and other parts of asia.
the great imperial champion cecil rhodes expanded a small existing british colony at siege of delhi the indian mutiny which lasted from 1857 to 1859 was a major uprising against the rule of the british east india company with indians fighting on both sides.
the uprising ended over a century of indirect rule by the company and resulted in the british crown taking direct control over india.
administration of the british empire in india became known as the raj from the indian word for rule ingram publishing capetown into a substantial colony that included much of what is now south africa.
in 1895 he added new british territories to the north which he named rhodesia and which today are zimbabwe and zambia.
others spread british authority into kenya uganda nigeria and much of egypt.
british imperialists also extended the empire into east asia with the acquisition of singapore hong kong burma and malaya and they built a substantial presence although not formal colonial rule in china.
other european states watching the vast expansion of the british empire quickly jumped into the race for colonies.
france created colonies in indochina vietnam and laos algeria west africa and madagascar.
belgium moved into the congo in west africa.
germany established colonies in the cameroons tanganyika and other parts of africa and in the pacific islands north of australia.
dutch italian portuguese spanish russian and japanese imperialists created colonies as well in africa asia and the pacific driven both by a calculation of their own commercial interests and by the frenzied competition that had developed among rival imperial powers.
in 1898 the united states was drawn into the imperial race in part inadvertently as an unanticipated result of the spanish american war.
but the drive to acquire colonies resulted as well from the deliberate efforts of home grown proponents of empire among them theodore roosevelt who believed that in the modern industrial imperial world a nation without colonies would have difficulty remaining or becoming a true great power.

what motivated the european nations drive for empire in the late nineteenth century.
why was great britain so successful in acquiring its vast empire.
how do the imperial efforts and ambitions of the united states at the end of the nineteenth century compare with those of european powers.
471 472 chapter 19 great britain and germany were also interested in the islands and they too secured treaty rights from the native princes.
for the next ten years the three powers jockeyed for samoa divided dominance in samoa finally agreeing to create a tripartite protectorate over samoa with the native chiefs exercising only nominal authority.
the three way arrangement failed to halt the rivalries of its members and in 1899 the united states and germany divided the islands between them compensating britain with territories elsewhere in the pacific.
the united states retained the harbor at pago pago.
war with spain imperial ambitions had thus begun to stir within the united states well before the late 1890s.
but a war with spain in 1898 turned those stirrings into overt expansionism.
controversy over cuba spains once formidable empire had grown rickety but still included two prized island possessions cuba ninety miles off the shores of florida and the philippines in asia.
as in many imperial holdings the native peoples in these regions objected to the presence of european colonizers and occasionally waged insurrections.
one rebellion in cuba had ended in 1878 with spanish rule intact.
nominal cuban control over the economy followed but the depression of the 1890s led spain to withdraw even that privilege.
in 1895 cuban revolt cuban revolutionaries mounted a new insurrection led by the revolutionary poet jos mart and military heroes of the earlier wars of liberation.
the rebellion soon attracted the sympathies of people in the united states.
popular newspapers reported horrific atrocities committed by the spanish against cuban rebels and civilians.
the spanish governor since 1896 general valeriano weyler was rounding up cubans in detention camps to isolate rebels in the countryside and then destroying agriculture to starve them out.
these policies of the butcher led to the deaths of tens of thousands of cuban civilians.
the conflict also imperiled the american owned sugar plantations in cuba and regional commerce more broadly.
and ever since the articulation of the monroe doctrine in 1823 americans had dreamed of ridding north and south america of european colonizers.
some hoped to replace the spanish with a heavy american presence in the region while others including william jennings bryan and other prominent democrats and members of congress wished only to liberate cuba and leave it to the cubans.
the conflict in cuba came at a particularly opportune moment for the publishers of some american newspapers joseph pulitzer with his new york world and william randolph hearst with his new york journal.
in the 1890s hearst and pulitzer were engaged in a ruthless circulation war and they both sent batteries of reporters and illustrators to cuba with orders to provide accounts of spanish atrocities.
this sort of sensationalist reporting was known as yellow journalism.
see patterns of popular culture yellow journalism although president cleveland worried about the potential disruptions of american trade he did not intervene.
nor at first did his successor william mckinley.
both men shared the commercial and humanitarian concerns but sought to avoid war with a european power.
an irritated theodore roosevelt the assistant secretary of the navy excoriated president mckinley for his un masculine weakness charging that he had no more backbone than a chocolate clair from crisis to empire 473 the situation changed in early 1898.
in january pro spanish cubans rioted in havana against the idea of a free cuba or cuba libre which the two american political parties had at least rhetorically supported even as successive u s administrations remained neutral.
thus the riots carried anti american undertones and president mckinley under pressure from the popular media after unfulfilled promises from spain sent the u s s.
maine to havana harbor to protect american citizens.
on february 15 1898 the maine the ship exploded killing 266 americans.
although later investigations revealed it likely an accident most americans egged on by the jingoistic press blamed the spanish.
for all the earlier arguments about humanity commerce and geopolitical strategy the destruction of the maine challenged american honor.
a democrat in the house voted for war to defend the honor and maintain the dignity of this republic a republican sought peace with honor on april 25 congress passed a resolution calling for war against the spanish.
it included the teller amendment named for democratic senator teller amendment henry t teller from colorado which swore off any intentions to occupy possess or control cuba after a future victory against the spanish.
a splendid little war the american ambassador to england john hay called the ensuing spanish american conflict a splendid little war an opinion that most americans with the exception of many of the enlisted men who fought in it seemed to share.
declared in april it was over in august in part because cuban rebels had already greatly weakened the spanish resistance making the american intervention in many respects little more than a mopping up exercise.
only 460 americans were killed in battle or died of wounds although some 5 200 others perished of disease malaria dysentery and typhoid among others.
casualties among cuban insurgents who continued to bear the brunt of the fighting were much higher.
the american war effort was not without difficulties.
united states soldiers faced serious supply problems a shortage of modern rifles and ammunition uniforms too heavy for the warm caribbean weather inadequate medical services and skimpy almost indigestible food.
the regular army numbered only 28 000 troops and officers most of whom had experience in quelling indian outbreaks but none in larger scale warfare.
that meant that as in the civil war the united states had to rely heavily on national guard units organized by local communities and commanded for the most part by local leaders without military experience.
a significant proportion of the american invasion force consisted of black soldiers.
some were volunteer troops put together by african american communities.
others were members of the four black regiments in the regular army who had been stationed on the frontier to defend white settlements against indians and were now transferred east to fight in cuba.
as the black soldiers traveled through the south toward the training camps some resisted the rigid segregation to which they were subjected.
african american soldiers in georgia deliberately made use of a whites only park in florida they beat a soda fountain operator for refusing to racial tensions in the military serve them in tampa white provocations and black retaliation led to a nightlong riot that left thirty wounded.
racial tensions continued in cuba.
african americans played crucial roles in some of the important battles of the war including the famous charge at san juan hill and won many medals.
nearly half the cuban insurgents fighting with the americans were themselves black patterns of popular culture yellow journalism joseph pulitzer was a successful newspaper publisher in st louis missouri when he traveled to new york city in 1883 to buy a struggling paper the new york world.
there is room in this great and growing city he wrote in one of his first editorials for a journal that is not only cheap but bright not only bright but large not only large but truly democratic.
that will serve and battle for the people with earnest sincerity within a year the worlds daily circulation had soared from 10 000 to over 60 000.
by 1886 it had reached 250 000 and was making enormous profits.
the success of pulitzers world marked the birth of what came to be known as yellow journalism a phrase that reportedly derived from a character in one of the world s comic strips the yellow kid color printing in newspapers was relatively new and yellow was the most difficult color to print so in the beginning the term yellow journalism was a comment on the new technological possibilities that pulitzer was so eagerly embracing.
eventually however it came to refer to a sensationalist style of reporting and writing that spread quickly through urban america and changed the character of newspapers forever.
sensationalism was not new to journalism in the late nineteenth century of course.
political scandal sheets had been publishing lurid stories since before the american revolution.
but the yellow journalism of the 1880s and 1890s took the search for a mass audience to new levels.
the world created one of the first sunday editions with lavishly colored special sections comics and illustrated features.
it expanded coverage of sports fashion 474 l iterature and theater.
it pioneered large glaring overheated headlines that captured the eyes of people who were passing newsstands.
it published exposs of political corruption.
it made considerable efforts to bring drama and energy to its coverage of crime.
it tried to involve readers directly in its stories as when a world campaign helped raise 300 000 to build a base for the statue of liberty with much of the money coming in donations of five or ten cents from working class readers.
and it introduced a self consciously populist style of writing that appealed to working class readers.
the american people want something terse forcible picturesque striking pulitzer said.
his reporters wrote short forceful sentences.
they did not shy away from expressing sympathy or outrage.
and they were not always constrained by the truth.
pulitzer very quickly produced imitators the most important of them the california publisher william randolph hearst who in 1895 bought the new york journal cut its price to one cent pulitzer quickly followed suit copied many of the worlds techniques and within a year raised its circulation to 400 000.
hearst soon made the journal the largest circulation paper in the country selling more than a million copies a day.
pulitzer whose own circulation was not far behind accused him of pandering to the worst tastes of the prurient and the horrorloving and dealing in bogus news but the world wasted no time before imitating the journal.
the competition between these two great yellow journals soon drove both to new levels of sensationalism.
their success drove newspapers in other cities around the nation to copy their techniques.
the civil war in cuba in the 1890s gave both papers their best opportunities yet for combining sensational reporting with shameless appeals to patriotism and moral outrage.
they avidly published exaggerated reports of spanish atrocities toward the cuban rebels fanning popular anger toward spain.
when the american battleship maine mysteriously exploded in havana harbor in 1898 both papers without any evidence immediately blamed spanish authorities.
the journal offered a 50 000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the explosion and it crowded all other stories off its front page there is no other news hearst told his editors to make room for such screaming headlines as the whole country thrills with war fever and havana populace insults the memory of the maine victims.
in the three days following the maine explosion the journal sold more than 3 million copies a new worlds record for newspaper circulation.
in the aftermath of the maine episode the more conservative press launched a spirited attack on yellow journalism.
that was partly in response to hearsts boast that the conflict in cuba was the journals war he sent a cable to one of his reporters in cuba saying you furnish the pictures and ill furnish the war growing numbers of critics tried to discourage yellow journalism which respectable editors both deplored and feared.
some schools libraries and clubs began to banish the papers from their premises.
but the techniques the yellow press pioneered in the 1890s helped map the way for a tradition of colorful popular journalism later embodied in tabloids some elements of which eventually found their way into television news that has endured into the present day.

seizing the philippines by an accident of history the assistant secretary of the navy during the cuban revolution was theodore roosevelt an ardent anglophile eager to see the united states join the british and other nations as imperial powers.
roosevelt was in fact a relatively minor figure in the navy department but he was determined to expand his power.
british friends had persuaded him that the war in cuba gave the united states a rare opportunity to expand the american empire.
roosevelt responded by sending the navys pacific fleet to the philippines with orders to attack as soon as america declared war.
on may 1 1898 commodore george dewey led the fleet into manila harbor quickly destroyed the aging spanish fleet and forced the spanish government to surrender manila with hardly a shot fired.
he became the first american hero of the war.
the battle for cuba cuba remained the principal focus of american military efforts.
at first the american commanders planned a long period of training before actually sending troops into combat.
but when a spanish fleet under admiral pascual cervera slipped past the american navy into santiago harbor on the southern coast of cuba plans changed quickly.
the american atlantic fleet quickly bottled cervera up in the harbor.
and the u s armys commanding general nelson a.
miles hastily altered his strategy and left tampa in june with a force of 17 000 to attack santiago.
general william r shafter the american commander moved toward santiago which he planned to surround and capture.
on the way he met and defeated spanish forces at las guasimos and a week later in two simultaneous battles el caney and san juan hill.
at the center of the fighting and on the front pages of the newspapers during many of the rough riders these engagements was a cavalry unit known as the rough riders.
nominally commanded by general leonard wood its real leader was colonel theodore roosevelt who had resigned from the navy department to get into the war and who had struggled with an almost desperate fury to get his regiment into the fighting.
his passion to join the war undoubtedly reflected the decision of his beloved father theodore roosevelt sr not to fight in the civil war a source of private shame within the family that his son sought to erase.
roosevelt rapidly emerged as a hero of the conflict.
his fame rested in large part on his role in leading a bold if perhaps reckless charge up kettle hill a minor part of the larger battle for the adjacent san juan hill directly into the face of spanish guns.
roosevelt himself emerged unscathed but nearly a hundred of his soldiers were killed or wounded.
he remembered the battle as the great day of my life although shafter was now in position to assault santiago his army was so weakened by sickness that he feared he might have to abandon his position.
but unknown to the americans the spanish government had by now decided that santiago was lost and had ordered cervera to evacuate.
on july 3 cervera tried to escape the harbor.
the waiting american squadron destroyed his entire fleet.

what were the implications of the war in cuba for puerto rico.
478 chapter 19 in puerto rico and occupied it against virtually no opposition.
on august 12 an armistice ended the war.
under the terms of the armistice spain recognized the independence of puerto rico occupied cuba ceded puerto rico and the pacific island of guam to the united states and accepted continued american occupation of manila pending the final disposition of the philippines.
puerto rico and the united states the island of puerto rico had been a part of the spanish empire since 1508.
by the early seventeenth century the native people of the island the arawaks had largely disappeared as a result of infectious diseases spanish brutality and poverty.
puerto rican society developed therefore with a spanish ruling class and a large african workforce for the coffee and sugar plantations that came to dominate its economy.
puerto rican resistance to spanish rule began to emerge in the nineteenth century.
the resistance prompted some reforms the abolition of slavery in 1873 representation in the spanish parliament and other changes.
demands for independence continued to grow and in 1898 spain granted the island a degree of independence.
but before the changes had any chance to take effect control of puerto rico shifted to the united states.
american military forces occupied the island during the spanish american war and they remained foraker act in control until 1900 when the foraker act ended military rule and established a formal colonial government.
agitation for independence continued and in 1917 congress passed the jones act which declared puerto rico to be united states territory and made all puerto ricans american citizens.
the puerto rican sugar industry flourished as it took advantage of the american market that was now open to it without tariffs.
as in hawaii americans from the mainland began establishing large sugar plantations on the island and hired natives to work them.
the growing emphasis on sugar as a cash crop and the transformation of many puerto rican farmers into paid laborers led to a reduction in the growing of food for the island and greater reliance on imported goods.
when international sugar prices were high puerto rico did well.
when they dropped the islands economy sagged pushing the many plantation workers already poor into destitution.
the debate over the philippines although the annexation of puerto rico produced relatively little controversy the annexation of the philippines created an impassioned debate.
controlling a nearby caribbean island fit reasonably comfortably into the united states sense of itself as the dominant power in the western hemisphere.
but to many americans controlling a large and densely populated territory thousands of miles away seemed very different and more ominous.
mckinley claimed to be reluctant to support annexation.
but according to his own accounts he came to believe there were no acceptable alternatives.
returning the the philippines question philippines to spain would be cowardly and dishonorable he claimed.
turning them over to another imperialist power france germany or britain would be bad business and discreditable granting them independence would be irresponsible because the filipinos were unfit for self government the only solution was to take them all and to educate the filipinos and uplift and christianize them and by gods grace do the very best we could by them from crisis to empire 479 in this puck cartoon president mckinley is favorably depicted as a tailor meaning his client for a suit is large enough to accommodate the new possessions the united states obtained in the aftermath of the spanish american war.
the stripes on uncle sams pants bear the names of earlier less controversial acquisitions such as the louisiana purchase.
the library of congress measuring uncle sam for a new suit the treaty of paris signed in december 1898 confirmed the terms of the armistice and brought a formal end to the war.
american negotiators had startled the spanish by demanding that they also cede the philippines to the united states but an american offer of 20 million for the islands softened their resistance.
they accepted all the american terms.
in the united states senate however resistance was fierce.
during debate over ratification of the treaty a powerful anti imperialist movement arose to oppose acquisition of the philippines.
the anti imperialists included some of the anti imperialist league nations wealthiest and most powerful figures andrew carnegie mark twain samuel gompers senator john sherman and others.
some anti imperialists believed that imperialism was immoral a repudiation of americas commitment to human freedom.
others feared polluting the american population by introducing inferior asian races into it.
industrial workers feared being undercut by a flood of cheap laborers from the new colonies.
conservatives worried about the large standing army and entangling foreign alliances that they believed imperialism would require and that they feared would threaten american liberties.
sugar growers and other anti imperialists feared unwelcome competition from the new territories.
the anti imperialist league established late in 1898 by upper class bostonians new yorkers and others to fight against annexation waged a vigorous campaign against ratification of the paris treaty see consider the source platform of the anti imperialist league.
but favoring ratification was an equally varied group.
there were the exuberant imperialists such as theodore roosevelt who saw the acquisition of empire as a way to reinvigorate the nation.
some businessmen saw opportunities to dominate the asian trade.
most republicans saw partisan advantages in acquiring valuable new territories through a war fought and won by a republican administration.
perhaps the arguments for annexation strongest argument in favor of annexation however was that the united states already possessed the islands.
co ns ider t he s o urc e platform of the american anti imperialist league 1899 as part of their campaign against the annexation of the philippines by the united states members of the anti imperialist league circulated this party platform.
here they argue that american political ideals are not compatible with imperialist actions.
we hold that the policy known as imperialism is hostile to liberty and tends toward militarism an evil from which it has been our glory to be free.
we regret that it has become necessary in the land of washington and lincoln to reaffirm that all men of whatever race or color are entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
we maintain that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.
we insist that the subjugation of any people is criminal a ggression and open disloyalty to the distinctive principles of our government.
we earnestly condemn the policy of the present national administration in the philippines.
it seeks to extinguish the spirit of 1776 in those islands.
we deplore the sacrifice of our soldiers and sailors whose bravery deserves admiration even in an unjust war.
we denounce the slaughter of the filipinos as a needless horror.
we protest against the extension of american sovereignty by spanish methods.
we demand the immediate cessation of the war against liberty begun by spain and continued by us.
we urge that congress be promptly convened to announce to the filipinos our purpose to concede to them the independence for which they have so long fought and which of right is theirs.
the united states have always protested against the doctrine of international law which permits the subjugation of the weak by the strong.
a self governing state cannot 480 accept sovereignty over an unwilling people.
the united states cannot act upon the ancient heresy that might makes right.
imperialists assume that with the destruction of self government in the philippines by american hands all opposition here will cease.
this is a grievous error.
much as we abhor the war of criminal aggression in the philippines greatly as we regret that the blood of the filipinos is on american hands we more deeply resent the betrayal of american institutions at home.
the real firing line is not in the suburbs of manila.
the foe is of our own household.
the attempt of 1861 was to divide the country.
that of 1899 is to destroy its fundamental principles and noblest ideals.
whether the ruthless slaughter of the filipinos shall end next month or next year is but an incident in a contest that must go on until the declaration of independence and the constitution of the united states are rescued from the hands of their betrayers.
those who dispute about standards of value while the republic is undermined will be listened to as little as those who would wrangle about the small economies of the household while the house is on fire.
the training of a great people for a century the aspiration for liberty of a vast immigration are forces that will hurl aside those who in the delirium of conquest seek to destroy the character of our institutions.
we deny that the obligation of all citizens to support their government in times of grave national peril applies to the present situation.
if an administration may with impunity ignore the issues upon which it was chosen deliberately create a condition of war anywhere on the face of the globe d ebauch the civil service for spoils to promote the adventure organize a truth suppressing censorship and demand of all citizens a suspension of judgment and their unanimous support while it chooses to continue the fighting representative government itself is imperiled.
we propose to contribute to the defeat of any person or party that stands for the forcible subjugation of any people.
we shall oppose for reelection all who in the white house or in congress betray american liberty in pursuit of un american gains.
we still hope that both of our great political parties will support and defend the declaration of independence in the closing campaign of the century.

when anti imperialists warned of the danger of acquiring heavily populated territories whose people might have to become citizens the jingoes had a ready answer the nations long standing policies toward indians treating them as dependents rather than as citizens had created a precedent for annexing land without absorbing people.
the fate of the treaty remained in doubt for weeks until it received the unexpected support of william jennings bryan a fervent anti imperialist.
he backed ratification because he hoped to move the issue out of the senate and make it the subject of a national referendum in 1900 when he expected to be the democratic presidential candidate again.
bryan persuaded a number of anti imperialist democrats to support the treaty so as to set up the 1900 debate.
the senate ratified it finally on february 6 1899.
but bryan miscalculated.
if the election of 1900 was in fact a referendum on the philippines as bryan expected it proved beyond a doubt that the nation election of 1900 had decided in favor of imperialism.
once again bryan ran against mckinley and once again mckinley won even more decisively than in 1896.
it was not only the issue of the colonies however that ensured mckinleys victory.
the republicans benefited from growing prosperity and also from the colorful personality of their vice presidential candidate theodore roosevelt the hero of san juan hill.
the republic as empire the new american empire was small by the standards of the great imperial powers of europe.
but it embroiled the united states in the politics of both europe and the far east in ways the nation had always tried to avoid in the past.
it also drew americans into a brutal war in the philippines.
governing the colonies three american dependencies hawaii alaska and puerto rico presented relatively few problems.
they received territorial status and their residents american citizenship relatively quickly hawaii in 1900 alaska in 1912 and puerto rico in 1917.
the navy took control of the pacific islands of guam and tutuila.
the united states simply left 481 482 chapter 19 alone some of the smallest least populated pacific islands now under its control.
cuba was a thornier problem.
american military forces commanded by general leonard wood remained there until 1902 to prepare the island for independence.
americans built roads schools and hospitals reorganized the legal financial and administrative systems and introduced medical and sanitation reforms.
but the united states also laid the basis for years of american economic domination of the island.
when cuba drew up a constitution that made no reference to the united states platt amendment congress responded by passing the platt amendment in 1901 and pressuring cuba into incorporating its terms into its constitution.
the platt amendment barred cuba from making treaties with other nations gave the united states the right to intervene in cuba to preserve independence life and property and required cuba to permit american naval stations on its territory.
the amendment left cuba with only nominal political independence.
american capital made the new nation an american economic appendage as well.
american investors poured into cuba buying up plantations factories railroads and refineries.
resistance to yankee imperialism produced intermittent revolts against the cuban government revolts that at times prompted u s military intervention.
american troops occupied the island from 1906 to 1909 after one such rebellion they returned again in 1912 to suppress a revolt by black plantation workers.
as in puerto rico and hawaii sugar production spurred by access to the american market increasingly dominated the islands economy and subjected it to the same cycle of booms and busts that plagued other sugar producing appendages of the united states economy.
the philippine war like other imperial powers the united states soon discovered that subjugating another people was not an easy task.
the american experience in the philippines began with a long and bloody war.
the conflict in the philippines is the least remembered of all american wars.
it was also one of the longest.
it lasted from 1898 to 1902 and it was one of the most vicious.
it involved 200 000 american troops and resulted in 4 300 american deaths.
the number of filipinos killed in the conflict has long been a matter of dispute but it seems likely that at least 50 000 natives and perhaps many more died.
the american occupiers faced brutal guerrilla tactics in the philippines and they soon found themselves drawn into the same pattern of brutality that had outraged so many americans when weyler had used them in the caribbean.
the filipinos had rebelled against spanish rule before 1898 and as soon as they realized the americans had come to stay they rebelled against them as well.
ably led by emilio aguinaldo emilio aguinaldo who claimed to head the legitimate government of the nation filipinos harried the american army of occupation from island to island for more than three years.
at first american commanders believed the rebels had only a small popular following.
but by early 1900 general arthur macarthur an american commander in the islands and father of general douglas macarthur was writing i have been reluctantly compelled to believe that the filipino masses are loyal to aguinaldo and the government which he heads to macarthur and others that realization was not a reason to moderate american tactics or conciliate the rebels but rather to adopt much more severe measures.
gradually the american military effort became more systematically vicious and brutal.

the new attraction of imperialism persuaded the united states to annex hawaii in 1898.
the war itself gave america control of the philippines guam and other smaller spanish possessions in the pacific.
when added to the small scattered islands that the united states had acquired as naval bases earlier in the nineteenth century these new possessions gave the nation a far flung pacific empire even if one whose total territory and population remained small by the standards of the other great empires of the age.
what was the reaction in the united states to the acquisition of this new empire.
guerrillas were treated not as prisoners of war but as murderers.
many were summarily executed.
on some islands entire communities were evacuated the residents forced into concentration camps while american troops destroyed their villages.
a spirit of savagery grew among some american soldiers who came to view the filipinos as almost subhuman and at times seemed to take pleasure in arbitrarily killing them.
the racial undertones of the war american soldiers called the filipinos niggers were particularly grating for african american troops serving in segregated units.
they were hardly unaware that at home southern states and lynch mobs were in the process of disenfranchising and terrorizing black people.
some noticed a resemblance between the attitude of the american military and government toward the filipino natives and popular attitudes toward african americans and native americans.
by 1902 reports of the brutality and of the american casualties had soured the american public on the war.
but by then the rebellion had largely exhausted itself and the occupiers had established control over most of the islands.
the key to their victory was the march 1901 capture of aguinaldo who later signed a document urging his followers to stop fighting and declared his own allegiance to the united states.
fighting continued intermittently until as late as 1906 but american possession of the philippines was now secure.
in the summer of 1901 the military transferred authority over the islands 484 chapter 19 to william howard taft who became their first civilian governor and gave the filipinos broad local autonomy.
the americans also built roads schools bridges and sewers instituted major administrative and financial reforms and established a public health sysgradual shift to self rule tem.
filipino self rule gradually increased and on july 4 1946 the islands finally gained their independence.
the open door the american acquisition of the philippines increased the already strong u s interest in asia.
americans were particularly concerned about the future of china which provided a tempting target for exploitation by stronger countries.
by 1900 england france germany russia and japan were beginning to carve up china among themselves pressuring the chinese government for concessions that gave them effective control over various regions of china.
in some cases they simply seized chinese territory and claimed it as their own.
many americans feared that the process would soon cut them out of the china trade altogether.
eager for a way to advance american interests in china without risking war mckinley issued a statement in september 1898 saying the united states wanted access to china but no special advantages there.
asking only the open door for ourselves we are ready to accord the open door to others the next year secretary of state john hay translated those words into policy when he addressed identical messages which hays open door notes became known as the open door notes to england germany russia france japan and italy.
he asked that each nation with a sphere of influence in china allow other nations to trade freely and equally in its sphere.
the principles hay outlined would allow the united states to trade freely with china without fear of interference.
europe and japan received the open door proposals coolly.
russia openly rejected them the other powers claimed to accept them in principle but to be unable to act unless all the other powers agreed.
hay refused to consider this a rebuff.
he boldly announced that all the powers had accepted the principles of the open door in final and definitive form and that the united states expected them to observe those principles.
no sooner had the diplomatic maneuvering over the open door ended than the boxers a secret chinese martial arts society with highly nationalist convictions and a somewhat mystical vision of their invulnerability to bullets launched a revolt against foreigners in boxer rebellion china.
the boxer rebellion spread widely across eastern china attacking westerners wherever they could find them including many christian missionaries.
but the climax of the revolt was a siege of the entire western foreign diplomatic corps which took refuge in the british embassy in peking.
the imperial powers including the united states sent an international expeditionary force into china to rescue the diplomats.
in august 1900 it fought its way into the city and broke the siege.
the boxer rebellion became an important event for the role of the united states in china.
mckinley and hay had agreed to american participation in quelling the boxer rebellion in order to secure a voice in the settlement of the uprising and prevent the partition of china by the european powers.
hay now won support for his open door approach from england and germany and induced the other participating powers to accept compensation from the chinese for the damages the boxer rebellion had caused.
chinese territorial integrity survived at least in name and the united states retained access to its lucrative china trade.
from crisis to empire 485 a modern military system the war with spain had revealed glaring deficiencies in the american military system.
had the united states been fighting a more powerful foe disaster might have resulted.
after the war mckinley appointed elihu root an able corporate lawyer in new york as secretary of war to supervise a major overhaul of the armed forces.
roots reforms enlarged the regular army from 25 000 to a maximum of 100 000.
they established federal army standards for the national guard ensuring that never again would the nation fight a war with volunteer regiments trained and equipped differently than those in the regular army.
they sparked the creation of a system of officer training schools including the army staff college later the command and general staff school at fort leavenworth kansas and the army war college in washington.
and in 1903 a general staff named the joint chiefs of staff was established to act as military advisers to the secretary of war.
as a result of the new reforms the united states entered the twentieth century with something resembling a modern military system.
conclusion for nearly three decades after the end of reconstruction american politics remained locked in a rigid stalemate.
the electorate was almost evenly divided and the two major parties differed on only a few issues.
a series of unimposing if respectable presidents presided over this political system as unwitting symbols of its stability and passivity.
beneath the calm surface of national politics however social issues were creating deep tensions battles between employers and workers growing resentment among american farmers facing declining prosperity outrage at what many voters considered corruption in government and excessive power in the hands of corporate titans.
when a great depression began in 1893 these social tensions exploded.
the most visible sign of the challenge to the political stalemate was the populist movement an uprising of american farmers demanding far reaching changes in politics and the economy.
in 1892 they created their own political party the peoples party which for a few years showed impressive strength.
but in the climactic election of 1896 in which the populist hero william jennings bryan became the presidential nominee of both the democratic party and the peoples party the republicans won a substantial victory and in the process helped create a great electoral realignment that left the republicans with a clear majority for the next three decades.
the crises of the 1890s helped spur the united states growing involvement in the world.
in 1898 the united states intervened in a colonial war between spain and cuba won a quick and easy military victory and signed a treaty with spain that ceded significant territory to the americans.
a vigorous anti imperialist movement failed to stop the imperial drive.
but taking the colonies proved easier than holding them.
in the philippines american forces became bogged down in a brutal four year war with filipino rebels.
the conflict soured much of the american public and the annexation of colonies in 1898 proved to be both the beginning and the end of american territorial expansion.

how did government change as a result of their reform efforts.
how did woodrow wilsons progressivism differ from that of theodore roosevelt.
in what ways was it similar to roosevelts.
well before the end of the nineteenth century many americans had become convinced that rapid industrialization and urbanization had created a growing crisis.
the nations most pressing need they claimed was to impose order and justice on a society that seemed to be approaching chaos.
by the early years of the twentieth century this outlook had acquired a name progressivism.
not even those who called themselves progressives could agree on what the term meant for it was a phenomenon of great scope and diversity.
but despite or perhaps because of its great diversity the progressive movement generated a remarkable wave of political and social innovation.
from the late nineteenth century until at least the end of world war i progressive reformers brought into public debate such issues as the role of women in society racial equality the rights of labor and the impact of immigration and cultural diversity.
progressivism began as a series of local movements and encompassed many different efforts to improve the working of society.
slowly but steadily these efforts became national 487 time line womens christian temperance union wctu founded jane addams opens hull house in chicago anti saloon league founded mckinley assassinated theodore roosevelt becomes president galveston texas establishes commission government northern securities antitrust case hepburn railroad regulation act meat inspection act taft elected president financial panic and recession naacp formed triangle shirtwaist company fire sixteenth amendment income tax pinchot ballinger dispute roosevelt forms progressive party woodrow wilson elected president seventeenth amendment direct popular election of u s senators federal reserve act federal trade commission act clayton antitrust act eighteenth amendment prohibition nineteenth amendment woman suffrage 488 efforts.
ultimately it was the presidency not the congress that became the most important vehicle of national reform first under the dynamic leadership of theodore roosevelt and then under the disciplined moralistic guidance of woodrow wilson.
by the time america entered world war i in 1917 the federal government which had exercised limited powers prior to the twentieth century had greatly expanded its role in american life.
the progressive impulse progressives believed as their name implies in the idea of progress.
they were optimistic that society was capable of improvement and that continued growth and advancement were the nations destiny.
but progressives believed too that growth and progress could not continue to occur recklessly as they had in the late nineteenth century.
the natural laws of the marketplace and the doctrines of laissez faire and social darwinism that dominated those laws were not sufficient.
direct purposeful human intervention was essential to ordering and bettering society.
these ideas percolated in the united states as well as many other industrializing parts of the world.
see america in the world social democracy progressives did not always agree on the form their interventions should take and the result was a variety of reform impulses.
one powerful impulse was the spirit of antimonopoly the fear of concentrated power and the urge to limit and disperse authority and wealth.
another progressive impulse was a belief in the importance of social cohesion the belief that individuals are part of a great web of social relationships that each persons welfare is dependent on the welfare of society as a whole.
still another impulse was a deep faith in the progressives 489 knowledge in the possibilities of applying to society the principles of natural and social sciences.
most progressives believed too that a modernized government could and must play an important role in the process of improving and stabilizing society.
the muckrakers and the social gospel among the first people to articulate the new spirit of national reform were crusading journalists who began to direct public attention toward social economic and political injustices.
known as the muckrakers after theodore roosevelt accused them of raking up muck through their writings they were committed to exposing scandal corruption and injustice.
their first major targets were the trusts and particularly the railroads which the muckrakers considered powerful and deeply corrupt.
exposs of the great corporate organizations began to appear as early as the 1860s when charles francis adams jr and others uncovered corruption among the railroad barons.
decades later journalist ida tarbell produced a scorching study of the standard oil trust.
by the turn of the century many muckrakers were turning their attention to government and particularly to the urban political machines.
among the most influential was lincoln steffens a reporter for mcclures magazine.
his portraits of machine government and boss rule in cities written in a tone of studied moral outrage helped arouse sentiment for urban political reform.
by presenting social problems to the public with indignation and moral fervor they helped inspire other americans to take action.
growing outrage at social and economic injustice committed many reformers to the pursuit of social justice.
social justice is a term widely used around the world to promote a kind of justice that goes beyond the individual but instead seeks justice for whole keppler was a popular political cartoonist of the late nineteenth century who shared the growing concern about the power of the trusts portrayed here as bloated almost reptilian figures standing menacingly over the members of the u s senate to whose chamber the peoples entrance is closed granger nyc all rights reserved.
the bosses of the senate 1889 by joseph keppler america in the world social democracy enormous energy enthusiasm and organization drove the reform efforts in america in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries much of it a result of social crises and political movements in the united states.
but the age of reform as some have called it was not an american phenomenon alone.
it was part of a wave of social experimentation that was occurring throughout much of the industrial world.
progressivism in other countries influenced the social movements in the united states.
american reform in turn had significant influence elsewhere as well.
several industrializing nations adopted the term progressivism for their efforts not only the united states but also england germany and france.
but the term that most broadly defined the new reform energies was social democracy.
social democrats in many countries shared a belief in the betterment of society through the accumulation of knowledge.
they favored improving the social condition of all people through reforms of the economy and government programs of social protection.
and they believed that these goals could be achieved through peaceful political change rather than through radicalism or revolution.
political parties committed to these goals emerged in several countries the labour party in britain social democratic parties in various european nations and the short lived progressive party in the united states.
intellectuals academics and government officials across the world shared the knowledge they were accumulating and observed one anothers social programs.
american reformers at the turn of the century spent much time visiting germany france britain belgium and the netherlands observing the reforms in progress there and europeans in turn visited 490 the united states.
reformers from both america and europe were also fascinated by the advanced social experiments in australia and especially new zealand which the american reformer henry demarest lloyd once called the political brain of the modern world but new zealands dramatic experiments in factory regulation woman suffrage old age pensions progressive taxation and labor arbitration gradually found counterparts in many other nations as well.

something was welding us into one the paris expo a progressive symbol the paris expositions of 1889 and 1900 symbolized by the eiffel tower and enormous globe drew progressive experts as well as tourists with the vision of progress through industrial innovation.
during the expos an international group of progressives held meetings to share ideas for bettering society.

all fighting a common cause social democracy or as it was sometimes called in the united states and elsewhere social justice or the social gospel was responsible for many public programs.
germany began a system of social insurance for its citizens in the 1880s while simultaneously undertaking a massive study of society that produced over 140 volumes of social investigation of almost every aspect of the nations life.
french reformers pressed in the 1890s for factory regulation assistance to the elderly and progressive taxation.
britain pioneered the settlement houses in working class areas of london a movement that soon spread to the united states and like the united states witnessed growing challenges to the power of monopolies at both the local and national levels.
in many countries social democrats felt pressure from the rising worldwide labor movement and from the rise of socialist parties in many industrial countries as well.
strikes sometimes violent were common in france germany britain and the united states in the late nineteenth century.
the more militant workers became the more unions seemed to grow.
social democrats did not always welcome the rise of militant labor movements but they took them seriously and used them to support their own efforts at reform.
the politics of social democracy represented a great shift in the character of public life all over the industrial world.
instead of battles over the privileges of aristocrats or the power of monarchs reformers now focused on the social problems of ordinary people and attempted to improve their lot.
the politics of the future are social politics the british reformer joseph chamberlain said in the 1880s referring to efforts to deal with the problems of ordinary citizens.

what is social democracy.
how does it differ from socialism.

groups or even societies.
advocates of social justice are likely to believe in a more egalitarian society.
that impulse helped create the rise of what became known as the social gospel the effort to make faith into a tool of social reform.
the social gospel movement was chiefly concerned with redeeming the nations cities.
the salvation army which began in england but soon spread to the united states was one example of the fusion of religion with reform.
a christian social welfare organization with a vaguely military structure it had recruited 3 000 officers and 20 000 privates by 1900 and was offering both material aid and spiritual service to the urban poor.
in addition many ministers priests and rabbis left traditional parish work to serve in the troubled cities.
charles sheldons book in his steps 1898 the story of a young minister who abandoned a comfortable post to work among the needy sold more than 15 million copies.
the social gospel was never the dominant element in the movement for urban reform.
but the engagement of religion with reform helped bring to progressivism a powerful moral commitment to redeem the lives of even the least favored citizens.
the settlement house movement an element of much progressive thought was the belief in the influence of the environment on individual development.

430 chapter 18 eastern european 6 other northwestern european 4 italian 8 german 28 other central european 10 scandinavian 11 british 18 irish 15 sources of immigration from europe 1860 1900 this pie chart shows the sources of european immigration in the late nineteenth century.
the largest number of immigrants continued to come from traditional sources britain ireland germany scandinavia but the beginnings of what in the early twentieth century would become a major influx of immigrants from new sources southern and eastern europe in particular are already visible here.
immigration from other sources mexico south and central america and asia was also significant during this period.
why would these newer sources of european and other kinds of immigration create controversy among older stock americans.
equally striking was the diversity of new immigrant populations.
in other countries experiencing heavy immigration in this period most of the new arrivals were coming from one or two sources.
but in the united states no single national group dominated.
most of the new arrivals were rural people and for many of them the adjustment to city life was painful.
to help ease the transition some immigrant groups formed close knit ethnic communities within the cities in neighborhoods often called immigrant g hettoes ethnic neighborhoods offered newcomers much that was familiar including newspapers and theaters in their native languages stores selling their native foods and church and fraternal organizations that provided links to their national pasts.
many immigrants also maintained close ties with their native countries.
they stayed in touch with relatives who had remained behind and perhaps as many as a third in the early years returned to their homelands after a relatively short time.
others helped bring the rest of their families to america.
the cultural cohesiveness of the ethnic communities clearly eased the pain of separation from the immigrants native lands.
what role it played in helping immigrants become absorbed into american economic life is a more difficult question to answer.
some ethnic groups jews and germans in particular advanced economically more rapidly than others importance of ethnic ties for example the irish.
one explanation is that by huddling together in ethnic neighborhoods immigrant groups tended to reinforce the cultural values of their previous societies.
when those values were particularly well suited to economic advancement for example the high value jews placed on education ethnic identification may have helped members of a group improve their lots.
when other values predominated maintaining community solidarity strengthening family ties preserving order economic progress could be less rapid.
the age of the city 431 but other factors were at least as important in determining how well immigrants fared.
immigrants who aroused strong racial prejudice among native born whites found it very difficult to advance whatever their talents.
those white immigrants who arrived with a valuable skill or with some capital did better than those who did not.
and over time those who lived in cities where people of their own nationality came to predominate for example the irish in new york and boston or the germans in milwaukee gained an advantage as they learned to exert their political power.
assimilation and exclusion despite the many differences among the various immigrant communities virtually all groups had certain things in common.
most immigrants shared the experience of living in cities.
most were young the majority of newcomers were between fifteen and forty five years old.
and in most communities of the foreign born ethnic ties had to compete against the desire for assimilation.
many of the new arrivals had come with romantic visions of the new world.
and however disillusioning they might have found their first contact with the united states they usually retained the dream of becoming true americans second generation immigrants were especially likely to attempt to break with the old ways.
young women in particular sometimes rebelled against parents who tried to arrange or prevent marriages or who opposed women entering the workplace.
old stock americans encouraged or demanded assimilation in countless ways.
public schools taught children in english and employers often insisted that workers speak english on the job.
most nonethnic stores sold mainly american products forcing immigrants to adapt their diets clothing and lifestyles to american norms.
church leaders were often native born americans or more assimilated immigrants pressure to assimilate who encouraged their parishioners to adopt american ways.
some even embraced reforms to make their religion more compatible with the norms of the new country.
reform judaism imported from germany in the late nineteenth century was an effort by american jewish leaders as it had been by german ones to make their faith less foreign to the dominant culture.
the vast numbers of new immigrants and the way many of them created distinctive communities provoked fear and resentment among some native born americans in much the same way that earlier arrivals had done.
in 1887 henry bowers a self educated lawyer founded the american protective association a group committed to stopping immigration.
by 1894 membership in the organization reportedly reached 500 000 with chapters throughout the northeast and midwest.
that same year five harvard alumni in boston founded a more genteel organization the immigration attempts to limit immigration restriction league.
they proposed screening immigrants through literacy tests and other standards to separate the desirable from the undesirable the government responded to popular concern about immigration even earlier.
in 1882 congress excluded the chinese denied entry to undesirables convicts paupers the mentally incompetent and placed a tax of 50 cents on each person admitted.
later legislation of the 1890s enlarged the list of those barred from immigrating.
but these laws kept out only a small number of aliens and more ambitious restriction proposals made little progress in congress for immigration provided a cheap and plentiful labor supply to the rapidly growing economy.
many argued that americas industrial and indeed agricultural development would be impossible without it.
america in the world global migrations the great waves of immigration that transformed american society in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were not unique to the united states.
they were part of a great global movement of peoples unprecedented in history that affected every continent in the world and that has continued to this day.
these great migrations were the product of two related forces population growth and industrialization.
the population of europe grew faster in the second half of the nineteenth century than ever before and ever since almost doubling between 1850 and the beginning of world war i.
the population growth was a result of growing economies able to support more people and of more efficient and productive agriculture that helped end debilitating famines.
but the rapid growth nevertheless strained the resources of many parts of europe and affected in particular rural people who were now too numerous to live off the available land.
many decided to move to other parts of the world where land was more plentiful.
at the same time industrialization drew millions of people out of the countryside and into cities sometimes into cities in their own countries but often to industrial cities in other more economically advanced nations.
historians of migration speak of push factors pressures on people to leave their homes and pull factors the lure of new lands in explaining population movements.
the push for many nineteenth century m igrants was poverty and inadequate land at home for others it was political and religious oppression.
the pull was the availability of land or industrial jobs in other regions or lands and for some the prospect of greater freedom abroad.
faster cheaper 432 and easier transportation railroads steamships and much later airplanes also aided large scale immigration.
from 1800 to the start of world war i 50 million europeans migrated to new lands overseas people from almost all areas of europe but in the later years of the century when migration reached its peak mostly from poor rural areas in southern and eastern europe.
italy russia and poland were among the biggest sources of late nineteenthcentury migrants.
almost two thirds of these immigrants came to the united states.
but nearly 20 million europeans m igrated to other lands.
migrants from england and private collection peter newark american pictures bridgeman images ireland among others moved in large numbers to those areas of the british empire with vast seemingly open lands canada australia new zealand and south africa.
large numbers of italians moved to argentina and other parts of south america.
many migrants moved to open land in these countries and established themselves as farmers using the new mechanical farming devices made possible by industrialization.
in many places australia new zealand argentina south africa and the united states immigrants evicted the native residents of their territories and created societies of their own.
many others settled in the industrial cities that were growing up in all these regions and formed distinctive ethnic and national communities within them.
but it was not only europeans who were transplanting themselves in these years.
tremendous numbers of poor people left asia africa and the pacific islands in search of better lives.
most of them could not afford the journey abroad on their own.
they moved instead as indentured servants in much the same way many english migrants moved to america in the seventeenth century agreeing to a term of servitude in their new land in exchange for food shelter and transportation.
recruiters of indentured servants fanned out across china japan areas of africa and the pacific islands and above all india.
french and british recruiters brought hundreds of thousands of indian migrants to work in plantations in their own asian and african colonies.
chinese laborers were recruited to work on plantations in cuba and hawaii mines in malaya peru south africa and australia and railroad projects in canada peru and the united states.
african indentured servants moved in large numbers to the caribbean and pacific islanders tended to move to other islands or to australia.
the immigration of european peoples to new lands was largely voluntary and brought most migrants to the united states where indentured servitude was illegal although sometimes imposed on workers through labor contracts.
but the migration of non european peoples often involved an important element of coercion and brought relatively small numbers of people to the united states.
this non european migration was a function of the growth of european empires and it was made possible by the imperial system by its labor recruiters by its naval resources by its law and by its economic needs.
together these various forms of migration produced one of the greatest population movements in the history of the world and transformed not just the united states but much of the globe.

the urban landscape the city was a place of remarkable contrasts.
it had homes of almost unimaginable size and grandeur and hovels of indescribable squalor.
it had conveniences unknown to earlier generations and problems that seemed beyond the capacity of society to solve.
433 434 chapter 18 the creation of public space there were a few early american cities that were planned from the beginning philadelphia and washington most prominently.
by the mid nineteenth century reformers planners architects and others began to call for more ordered visions of many other cities.
among the most important urban innovations of the mid nineteenth century were great city parks which reflected the desire of urban leaders to provide an antidote to the congestion of the city landscape.
parks they argued would allow city residents a healthy restorative escape from the strains of urban life by reacquainting them with the natural world.
this notion of the park as refuge was most effectively promoted by the landscape designers frederick law olmsted and calvert vaux who together in the late 1850s central park designed new yorks central park.
they deliberately created a public space that would look as little like the city as possible.
instead of the ordered formal spaces common in some european cities they created a space that seemed entirely natural.
central park was from the start one of the most popular and admired public spaces in the world.
at the same time that cities were creating great parks they were also creating great public buildings libraries art galleries natural history museums theaters and concert and opera halls.
new yorks metropolitan museum of art was the largest and best known of many great museums taking shape in the late nineteenth century but giant museums grew up quickly in boston philadelphia chicago and other places.
in one city after another new and lavish public libraries appeared as if to confirm the citys role as a center of learning and knowledge.
wealthy residents were the principal force behind the creation of the great art museums concert halls opera houses and at times even parks.
as their own material and social aspirations grew they wanted the public life of the city to provide them with amenities to match their expectations.
becoming an important patron of a major cultural institution was an especially effective route to social distinction.
as both the size and aspirations of great cities increased urban leaders launched monumental projects to remake them.
some cities began to clear away older neighborhoods and streets and create grand monumental avenues lined with new and more impressive buildings.
a particularly important event in inspiring such efforts was the 1893 columbian exposition in chicago a worlds fair constructed to honor the 400th anniversary of columbuss first voyage to america.
at the center of the wildly popular exposition was a cluster of neoclassical buildings the great white city arranged symmetrically around a formal lagoon.
city beautiful movement it became the inspiration for the city beautiful movement led by the architect of the great white city daniel burnham.
the movement strove to impose a similar order and symmetry on the disordered life of cities around the country.
only rarely however were planners able to overcome the obstacles of private landowners and complicated urban politics to realize more than a small portion of their dreams.
the effort to remake the city did not focus only on redesigning existing landscapes.
it occasionally led to the creation of entirely new ones.
in one of the largest public works projects ever undertaken in america to that point the city of boston gradually filled in a large area of marshy tidal land in the late 1880s to create the neighborhood known as back back bay bay boston was not alone.
chicago reclaimed large areas from lake michigan and at one point raised the street level for the entire city to help avoid the problems the marshy land created.
in new york and other cities the response to limited space was not so much to create new land as to annex adjacent territory.
a great wave of annexations expanded the boundaries of many american cities in the 1890s and beyond most notably new york citys 1898 annexation of brooklyn which was itself a large and important city.
the age of the city 435 this woman shown here with some of her children was typical of many workingclass mothers who found income producing activities they could pursue in the home in this case laundry.
bettmann corbis a tenement laundry the search for housing one of the greatest urban problems was to provide housing for the thousands of new residents pouring into the cities every day.
for the prosperous housing was seldom a worry.
the availability of cheap labor reduced the cost of building and permitted anyone with even a moderate income to afford a house.
some of the richest urban residents lived in palatial mansions located in exclusive neighborhoods in the heart of the city fifth avenue in new york back bay and beacon hill in boston society hill in philadelphia lake shore drive in chicago nob hill in san francisco and many others.
many of the moderately well to do city dwellers took advantage of less expensive land on the edges of cities and settled in new suburbs linked to the downtowns by new suburbs trains or streetcars.
chicago in the 1870s for example connected nearly 100 residential suburbs to the downtown by railroad.
real estate developers worked to create suburban communities that would appeal to many city dwellers nostalgia for the countryside promoting them with lawns trees and houses designed to look manorial.
most urban residents however could not afford either to own a house in the city or to move to the suburbs.
instead they stayed in the city centers and rented.
landlords tried to squeeze as many rent paying residents as possible into the smallest available space.
in manhattan for example the average population density in 1894 was 143 people per acre a rate far higher than that of any other american or european city then or since.
in the cities of the south charleston new orleans richmond poor african americans lived in crumbling former slave quarters.
in boston immigrants moved into cheap three story wooden 436 chapter 18 houses triple deckers.
in baltimore and philadelphia the new arrivals crowded into narrow brick row houses.
and in new york and many other cities they lived in tenements.
the word tenement had originally referred simply to a multiple family rental building tenements but by the late nineteenth century it had become a term for slum dwellings only.
the first tenements built in 1850 had been hailed as a great improvement in housing for the poor.
but most were in fact miserable places with many windowless rooms and jacob riis little or no plumbing or heating.
jacob riis a danish immigrant and new york newspaper photographer shocked many middle class americans with his sensational and some claimed sensationalized descriptions and pictures of tenement life in his 1890 book how the other half lives.
but the solution reformers often adopted was simply to raze slum dwellings without building any new housing to replace them.
urban technologies transportation and construction urban growth posed monumental transportation challenges.
sheer numbers of people mandated the development of mass transportation.
streetcars drawn on tracks by horses had been introduced into some cities even before the civil war.
but the horsecars were not fast enough so many communities developed new forms of mass transit.
in 1870 new york opened its first elevated railway whose noisy steam powered trains moved rapidly above the city streets on massive iron structures.
new york chicago san francisco boston and other cities also experimented with cable cars towed by continuously moving underground cables.
richmond virginia introduced the first electric trolley line in 1888 and in 1897 boston opened the first american subway.
at the same time cities were developing new techniques of road and bridge building.
one of the great technological marvels of the 1880s was the completion of the brooklyn bridge in new york a dramatic steel cable suspension span designed by john a roebling.
cities grew upward as well as outward.
in chicago the 1884 construction of the first modern skyscraper by later standards a relatively modest ten story building launched a new era in urban architecture.
critical to the creation of the skyscraper was a new technology of construction which emerged as a result of several related developments.
new kinds of steel girders could support much greater tension than the metals of the past.
the invention and development of the passenger elevator made much taller buildings p ossible.
and the search for ways to protect cities from the ravages of great fires which caused such terrible destruction in wood frame cities of the late nineteenth century led to steel frame construction that among other things made cities more fireproof.
once the technology existed to permit the construction of tall buildings there were few obstacles to building taller and taller skyscrapers structures.
the early chicago skyscrapers paved the way for some of the great construction achievements later in the twentieth century the chrysler building and the empire state building in new york the lasalle building in chicago and ultimately the vast numbers of steel and glass skyscrapers of post 1945 cities around the world.
strains of urban life increasing urban congestion and the absence of adequate public services produced serious hazards.
crime fire disease and indigence all placed strains on the capacities of metropolitan institutions and both governments and private agencies were for a time poorly equipped to respond.
the age of the city 437 fire and disease in one major city after another fires destroyed large downtown areas.
chicago and boston suffered great fires in 1871 and other cities experienced similar disasters.
the terrible experience of the great fires encouraged the construction of fireproof buildings and the development of professional fire departments.
they also forced cities to rebuild at a time when new technological and architectural innovations were available.
some of the high rise downtowns of american cities arose out of the rubble of great fires.
an even greater hazard than fire was disease especially in poor neighborhoods with inadequate sanitation facilities.
an epidemic that began in a poor neighborhood could and often did spread easily into other neighborhoods as well.
few municipal officials recognized the relationship of improper sewage disposal and water contamination to such epidemic diseases as typhoid fever and cholera many cities lacked adequate systems for disposing of human waste until well into the twentieth century.
flush toilets and sewer systems began to appear in the 1870s but they could not solve the problem as long as sewage continued to flow into open ditches or streams polluting cities water supplies.
environmental degradation modern notions of environmental science were unknown to most americans in these years.
but the environmental degradation of many american cities was a visible and disturbing fact of life.
the frequency of great fires the dangers of disease the crowding of working class neighborhoods all exemplified the environmental costs of industrialization and rapid urbanization.
poor disposal of human and industrial waste was common in almost all large cities.
the presence of domestic animals horses cows pigs and other animals also contributed to the contamination of drinking water and other environmental problems.
air quality in many cities was poor as well.
few americans had the severe problems that london experienced in the late nineteenth century with its seemingly perpetual fogs created by the burning of soft coal.
but air pollution from factories and from stoves and furnaces in offices homes and other buildings was constant and at times severe.
the incidence of respiratory infection and related diseases was much higher in cities than it was in rural areas and it accelerated rapidly in the late nineteenth century.
by the early twentieth century reformers actively crusading to improve the environmental conditions of cities were beginning to achieve some notable successes.
by 1910 most large american cities had constructed sewage disposal systems often at great cost to protect the drinking water of their inhabitants and to prevent the great bacterial plagues that impure water had helped create in the past such as the yellow fever epidemic in memphis that killed 5 000 people.
in 1912 the federal government created the public health service which was charged with preventing such occupational diseases as tuberculosis anemia and public health service carbon dioxide poisoning which were common in the garment industry and other trades.
it attempted to create common health standards for all factories but since the agency had few powers of enforcement it had limited impact.
the creation of the occupational safety and health administration in 1970 which gave government the authority to require employers to create safe and healthy workplaces was a legacy of the public health services early work.
438 chapter 18 urban poverty crime and violence above all perhaps urban expansion spawned widespread and often desperate poverty.
public agencies and private philanthropic organizations offered some relief.
but they were generally poorly funded and in any case dominated by middle class people who believed that too much assistance would breed dependency.
most tried to restrict aid to the deserving poor those who truly could not help themselves.
charitable organizations conducted elaborate investigations to separate the deserving from the undeserving other charitable societies for example the salvation army which began operating in america in 1879 concentrated more on religious revivalism than on relief of the homeless and hungry.
middle class people grew particularly alarmed over the rising number of poor children in the cities some of them orphans or runaways.
they attracted greater attention from reformers than any other group although that attention produced no lasting solutions to their problems.
poverty and crowding bred crime and violence.
the american murder rate rose rapidly in the late nineteenth century from 25 murders for every million people in 1880 to over 100 by the end of the century.
that reflected in part a very high level of violence in some nonurban areas the american south where lynching and homicide were particularly high and the west where the rootlessness and instability of new communities cow towns mining camps and the like created much violence.
but the big cities factors in rising crime rate contributed their share to the increase as well.
native born americans liked to believe that crime was a result of the violent proclivities of immigrant groups and they cited the rise of gangs and criminal organizations in various ethnic communities.
but native born americans in the cities were as likely to commit crimes as immigrants.
the rising crime rates encouraged many cities to develop larger and more professional police forces.
but police forces themselves could spawn corruption and brutality.
some members of the middle class fearful of urban insurrections felt the need for even more substantial forms of protection.
urban national guard groups built imposing armories on the outskirts of affluent neighborhoods and stored large supplies of weapons and ammunition in preparation for uprisings that in fact virtually never occurred.
the city was a place of strong allure and great excitement.
yet it was also a place of alienating impersonality and to some of degradation and exploitation.
theodore dreisers dreisers urban novel novel sister carrie 1900 exposed one troubling aspect of urban life the plight of single women like dreisers heroine carrie who found themselves without any means of support.
carrie first took an exhausting and ill paying job in a chicago shoe factory then drifted into a life of sin exploited by predatory men.
the machine and the boss newly arrived immigrants were much in need of institutions to help them adjust to american urban life.
for many residents of the inner cities the principal source of assistance was the political machine the urban machine owed its existence to the power vacuum that the chaotic growth of cities had created and to the potential voting power of large immigrant communities.
function of the urban boss out of that combination emerged the urban bosses the principal function of the political boss was simple to win votes for his organization.
that the age of the city 439 puck was the first successful humor magazine published in the united states.
issues were published from 1871 to 1918.
it offered political cartoons caricatures and satire on the issues of the day.
this cover shows a beer and wine seller shuttering his store by order of the government.
the tammany man indicates that the merchant will be able to operate without penalty in exchange for his support.
the library of congress puck magazine meant winning the loyalty of his constituents.
to do so a boss might provide them with occasional relief a basket of groceries or a bag of coal.
he might step in to save those arrested for petty crimes from jail.
when he could he found work for the unemployed.
above all he rewarded many of his followers with patronage with jobs in city government or in the police which the machines elected officials often controlled with jobs building or operating the new transit systems and with opportunities to rise in the political organization itself.
machines were also vehicles for making money.
politicians enriched themselves and their allies through various forms of graft and corruption.
a politician might discover in advance where a new road or streetcar line was to be built buy land near it and sell it at a profit when property values rose as a result of the construction.
there was also covert graft.
officials received kickbacks from contractors in exchange for contracts to build public projects and they sold franchises for the operation of public utilities.
the most famously 440 chapter 18 corrupt city boss was william m tweed boss of new york citys tammany hall in the 1860s and 1870s whose extravagant use of public funds and kickbacks landed him in jail in 1872.
the urban machine was not without competition.
reform groups frequently mobilized public outrage at the corruption of the bosses and often succeeded in driving machine politicians from office.
but the reform organizations typically lacked the permanence of the machine.
boss tweed and tammany hall the rise of mass consumption in the last decades of the nineteenth century a distinctive middle class culture began to exert influence over the whole of american life.
other groups in society advanced less rapidly or not at all but the rise of the new urban consumer culture began to shape a new image of the nation.
patterns of income and consumption incomes rose for almost everyone in the industrial era although highly unevenly.
one result of the new economy was the creation of vast fortunes but perhaps the most imporgrowth of middle class tant result for society as a whole was the growth and increasing prosperity of the middle class.
clerks accountants middle managers and other white collar workers saw their salaries rise by an average of a third between 1890 and 1910.
doctors lawyers and other professionals experienced a particularly dramatic increase in both the prestige and the profitability of their professions.
working class incomes rose in those years as well although from a much lower base and more slowly.
the iron and steel industries saw workers hourly wages increase by a third between 1890 and 1910 but industries with large female workforces shoes textiles and paper saw more modest increases as did almost all industries in the south.
wages for african americans mexicans and asians also rose more slowly than those for white workers.
rising incomes created new markets for consumer goods which were now available new consumerism to a mass market for the first time as a result of technological innovations and new merchandising techniques.
an example of such changes was the emergence of ready made clothing.
in the early nineteenth century most americans had made their own clothing.
the invention of the sewing machine and the civil war demand for uniforms spurred the manufacture of clothing and helped create an enormous industry devoted to producing ready made garments.
by the end of the century almost all americans bought their clothing from stores.
partly as a result much larger numbers of people became concerned with personal style.
interest in womens fashion for example had once been a luxury reserved for the relatively affluent.
now middle class and even working class women could strive to develop a distinctive style of dress.
buying and preparing food also became a critical part of the new consumerism.
the development and mass production of tin cans in the 1880s created a large new industry devoted to packaging and selling canned food and condensed milk.
refrigerated railroad cars made it possible for perishable foods to be transported over long distances without spoiling.
artificially frozen ice enabled many households to afford iceboxes.
the changes brought improved diets and better health.
life expectancy rose six years in the first two decades of the twentieth century.
the age of the city 441 department stores often created events to help promote sales of their many wares.
here strawbridge and clothier department store creates a stir on market street in philadelphia in 1907.
corbis department stores chain stores mail order houses and department stores changes in marketing also altered the way americans bought goods.
new chain stores could usually offer a wider array of goods at lower prices than the small local stores with which they competed.
the atlantic and pacific tea company the a p began a national network of grocery stores in the 1870s.
f w woolworth built a chain of dry goods stores.
sears and roebuck established a large market for its mail order merchandise by distributing an enormous catalog each year.
in larger cities the emergence of great department stores helped make shopping more alluring and glamorous.
marshall field in chicago created one of the first american department stores a place deliberately designed to produce a sense of department stores wonder and excitement.
similar stores emerged in new york brooklyn boston philadelphia and other cities.
for the philosophy of one of the leading department store innovators see consider the source john wanamaker the four cardinal points of the department store women as consumers the rise of mass consumption had particularly dramatic effects on american women.
womens clothing styles changed much more rapidly than mens which encouraged more frequent purchases.
women generally bought and prepared food for their families so the availability of new food products changed not only how people ate but also how women shopped and cooked.
the consumer economy produced new employment opportunities for women as salesclerks and waitresses.
and it spawned the creation of a new movement in which women co ns ider t he s o urc e john wanamaker the four cardinal points of the department store 1874 the philadelphia merchant john wanamaker was one of the most successful and innovative businessmen of his day.
a pioneer of the department store wanamaker ran this advertisement explaining the policies and benefits for consumers of his new commercial venue.
four cardinal points by which we will hereafter steer our craft full guarantee cash payment one price cash returned explanation and elaboration of the new plan first point cash houses doing a credit business must provide for losses on bad debts interest on long standing accounts capital locked up etc.
to bear such losses themselves would drive them out of business.
therefore a per cent is added to the price of each article sold to cover this leakage and cash buyers whether they know it or not really pay the bad debts and the interest on the long credits of the other customers.
under the cash payment system one pays only for what he gets and contributes nothing to a sinking fund by this radical change we shall lose some of our customers no doubt but we will gain ten where we lose one the advantages being so great to all who can avail themselves of them.
so we say cash throughout.
bring money for clothing and we will supply it at prices possible under no other plan.
second point one price the fairness of this feature of our plan all will praise.
it is simply treating all alike exacting nothing from indisposition to bargain or ignorance and at the same time conceding all that shrewdness on the shrewdest customers part could possibly extort because the one price 442 which we mark on our goods shall invariably be not the first price but the last and lowest price.
not the top price but the very bottom price.
third point full guarantee a printed guarantee bearing the signature of our firm will accompany each garment as a warrantee.
this binds us in every sense and will be honored as quickly as a good draft of the government of the united states.
this is a sample of the full guarantee and tells its own story guarantee.
we hereby guarantee first that the prices of our goods shall be as low as the same quality of material and manufacture are sold anywhere in the united states.
second that prices are precisely the same to everybody for same quality on same day of purchase.
third that the quality of goods is as represented on printed labels.
fourth that the full amount of cash paid will be refunded if customers find the articles unsatisfactory and return them unworn and uninjured within ten days of date of purchase.
fourth point cash returned this is simply a concession on our part to our customers to secure them full confidence in dealing for goods they know very little about and we thus prevent any occasion for dissatisfaction from any and every cause whatsoever.
if the garment is not exactly what you thought if your taste changes if the home folks prefer another color or another shape if you find you can buy the same material and style elsewhere for less money if you conclude you dont need it after you get home if the season changes suddenly and you wish you had not bought it bring it back unworn and uninjured and the full amount of money you paid will be returned on the spot.
what more can we do for our customers than this when we make our clothing so that they can draw the money value with it equally as well as with a check on the banks.
the advantages incident to a system having for its cardinal points these which we have now explained are simply innumerable.
saving of time and temper perfect security absence of all huckstering etc etc.
but above all this.
all of these by ways lead direct to cheapness and this without lowering the quality or style of our celebrated make of mens and boys clothing.

played a vital role the consumer protection movement.
the national consumers league ncl formed in the 1890s under the leadership of florence national consumers league kelley attempted to mobilize the power of women as consumers to force retailers and manufacturers to improve wages and working conditions.
the ncl encouraged women to buy only products with the leagues white label which indicated that the product was made under fair working conditions.
leisure in the consumer society closely related to the rise of consumption was a growing interest in leisure time.
members of the urban middle and professional classes had large blocks of time during which they were not at work evenings weekends even paid vacations.
working hours in many factories declined from an average of nearly seventy hours a week in 1860 to under sixty in 1900.
even farmers found that the mechanization of agriculture gave them more free time.
as many peoples lives became more compartmentalized with clear distinctions between work and leisure many americans began to search for new forms of recreation and entertainment.
redefining leisure in earlier eras relatively few americans had considered leisure a valuable thing.
many equated it with laziness.
in the late nineteenth century however the beginnings of a redefinition of leisure appeared.
the economist simon patten articulated this new view 443 444 chapter 18 of leisure in the theory of prosperity 1902 the new basis of civilization 1910 and other works.
he challenged the centuries old assumption that the normal condition of civilization was a scarcity of goods.
in earlier times patten argued fear of scarcity had caused people to place a high value on thrift self denial and restraint.
but in modern industrial societies new economies could create enough wealth to satisfy not just the needs but also the desires of all.
as americans became more accustomed to leisure as a normal part of life they began to look for new experiences and entertainments.
mass entertainment occasionally bridged differences of class race and gender.
but it could also be sharply divided.
saloons and some sporting events tended to be male preserves.
shopping and going to tea rooms and luncheonettes were more characteristic of female leisure.
theaters pubs and clubs were often specific to particular ethnic communities or particular work groups.
when the classes did meet in public spaces as they did for example in city parks there was often considerable conflict over what constituted appropriate public behavior.
elites in new york city for example tried to prohibit anything but quiet genteel activities in central park while working class people wanted to use the public spaces for sports and entertainments.
spectator sports among the most important responses to the search for entertainment was the rise of organized spectator sports especially baseball.
a game much like baseball known as rounders and derived from cricket had enjoyed limited popularity in great britain in the early nineteenth century.
versions of the game began to appear in america in the early 1830s.
by the end of the civil war interest in the game had grown rapidly.
baseball the american national game long before the modern major leagues began local baseball clubs were active throughout much of the united states establishing the game as the national pastime this print of a grand match for the championship depicts an 1866 game at elysian fields a popular park just across the river from new york city in hoboken new jersey.
photo reproduction by transcendental graphics getty images the age of the city 445 more than 200 amateur or semiprofessional teams and clubs existed many of which joined a national association and proclaimed a set of standard rules.
as the game grew in popularity it offered opportunities for profit.
the first salaried team the cincinnati red stockings was formed in 1869.
other cities fielded professional teams and in 1876 the teams banded together in the national league.
a rival league the american association appeared and collapsed but in 1901 the american league emerged to replace it.
and in 1903 the first modern world series was played in which the american leagues boston red sox beat the national leagues pittsburgh pirates.
by then baseball had become an important business and a national preoccupation.
baseball had great appeal to working class males.
the second most popular game football appealed at first to a more elite segment of the male population in part because it originated in colleges and universities.
the first intercollegiate football game in america occurred between princeton and rutgers in 1869.
early intercollegiate football bore only an indirect relation to the modern game it was more similar to present day rugby.
by the late 1870s however the game was becoming standardized and was taking on the outlines of its modern form.
basketball was invented in 1891 in springfield massachusetts by dr james a naismith a canadian working as an athletic director for a local college.
basketball invented boxing which had long been a disreputable activity concentrated primarily among the urban lower classes became by the 1880s a more popular and in some places more reputable sport.
participation in the major sports was almost exclusively the province of men but several sports emerged in which women became involved.
golf and tennis both attracted more and more relatively wealthy men and women.
bicycling and croquet also enjoyed widespread popularity in the 1890s among women as well as men.
womens colleges introduced their students to more strenuous sports as well track crew swimming and beginning in the late 1890s basketball.
music theater and movies other forms of popular entertainment also developed in the cities.
many ethnic communities maintained their own theaters which presented plays in the languages of the immigrant communities.
urban theaters in the heart of the cities attracted a much broader audience.
they introduced new and distinctively american entertainment forms the musical comedy which evolved gradually from the comic operettas of europe and vaudeville a vaudeville form of theater adapted from french models which remained the most popular urban entertainment into the first decades of the twentieth century.
it consisted of a variety of acts musicians comedians magicians jugglers and others and was at least in the beginning inexpensive to produce.
as the economic potential of vaudeville grew some promoters most prominently florenz ziegfeld of new york staged much more elaborate spectacles.
vaudeville was also one of the few entertainment media open to black performers who brought to it elements of the minstrel shows they had earlier developed for black audiences in the late nineteenth century.
some minstrel singers including the most famous al jolson were white performers wearing heavy makeup or blackface but most were black.
entertainers of both races performed music based on the gospel and folk tunes of the plantation and on the jazz and ragtime of black urban communities.
performers of both races also tailored their acts to prevailing white prejudices ridiculing african americans by acting out demeaning stereotypes.
446 chapter 18 american popular entertainment was transformed with the emergence of motion picture shows.
thomas edison and others had created the technology underpinning the motion picture in the 1880s.
soon after that short films became available to individual viewers watching peepshows in pool halls penny arcades and amusement parks.
soon larger projectors made it possible to display the images on big screens which permitted substantial audiences to see films in theaters.
by 1900 americans were becoming attracted silent films in large numbers to these early movies usually plotless films of trains or waterfalls or other spectacles.
the director d w griffith carried the motion picture into a new era with his silent epics the birth of a nation 1915 intolerance 1916 and others which introduced serious if notoriously racist plots and elaborate productions to filmmaking.
motion pictures were the first truly mass entertainment medium.
patterns of public and private leisure particularly striking about popular entertainment in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was its public quality.
many americans spent their leisure time in places where they would find not only entertainment but also other people.
thousands of working class new yorkers spent evenings in dance halls vaudeville houses and concert halls.
more affluent new yorkers enjoyed afternoons in central park where a principal attraction was seeing other people and being seen by them.
moviegoers were attracted not just by the movies themselves but also by the energy of the audiences at lavish new movie palaces just as sports fans were drawn by the crowds as well as by the games.
perhaps the most striking example of popular public entertainment in the early twenconey island tieth century was coney island the famous and self consciously fabulous amusement park and resort on a popular beach in brooklyn.
luna park the greatest of the coney island attractions opened in 1903 and provided rides stunts and lavish reproductions of exotic places and spectacular adventures japanese gardens venetian canals with gondoliers a chinese theater a simulated trip to the moon and reenactments of such disasters as burning buildings and earthquakes.
a year later a competing company opened dreamland which tried to outdo even luna park with a 375 foot tower a three ring circus chariot races and a lilliputian village from gullivers travels.
the popularity of coney island in these years was phenomenal.
thousands of people flocked to the large resort hotels that lined the beaches.
many thousands more made day trips out from the city by train and after 1920 subway.
in 1904 the average daily attendance at luna park alone was 90 000 people.
most people found coney island appealing in part because it provided an escape from the genteel standards that governed so much of american life at the time.
in the amusement parks of coney island decorum was often forgotten and people delighted in finding themselves in situations that in any other setting would have seemed embarrassing or improper womens skirts blown above their heads with hot air people pummeled with water and rubber paddles by clowns hints of sexual freedom as strangers were forced to come into physical contact with one another on rides and amusements.
not all popular entertainment however involved public events.
many americans dime novels amused themselves privately by reading novels and poetry.
the so called dime novels cheaply bound and widely circulated became popular after the civil war with detective stories tales of the wild west sagas of scientific adventure and novels of moral uplift publishers also distributed sentimental novels of romance which developed a large audience among women as did books about animals and about young children the age of the city 447 growing up.
louisa may alcotts little women most of whose readers were female sold more than 2 million copies.
the technologies of mass communication american journalism experienced dramatic change in the decades following the civil war.
between 1870 and 1910 the circulation of daily newspapers increased nearly ninefold from under 3 million to more than 24 million a rate three times as great as the rate of population increase.
and while standards varied widely from one paper to another american journalism was developing the beginnings of a professional identity.
salaries of reporters increased many newspapers began separating the reporting of news from the expression of opinion and newspapers themselves became important businesses.
this transformation was to a large degree a result of new technologies of communication.
the emergence of national press services for example was a product of the telegraph which made it possible to supply papers with news and features from around the nation and the world.
by the turn of the century important newspaper chains had emerged as well linked together by their own internal wire services.
the most powerful was owned by william randolph hearst who by 1914 controlled william randolph hearst nine newspapers and two magazines.
new printing technologies were making possible more elaborate layouts the publication of color pictures and by the end of the century the printing of photographs.
these advances not only helped publishers make their own stories more vivid they also made it possible for them to attract more advertisers.
the telephone the most important new technology of communication in the late nineteenth century was the telephone which alexander graham bell had first demonstrated in 1876.
in its first years the telephone was a relatively impractical tool.
those who subscribed to telephone service had to have direct wire links to everyone else they wished to call.
in 1878 the first switchboard opened in new haven connecticut opening the way for more practical uses of the telephone.
once there was a switchboard a telephone subscriber needed only a line to the central telephone office from which connections could be made to any other subscriber.
a new occupation the telephone operator was born.
the bell system which controlled all american telephone service hired young white women to work as operators hoping that a pleasant female voice would make the experience of using the telephone and the inconvenience of the frequent technological problems that accompanied it less irritating to customers.
telephone signals were very weak at first and callers could seldom reach anyone more than a few miles away.
in an effort to increase the range of telephones engineers created the repeater which periodically strengthened the signal as it moved over distances.
by 1914 the repeaters had improved to the point that it was now practical to envision a transcontinental line.
in its early years the telephone was an almost entirely commercial instrument.
of the nearly 7 400 telephone customers in the new york new jersey area in 1891 6 000 were businesses and organizations.
even the residential telephones tended to belong to doctors or business managers.
the growing reach of the telephone in the early years of the twentieth century made the bell system formally named american telephone and telegraph or the bell system at t one of the most powerful corporations in america and a genuine monopoly.
448 chapter 18 central to its success was an early decision by executives that the company would exclusively build and own all telephone instruments and then lease them to subscribers.
that made it possible for at t to control both the equipment and the telephone service itself and to exclude any competitors in either field.
it also gave at t effective control over the local telephone companies allied with it and made the nations telephone system into an effective cartel.
high culture in the urban age in addition to the important changes in popular culture that accompanied the rise of cities and industry there were profound changes in the realm of high culture the distinction between highbrow and lowbrow culture was largely new to the industrial era.
in the early nineteenth century most cultural activities had targeted people of all classes.
by the late nineteenth century however elites were developing a cultural and intellectual life quite separate from the popular amusements of the urban masses.
literature and art in urban america one of the strongest impulses in american literature was the effort to recreate urban social reality.
this trend toward realism found an early voice in stephen crane who although perhaps best known for his novel of the civil war the red badge of courage 1895 created a sensation in 1893 when he published maggie a girl of the streets a grim picture of urban poverty and slum life.
theodore dreiser frank norris and upton sinclair were similarly drawn to social issues as themes.
kate chopin a southern writer who explored the oppressive features of traditional marriage encountered widespread public abuse after the publication of her shocking 1899 novel the awakening which described a young wife and mother who abandoned her family in search of personal fulfillment.
william dean howells in the rise of silas lapham and other works described what he considered the shallowness and corruption in ordinary american lifestyles.
american art through most of the nineteenth century had been overshadowed by that of europe.
by 1900 however a number of american artists broke from old world traditions and experimented with new styles.
winslow homer brought a distinctive approach to his paintings of new england maritime life and other american subjects.
james mcneil whistler was one of the first western artists to introduce asian themes into american and european art.
by the first years of the new century some american artists were turning decisively away from the traditional academic style a style perhaps most identified in america by the brilliant portraitist john singer sargent.
members of the so called ashcan school ashcan school produced work startling in its naturalism and stark in its portrayal of the social realities of the era.
john sloan portrayed the dreariness of american urban slums george bellows caught the vigor and violence of his time in paintings and drawings of prizefights edward hopper explored the starkness and loneliness of the modern city.
the ashcan artists were also among the first americans to appreciate expressionism and abstraction and they showed their interest in new forms in 1913 when they helped stage armory show the famous armory show in new york city which displayed works of the french postimpressionists and of some american moderns.
literary realism the age of the city 449 the artist george bellows began painting fight scenes in the first years of the twentieth century when boxing appealed primarily to working class audiences.
by 1924 when he painted this moment from a famous prizefight boxing had become one of the most popular sports in america.
whitney museum of american art new york usa bridgeman images dempsey and firpo the impact of darwinism one of the most profound intellectual developments in the late nineteenth century was the widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution associated most prominently with the english naturalist charles darwin.
darwin argued that the human species had evolved from earlier forms of life through a process of natural selection history darwin suggested was not the working out of a divine plan.
it was a natural process dominated by the fiercest or luckiest competitors.
the theory of evolution met widespread resistance at first from educators theologians and even many scientists.
by the end of the century however the evolutionists had converted most members of the urban professional and educated classes.
even many middleclass protestant religious leaders had accepted the doctrine making significant alterations in theology to accommodate it.
the rise of darwinism however divisions over darwinism contributed to something unseen by most urban americans at the time a deep schism between the new cosmopolitan culture of the city and the more traditional provincial culture of some rural areas.
thus the late nineteenth century saw not only the rise of a liberal protestantism in tune with new scientific discoveries but also the beginning of an organized protestant fundamentalism.
darwinism helped spawn other new intellectual currents.
there was the social darwinism of william graham sumner and others which industrialists used so enthusiastically to justify their favored position in american life.
but there were also more sophisticated philosophies among them a doctrine that became known as pragmatism 450 chapter 18 william james a harvard psychologist and brother of the novelist henry james was the most prominent publicist of the new theory although earlier intellectuals such as charles s peirce and later ones such as john dewey were also important to its develop pragmatism ment and dissemination.
according to the pragmatists modern society should rely for guidance not on inherited ideals and moral principles but on the test of scientific inquiry.
no idea or institution not even religious faith was valid they claimed unless it worked unless it stood the test of experience.
a similar concern for scientific inquiry was influencing the social sciences.
sociologists such as edward a ross and lester frank ward urged applying the scientific method to the solution of social and political problems.
historians such as frederick jackson turner and charles beard argued that economic factors more than spiritual ideals had been the governing force in historical development.
john dewey proposed a new approach to education that placed less emphasis on the rote learning of traditional knowledge and more on flexible democratic schooling.
the implications of darwinism also promoted the growth of anthropology and encouraged some scholars to begin examining other cultures in new ways.
some white americans began to look at indian society for example as a coherent culture with its own norms and values that were worthy of respect and preservation even though they were different from those of white society.
toward universal schooling the growing demand for specialized skills and scientific knowledge naturally created a growing and changing demand for education.
the late nineteenth century therefore was a time of rapid expansion and reform of american schools and universities.
free public primary and secondary education spread rapidly.
by 1900 compulsory school attendance laws existed in thirty one states and territories.
education was still far from universal.
rural areas lagged far behind urban industrial ones in funding public education.
in the south many african americans had no access to schools at all.
but for many white men and women educational opportunities were expanding rapidly.
educational reformers tried to extend educational opportunities to the indian tribes as well in an effort to civilize them and help them adapt to white society.
in the 1870s reformers recruited small groups of indians to attend hampton institute a primarily black college.
in 1879 they organized the carlisle indian industrial school in pennsylvania.
like many black colleges carlisle emphasized practical industrial education.
ultimately however these reform efforts failed in part because they were unpopular with their intended beneficiaries.
universities and the growth of science and technology colleges and universities also proliferated rapidly in the late nineteenth century.
the morrill land grant act of 1862 by which the federal government had donated public land to states for the establishment of colleges led to the creation of sixty nine landgrant institutions in the last decades of the century among them the state university systems of california illinois minnesota and wisconsin.
other universities including chicago columbia harvard northwestern princeton syracuse and yale benefited from millions of dollars contributed by business and financial titans such as rockefeller and carnegie.
other philanthropists founded new universities or reorganized older ones to the age of the city 451 perpetuate their family names for example vanderbilt johns hopkins cornell duke tulane and stanford.
these and other universities played a vital role in the economic development of the united states in the late nineteenth century and beyond.
the land grant institutions were specifically mandated to advance knowledge in agriculture higher education and the economy and mechanics from the beginning therefore they were committed not just to abstract knowledge but to making discoveries that would be of practical use to farmers and manufacturers.
as they evolved into great state universities they retained that tradition and became the source of many of the great discoveries that helped american industry and commerce advance.
private universities emerged that served many of the same purposes the massachusetts institute of technology founded in 1865 soon became the nations premier engineering school johns hopkins university in baltimore founded in 1876 did much to advance medical scholarship as did the rockefeller institute for medical research in new york later rockefeller university and the carnegie institution.
by the early twentieth century older and more traditional universities were beginning to form relationships with the private sector and the government doing research that did not just advance knowledge for its own sake but that was directly applicable to practical problems of the time.
medical science both the culture of and the scientific basis for medical care were changing rapidly in the early twentieth century.
most doctors were beginning to accept the new medical assumption that there were underlying causes to particular symptoms that a symptom was not itself a disease.
they were also beginning to make use of new or improved technologies the x ray improved microscopes and other diagnostic devices that made it possible to classify and distinguish among different diseases.
laboratory tests could now identify infections such as typhoid and dysentery.
these technologies were a critical first step toward the effective treatment of diseases.
at about the same time pharmaceutical research began to produce some important new medicines.
aspirin was first synthesized in 1899.
other researchers experimented with chemicals that might destroy diseases in the blood an effort that eventually led to the various forms of chemotherapy that are still widely used in treating cancer.
in 1906 an american surgeon g w crile became the first physician to use blood transfusion in treatment which revolutionized surgery.
in the past patients often lost so much blood during operations that extensive surgery could be fatal for that reason alone.
with transfusions it became possible to conduct much longer and more elaborate operations.
the widespread acceptance by the end of the nineteenth century of the germ theory of disease had important implications.
physicians quickly discovered that germ theory accepted exposure to germs did not by itself necessarily cause disease and they began looking for the other factors that determined who got sick and who did not.
among the factors they eventually discovered were general health previous medical history diet and nutrition and eventually genetic predisposition.
the awareness of the importance of infection in spreading disease also encouraged doctors to sterilize their instruments use surgical gloves and otherwise purify the medical environment.
by the early twentieth century american physicians and surgeons were generally recognized as among the best in the world and american medical education declining mortality was beginning to attract students from many other countries.
these improvements in medical knowledge and training along with improvements in sanitation and public health did much to reduce infection and mortality in most american communities.
452 chapter 18 education for women the post civil war era saw an important expansion of educational opportunities for women although such opportunities continued to lag far behind those available to men and were almost entirely denied to black women.
most public high schools accepted women readily but opportunities for higher education were fewer.
at the end of the civil war only three american colleges were coeducational.
after the war many of the land grant colleges and universities in the midwest and such private universities as cornell and wesleyan began to admit women along with men.
but coeducation was less crucial to womens education in this period than was the creation of a network of womens colleges.
mount holyoke in central massachusetts had begun its life in 1836 as a seminary for women it became a full fledged college in the 1880s at about the same time that entirely new female institutions were emerging vassar wellesley smith bryn mawr wells and goucher.
a few of the larger private universities created separate colleges for women on their campuses barnard at columbia and radcliffe at harvard for example.
the female college was part of an important phenomenon in the history of modern american women the emergence of distinctive womens communities outside the family.
most faculty members and many administrators were women usually unmarried.
and college life produced a spirit of sorority and commitment among educated women that had important effects in later years.
most female college graduates ultimately married but they married at a more advanced age than their noncollege counterparts.
a significant minority perhaps over 25 percent did not marry at all but devoted themselves to careers.
the growth of female higher education clearly became for some women a liberating experience persuading them that they had roles other than those of wives and mothers to perform in their rapidly changing urban industrial society.
conclusion the extraordinary growth of american cities in the last decades of the nineteenth century led to both great achievements and enormous problems.
cities became centers of learning art and commerce and produced great advances in technology transportation architecture and communications.
they provided their residents and their many visitors with varied and dazzling experiences so much so that people increasingly left the countryside to move to the city.
but cities were also places of congestion filth disease and corruption.
with populations expanding too rapidly for services to keep up most american cities in this era struggled with makeshift techniques to solve the basic problems of providing water disposing of sewage building roads running public transportation fighting fire stopping crime and preventing or curing disease.
city governments many of them dominated by political machines and ruled by party bosses were often models of inefficiency and corruption although in their informal way they also provided substantial services to the working class and immigrant constituencies who needed them most.
yet they also managed to oversee great public projects the building of parks museums opera houses and theaters usually in partnership with private developers.
the city brought together races ethnic groups and classes of extraordinary variety from the families of great wealth that the new industrial age was creating to the vast the age of the city 453 working class much of it consisting of immigrants who crowded into densely packed neighborhoods divided by nationality.
the city also spawned temples of consumerism shops boutiques and above all the great department stores.
and it created forums for public recreation and entertainment parks theaters athletic fields amusement parks and later movie palaces.
urban life created anxiety among those who lived within the cities and among those who observed them from afar.
but in fact american cities adapted reasonably successfully over time to the great demands their growth made of them and learned to govern themselves if not entirely honestly and efficiently at least enough to allow them to survive and grow.

what was the relationship between immigration and urbanization in the late nineteenth century.
how did the new consumer economy affect roles and expectations for women.
what was darwinism and what was its impact on american intellectual life.
from crisis to empire the politics of equilibrium the agrarian revolt the crisis of the 1890s stirrings of imperialism war with spain the republic as empire looking ahead 1.
what were the major social and economic problems that beset the united states in the late nineteenth century and how did the two major political parties respond to these problems.
what was populism what were its goals and to what degree were these goals achieved.
how did the united states become an imperial power.
the united states approached the end of the nineteenth century as a fundamentally different nation from what it had been at the beginning of the civil war.
with rapid change came cascading social and political problems problems that the weak and conservative governments of the time showed little inclination or ability to address.
a catastrophic economic depression that began in 1893 created devastating hardship for millions of americans.
farmers responded by creating an agrarian political movement known as populism.
american workers facing massive unemployment staged large and occasionally violent strikes.
not since the civil war had american politics been so polarized and impassioned.
the election of 1896 which pitted the agrarian hero william jennings bryan against the solid conservative william mckinley was dramatic but anticlimactic.
supported by the mighty republican party and many eastern groups who looked with suspicion and unease at the agricultural demands coming from the west mckinley easily triumphed.
mckinley did little in his first term in office to resolve the problems and grievances of his time but the economy revived nevertheless.
having largely ignored the depression however mckinley focused on another great national cause the plight of cuba in its war with spain.
in the spring of 1898 the united states declared war on spain and entered the conflict in cuba a brief but bloody war that ended with an american victory four months later.
454 the conflict had begun as a way to support cuban independence from the spanish but a group of fervent and influential imperialists worked to convert the war into an occasion for acquiring overseas possessions.
despite a powerful anti imperialist movement the acquisition of the former spanish colonies proceeded only to draw americans into yet another imperial war this one in the philippines where the americans not the spanish were the targets of local enmity.
the politics of equilibrium the enormous social and economic changes of the late nineteenth century strained not only the nations traditional social arrangements but its political institutions as well.
searching for stability and social justice americans looked to the government for leadership.
yet that government during much of this period was ill equipped to confront these new challenges.
as a result problems and grievances festered and grew.
the party system the most striking feature of late nineteenthcentury politics was the stability of the party system.
from the end of reconstruction until the late 1890s the electorate was divided almost evenly between the republicans and the democrats.
sixteen states were solidly and consistently republican and fourteen states most in the south were solidly and consistently democratic.
only a handful of states were usually in doubt and they generally decided the results of national elections often on the basis of voter turnout.
the republican party captured the presidency in all but two of the elections of the era but in the five presidential elections beginning in 1876 the average popular vote margin separating the democratic and republican candidates was 1 5 percent.
