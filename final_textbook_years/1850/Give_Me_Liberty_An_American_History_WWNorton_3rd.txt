california also attracted a small number of american newcomers.
in 1846 alfred robinson who had moved from boston published life in california.
in this age of annexation he wondered why not extend the area of freedom by the annexation of california the texas r e v o lt the first part of mexico to be settled by significant numbers of americans was texas whose non indian population of spanish origin called tejanos numbered only about 2 000 when mexico became independent.
in order to develop the region the mexican government accepted an offer by moses austin a connecticut born farmer to colonize it with americans.
in 1820 austin received a large land grant.
he died soon afterward and his son what were the major factors contributing to u s territorial expansion in the 1840s.
stephen continued the plan reselling land in smaller plots to american settlers at twelve cents per acre.
by 1830 the population of american origin had reached around 7 000 considerably exceeding the number of tejanos.
alarmed that its grip on the area was weakening the mexican government in 1830 annulled existing land contracts and barred future emigration from the united states.
led by stephen austin american settlers demanded greater autonomy within mexico.
part of the areas tiny tejano elite joined them.
mostly ranchers and large farmers they had welcomed the economic boom that accompanied the settlers and had formed economic alliances with american traders.
the issue of slavery further exacerbated matters.
mexico had abolished slavery but local authorities allowed american settlers to bring slaves with them.
when mexicos ruler general antonio lpez de santa anna sent an army in 1835 to impose central authority a local committee charged that his purpose was to give liberty to our slaves and make slaves of ourselves the appearance of santa annas army sparked a chaotic revolt in texas.
the rebels formed a provisional government that soon called for texan independence.
on march 13 1836 santa annas army stormed the alamo a mission compound in san antonio killing its 187 american and tejano defenders.
remember the alamo became the texans rallying cry.
in april forces under sam houston a former governor of tennessee routed santa annas army at the battle of san jacinto and forced him to recognize texan independence.
houston was soon elected the first president of the republic of texas.
in 1837 the texas congress called for union with the united states.

buren shelved the question.
settlers from the united states nonetheless poured into the region many of them slaveowners taking up fertile cotton land.
by 1845 the population of texas had reached nearly 150 000.
the election of texas annexation remained on the political back burner until president john tyler revived it in the hope of rescuing his failed administration and securing southern support for renomination in 1844.
in april 1844 a letter by john c calhoun whom tyler had appointed secretary of state was leaked to the press.
it linked the idea of absorbing texas directly to the goal of strengthening slavery in the united states.
some southern leaders indeed hoped that texas could be divided into several states thus further enhancing the souths power in congress.
late that month henry clay and former president van buren the prospective whig and democratic candidates for president and two of the party systems most venerable leaders met at clays kentucky plantation.
they agreed to issue letters rejecting immediate annexation on the grounds that it might provoke war with mexico.
clay and van buren were reacting to the slavery issue in the traditional manner by trying to keep it out of national politics.
clay went on to receive the whig nomination but for van buren the letters proved to be a disaster.
at the democratic convention southerners bent on annexation deserted van burens cause and he failed to receive the two thirds majority necessary for nomination.
the delegates then turned to the little known james k polk a former governor of tennessee whose main assets were his support for annexation and his close association with andrew jackson still the partys most popular figure.
like nearly all the presidents before him polk was a slaveholder.
he owned substantial cotton plantations in tennessee and mississippi where conditions were so brutal that only half of the slave children lived to the age of fifteen and adults frequently ran away.
to soothe injured feelings among northern democrats over the rejection of van buren the party platform called not only for the what were the major factors contributing to u s territorial expansion in the 1840s.
reannexation of texas implying that texas had been part of the louisiana purchase and therefore once belonged to the united states but also the reoccupation of all of oregon.
fifty four forty or fight american control of oregon all the way to its northern boundary at north latitude 5440 became a popular campaign slogan.
but the bitterness of the northern van burenites over what they considered to be a betrayal on the part of the south would affect american politics for years to come.
polk was the first dark horse candidate for president that is one whose nomination was completely unexpected.
in the fall he defeated clay in an extremely close election.
polks margin in the popular vote was less than 2 percent.
had not james g birney running again as the liberty party candidate received 16 000 votes in new york mostly from antislavery whigs clay would have been elected.
in march 1845 only days before polks inauguration congress declared texas part of the united states.
the road to war james k polk may have been virtually unknown but he assumed the presidency with a clearly defined set of goals to reduce the tariff reestablish the independent treasury system settle the dispute over ownership of oregon and bring california into the union.
congress soon enacted the first two goals and the third was accomplished in an agreement with great britain dividing oregon at the forty ninth parallel.
many northerners were bitterly disappointed by this compromise considering it a betrayal of polks campaign promise not to give up any part of oregon without a fight.
but the president secured his main objectives the willamette valley and the magnificent harbor of puget sound.
acquiring california proved more difficult.
polk dispatched an emissary to mexico offering to purchase the region but the mexican government refused to negotiate.
by the spring of 1846 polk was planning for military action.
in april american soldiers under zachary taylor moved into the region between the nueces river and the rio grande land claimed by both countries on the disputed border between texas and mexico.
this action made conflict with mexican forces inevitable.
when fighting broke out polk claimed that the mexicans had shed blood upon american soil and called for a declaration of war.
the war and its critics the mexican war was the first american conflict to be fought primarily on foreign soil and the first in which american troops occupied a foreign capital.
inspired by the expansionist fervor of manifest destiny a majority of americans supported the war.
they were convinced as herman melville put it in his novel white jacket 1850 that since americans bear the ark of liberties for all mankind national war news from mexico an 1848 painting by richard c woodville shows how americans received war news through the popular press.

ulysses s grant who served with distinction in mexico later called the war one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger nation against a weaker nation an indication that the united states was beginning to behave like european monarchies not a democratic republic.
henry david thoreau was jailed in massachusetts in 1846 for refusing to pay taxes as a protest against the war.
defending his action thoreau wrote an important essay on civil disobedience which inspired such later advocates of nonviolent resistance to unjust laws as martin luther king jr under a government which imprisons any unjustly wrote thoreau the true place of a just man is also a prison among the wars critics was abraham lincoln who had been elected to congress in 1846 from illinois.
like many whigs lincoln questioned whether the mexicans had actually inflicted casualties on american soil as polk claimed and in 1847 he introduced a resolution asking the president to specify the precise spot where blood had first been shed.
but lincoln was also disturbed by polks claiming the right to initiate an invasion of mexico.
allow the president to invade a neighboring country whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion he declared and you allow him to make war at pleasure.
if today he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade canada to prevent the british from invading us how could you stop him lincolns stance proved unpopular in illinois.
he had already agreed to serve only one term in congress but when democrats captured his seat in 1848 many blamed the result on lincolns criticism of the war.
but the concerns he raised regarding the presidents power to make war at pleasure would continue to echo in the twentieth and twenty first centuries.
combat in mexico more than 60 000 volunteers enlisted and did most of the fighting.
combat took place on three fronts.
in june 1846 a band of american insurrectionists proclaimed california freed from mexican control and named captain john c frmont head of a small scientific expedition in the west its ruler.
their aim was californias incorporation into the united states but for the moment they adopted a flag depicting a large bear as the symbol of the areas independence.
a month later the u s navy sailed into monterey and san francisco harbors raised the american flag and put an end to the bear flag republic at almost the same time 1 600 american troops under general stephen w kearney occupied sante fe without resistance and then set out for southern california where they helped to put down a mexican uprising against american rule.
the bulk of the fighting occurred in central mexico.
in february 1847 taylor defeated santa annas army at the battle of buena vista.
when the mexican government still refused to negotiate polk ordered american forces under winfield scott to march inland from the port of vera cruz toward mexico city.
scotts forces routed mexican defenders and in september occupied the countrys capital.
in february 1848 the two governments agreed to the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo which confirmed the annexation of texas and ceded california and present day new mexico what were the major factors contributing to u s territorial expansion in the 1840s.

fruits of manifest destiny mexican negotiators of 1848 complained it was unprecedented to launch a war because a country refused to sell part of its territory to a neighbor.
race and manifest destiny with the end of the mexican war the united states absorbed half a million square miles of mexicos territory one third of that nations total area.
a region that for centuries had been united was suddenly split in two dividing families and severing trade routes.
an estimated 75 000 to 100 000 spanish speaking mexicans and more than 150 000 indians inhabited the mexican cession.
the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo guaranteed to male citizens of the area the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and all the rights of americans a provision designed to protect the property of large mexican landowners in california.
as to indians whose homelands and hunting grounds suddenly became part of the united states the treaty referred to them only as savage tribes whom the united states must prevent from launching incursions into mexico across the new border.
the spirit of manifest destiny gave a new stridency to ideas about racial superiority.
during the 1840s territorial expansion came to be seen as proof of the innate superiority of the anglo saxon race a mythical construct defined largely by its opposites blacks indians hispanics and catholics.
race declared john l osullivans democratic review was the key to the history of nations and the rise and fall of empires.
what were the major factors contributing to u s territorial expansion in the 1840s.
race in the mid nineteenth century was an amorphous notion involving color culture national origin class and religion.
newspapers magazines and scholarly works popularized the link between american freedom and the supposedly innate liberty loving qualities of anglo saxon protestants.
the annexation of texas and conquest of much of mexico became triumphs of civilization progress and liberty over the tyranny of the catholic church and the innate incapacity of mongrel races indeed calls by some expansionists for the united states to annex all of mexico failed in part because of fear that the nation could not assimilate its large non white catholic population supposedly unfit for citizenship in a republic.
redefining race the imposition of the american system of race relations proved detrimental to many inhabitants of the newly acquired territories.
texas had already demonstrated as much.
mexico had abolished slavery and declared persons of spanish indian and african origin equal before the law.
the texas constitution adopted after independence not only included protections for slavery but also denied civil rights to indians and persons of african origin.
only whites were permitted to purchase land and the entrance of free blacks into the state was prohibited altogether.
every privilege dear to a free man is taken away one free black resident of texas complained.

san francisco a town of 1 000 in 1848 became the gateway to the el dorado of northern california.
by 1850 it had 30 000 residents and had become perhaps the worlds most racially and ethnically diverse city.
unlike farming frontiers settled by families most of the gold rush migrants were young men.
women played many roles in western mining communities running restaurants and boardinghouses and working as laundresses cooks and prostitutes.
but as late as 1860 californias male population outnumbered females by nearly three to one.
california and the boundaries of freedom as early surface mines quickly became exhausted they gave way to underground mining that required a large investment of capital.
this economic development worsened conflicts among californias many racial and ethnic groups engaged in fierce competition for gold.
the law was very fragile in gold rush california.
in 1851 and 1856 committees of vigilance took control of san francisco sweeping aside established courts to try and execute those accused of crimes.
white miners organized extralegal groups that expelled foreign miners mexicans chileans chinese french and american indians from areas with gold.
the state legislature imposed a tax of twenty dollars per month on foreign miners driving many of them from the state.
california would long remain in the american imagination a place of infinite opportunity where newcomers could start their lives anew.
but the boundaries of freedom there were tightly drawn.
the state constitution of 1850 limited voting and the right to testify in court to whites excluding indians asians and the states few blacks who numbered only 962 persons.
california landowners who claimed spanish descent or had inter what were the major factors contributing to u s territorial expansion in the 1840s.
married with american settlers were deemed to be white.
but with land titles derived from mexican days challenged in court many sold out to newcomers from the east.
for californias indians the gold rush and absorption into the united states proved to be disastrous.
gold seekers overran indian communities.
miners ranchers and vigilantes murdered thousands of indians.
determined to reduce the native population state officials paid millions in bounties to private militias that launched attacks on the states indians.
although california was a free state thousands of indian children declared orphans or vagrants by local courts were bought and sold as slaves.
by 1860 californias indian population nearly 150 000 when the mexican war ended had been reduced to around 30 000.
the other gold rush in a remarkable coincidence the california gold rush took place almost simultaneously with another located halfway around the world.
in 1851 gold was discovered in australia then a collection of british colonies.
during the 1850s california and australia together produced 80 percent of the worlds gold.
like california australia attracted gold seekers from across the globe.
the population of victoria the colony where gold was found grew from 77 000 in 1851 to 411 000 six years later.
like san francisco the australian city of melbourne rose to prominence on the basis of its proximity to the gold fields.
as in california the gold rush was a disaster for the aboriginal peoples as native australians are called whose population already declining fell precipitously.
in australia like california significant numbers of chinese miners took part in the gold rush only to face persistent efforts by miners of european origin to drive them from the fields.
indeed australians frequently modeled anti chinese legislation especially their tax on foreign miners on measures that had been pioneered in california.

a dose of arsenic victory over mexico added more than 1 million square miles to the united states an area larger than the louisiana purchase.
but the acquisition of this vast territory raised the fatal issue that would disrupt the political system and plunge the nation into civil war whether slavery should be allowed to expand into the west.
events soon confirmed ralph waldo emersons prediction that if the united states gobbled up part of mexico it will be as the man who swallows arsenic.
mexico will poison us why did the expansion of slavery become the most divisive political issue in the 1840s and 1850s.
the wilmot proviso before 1846 the status of slavery in all parts of the united states had been settled either by state law or by the missouri compromise which determined slaverys status in the louisiana purchase.
the acquisition of new land reopened the question of slaverys expansion.
the divisive potential of this issue became clear in 1846 when congressman david wilmot of pennsylvania proposed a resolution prohibiting slavery from all territory acquired from mexico.
party lines crumbled as every northerner democrat and whig alike supported what came to be known as the wilmot proviso while nearly all southerners opposed it.
the measure passed the house where the more populous north possessed a majority but failed in the senate with its even balance of free and slave states.
the proviso said one newspaper as if by magic brought to a head the great question that is about to divide the american people in 1848 opponents of slaverys expansion organized the free soil party and nominated martin van buren for president and charles francis adams the son of john quincy adams as his running mate.
democrats nominated lewis cass of michigan who proposed that the decision on whether to allow slavery should be left to settlers in the new territories an idea later given the name popular sovereignty.
van buren was motivated in part by revenge against the south for jettisoning him in 1844.
but his campaign struck a chord among northerners opposed to the expansion of slavery and he polled some 300 000 votes 14 percent of the northern total.
victory in 1848 went to the whig candidate zachary taylor a hero of the mexican war and a louisiana sugar planter.
but the fact that a former president and the son of another abandoned their parties to run on a free soil platform showed that antislavery sentiment had spread far beyond abolitionist ranks.
antislavery commented senator william h seward of new york is at length a respectable element in politics the free soil appeal the free soil position had a popular appeal in the north that far exceeded the abolitionists demand for immediate emancipation and equal rights for blacks.
while congress possessed no constitutional power to abolish slavery within a state well known precedents existed for keeping territories areas that had not yet entered the union as states free from slavery.
congress had done this in 1787 in the northwest ordinance and again in the missouri compromise of 1820 1821.
many northerners had long resented what they considered southern domination of the federal government.
the idea of preventing the creation of new slave states appealed to those who favored policies such as the protective tariff and government aid to internal improvements that the majority of southern political leaders opposed.
for thousands of northerners moreover the ability to move to the new western territories held out the promise of economic betterment.
the depression of the early 1840s had reinforced the traditional equation of land ownership with economic freedom.
the labor movement promoted access to western land as a way of combating unemployment and low wages in the east.
freedom of the soil declared george henry evans the c h.
13 a house divided 1840 1861 a dose of arsenic editor of a pro labor newspaper offered the only alternative to permanent economic dependence for american workers.
such views merged easily with opposition to the expansion of slavery.
if slave plantations were to occupy the fertile lands of the west northern migration would be effectively blocked.
the term free soil had a double meaning.
the free soil platform of 1848 called both for barring slavery from western territories and for the federal government to provide free homesteads to settlers in the new territories.
unlike abolitionism the free soil idea also appealed to the racism so widespread in northern society.
wilmot himself insisted that his controversial proviso was motivated not by morbid sympathy for the slaves but to advance the cause and rights of the free white man in part by preventing him from having to compete with black labor to white southerners the idea of barring slavery from territory acquired from mexico seemed a violation of their equal rights as members of the union.
southerners had fought and died to win these territories surely they had a right to share in the fruits of victory.
to single out slavery as the one form of property barred from the west would be an affront to the south and its distinctive way of life.
a majority of slaves in 1848 lived in states that had not even existed when the constitution was adopted.
many older plantation areas already suffered from soil exhaustion.
just as northerners believed westward expansion essential to their economic wellbeing southern leaders became convinced that slavery must expand or die.
moreover the admission of new free states would overturn the delicate political balance between the sections and make the south a permanent minority.
southern interests would not be secure in a union dominated by non slaveholding states.

the french replaced their monarchy with a republic.
hungarians proclaimed their independence from austrian rule.
patriots in italy and germany both divided into numerous states demanded national unification.
but the revolutionary tide receded.
chartism faded away.
in france the second republic was soon succeeded by the reign of emperor napoleon iii.
revolts in budapest rome and other cities were crushed.
would their own experiment in self government some americans wondered suffer the same fate as the failed revolutions of europe.
with the slavery issue appearing more and more ominous established party leaders moved to resolve differences between the sections.
some disputes were of long standing but the immediate source of controversy arose from the acquisition of new lands after the mexican war.
in 1850 california asked to be admitted to the union as a free state.
many southerners opposed the measure fearing that it would upset the sectional balance in congress.
senator henry clay offered a plan with four main provisions why did the expansion of slavery become the most divisive political issue in the 1840s and 1850s.

the slave trade but not slavery itself would be abolished in the nations capital.
a stringent new law would allow southerners to reclaim runaway slaves.
and the status of slavery in the remaining territories acquired from mexico would be left to the decision of the local white inhabitants.

john c calhoun again representing south carolina was too ill to speak.
a colleague read his remarks rejecting the very idea of compromise.
slavery calhoun insisted must be protected by the national government and extended into all the new territories.
the north must yield or the union could not survive.

he accused southern leaders in congress of holding california hostage to their own legislative aims and insisted that all congress needed to do was admit california to the union.

the new fugitive slave act however made further controversy inevitable.
the law allowed special federal commissioners to determine the fate of alleged fugitives without benefit of a jury trial or even testimony by the accused individual.
it prohibited local authorities from interfering with the capture of fugitives and required individual citizens to assist in such capture when called upon by federal agents.
thus southern leaders usually strong defenders of states rights and local autonomy supported a measure that brought federal agents into communities throughout the north armed with the power to override local law enforcement and judicial procedures to secure the return of runaway slaves.
the security of slavery was more important to them than states rights consistency.
the fugitive slave issue affected all the free states not just those that bordered on the south.
slave catchers for example entered california attempting to apprehend fugitives from texas and new mexico who hoped to reach freedom in british columbia.
the issue drew into politics individuals like ralph waldo emerson who although antislavery had previously remained aloof from the abolitionist crusade.
emerson and others influenced by transcendentalism viewed the fugitive slave act as a dangerous example of how a government doing the bidding of the south could override an individuals ability to act according to his conscience the foundation for emerson of genuine freedom.
during the 1850s federal tribunals heard more than 300 cases and ordered 157 fugitives returned to the south many at the governments expense.
but the law further widened sectional divisions.
in a series of dramatic confrontations fugitives aided by abolitionist allies violently resisted recapture.
a large crowd in 1851 rescued the escaped slave jerry from jail in syracuse new york and spirited him off to canada.
in the same year an owner who attempted to recapture a fugitive was killed in christiana pennsylvania.
later in the decade margaret garner a kentucky slave who had escaped with her family to ohio killed her own young daughter rather than see her returned to slavery by federal marshals.
at the end of the twentieth century this incident would become the basis for toni morrisons celebrated novel beloved.
in the north several thousand fugitives and free born blacks worried why did the expansion of slavery become the most divisive political issue in the 1840s and 1850s.
that they might be swept up in the stringent provisions of the fugitive slave act fled to safety in canada.
the sight of so many refugees seeking liberty in a foreign land challenged the familiar image of the united states as an asylum for freedom.
families are separating reported a toronto newspaper in october 1850 leaving their homes and flying in all directions to seek in canada under the british flag the protection denied to them in the free republic douglas and popular sovereignty at least temporarily the compromise of 1850 seemed to have restored sectional peace and party unity.
in the 1852 presidential election democrat franklin pierce won a sweeping victory over the whig winfield scott on a platform that recognized the compromise as a final settlement of the slavery controversy.
pierce received a broad popular mandate winning 254 electoral votes to scotts 42.
yet his administration turned out to be one of the most disastrous in american history.
it witnessed the collapse of the party system inherited from the age of jackson.
in 1854 the old political order finally succumbed to the disruptive pressures of sectionalism.
early in that year illinois senator stephen a douglas introduced a bill to provide territorial governments for kansas and nebraska located within the louisiana purchase.
with calhoun clay and webster the great triumvirate all having died between 1850 and 1852 douglas although only forty one saw himself as the new leader of the senate.
a strong believer in western development he hoped that a transcontinental railroad could be constructed through kansas or nebraska.
but he feared that this could not be accomplished unless formal governments had been established in these territories.
southerners in congress however seemed adamant against allowing the organization of new free territories that might further upset the sectional balance.
douglas hoped to satisfy them by applying the principle of popular sovereignty whereby the status of slavery would be determined by the votes of local settlers not congress.
to douglas popular sovereignty embodied the idea of local self government and offered a middle ground between the extremes of north and south.
it was a principle on which all parts of the democratic party could unite and which might enable him to capture the presidential nomination in 1856 to succeed the ineffectual pierce.
the kansas nebraska act unlike the lands taken from mexico kansas and nebraska lay in the nations heartland directly in the path of westward migration.
slavery moreover was prohibited there under the terms of the missouri compromise which douglass bill repealed.
in response to douglass proposal a group of antislavery congressmen issued the appeal of the independent democrats.
written by two abolitionists from ohio congressman joshua giddings and senator salmon p chase the appeal proved to be one of the most effective pieces of political persuasion in american history.

thanks to douglass energetic leadership the kansas nebraska act became law.
but it shattered the democratic partys unity.
even as congress debated protest meetings sprang up throughout the north.
fearing that the bills unpopularity among their constituents would harm their chances for reelection half the northern democrats in the house cast negative votes.
loyalty to pierce douglas and their party led the other half to support the measure.
it is difficult to think of a piece of legislation in american history that had a more profound impact on national life.
in the wake of the bills passage american politics underwent a profound reorganization.
during the next two years the whig party unable to develop a unified response to the political crisis collapsed.
from a region divided between the two parties the south became solidly democratic.
most northern whigs augmented by thousands of disgruntled democrats joined a new organization the republican party dedicated to preventing the further expansion of slavery.
why did the expansion of slavery become the most divisive political issue in the 1840s and 1850s.
t h e r i s e o f t h e r e p u b l i c a n pa r t y the northern economy the disruptive impact of slavery on the traditional parties was the immediate cause of political transformation in the mid 1850s.
but the rise of the republican party also reflected underlying economic and social changes notably the completion of the market revolution and the beginning of mass immigration from europe.
the period from 1843 when prosperity returned to 1857 when another economic downturn hit witnessed explosive economic growth especially in the north.
the catalyst was the completion of the railroad network.
from 5 000 miles in 1848 railroad track mileage grew to 30 000 by 1860 with most of the construction occurring in ohio illinois and other states of the old northwest.
four great trunk railroads now linked eastern cities with western farming and commercial centers.
the railroads completed the reorientation of the northwests trade from the south to the east.
as late as 1850 most western farmers still shipped their produce down the mississippi river.
ten years later however railroads transported nearly all their crops to the east at a fraction of the previous cost.
by 1860 for example 60 million bushels of wheat were passing through buffalo on their way to market in eastern cities and abroad.
the economic integration of the northwest and northeast created the groundwork for their political unification in the republican party.
by 1860 the north had become a complex integrated economy with eastern industrialists marketing manufactured goods to the commercial farmers of the west while residents of the regions growing cities consumed the food westerners produced.
northern society stood poised between old and new ways.
the majority of the population still lived not in large cities but in small towns and rural areas where the ideal of economic independence owning ones own farm or shop still lay within reach.
yet the majority of the northern workforce no longer labored in agriculture and the industrial revolution was spreading rapidly.

two great areas of industrial production had arisen.
one along the atlantic coast stretched from boston to philadelphia and baltimore.
a second was centered on or near the great lakes in inland cities like buffalo cleveland pittsburgh and chicago.
driven by railroad expansion coal mining and iron manufacturing were growing rapidly.

ing 5 000 reapers each year along with barbed wire windmills and prefabricated balloon frame houses all of which facilitated further western settlement.
new york city by 1860 had become the nations preeminent financial commercial and manufacturing center.
although the southern economy was also growing and the continuing expansion of cotton production brought wealth to slaveholders the south did not share in these broad economic changes.
the rise and fa l l of the know nothings as noted in chapter 9 nativism hostility to immigrants especially catholics emerged as a local political movement in the 1840s.
but in 1854 with the party system in crisis it burst on the national political scene with the sudden appearance of the american or know nothing party so called because it began as a secret organization whose members when asked about its existence were supposed to respond i know nothing.
the party trumpeted its dedication to reserving political office for native born americans and to resisting the aggressions of the catholic church such as its supposed efforts to undermine public school systems.
the knownothings swept the 1854 state elections in massachusetts electing the governor all of the states congressmen and nearly every member of the state legislature.
they captured the mayors office in cities like philadelphia chicago and san francisco as well.
in many states nativists emerged as a major component of victorious anti nebraska coalitions of voters opposed to the kansas nebraska act.
in the north the know nothings appeal combined anti catholic and antislavery sentiment with opposition to the sale of liquor often added to the equation.
after all most catholics as noted in the previous chapter vigorously opposed the reform move george catlins 1827 painting five points depicts a working class immigrant neighborhood in new york city that gained a reputation for crime drinking and overcrowding.

the rise of the republican party ments inspired by evangelical protestantism especially antislavery and temperance.
the 1854 elections said one observer revealed a deep seated feeling in favor of human freedom and also a fine determination that hereafter none but americans shall rule america despite severe anti irish discrimination in jobs housing and education however it is remarkable how little came of demands that immigrants be barred from the political nation.
all european immigrants benefited from being white.
during the 1850s free blacks found immigrants pushing them out of even the jobs as servants and common laborers previously available to them.
the newcomers had the good fortune to arrive after white male suffrage had become the norm and automatically received the right to vote.
even as new england states sought to reduce immigrant political power massachusetts and connecticut made literacy a voting requirement and massachusetts mandated a two year waiting period between becoming a naturalized citizen and voting western states desperate for labor allowed immigrants to vote well before they became citizens.
in a country where the suffrage had become essential to understandings of freedom it is significant that many white male immigrants could vote almost from the moment they landed in america while non whites whose ancestors had lived in the country for centuries could not.
the free labor ideology by 1856 it was clear that the republican party a coalition of antislavery democrats northern whigs free soilers and know nothings opposed to the further expansion of slavery would become the major alternative to the democratic party in the north.
republicans managed to convince most northerners that the slave power as they called the souths proslavery political leadership posed a more immediate threat to their liberties and aspirations than popery and immigration.
the partys appeal rested on the idea of free labor in republican hands the antithesis between free society and slave society coalesced into a comprehensive worldview that glorified the north as the home of progress opportunity and freedom.
the defining quality of northern society republicans declared was the opportunity it offered each laborer to move up to the status of landowning farmer or independent craftsman thus achieving the economic independence essential to freedom.
slavery by contrast spawned a social order consisting of degraded slaves poor whites with no hope of advancement and idle aristocrats.
the struggle over the territories was a contest about which of two antagonistic labor systems would dominate the west and by implication the nations future.
if slavery were to spread into the west northern free laborers would be barred and their chances for social advancement severely diminished.

republicans insisted must be kept out of the territories so that free labor could flourish.
to southern claims that slavery was the foundation of liberty republicans responded with the rallying cry freedom national meaning not abolition but ending the federal governments support of slavery.
under the banner of free labor northerners of diverse backgrounds and interests rallied in defense of the superiority of their own society.
republicans acknowledged that some northern laborers including most irish immigrants were locked into jobs as factory workers and unskilled laborers and found it extremely difficult to rise in the social scale.
but republicans concluded that it was their dependent nature a lack of protestant middle class virtues that explained the plight of the immigrant poor.
republicans were not abolitionists they focused on preventing the spread of slavery not attacking it where it existed.
nonetheless many party leaders viewed the nations division into free and slave societies as an irrepressible conflict as senator william h seward of new york put it in 1858 that eventually would have to be resolved.
these two systems of society seward insisted were incompatible within a single nation.
the market revolution seward argued by drawing the entire nation closer together in a web of transportation and commerce heightened the tension between freedom and slavery.
the united states he predicted must and will sooner or later become either entirely a slaveholding nation or entirely a free labor nation bleeding kansas and the election of their free labor outlook which resonated so effectively with deeply held northern values helps to explain the republicans rapid rise to prominence.
but dramatic events in 1855 and 1856 also fueled the partys growth.
when kansas held elections in 1854 and 1855 hundreds of proslavery missourians crossed the border to cast fraudulent ballots.
president franklin pierce recognized the legitimacy of the resulting proslavery legislature and replaced the territorial governor andrew h reeder of pennsylvania when he dissented.
settlers from free states soon established a rival government and a sporadic civil war broke out in kansas in which some 200 persons eventually lost their lives.
in one incident in may 1856 a proslavery mob attacked the free soil stronghold of lawrence burning public buildings and pillaging private homes.
bleeding kansas seemed to discredit douglass policy of leaving the decision on slavery up to the local population thus aiding the republicans.
the party also drew strength from an unprecedented incident in the halls of congress.

stung by the northern reaction to the kansas nebraska act the democrats nominated james buchanan who had been minister to great britain in 1854 and thus had no direct connection with that divisive measure.
the democratic platform endorsed the principle of popular sovereignty as the only viable solution to the slavery controversy.
meanwhile the know nothings presented ex president millard fillmore as their candidate.
frmont outpolled buchanan in the north carrying eleven of sixteen free states a remarkable achievement for an organization that had existed for only two years.
but buchanan won the entire south and the key northern states of illinois indiana and pennsylvania enough to ensure his victory.
fillmore carried only maryland.

this was the case of dred scott.
during the 1830s scott had accompanied his owner dr john emerson of missouri to illinois where slavery had been prohibited by the northwest ordinance of 1787 and by state law and to wisconsin territory where it was barred by the missouri compromise.
after returning to missouri scott sued for his freedom claiming that residence on free soil had made him free.
the dred scott decision one of the most famous or infamous rulings in the long history of the supreme court was announced in march 1857 two days after buchanans inauguration.
the justices addressed three questions.
could a black person be a citizen and therefore sue in federal court.
did residence in a free state make scott free.
did congress possess the power to prohibit slavery in a territory.
all nine justices issued individual opinions.
but essentially the court divided 6 3 with justice robert c grier of pennsylvania at buchanans behind the scenes urging joining a southern majority.
speaking for the majority chief justice roger b taney declared that only white persons could be citizens of the united states.
the nations founders taney insisted believed that blacks had no rights which the white man was bound to respect descended from different ancestors and lacking a history of freedom blacks he continued could never be part of the nations political family the case could have ended there since scott had no right to sue but inspired by the idea of resolving the slavery issue taney pressed on.
scott he declared remained a slave.
illinois law had no effect on him after his return to missouri.
as for his residence in wisconsin congress possessed no power under the constitution to bar slavery from a territory.

the decision in effect declared unconstitutional the republican platform of restricting slaverys expansion.
it also seemed to undermine douglass doctrine of popular sovereignty.
for if congress lacked the power to prohibit slavery in a territory how could a territorial legislature created by congress do so.
the court a georgia newspaper exulted covers every question regarding slavery and settles it in favor of the south the decisions aftermath perhaps the person least directly affected by the dred scott decision was the plaintiff himself for a new master immediately emancipated scott and his wife harriet.
both died on the eve of the civil war having enjoyed their freedom for only a few years.
the impact on the party system was more far reaching.
among the decisions casualties was the reputation of the court itself which in the north sank to the lowest level in all of american history.
rather than abandoning their opposition to the expansion of slavery republicans now viewed the court as controlled by the slave power.
slavery announced president buchanan henceforth existed in all the territories by virtue of the constitution in 1858 his administration attempted to admit kansas as a slave state under the lecompton constitution which had been drafted by a pro southern convention and never submitted to a popular vote.
outraged by this violation of popular sovereignty douglas formed an unlikely alliance with congressional republicans to block the attempt.
kansas remained a territory it would join the union as a free state on the eve of the civil war.
the lecompton battle convinced southern democrats that they could not trust their partys most popular northern leader.
lincoln and slavery the depth of americans divisions over slavery were brought into sharp focus in 1858 in one of the most storied election campaigns in the nations history.
seeking reelection to the senate as both a champion of popular sovereignty and the man who had prevented the administration from forcing slavery on the people of kansas douglas faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from abraham lincoln then little known outside of illinois.
born into a modest farm family in kentucky in 1809 lincoln had moved as a youth to frontier indiana and then illinois.
although he began running for public office at the age of twenty one until the mid 1850s his career hardly seemed destined for greatness.
he had served four terms as a whig in the state legislature and one in congress from 1847 to 1849.
lincoln reentered politics in 1854 as a result of the kansas nebraska act.
he once said that he hated slavery as much as any abolitionist unlike abolitionists however lincoln was willing to compromise with the south to preserve the union.
i hate to see the poor creatures hunted down he once wrote of fugitive slaves but i bite my lip and keep silent but on one question he was inflexible stopping the expansion of slavery.
what enabled lincoln to emerge as president from the divisive party politics of the 1850s.
lincoln developed a critique of slavery and its expansion that gave voice to the central values of the emerging republican party and the millions of northerners whose loyalty it commanded.
his speeches combined the moral fervor of the abolitionists with the respect for order and the constitution of more conservative northerners.
i hate it he said in 1854 of the prospect of slaverys expansion because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself.
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity if slavery were allowed to expand he warned the love of liberty would be extinguished and with it americas special mission to be a symbol of democracy for the entire world.
even though lincoln lived in a society firmly in the grasp of the market revolution and worked on occasion as an attorney for the illinois central railroad one of the nations largest corporations his america was the world of the small producer.
in a sense his own life personified the free labor ideology and the opportunities northern society offered to laboring men.
during the 1850s property owning farmers artisans and shopkeepers far outnumbered wage earners in illinois.
lincoln was fascinated and disturbed by the writings of proslavery ideologues like george fitzhugh discussed in chapter 11 and he rose to the defense of northern society.
i want every man to have the chance said lincoln and i believe a black man is entitled to it in which he can better his condition blacks might not be the equal of whites in all respects but in their natural right to the fruits of their labor they were my equal and the equal of all others the lincoln douglas abraham lincoln in 1858 the year of the lincoln douglas debates.
campaign the campaign against douglas the norths preeminent political leader created lincolns national reputation.
accepting his partys nomination for the senate in june 1858 lincoln etched sharply the differences between them.
a house divided against itself he announced cannot stand.
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free lincolns point was not that civil war was imminent but that americans must choose between favoring and opposing slavery.
there could be no middle ground.
douglass policy of popular sovereignty he insisted reflected a moral indifference that could only result in the institutions spread throughout the entire country.
the lincoln douglas debates held in seven illinois towns and attended by tens of thousands of listeners remain classics of american political oratory.
clashing definitions of freedom lay at their heart.
to lincoln freedom meant opposition to slavery.
the nation needed to rekindle the spirit of the founding fathers who he claimed had tried to place slavery on the path to ultimate extinction douglas argued that the essence of freedom lay in local self government and individual self determination.
a large and diverse nation could only survive by respecting the right of each locality to determine its own institutions.
in response to a question posed by lincoln during the freeport debate douglas insisted that popular sovereignty was not incompatible with the dred scott decision.
although territorial legislatures could no longer exclude slavery directly he argued if the people stephen a douglas in a daguerreotype from around 1853.
recent h1 voices of freedom from the l i n c o l n d o u g l a s d e b at e s 1 8 5 8 the most famous political campaign in american history the 1858 race for the u s senate between senator stephen a douglas a former illinois judge and abraham lincoln was highlighted by seven debates in which they discussed the politics of slavery and contrasting understandings of freedom.
lincoln judge douglas says why cant this union endure permanently half slave and half free why cant we let it stand as our fathers placed it that is the exact difficulty between us.
i say when this government was first established it was the policy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new territories of the united states where it had not existed.
but judge douglas and his friends have broken up that policy and placed it upon a new basis by which it is to become national douglas mr lincoln says that this government cannot endure permanently in the same condition in which it was made by its framers divided into free and slave states.
he says that it has existed for about seventy years thus divided and yet he tells you that it cannot endure permanently on the same principles and in the same relative conditions in which our fathers made it.
one of the reserved rights of the states was the right to regulate the relations between master and servant on the slavery question.
now my friends if we will only act conscientiously upon this great principle of popular sovereignty which guarantees to each state and territory the right to do as it pleases on all things local and domestic instead of congress interfering we will continue to be at peace one with another.
and perpetual.
all i have asked or desired anywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the basis that the founders of our government originally placed it restricting it from the new territories.
judge douglas assumes that we have no interest in them that we have no right to interfere.
do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population if i may so express myself.
do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such institutions as we would like to have prevail there.
now irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as to whether there is a right or wrong in enslaving a negro i am still in favor of our new territories being in such a condition that white men may find a home.
i am in favor of this not merely for our own people but as an outlet for free white people everywhere the world over in which hans and baptiste and patrick and all other men from all the world may find new homes and better their conditions in life.
douglas for one i am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form.
i believe this government was made on the white basis.
i believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever.
i do not believe that the almighty made the negro capable of selfgovernment.
i say to you my fellow citizens that in my opinion the signers of the declaration of independence had no reference to the negro whatever when they declared all men to be created equal.
they desired to express by that phrase white men men of european birth and european descent.
when they spoke of the equality of men.
lincoln i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black douglas he tells you that i will not argue the question whether slavery is right or wrong.
i tell you why i will not do it.
i hold that the people of the slaveholding states are civilized men as well as ourselves that they bear consciences as well as we and that they are accountable to god and their posterity and not to us.
it is for them to decide therefore the moral and religious right of the slavery question for themselves within their own limits.
he says that he looks forward to a time when slavery shall be abolished everywhere.
i look forward to a time when each state shall be allowed to do as it pleases.
lincoln i suppose that the real difference between judge douglas and his friends and the republicans is that the judge is not in favor of making any difference between slavery and liberty.
and consequently races.
there is a physical difference between the two which in my judgment will probably forever every sentiment he utters discards the idea that there is any wrong in slavery.
that is the real issue.
that forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference i as well as is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of judge douglas and myself shall be silent.
it is the eternal struggle between these two judge douglas am in favor of the race to which i principles right and wrong throughout the world.
belong having the superior position.
but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man.
i agree with judge douglas he is not my equal in many respects certainly not in color perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment.
but in the right to eat the bread without leave of anybody else which his own hand earns he is my equal and the equal of judge douglas and the equal of every living man.
questions 1.
how do lincoln and douglas differ on what rights black americans are entitled to enjoy.
why does lincoln believe the nation cannot exist forever half slave and half free whereas douglas believes it can.
how does each of the speakers balance the right of each state to manage its own affairs against the right of every person to be free.
13 a house divided 1840 1861 the emergence of lincoln wished to keep slaveholders out all they needed to do was refrain from giving the institution legal protection.
in a critique not only of the antislavery movement but of the entire reform impulse deriving from religious revivalism douglas insisted that politicians had no right to impose their own moral standards on society as a whole.
i deny the right of congress he declared to force a good thing upon a people who are unwilling to receive it if a community wished to own slaves it had a right to do so.
of course when douglas spoke of the people he meant whites alone.
he spent much of his time in the debates attempting to portray lincoln as a dangerous radical whose positions threatened to degrade white americans by reducing them to equality with blacks.
the united states government douglas proclaimed had been created by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity for ever lincoln shared many of the racial prejudices of his day.
he opposed giving illinois blacks the right to vote or serve on juries and spoke frequently of colonizing blacks overseas as the best solution to the problems of slavery and race.
yet unlike douglas lincoln did not use appeals to racism to garner votes.
and he refused to exclude blacks from the human family.
no less than whites they were entitled to the inalienable rights of the declaration of independence which applied to all men in all lands everywhere not merely to europeans and their descendants.
the illinois election returns revealed a state sharply divided like the nation itself.
southern illinois settled from the south voted strongly democratic while the rapidly growing northern part of the state was firmly in the republican column.
until the adoption of the seventeenth amendment in the early twentieth century each states legislature chose its u s senators.
in 1858 republican candidates for the legislature won more votes statewide than democrats.
but because the apportionment of seats based on the census of 1850 did not reflect the growth of northern illinois since then the democrats emerged with a narrow margin in the legislature.
douglas was reelected.
his victory was all the more remarkable because elsewhere in the north republicans swept to victory in 1858.
resentment over the administrations kansas policy split the democratic party sometimes producing two democratic candidates pro douglas and pro buchanan running against a single republican.
coupled with the impact of the economic recession that began in 1857 this helped to produce republican victories even in indiana and pennsylvania which democrats had carried two years earlier.
john john brown in an 1847 portrait by augustus washington a black photographer.
brown at harpers ferry an armed assault by the abolitionist john brown on the federal arsenal at harpers ferry virginia further heightened sectional tensions.
brown had a long career of involvement in antislavery activities.
in the 1830s and 1840s he had befriended fugitive slaves and although chronically in debt helped to finance antislavery publications.
like other abolitionists brown was a deeply religious man.
but his god was not the forgiving jesus of the revivals who encouraged men to save themselves through conversion but the vengeful father of the old testament.

an 1835 painting of the federal arsenal at harpers ferry virginia now west virginia.
john browns raid on harpers ferry in october 1859 helped to bring on the civil war.
brown traveled to the territory.
in may 1856 after the attack on lawrence he and a few followers murdered five proslavery settlers at pottawatomie creek.
for the next two years he traveled through the north and canada raising funds and enlisting followers for a war against slavery.
on october 16 1859 with twenty one men seven of them black brown seized harpers ferry.
militarily the plan made little sense.
browns band was soon surrounded and killed or captured by a detachment of federal soldiers headed by colonel robert e lee.
placed on trial for treason to the state of virginia brown conducted himself with dignity and courage winning admiration from millions of northerners who disapproved of his violent deeds.
when virginias governor henry a.
wise spurned pleas for clemency and ordered brown executed he turned brown into a martyr to much of the north.
henry david thoreau pronounced him a crucified hero since browns death radicals of both the left and right have revered brown as a man willing to take action against an institution he considered immoral.
black leaders have long hailed him as a rare white person willing to sacrifice himself for the cause of racial justice.
to the south the failure of browns assault seemed less significant than the adulation he seemed to arouse from much of the northern public.
his raid and execution further widened the breach between the sections.
browns last letter was a brief prophetic statement i john brown am quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood the rise of southern nationalism with the republicans continuing to gain strength in the north democrats might have been expected to put a premium on party unity as the election of 1860 approached.
by this time however a sizable group of southerners c h.
13 a house divided 1840 1861 the emergence of lincoln now viewed their regions prospects as more favorable outside the union than within it.
throughout the 1850s influential writers and political leaders kept up a drumbeat of complaints about the souths problems.
the skyhigh price of slaves made it impossible for many planters sons and upwardly mobile small farmers to become planters in their own right.
many white southerners felt that the opportunity was eroding for economic independence through ownership of land and slaves liberty as they understood it.
the north secessionists charged reaped the benefits of the cotton trade while southerners fell deeper and deeper into debt.
to remain in the union meant to accept bondage to the north.
but an independent south could become the foundation of a slave empire ringing the caribbean and embracing cuba other west indian islands mexico and parts of central america.
more and more southerners were speaking openly of southward expansion.
in 1854 pierre soul of louisiana the american ambassador to spain had persuaded the ministers to britain and france to join him in signing the ostend manifesto which called on the united states to purchase or seize cuba where slavery was still legal from spain.
meanwhile the military adventurer william walker led a series of filibustering expeditions the term derived from the spanish word for pirate filibustero in central america.
born in tennessee walker had headed to california to join the gold rush.
failing to strike it rich he somehow decided to try to become the leader of a latin american country.
in 1853 he led a band of men who captured baja california a peninsula owned by mexico south of california and named himself president of an independent republic.
the arrival of mexican naval vessels forced walker and his men to beat a hasty retreat.
walker next decided to establish himself as ruler of nicaragua in central america and to open that country to slavery.
nicaragua at the time was engaged in a civil war and one faction invited walker to assist it by bringing 300 armed men.
in 1855 walker captured the city of granada and in the following year proclaimed himself president.
the administration of franklin pierce recognized walkers government but neighboring countries sent in troops who forced walker to flee.
his activities represented clear violations of american neutrality laws.
but walker won acclaim in the south and when federal authorities placed him on trial in new orleans in 1858 the jury acquitted him.
by the late 1850s southern leaders were bending every effort to strengthen the bonds of slavery.
slavery is our king declared a south carolina politician in 1860.
slavery is our truth slavery is our divine right new state laws further restricted access to freedom.
one in louisiana stated simply after the passage of this act no slave shall be emancipated in this state some southerners called for the reopening of the african slave trade hoping that an influx of new slaves would lower the price thereby increasing the number of whites with a vested interest in the peculiar institution.
by early 1860 seven states of the deep south had gone on record demanding that the democratic platform pledge to protect slavery in all the territories that had not yet been admitted to the union as states.
virtually no northern politician could accept this position.
for southern leaders to insist on it would guarantee the destruction of the democratic party as a what enabled lincoln to emerge as president from the divisive party politics of the 1850s.
national institution.
but southern nationalists known as fire eaters hoped to split the party and the country and form an independent southern confederacy.
the democratic split when the democratic convention met in april 1860 douglass supporters commanded a majority but not the two thirds required for a presidential nomination.
because of his fight against kansass lecompton constitution and his refusal to support congressional laws imposing slavery on all the territories douglas had become unacceptable to political leaders of the deep south.
they were still determined to bring kansas into the union as a slave state.
when the convention adopted a platform reaffirming the doctrine of popular sovereignty delegates from the seven slave states of the lower south walked out and the gathering recessed in confusion.
six weeks later it reconvened replaced the bolters with douglas supporters and nominated him for president.
in response southern democrats placed their own ticket in the field headed by john c breckinridge of kentucky.
breckinridge insisted that slavery must be protected in the western territories.
the democratic party the last great bond of national unity had been shattered.
national conventions had traditionally been places where party managers mindful of the need for unity in the fall campaign reconciled their differences.
but in 1860 neither northern nor southern democrats were interested in conciliation.
southern democrats no longer trusted their northern counterparts.
douglass backers for their part would not accept a platform that doomed their party to certain defeat in the north.
the nomination of lincoln meanwhile republicans gathered in chicago and chose lincoln as their standard bearer.
although he entered the convention with fewer delegates than william h seward lincoln did not suffer from sewards political liabilities.
former know nothings a majority of whom had by now joined republican ranks bitterly resented sewards efforts as governor of new york to channel state funds to catholic schools.
seward had a not entirely deserved reputation for radicalism as a result of his higher law and irrepressible conflict speeches discussed earlier.
lincolns devotion to the union appealed to moderate republicans and his emphasis on the moral dimension of the sectional controversy made him acceptable to republicans from abolitionist backgrounds.
having never associated with the know nothings he could appeal to immigrant voters and nativists preferred him to the hated seward.
most important coming from illinois lincoln was better positioned to carry the pivotal doubtful states essential for republican victory.
on the third ballot he was nominated.
the party platform denied the validity of the dred scott decision reaffirmed republicans opposition to slaverys expansion and added economic planks designed to appeal to a broad array of northern voters free homesteads in the west a protective tariff and government aid in building a transcontinental railroad.
13 a house divided 1840 1861 the impending crisis the the presidential election of 1860 election of in effect two presidential campaigns took place in 1860.
in the north lincoln and douglas were the combatants.
in the south the republicans had no presence and three can55 8 didates contested the election douglas breckinridge and john bell of tennessee the candidate of the hastily organ5 ized constitutional union party.
a haven for unionist for4 mer whigs this new party adopted a platform consisting of a single pledge to preserve the constitution as it is that is with slavery and the union as it was without sec8 tional discord 7 9 the most striking thing about the election returns was their sectional character.
lincoln carried all of the north non voting territory except new jersey receiving 1 8 million popular votes 54 percent of the regional total and 40 percent of the electoral vote popular vote national and 180 electoral votes a clear majority.
party candidate share share breckinridge captured most of the slave states although 180 59 1 866 452 40 republican lincoln 72 24 847 953 18 southern democrat breckinridge bell carried three upper south states and about 40 per39 13 590 831 13 constitutional union bell cent of the southern vote as a whole.
douglas placed first 12 4 1 371 157 29 northern democrat douglas only in missouri but his 1 3 million popular votes were states that republicans lost in 1856 won in 1860 second in number only to lincolns.
douglas was the only candidate with significant support in all parts of the country a vindication in a sense of his long effort to transcend sectional divisions.
but his failure to carry either section suggested that a traditional political career based on devotion to the union was no longer possible.
without a single vote in ten southern states lincoln was elected the nations sixteenth president.
he failed to secure a majority of the national popular vote.
but because of the norths superiority in population lincoln would still have carried the electoral college and thus been elected president even if the votes of his three opponents had all been cast for a single candidate.
the impending crisis the secession movement in the eyes of many white southerners lincolns victory placed their future at the mercy of a party avowedly hostile to their regions values and interests.
those advocating secession did not believe lincolns administration would take immediate steps against slavery in the states.
but if as seemed quite possible the election of 1860 marked a fundamental shift in power the beginning of a long period of republican rule who could say what the norths antislavery sentiment would demand in five years or ten.
slaveowners moreover feared republican efforts to extend their party into the south by appealing to non slaveholders.
rather than accept permanent minority status in a nation governed by their opponents deep south political leaders boldly struck for their regions independence.
at stake they believed was not a single election but an entire way of life.
what were the final steps on the road to secession.
an 1860 engraving of a mass meeting in savannah georgia shortly after lincolns election as president which called for the state to secede from the union.
the banner on the obelisk at the center reads our motto states rights equality of the states dont tread on me the last a slogan from the american revolution.
in the months that followed lincolns election seven states stretching from south carolina to texas seceded from the union.
these were the states of the cotton kingdom where slaves represented a larger part of the total population than in the upper south.
first to secede was south carolina the state with the highest percentage of slaves in its population and a long history of political radicalism.
on december 20 1860 the legislature unanimously voted to leave the union.
its declaration of the immediate causes of secession placed the issue of slavery squarely at the center of the crisis.
the north had assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions lincoln was a man whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery experience had proved that slaveholding states cannot be safe in subjection to nonslaveholding states secessionists equated their movement with the struggle for american independence.
proslavery ideologue george fitzhugh however later claimed that southern secession was even more significant than the commonplace affair of 1776 since the south rebelled not merely against a particular government but against the erroneous modern idea of freedom based on human equality and natural liberty the secession crisis as the union unraveled president buchanan seemed paralyzed.
he denied that a state could secede but he also insisted that the federal government had no right to use force against it.
other political leaders struggled to find a formula to resolve the crisis.
senator john j crittenden of kentucky a slave state on the border between north and south offered the most widely supported compromise plan of the secession winter.
embodied in a series of unamendable constitutional amendments crittendens proposal would c h.
13 a house divided 1840 1861 a richmond virginia cartoonist in april 1861 depicts lincoln as a cat seeking to catch the southern states as mice fleeing the union which lies dead on the left.
the impending crisis have guaranteed the future of slavery in the states where it existed and extended the missouri compromise line to the pacific ocean dividing between slavery and free soil all territories now held or hereafter acquired the seceding states rejected the compromise as too little too late.
but many in the upper south and north saw it as a way to settle sectional differences and prevent civil war.
crittendens plan however foundered on the opposition of abraham lincoln.
willing to conciliate the south on issues like the return of fugitive slaves lincoln took an unyielding stand against the expansion of slavery.
here he informed one republican leader he intended to hold firm as with a chain of steel a fundamental principle of democracy lincoln believed was at stake.
we have just carried an election he wrote on principles fairly stated to the people.
now we are told in advance that the government shall be broken up unless we surrender to those we have beaten before we take the offices.
if we surrender it is the end of us and the end of the government lincoln moreover feared that crittendens reference to land hereafter acquired offered the south a thinly veiled invitation to demand the acquisition of cuba mexico and other territory suited to slavery.
before lincoln assumed office on march 4 1861 the seven seceding states formed the confederate states of america adopted a constitution and chose as their president jefferson davis of mississippi.
with a few alterations the president served a single six year term cabinet members as in britain could sit in congress the confederate constitution was modeled closely on that of the united states.
it departed from the federal constitution however in explicitly guaranteeing slave property both in the states and in any territories the new nation acquired.
the cornerstone of the confederacy announced daviss vice president alexander h stephens of georgia was the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition what were the final steps on the road to secession.
and the war came even after rejecting the crittenden compromise lincoln did not believe war inevitable.
when he became president eight slave states of the upper south remained in the union.
here slaves and slaveholders made up a considerably lower proportion of the population than in the deep south and large parts of the white population did not believe lincolns election justified dissolving the union.
even within the confederacy whites had divided over secession with considerable numbers of non slaveholding farmers in opposition.
in time lincoln believed secession might collapse from within.
in his inaugural address delivered on march 4 1861 lincoln tried to be conciliatory.
he rejected the right of secession but denied any intention of interfering with slavery in the states.
he said nothing of retaking the forts arsenals and customs houses the confederacy had seized although he did promise to hold remaining federal property in the seceding states.
but lincoln also issued a veiled warning in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war in his first month as president lincoln walked a tightrope.
he avoided any action that might drive more states from the union encouraged southern unionists to assert themselves within the confederacy and sought to quiet a growing clamor in the north for forceful action against secession.
knowing that the risk of war existed lincoln strove to ensure that if hostilities did break out the south not the union would fire the first shot.
and that is precisely what happened on april 12 1861 at fort sumter an enclave of union control in the harbor of charleston south carolina.
a few days earlier lincoln had notified south carolinas governor that he intended to replenish the garrisons dwindling food supplies.

on april 14 its commander surrendered.
the following day lincoln proclaimed that an insurrection existed in the south and called for 75 000 troops to suppress it.
civil war had begun.
within weeks virginia north carolina tennessee and arkansas joined the confederacy.
both sides deprecated war lincoln later said but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.
and the war came in 1842 henry wadsworth longfellow published poems on slavery a collection that included a work entitled simply the warning in it longfellow compared the american slave to the mighty biblical figure of samson who after being blinded and chained managed to destroy the temple of his tormentors there is a poor blind samson in this land shorn of his strength and bound in bonds of steel who may in some grim revel raise his hand and shake the pillars of this commonweal till the vast temple of our liberties a shapeless mass of wreck and rubbish lies.

t h e f i r s t m o d e r n wa r the american civil war is often called the first modern war.
never before had mass armies confronted each other on the battlefield with the deadly weapons created by the industrial revolution.
the resulting casualties dwarfed anything in the american experience.
beginning as a battle of army versus army the war became a conflict of society against society in which the distinction between military and civilian targets often disappeared.
in a war of this kind the effectiveness of political leadership the ability to mobilize economic resources and a societys willingness to keep up the fight despite setbacks are as crucial to the outcome as success or failure on individual battlefields.

development.
it enacted high tariffs that protected american industry from foreign competition granted land to railroad companies to encourage construction and used the army to remove indians from western lands desired by farmers and mining companies.
the industrial economy the rapid expansion of factory production mining and railroad construction in all parts of the country except the south signaled the transition from lincolns america a world centered on the small farm and artisan workshop to a mature industrial society.
americans of the late nineteenth century marveled at the triumph of the new economy.
one can hardly believe wrote the philosopher john dewey there has been a revolution in history so rapid so extensive so complete by 1913 the united states produced one third of the worlds industrial output more than the total of great britain france and germany combined.
small scale craft production still flourished in many trades and armies of urban workers male and female toiled in their own homes or in the households of others as outworkers and domestics.
but half of all industrial workers now labored in plants with more than 250 employees.
on the eve of the civil war the first industrial revolution centered on the textile industry had transformed new england into a center of manufacturing.
but otherwise the united states was still primarily an agricultural nation.
by 1880 for the first time the census bureau found a majority of the workforce engaged in non farming jobs.
the traditional dream of economic independence seemed obsolete.
by 1890 two thirds of americans worked for wages rather than owning a farm business or craft shop.
drawn to factories by the promise of employment a new working class emerged in these years.
between 1870 and 1920 almost 11 million americans moved from farm to city and another 25 million immigrants arrived from overseas.

new york with its new skyscrapers and hundreds of thousands of workers in all sorts of manufacturing establishments symbolized dynamic urban growth.

the city financed industrialization and westward expansion its banks and stock exchange funneling capital to railroads mines and factories.
but the heartland of the second industrial revolution was the region around the great lakes with its factories producing iron and steel machinery chemicals and packaged foods.
pittsburgh had become the worlds center of iron and steel manufacturing.
chicago by 1900 the nations second largest city with 1 7 million inhabitants was home to factories producing steel and farm machinery and giant stockyards where cattle were processed into meat products for shipment east in refrigerated rail cars.
smaller industrial cities also proliferated often concentrating on a single industry cast iron stoves in troy new york silk in paterson new jersey furniture in grand rapids michigan.
railroads and the national market the railroad made possible what is sometimes called the second industrial revolution spurred by private investment and massive grants of land and money by federal state and local governments the number of miles of railroad track in the united states tripled between 1860 and 1880 and tripled again by 1920 opening vast new areas to commercial farming and creating a truly national market for manufactured goods.
in 1886 the railroads adopted a standard national gauge the distance separating the two tracks making it possible for the first time for trains of one company to travel on any other companys track.

the railroads reorganized time itself.
in 1883 the major companies divided the nation into the four time zones still in use today.
indeed the centrality of railroads to the national market meant that when railroads experienced financial crises the entire economy suffered.
the growing population formed an ever expanding market for the mass production mass distribution and mass marketing of goods essential elements of a modern industrial economy.
the spread of national brands like ivory soap and quaker oats symbolized the continuing integration of the economy.

scientific breakthroughs poured forth from research laboratories in menlo park and orange new jersey created by the eras greatest inventor thomas a edison.
born in ohio in 1847 edison had little formal education but as a teenager he read popular books on science and began doing chemistry experiments.
during the course of his life edison helped to establish entirely new industries that transformed private life public entertainment and economic activity including the phonograph lightbulb motion picture and a system for generating and distributing electric power.
he opened the first electric generating station in manhattan in 1882 to provide power to streetcars factories and private homes and he established among other companies the forerunner of general electric to market electrical equipment.
the spread of electricity was essential to industrial and urban growth providing a more reliable and flexible source of power than water or steam.
however it was not edison but another inventor nikola tesla an ethnic serb born in modern day croatia who emigrated to the united states at the age of twenty eight who developed an electric motor using the system of alternating current that overcame many of the challenges of using electricity for commercial and industrial purposes.

competition and consolidation economic growth was dramatic but highly volatile.
the combination of a market flooded with goods and the federal monetary policies discussed later that removed money from the national economy led to a relentless fall in prices.
the world economy suffered prolonged downturns in the 1870s and 1890s.
indeed before the 1930s the years from 1873 to 1897 were known throughout the world as the great depression.
businesses engaged in ruthless competition.
railroads and other companies tried various means of bringing order to the chaotic marketplace.
they formed pools that divided up markets between supposedly competing firms and fixed prices.
they established trusts legal devices whereby the affairs of several rival companies were managed by a single director.
such efforts to coordinate the economic activities of independent companies generally proved short lived disintegrating as individual firms continued their intense pursuit of profits.
to avoid cutthroat competition more and more corporations battled to control entire industries.
many companies fell by the wayside or were gobbled up by others.
the process of economic concentration culminated between 1897 and 1904 when some 4 000 firms vanished into larger corporations that served national markets and exercised an unprecedented degree of control over the marketplace.
by the time the wave of mergers had been completed giant corporations like u s steel created by financier j p morgan in 1901 by combining eight large steel companies into the first billion dollar economic enterprise standard oil and international harvester a manufacturer of agricultural machinery dominated major parts of the economy.
the rise of andrew carnegie in an era without personal or corporate income taxes some business leaders accumulated enormous fortunes and economic power.
under the aggressive leadership of thomas a scott the pennsylvania railroad for a time the nations largest corporation forged an economic empire that stretched w h a t f a c t o r s c o m b i n e d t o m a k e t h e u n i t e d s t a t e s a m a t u r e i n d u s t r i a l s o c i e t y a f t e r t h e c i v i l wa r.
across the continent and included coal mines and oceangoing steamships.
with an army of professional managers to oversee its far flung activities the railroad pioneered modern techniques of business organization.
another industrial giant was andrew carnegie who emigrated with his family from his native scotland at the age of thirteen and as a teenager worked in a pennsylvania textile factory.
during the 1850s scott hired carnegie as his private telegraph operator and by the eve of the civil war had promoted him to one of the pennsylvania railroads major management positions.
during the depression that began in 1873 carnegie set out to establish a vertically integrated steel company that is one that controlled every phase of the business from raw materials to transportation manufacturing and distribution.
by the 1890s he dominated the steel industry and had accumulated a fortune worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
carnegies complex of steel factories at homestead pennsylvania were the most technologically advanced in the world.
carnegies father an immigrant scottish weaver who had taken part in popular efforts to open the british political system to working class participation had instilled in his son a commitment to democracy and social equality.
from his mother carnegie learned that life was a ceaseless struggle in which one must strive to get ahead or sink beneath the waves.
his life reflected the tension between these elements of his upbringing.
believing that the rich had a moral obligation to promote the advancement of society carnegie denounced the worship of money and distributed much of his wealth to various philanthropies especially the creation of public libraries in towns throughout the country.
but he ran his companies with a dictatorial hand.
his factories operated nonstop with two twelve hour shifts every day of the year except the fourth of july.
the triumph of john d.
rockefeller if any single name became a byword for enormous wealth it was john d rockefeller who began his working career as a clerk for a cleveland merchant and rose to dominate the oil industry.
he drove out rival firms through cutthroat competition arranging secret deals with railroad companies and fixing prices and production quotas.
rockefeller began with horizontal expan the electricity building at the chicago worlds fair of 1893 painted by childe hassam.

by the 1880s his standard oil company controlled 90 percent of the nations oil industry.
like carnegie rockefeller gave much of his fortune away establishing foundations to promote education and medical research.
and like carnegie he bitterly fought his employees efforts to organize unions.

these and other industrial leaders inspired among ordinary americans a combination of awe admiration and hostility.
depending on ones point of view they were captains of industry whose energy and vision pushed the economy forward or robber barons who wielded power without any accountability in an unregulated marketplace.
most rose from modest backgrounds and seemed examples of how inventive genius and business sense enabled americans to seize opportunities for success.
but their dictatorial attitudes unscrupulous methods repressive labor policies and exercise of power without any democratic control led to fears that they were undermining political and economic freedom.
concentrated wealth degraded the political process declared henry demarest lloyd in wealth against commonwealth 1894 an expos of how rockefellers standard oil company made a mockery of economic competition and political democracy by manipulating the market and bribing legislators.
liberty and monopoly lloyd concluded cannot live together workers freedom in an industrial age striking as it was the countrys economic growth distributed its benefits very unevenly.
for a minority of workers the rapidly expanding industrial system created new forms of freedom.
in some industries skilled workers commanded high wages and exercised considerable control over the production process.
a workers economic independence now rested on technical skill rather than ownership of ones own shop and tools as in earlier times.
what was known as the miners freedom consisted of elaborate work rules that left skilled underground workers free of managerial supervision on the job.
through their union skilled iron and steelworkers fixed output quotas and controlled the training of apprentices in the technique of iron rolling.
these workers often knew more about the details of production than their employers did.
such freedom however applied only to a tiny portion of the industrial labor force and had little bearing on the lives of the growing army of semiskilled workers who tended machines in the new factories.
for most workers economic insecurity remained a basic fact of life.
during the depressions of the 1870s and 1890s millions of workers lost their jobs or were forced to accept reductions of pay.
the tramp became a familiar figure on the social landscape as thousands of men took to the roads in search of work.
many industrial workers labored sixty hour weeks with no pensions compensation for injuries or protections against unemployment.
although american workers received higher wages than their counterparts in europe they also experienced more dangerous working conditions.
between 1880 and 1900 an average of 35 000 workers perished each year in factory and mine accidents the highest rate in the industrial world.

much of the working class remained desperately poor and to survive needed income from all family members.
in 1888 the chicago times published a series of articles by reporter nell cusack under the title city slave girls exposing wretched conditions among the growing number of women working for wages in the citys homes factories and sweatshops.
the articles unleashed a flood of letters to the editor from women workers.

the second industrial revolution and and shadow increasing poverty at the other end of the economic spectrum the era witnessed an unprecedented accumulation of wealth.
class divisions became more and more visible.
in frontier days all classes in san francisco for example lived near the waterfront.
in the late nineteenth century upper class families built mansions on nob hill and van ness avenue known as millionaires row.
in eastern cities as well the rich increasingly resided in their own exclusive neighborhoods and vacationed among members of their own class at exclusive resorts like newport rhode island.
the growing urban middle class of professionals office workers and small businessmen moved to new urban and suburban neighborhoods linked to central business districts by streetcars and commuter railways.

sciously pursued an aristocratic lifestyle building palatial homes attending exclusive social clubs schools and colleges holding fancy dress balls and marrying into each others families.
in 1899 the economist and social historian thorstein veblen published the theory of the leisure class a devastating critique of an upper class culture focused on conspicuous consumption that is spending money not on needed or even desired goods but simply to demonstrate the possession of wealth.
one of the eras most widely publicized spectacles was an elaborate costume ball organized in 1897 by mrs bradley martin the daughter of a new york railroad financier.
the theme was the royal court of prerevolutionary france.
the waldorf astoria hotel was decorated to look like the palace of versailles the guests wore the dress of the french nobility and the hostess bedecked herself with the actual jewels of queen marie antoinette.
not that far from the waldorf much of the working class lived in desperate conditions.
matthew smiths 1868 best seller sunshine and shadow in new york opened with an engraving that contrasted department store magnate alexander t stewarts two million dollar mansion with housing in the citys slums.
two decades later jacob riis in how the other half lives 1890 offered a shocking account of living conditions among the urban poor complete with photographs of apartments in dark airless overcrowded tenement houses.
t h e t r a n s f o r m at i o n o f t h e w e s t nowhere did capitalism penetrate more rapidly or dramatically than in the trans mississippi west whose vast trackless spaces as the poet walt whitman called them were now absorbed into the expanding economy.
at the close of the civil war the frontier of settlement did not extend far beyond the mississippi river.
to the west lay millions of acres of fertile and mineral rich land roamed by giant herds of buffalo whose meat and hides provided food clothing and shelter for a population of more than 250 000 indians.
in 1893 the historian frederick jackson turner gave a celebrated lecture the significance of the frontier in american history in which he argued that on the western frontier the distinctive qualities of american culture were forged individual freedom political democracy and economic mobility.
the west he added acted as a safety valve drawing off those dissatisfied with their situation in the east and therefore counteracting the threat of social unrest.
turners was one of the most influential interpretations of american history ever developed.
but his lecture summarized attitudes toward the west that had been widely shared among americans long before 1893.
ever since the beginning of colonial settlement in british north america the west a region whose definition shifted as the popula baxter street court 1890 one of numerous photographs by jacob riis depicting living conditions in new york citys slums.

the hiltons insisted on being photographed with their organ away from the modest sod house in which they lived to better represent their aspiration for prosperity.
the transformation of the west tion expanded had been seen as a place of opportunity for those seeking to improve their condition in life.
many americans did indeed experience the westward movement in the way turner described it.
from farmers moving into ohio indiana and illinois in the decades after the american revolution to prospectors who struck it rich in the california gold rush of the mid nineteenth century millions of americans and immigrants from abroad found in the westward movement a path to economic opportunity.
but turner offered only a partial account of western history.
most settlers moved west in family groups or as members of immigrant communities not as lone pioneers.
turner seemed to portray the west as an empty space before the coming of white settlers.
in fact of course it was already inhabited by native americans whose dispossession was essential to the opening of land for settlement by others.
moreover the west was hardly a uniform paradise of small independent farmers.
beginning in the eighteenth century for example california was the site of forced indian labor on missions established by members of religious orders a system that helped establish the pattern of large agricultural land holdings in that region.
landlords railroads and mining companies in the west also utilized mexican migrant and indentured labor chinese working on long term contracts and until the the end of the civil war african american slaves.
a diverse region the west of course was hardly a single area.
west of the mississippi river lay a variety of regions all marked by remarkable physical beauty the vast trackless great plains the rocky mountains the desert of the southwest the sierra nevada and the valleys and coastline of california and the pacific northwest.
it would take many decades before individual settlers and corporate business enterprises penetrated all these areas.
but the process was far advanced by the end of the nineteenth century.
the political and economic incorporation of the american west was part of a global process.
in many parts of the world indigenous inhabitants the mapuche in chile the zulu in south africa aboriginal peoples in australia american indians were pushed aside often after fierce resistance as centralizing governments brought large interior regions under their control.
in the united states the incorporation of the west required the active intervention of the federal government which acquired indian land by war and treaty administered land sales regulated territorial politics and distributed land and money to farmers railroads and mining companies.
in the twentieth century the construction of federally financed irrigation systems and dams would open large areas to commercial farming.
ironically the west would become known not least to its own inhabitants as a place of rugged individualism and sturdy independence.
but h o w w a s t h e we s t t r a n s f o r m e d e c o n o m i c a l l y a n d s o c i a l l y i n t h i s p e r i o d.
without active governmental assistance the region could never have been settled and developed.
fa r m i n g on the middle border even as sporadic indian wars raged settlers poured into the west.
territorial and state governments eager for population and railroad companies anxious to sell land they had acquired from the government flooded european countries and eastern cities with promotional literature promising easy access to land.
more land came into cultivation in the thirty years after the civil war than in the previous two and a half centuries of american history.
hundreds of thousands of families acquired farms under the homestead act and even more purchased land from speculators and from railroad companies that had been granted immense tracts of public land by the federal government.
a new agricultural empire producing wheat and corn for national and international markets arose on the middle border minnesota the dakotas nebraska and kansas whose population rose from 300 000 in 1860 to 5 million in 1900.
the farmers were a diverse group including native born easterners blacks escaping the postreconstruction south and immigrants from canada germany scandinavia and great britain.
although ethnic diversity is generally associated with eastern cities in the late nineteenth century the most multicultural state in the union was north dakota.
despite the promises of promotional pamphlets farming on the great plains was not an easy task.
difficulties came in many forms from the poisonous rattlesnakes that lived in the tall prairie grass to the blizzards and droughts that periodically afflicted the region.
much of the burden fell on women.
farm families generally invested in the kinds of labor saving machinery that would bring in cash not machines that would ease womens burdens in the household like the back breaking task of doing laundry.
while husbands and sons tended to devote their labor to cash an engraving from the early 1880s of a california farm adjacent to the southern pacific railroad.
having been granted vast tracts of land by the federal government the railroad encouraged settlement along its lines.

glenns farm in colusa county an engraving from 1876 illustrates the large scale of operations and heavy investment in machinery common on western bonanza farms.
fa r m s john wesley powell the explorer and geologist who surveyed the middle border in the 1870s warned that because of the regions arid land and limited rainfall development there required large scale irrigation projects.
the model of family farming envisioned by the homestead act of 1862 could not apply no single family could do all the work required on irrigated farms only cooperative communal farming could succeed powell maintained.
despite the emergence of a few bonanza farms that covered thousands of acres and employed large numbers of agricultural wage workers family farms still dominated the trans mississippi west.
even small farmers however became increasingly oriented to national and international markets specializing in the production of single crops for sale in faraway places.
at the same time railroads brought factory made goods to rural people replacing items previously produced in farmers homes.
farm families became more and more dependent on loans to purchase land machinery and industrial products and more and more vulnerable to the ups and downs of prices for agricultural goods in the world market.
agriculture reflected how the international economy was becoming more integrated.
the combination of economic depressions and expanding agricultural pro h o w w a s t h e we s t t r a n s f o r m e d e c o n o m i c a l l y a n d s o c i a l l y i n t h i s p e r i o d.
duction in places like argentina australia and the american west pushed prices of farm products steadily downward.
from italy and ireland to china india and the american south small farmers throughout the world suffered severe difficulties in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
many joined the migration to cities within their countries or the increasing international migration of labor.
large scale a g r i c u lt u r e in california the future of western farming ultimately lay with giant agricultural enterprises relying heavily on irrigation chemicals and machinery investments far beyond the means of family farmers.
a preview of the agricultural future was already evident in california where as far back as spanish and mexican days landownership had been concentrated in large units.
in the late nineteenth century californias giant fruit and vegetable farms owned by corporations like the southern pacific railroad were tilled not by agricultural laborers who could expect to acquire land of their own but by migrant laborers from china the philippines japan and mexico who tramped from place to place following the ripening crops.
california is not a country of farms but.
of plantations and estates wrote the young journalist henry george in 1871 urging the government to take action against land monopoly and to give all men an equal chance to achieve economic independence.
the cowboy and the corporate west the two decades following the civil war also witnessed the golden age of the cattle kingdom.
the kansas pacific railroads stations at abilene dodge city and wichita kansas became destinations for the fabled drives of millions of cattle from texas.
a collection of white mexican and black men who conducted the cattle drives the cowboys became symbols of a life of freedom on the open range.
their exploits would later serve as the theme of many a hollywood movie and their clothing inspired fashions that remain popular today.
but there was nothing romantic about the life of the cowboys most of whom were low paid wage workers.
texas cowboys even went on strike for higher pay in 1883.
the days of the long distance cattle drive ended in the mid 1880s as farmers enclosed more and more of the open range with barbed wire fences making it difficult to graze cattle on the grasslands of the great plains and two terrible winters destroyed millions of cattle.
when the industry recuperated it was reorganized in large enclosed ranches close to rail connections.
the west was more than a farming empire.
by 1890 a higher percentage of its population lived in cities than was the case in other regions.
the economic focus of californias economy remained san francisco a major manufacturing and trading center.
the explosive growth of southern california began in the 1880s first with tourism heavily promoted by railroad companies followed by the discovery of oil in los angeles in 1892.
large corporate enterprises appeared throughout the west.
the lumber industry dominated by small scale producers in 1860 came under the control of corporations that acquired large tracts of forest and employed armies of loggers.
western mining from michigan iron ore and copper to gold and silver in california in the late 1800s california tried to attract immigrants by advertising its pleasant climate and the availability of land although large scale corporate farms were coming to dominate the states agriculture.
16 americas gilded age 1870 1890 the transformation of the west nevada and colorado fell under the sway of companies that mobilized eastern and european investment to introduce advanced technology.
gold and silver rushes took place in the dakotas in 1876 idaho in 1883 and alaska at the end of the century.
but as in california after 1848 the independent prospector working a surface mine with his pick and shovel quickly gave way to deep shaft corporate mining employing wage workers.
a similar process occurred in new mexico where traditional life based on sheep farming on land owned in common by mexican villagers had continued more or less unchanged after the united states acquired the area in the mexican war.
railroads reached the area in the 1870s bringing with them eastern mining companies and commercial ranchers and farmers.
because courts only recognized mexican era land titles to individual plots of land communal landholdings were increasingly made available for sale to newcomers.
by 1880 three quarters of new mexicos sheep belonged to just twenty families.
unable to continue as sheep raisers more and more hispanic residents went to work for the new mines and railroads.
the albert bierstadts 1863 painting the rocky mountains landers peak depicts indians as an integral part of the majestic landscape of the west.
subjugation of the plains indians the incorporation of the west into the national economy spelled the doom of the plains indians and their world.
their lives had already undergone profound transformations.
in the eighteenth century the spread of horses originally introduced by the spanish led to a wholesale shift from farming and hunting on foot to mounted hunting of buffalo.
new indian groups migrated to the great plains to take advantage of the horse coalescing into the great tribes of the nineteenth century the cheyenne comanche crow kiowa and sioux.
persistent warfare took place between the more established tribes and newcomers including indians removed from the east who sought access to their hunting grounds.

encountered little hostility from indians often trading with them for food and supplies.
but as settlers encroached on indian lands bloody conflict between the army and plains tribes began in the 1850s and continued for decades.
in 1869 president ulysses s grant announced a new peace policy in the west but warfare soon resumed.
drawing on methods used to defeat the confederacy civil war generals like philip h sheridan set out to destroy the foundations of the indian economy villages horses and especially the buffalo.
hunting by mounted indians had already reduced the buffalo population estimated at 30 million in 1800 but it was army campaigns and the depredations of hunters seeking buffalo hides that rendered the vast herds all but extinct.
by 1886 an expedition from the smithsonian institution in washington had difficulty finding twenty five good specimens a cold wind blew across the prairie when the last buffalo fell said the sioux leader sitting bull a death wind for my people let me be a free man the armys relentless attacks broke the power of one tribe after another.
in 1877 troops commanded by former freedmens bureau commissioner o o howard pursued the nez perc indians on a 1 700 mile chase across the far west.
the nez perc whose name was given them by lewis and clark in 1805 and means pierced noses in french were seeking to escape to canada after fights with settlers who had encroached on tribal lands in oregon and idaho.
after four months howard forced the indians to surrender and they were removed to oklahoma.

f r o m i r a s t e wa r d a s e c o n d d e c l a r a t i o n of independence 1879 at a fourth of july celebration in chicago in 1879 ira steward the most prominent labor leader associated with the movement for the eight hour day invoked the legacy of the declaration of independence and the abolition of slavery during the civil war to discuss labors grievances.
each other with vastly more occupations or days work than the lowest paid workers can give to one another.
and if the workers power to buy increases with his power to do granaries and warehouses will empty their pockets and farms and factories fill up with producers.
and we call to the workers of the whole civilized world especially those of france germany and great britain to join hands with the laborers of the united states in this mighty movement.
resolved that the practical question for an american fourth of july is not between freedom and slavery but between wealth and poverty.
for if it is true that laborers ought to have as little as possible of the wealth they produce south carolina slaveholders were right and the massachusetts abolitionists were wrong.
because when the working classes are denied everything but the barest necessities of life they have no decent use for liberty.
slavery is.
the child of poverty instead of poverty the child of slavery and freedom is the child of wealth instead of wealth the child of freedom.
the only road therefore to universal freedom is the road that leads to universal wealth.
resolved that while the fourth of july was heralded a hundred years ago in the name of liberty we now herald this day in behalf of the great economic measure of eight hours or shorter days work for wageworkers everywhere.
because more leisure rest and thought will cultivate habits customs and expenditures that mean higher wages and the worlds highest paid laborers now furnish on the.
issue of eight hours therefore or less hours we join hands with all regardless of politics nationality color religion or sex knowing no friends or foes except as they aid or oppose this longpostponed and world wide movement.
and for the soundness of our political economy as well as the rectitude of our intentions we confidently and gladly appeal to the wiser statesmanship of the civilized world.

they would not surrender until the mid 1880s.
another casualty was the comanche empire centered in modernday new mexico and colorado.
beginning in the mid eighteenth century the comanche dominated much of the great plains and southwest.
the comanche had subordinated local indian groups to their power imposed a toll on trade routes like the santa fe trail and dealt for a time as an equal with the spanish french and american governments.
their power was not finally broken until the 1870s.

the indian idea of freedom however which centered on preserving their cultural and political autonomy and control of ancestral lands conflicted with the interests and values of most white americans.
nearly all officials believed that the federal government should persuade or force the plains indians to surrender most of their land and to exchange their religion com by 1890 the vast majority of the remaining indian population had been removed to reservations scattered across the western states.

in 1871 congress eliminated the treaty system that dated back to the revolutionary era by which the federal government negotiated agreements with indians as if they were independent nations.
this step was supported by railroad companies that found tribal sovereignty an obstacle to construction and by republicans who believed that it contradicted the national unity born of the civil war.
the federal government pressed forward with its assault on indian culture.
the bureau of indian affairs established boarding schools where indian children removed from the negative influences of their parents and tribes were dressed in nonindian clothes given new names and educated in white ways.
the dawes act the crucial step in attacking tribalism came in 1887 with the passage of the dawes act named for senator henry l dawes of massachusetts chair of the senates indian affairs committee.
the act broke up the land of nearly all tribes into small parcels to be distributed to indian families with the remainder auctioned off to white purchasers.
indians who accepted the farms and adopted the habits of civilized life would become full fledged american citizens.
the policy proved to be a disaster leading to the loss of much tribal land and the erosion of indian cultural traditions.
whites however benefited enormously.
on the nez perc reservation for example 172 000 acres were divided into farms for indians but white ranchers and land speculators purchased 500 000 acres.
when the government made 2 million acres of indian land available in oklahoma 50 000 white settlers poured into the territory to claim farms on the single day of h o w w a s t h e we s t t r a n s f o r m e d e c o n o m i c a l l y a n d s o c i a l l y i n t h i s p e r i o d.

further land rushes followed in the 1890s.
in the half century after the passage of the dawes act indians lost 86 million of the 138 million acres of land in their possession in 1887.
indian citizenship many laws and treaties in the nineteenth century offered indians the right to become an american citizen if they left the tribal setting and assimilated into american society.
but tribal identity was the one thing nearly every indian wished to maintain and very few took advantage of these offers.
thus few indians were recognized as american citizens.
western courts ruled that the citizenship rights guaranteed by the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments did not apply to them and in elk v wilkins 1884 the u s supreme court agreed even though john elk had left his tribe in oklahoma and lived among white settlers in nebraska.
the court questioned whether any indian had achieved the degree of civilization required of american citizens.
by 1900 roughly 53 000 indians had become american citizens by accepting land allotments under the dawes act.
the following year congress granted citizenship to 100 000 residents of indian territory in present day oklahoma.
the remainder would have to wait until 1919 for those who fought in world war i and 1924 when congress made all indians american citizens.
the ghost dance and wounded knee some indians sought solace in the ghost dance a religious revitalization campaign reminiscent of the pan indian movements led by earlier prophets like neolin and tenskwatawa discussed in chapters 4 and 8.
its leaders foretold a day when whites disappear the buffalo would return and indians could once again practice their ancestral customs free from misery death and disease large numbers of indians gathered for days of singing dancing and religious observances.
fearing a general uprising the government sent troops to the reservations.
on december 29 1890 soldiers opened fire on ghost dancers encamped near wounded knee creek in south dakota killing between 150 and 200 indians mostly women and children.
the wounded knee massacre marked the end of four centuries of armed conflict between the continents native population and european settlers and their descendants.
by 1900 the indian population had fallen to 250 000 the lowest point in american history.
a childrens book about indians published around this time stated flatly the indian pictured in these pages no longer exists yet despite everything indians survived and in the twentieth century their numbers once again would begin to grow.
settler societies and global wests the conquest of the american west was part of a global process whereby settlers moved boldly into the interior of regions in temperate climates around a 1911 poster advertising the federal governments sale of land formerly possessed by indians.
under the dawes act of 1887 indian families were allotted individual farms and the remaining land on reservations so called surplus land was made available to whites.
16 americas gilded age 1870 1890 politics in a gilded age the world bringing their familiar crops and livestock and establishing mining and other industries.
countries such as argentina australia canada and new zealand as well as the united states are often called settler societies because immigrants from overseas quickly outnumbered and displaced the original inhabitants unlike in india and most parts of colonial africa where fewer europeans ventured and those who did relied on the labor of the indigenous inhabitants.
south africa combined the characteristics of these two forms of western expansion.
the descendants of european immigrants grew to a substantial population and fully controlled politics and the economy but they still remained far fewer in number than the native africans who did most of the work in the regions mines and rural areas.
in the late nineteenth century even as the population of the american west grew dramatically the argentine military occupied the pampas opening a vast area for cattle raising and wheat cultivation.
in 1885 canada marked the completion of its first transcontinental railroad although the more severe climate limited the number of western settlers to a much smaller population than in the american west and as a result the displacement of indians did not produce as much conflict and bloodshed.
in many settler societies native peoples were subjected to cultural reconstruction similar to policies in the united states.
in australia the government gathered the aboriginal populations their numbers devastated by disease in reserves reminiscent of american indian reservations.
australia went further than the united states in the forced assimilation of surviving aboriginal peoples.
the government removed large numbers of children from their families to be adopted by whites a policy only abandoned in the 1970s and for which the prime minister formally apologized in 2008 in a national moment of reconciliation called sorry day.
politics in a gilded age the era from 1870 to 1890 is the only period of american history commonly known by a derogatory name the gilded age after the title of an 1873 novel by mark twain and charles dudley warner.
gilded means covered with a layer of gold but it also suggests that the glittering surface covers a core of little real value and is therefore deceptive.
twain and warner were referring not only to the remarkable expansion of the economy in this period but also to the corruption caused by corporate dominance of politics and to the oppressive treatment of those left behind in the scramble for wealth.
get rich dishonestly if we can honestly if we must was the eras slogan according to the gilded age.
the corruption of politics as they had earlier in the nineteenth century americans during the gilded age saw their nation as an island of political democracy in a world still dominated by undemocratic governments.
in europe only france and switzerland enjoyed universal male suffrage.
even in britain which prided itself on its tradition of political liberty most of the working class could not wa s t h e g i l d e d a g e p o l i t i c a l s y s t e m e f f e c t i v e i n m e e t i n g i t s g o a l s.
vote until the passage of the reform act of 1884.
as late as the eve of world war i the house of lords an unelected body of hereditary aristocrats could veto any legislation passed by the house of commons.
nonetheless the power of the new corporations seemingly immune to democratic control raised disturbing questions for the american understanding of political freedom as popular self government.
political corruption was rife.
the galleries and lobbies of every legislature observed an illinois republican leader are thronged with men seeking to procure an advantage for one corporation or another.
in pennsylvanias legislature the third house of railroad lobbyists supposedly exerted as much influence as the elected chambers.
in the west many lawmakers held stock or directorships in lumber companies and railroads that received public aid.
urban politics fell under the sway of corrupt political machines like new yorks tweed ring which plundered the city of tens of millions of dollars.
boss william m tweeds organization reached into every neighborhood.
he forged close ties with railroad men and labor unions and he won support from the citys immigrant poor by fashioning a kind of private welfare system that provided food fuel and jobs in hard times.
a combination of political reformers and businessmen tired of paying tribute to the ring ousted tweed in the early 1870s although he remained popular among the citys poor who considered him an urban robin hood.
at the national level many lawmakers supported bills aiding companies in which they had invested money or from which they received stock or salaries.
the most notorious example of corruption came to light during grants presidency.
this was crdit mobilier a corporation formed by an inner ring of union pacific railroad stockholders to oversee the lines government assisted construction.
essentially it enabled the participants to sign contracts with themselves at an exorbitant profit to build the new line.
the arrangement was protected by the distribution of stock to influ the bosses of the senate a cartoon from puck january 23 1889 shows well fed monopolists towering over the obedient senators.

in another example of corruption the whiskey ring of the grant administration united republican officials tax collectors and whiskey manufacturers in a massive scheme that defrauded the federal government of millions of tax dollars.
the politics of dead center in national elections party politics bore the powerful imprint of the civil war.
republicans controlled the industrial north and midwest and the agrarian west and were particularly strong among members of revivalist churches protestant immigrants and blacks.
organizations of union veterans formed a bulwark of republican support.
every republican candidate for president from 1868 to 1900 had fought in the union army.
in the 1880 campaign all four candidates republican james a garfield democrat winfield scott hancock prohibitionist neal dow and james b weaver of the greenback labor party discussed later had been union generals during the war.
by 1893 a lavish system of pensions for union soldiers and their widows and children consumed more than 40 percent of the federal budget.
democrats after 1877 dominated the south and did well among catholic voters especially irish americans in the nations cities.
the parties were closely divided.
in three of the five presidential elections between 1876 and 1892 the margin separating the major candidates was less than 1 percent of the popular vote.
twice in 1876 and 1888 the candidate with an electoral college majority trailed in the popular vote.
the congressional elections of 1874 when democrats won control of the house of representatives ushered in two decades of political stalemate.
a succession of one term presidencies followed rutherford b hayes elected in 1876 james a garfield succeeded after his assassination in 1881 by chester a arthur grover cleveland in 1884 benjamin harrison in 1888 and cleveland elected for the second time in 1892.
only for brief periods did the same party control the white political stalemate house and both houses of congress.
more than once 1876 1892 congress found itself paralyzed as important bills shuttled back and forth between house and senate and special sessions to complete legislation became necessary.
gilded age presidents made little effort to mobilize public opinion or exert executive leadership.
their staffs were quite small.
grover cleveland himself answered the white house doorbell.
in some ways american democracy in the gilded age seemed remarkably healthy.
elections were closely contested party loyalty was intense and 80 percent or more of eligible voters turned out to cast ballots.
it was an era of massive party rallies and spellbinding political oratory.
james g blaine was among the members of congress non voting territory tainted by the crdit mobilier scandal but robert g elections of 1876 1892 ingersolls speech before the republican national convenvoted democrat 4 5 times tion of 1876 nearly secured blaines nomination for presivoted republican 4 5 times dent by depicting him as a plumed knight who had voted more irregularly raised his shining lance against the countrys enemies.

government and the economy the nations political structure however proved ill equipped to deal with the problems created by the economys rapid growth.
despite its expanded scope and powers arising from the civil war the federal government remained remarkably small by modern standards.
activities from education to medical care business regulation civil and criminal prosecutions and many others were almost entirely under the control of local and state governments or private institutions.
the federal workforce in 1880 numbered 100 000 today it exceeds 2 5 million.
nationally both parties came under the control of powerful political managers with close ties to business interests.
republicans strongly supported a high tariff to protect american industry and throughout the 1870s they pursued a fiscal policy based on reducing federal spending repaying much of the national debt and withdrawing greenbacks the paper money issued by the union during the civil war from circulation.
democrats opposed the high tariff but the partys national leadership remained closely linked to new york bankers and financiers and resisted demands from debt ridden agricultural areas for an increase in the money supply.
in 1879 for the first time since the war the united states returned to the gold standard that is paper currency became exchangeable for gold at a fixed rate.
by reducing competition from foreign manufactured goods and leaving the banks not the government in control of issuing money republican economic policies strongly favored the interests of eastern industrialists and bankers.
these policies worked to the disadvantage of southern and western farmers who had to pay a premium for manufactured goods while the prices they received for their produce steadily declined.
reform legislation gilded age national politics did not entirely lack accomplishments.
inspired in part by president garfields assassination by a disappointed office seeker the civil service act of 1883 created a merit system for federal employees with appointment via competitive examinations rather than political influence.
although it applied at first to only 10 percent of the more than 100 000 government workers the act marked the first step in establishing a professional civil service and removing officeholding from the hands of political machines.
however since funds raised from political appointees had helped to finance the political parties civil service reform had the unintended result of increasing politicians dependence on donations from business interests.
in 1887 in response to public outcries against railroad practices congress established the interstate commerce commission icc to ensure that the rates railroads charged farmers and merchants to transport their goods were reasonable and did not offer more favorable treatment to some shippers over others.
the icc was the first federal agency intended to regulate economic activity but since it lacked the power to establish rates on its own it could only sue companies in court it had little impact on railroad practices.
three years later congress passed the sherman antitrust act which banned combinations and practices that restrained a political cartoon shows grover cleveland leading the democratic party in an assault against republican high taxes.

but the language was so vague that the act proved almost impossible to enforce.
weak as they were these laws helped to establish the precedent that the national government could regulate the economy to promote the public good.

conflict in the states the nation had to weather the effects of drastic economic change and periodic economic crises without leadership from washington.
at the state and local level however the gilded age was an era of political ferment and conflict over the proper uses of governmental authority.
in the immediate aftermath of the civil war state governments in the north like those in the reconstruction south greatly expanded their responsibility for public health welfare and education and cities invested heavily in public works such as park construction and improved water and gas services.
those who suffered from economic change called on the activist state created by the war to redress their own grievances.
third parties enjoyed significant if short lived success in local elections.
the greenback labor party proposed that the federal government stop taking greenback money out of circulation.
this it argued would make more funds available for investment and give the government not private bankers control of the money supply.
it also condemned the use of militias and private police against strikes.
in the late 1870s the party controlled local government in a number of industrial and mining communities and contributed to the election of twenty one members of congress independent of the two major parties.
the policies of railroad companies produced a growing chorus of protest especially in the west.
farmers and local merchants complained of excessively high freight rates discrimination in favor of large producers and shippers and high fees charged by railroad controlled grain warehouses.
critics of the railroads came together in the patrons of husbandry or grange which moved to establish cooperatives for storing and marketing farm output in the hope of forcing the carriers to take our produce at a fair price founded in 1867 the grange claimed more than 700 000 members by the mid 1870s.
its members called on state governments to establish fair freight rates and warehouse charges.
in several states the grange succeeded in having commissions established to investigate and in some cases regulate railroad practices.
at the same time the labor movement revitalized during the civil war demanded laws establishing eight hours as a legal days work.
seven northern legislatures passed such laws but since most lacked strong means of enforcement they remained dead letters.
but the efforts of farmers and workers to use the power of the state to wa s t h e g i l d e d a g e p o l i t i c a l s y s t e m e f f e c t i v e i n m e e t i n g i t s g o a l s.
counteract the inequalities of the gilded age inspired a far reaching debate on the relationship between political and economic freedom in an industrial society.
freedom in the gilded age the social problem as the united states matured into an industrial economy americans struggled to make sense of the new social order.
debates over political economy engaged the attention of millions of americans reaching far beyond the tiny academic world into the public sphere inhabited by self educated workingmen and farmers reformers of all kinds newspaper editors and politicians.
this broad public discussion produced thousands of books pamphlets and articles on such technical issues as land taxation and currency reform as well as widespread debate over the social and ethical implications of economic change.
many americans sensed that something had gone wrong in the nations social development.
talk of better classes respectable classes and dangerous classes dominated public discussion and bitter labor strife seemed to have become the rule.
during the gilded age congress and a number of states established investigating committees to inquire into the relations between labor and capital.
their hearings produced powerful evidence of distrust between employees and employers.
in 1881 the massachusetts bureau of labor statistics reported that virtually every worker it interviewed in fall river the nations largest center of textile production complained of overwork poor housing and tyrannical employers.
for their part manufacturers claimed their workingmen were the scum of the english and irish whose complaints reflected nothing more than a hereditary feeling of discontent freedom i n e q u a l i t y and democracy the appearance of what massachusetts cotton manufacturer edward atkinson called a permanent factory population living on the edge of poverty alongside a growing class of millionaires posed a sharp challenge to traditional definitions of freedom.
did americas promise still lie in the opportunity it offered ordinary citizens to achieve economic autonomy.
the great curse of the old world the division of society into classes declared the nation had come to america.
it became increasingly difficult to view wage labor as a temporary resting place on the road to economic independence or the west as a haven for the dispossessed small producers of the east.
given the vast expansion of the nations productive capacity many americans viewed the concentration of wealth as inevitable natural and justified by progress.
by the turn of the century advanced economics taught that wages were determined by the iron law of supply and demand and that wealth rightly flowed not to those who worked the hardest but to men with business skills and access to money.
the close link between freedom and equality forged in the revolution and reinforced during the civil c h.
16 americas gilded age 1870 1890 freedom in the gilded age war appeared increasingly out of date.
the task of social science wrote iron manufacturer abram hewitt was to devise ways of making men who are equal in liberty content with the inequality in.
distribution inevitable in modern society.
among the first to take up this challenge were the self styled liberal reformers.
their beliefs were quite different from those called liberals in modern america who advocate that an activist government try to address social needs.
this group of editors and professionals broke with the republican party in 1872 and helped to bring about a change in northern opinion regarding reconstruction.
but their program was not confined to the south.
like the men who led the movement for a new constitution in the 1780s gilded age reformers feared that with lowerclass groups seeking to use government to advance their own interests democracy was becoming a threat to individual liberty and the rights of property.
some urged a return to the long abandoned principle that voting should be limited to property owners.
during the 1830s alexis de tocqueville had reported that opponents of democracy hide their heads by the 1870s wrote one observer expressions of doubt and distrust in regard to universal suffrage are heard constantly.
at the top of our society social darwinism in america the idea of the natural superiority of some groups to others which before the civil war had been invoked to justify slavery in an otherwise free society now reemerged in the vocabulary of modern science to explain the success and failure of individuals and social classes.
in 1859 the british scientist charles darwin published on the origin of species.
one of the most influential works of science ever to appear it expounded the theory of evolution whereby plant and animal species best suited to their environment took the place of those less able to adapt.
in a highly oversimplified form language borrowed from darwin such as natural selection the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest entered public discussion of social problems in the gilded age.
according to what came to be called social darwinism evolution was as natural a process in human society as in nature and government must not interfere.
especially misguided in this view were efforts to uplift those at the bottom of the social order such as laws regulating conditions of work or public assistance to the poor.
the giant industrial corporation social darwinists believed had emerged because it was better adapted to its environment than earlier forms of enterprise.
to restrict its operations by legislation would reduce society to a more primitive level.
even the depressions of the 1870s and 1890s did not shake the widespread view that the poor were essentially responsible for their own fate.
charity workers and local governments spent much time and energy distinguishing the deserving poor those like widows and orphans destitute through no fault of their own from the undeserving a far larger number.
failure to advance in society was widely thought to indicate a lack of character an absence of self reliance and determination in the face of adversity.
as late as 1900 half the nations largest cities offered virtually no public relief except to persons living in poorhouses.
to improve their lot visions of freedom detail from capital and labor.
capital and labor a cotton textile from around 1870 illustrates the free labor ideal with an employer and employee shaking hands and laborers enjoying dignity at work and a happy home one image and its caption the two powers in accord illustrates the idea of a harmony of interests between worker and employer a key tenet of free labor thought.
others stress the dignity of the workingman based partly on his skill and partly on his ability to provide a comfortable home for his family.
the portrait of american industry here stands in stark contrast to the widespread labor strife of the gilded age.
questions 1.
why did many americans in the gilded age worry that this vision of harmony no longer described american life.
give some examples of how the images here misrepresent the realities of the period.
16 americas gilded age 1870 1890 freedom in the gilded age according to the philosophy of social darwinism workers should practice personal economy keep out of debt and educate their children in the principles of the marketplace not look to the government for aid.
the eras most influential social darwinist was yale professor william graham sumner.
for sumner freedom meant the security given to each man that he can acquire enjoy and dispose of property exclusively as he chooses without interference from other persons or from government.
freedom thus defined required frank acceptance of inequality.
society faced two and only two alternatives liberty inequality survival of the fittest not liberty equality survival of the unfittest in 1883 sumner published what social classes owe to each other.
his answer essentially was nothing in a free state no one was entitled to claim help from and cannot be charged to offer help to another government sumner believed existed only to protect the property of men and the honor of women not to upset social arrangements decreed by nature.
liberty of contract the growing influence of social darwinism helped to popularize an idea that would be embraced by the business and professional classes in the last quarter of the nineteenth century a negative definition of freedom as limited government and an unrestrained free market.
central to this social vision was the idea of contract.
the laws of contract wrote one reformer are the foundation of civilization labor contracts reconciled freedom and authority in the workplace.
so long as labor relations were governed by contracts freely arrived at by independent individuals neither the government nor unions had a right to interfere with working conditions and americans had no grounds to complain of a loss of freedom.
demands by workers that the government enforce an eight hour day provide relief to the unemployed or in other ways intervene in the economy struck liberals as an example of how the misuse of political power posed a threat to liberty.
the right of each man to labor as much or as little as he chooses and to enjoy his own earnings is the very foundation stone of.
freedom wrote chicago newspaper editor horace white.
the principle of free labor which originated as a celebration of the independent small producer in a society of broad equality and social harmony was transformed into a defense of the unrestrained operations of the capitalist marketplace.
the courts and freedom in elevating liberty of contract from one element of freedom to its very essence the courts played a significant role.
the fourteenth amendment had empowered the federal government to overturn state laws that violated citizens rights.
by the 1880s liberty of contract not equality before the law for former slaves came to be defined as the amendments true meaning.
state and federal courts regularly struck down state laws regulating economic enterprise as an interference with the right of the free laborer to choose his employment and working conditions and of the entrepreneur to utilize his property as he saw fit.
for decades the courts viewed state regulation of business especially laws establishing maximum hours of work and safe working conditions as an insult to free labor.
how did the economic development of the gilded age affect american freedom.
the ironworkers noontime painted in 1880 1881 by thomas anshutz an artist born in west virginia whose family owned iron factories.
unlike artists who depicted factories and workers earlier in the century anshutz does not try to reconcile nature and industry there are no reminders of the natural environment.
nor does he emphasize the dignity of labor.
the workers seem dwarfed by the factory and some seem exhausted.
at first the supreme court was willing to accept laws regulating enterprises that represented a significant public interest in munn v illinois an 1877 decision it upheld the constitutionality of an illinois law that established a state board empowered to eliminate railroad rate discrimination and set maximum charges.
nine years later however in wabash v illinois the court essentially reversed itself ruling that only the federal government not the states could regulate railroads engaged in interstate commerce as all important lines were.
the decision led directly to the passage of the interstate commerce act of 1887.
but on virtually every occasion when cases brought by the icc against railroads made their way to the supreme court the company emerged victorious.
the courts generally sided with business enterprises that complained of a loss of economic freedom.
in 1885 the new york court of appeals invalidated a state law that prohibited the manufacture of cigars in tenement dwellings on the grounds that such legislation deprived the worker of the liberty to work where he will although women still lacked political rights they were increasingly understood to possess the same economic liberty defined in this way as men.
on the grounds that it violated womens freedom the illinois supreme court in 1895 declared unconstitutional a state law that outlawed the production of garments in sweatshops and established a forty eight hour work week for women and children.
in the same year in united states v e c knight co the u s supreme court ruled that the sherman antitrust act of 1890 which barred combinations in restraint of trade could not be used to break up a sugar refining monopoly since the constitution empowered congress to regulate commerce but not manufacturing.
their unwillingness to allow regulation of the economy however did not prevent the courts from acting to impede labor organization.
the sherman act intended to prevent business mergers that stifled competition was used by judges primarily to issue injunctions prohibiting strikes on the grounds that they illegally interfered with the freedom of trade.
in a 1905 case that became almost as notorious as dred scott and gave c h.
16 americas gilded age 1870 1890 labor and the republic the name lochnerism to the entire body of liberty of contract decisions the supreme court in lochner v new york voided a state law establishing ten hours per day or sixty per week as the maximum hours of work for bakers.
the law wrote associate justice rufus peckham for the 5 4 majority interfered with the right of contract between employer and employee and therefore infringed upon individual freedom.
by this time the court was invoking liberty in ways that could easily seem absurd.
in one case it overturned as a violation of personal liberty a kansas law prohibiting yellow dog contracts which made nonmembership in a union a condition of employment.
in another it struck down state laws requiring payment of coal miners in money rather than paper usable only at company owned stores.
workers observed mine union leader john p mitchell could not but feel that they are being guaranteed the liberties they do not want and denied the liberty that is of real value to them labor and the republic the overwhelming labor question as mitchells remark suggests public debate in the late nineteenth century more than at almost any other moment in american history divided along class lines.
the shift from the slavery controversy to what one politician called the overwhelming labor question was dramatically illustrated in 1877 the year of both the end of reconstruction and also the first national labor walkout the great railroad strike.
when workers protesting a pay cut paralyzed rail traffic in much of the country militia units tried to force them back to work.
after troops fired on strikers in pittsburgh killing twenty people workers responded by burning the citys railroad yards destroying millions of dollars in property.
general strikes paralyzed chicago and st louis.
the strike revealed both a strong sense of solidarity among workers and the close ties between the republican party and the new class of industrialists.
president rutherford b hayes who a few months earlier had ordered federal troops in the south to end their involvement in local politics ordered the army into the north.
the workers the president wrote in his diary were put down by force the days are over declared the new york times in which this country could rejoice in its freedom from the elements of social strife which have long abounded in the old countries in the aftermath of 1877 the federal government constructed armories in major cities to ensure that troops would be on hand in the event of further labor difficulties.
henceforth national power would be used not to protect beleaguered former slaves but to guarantee the rights of property.
the knights conditions ruins of the pittsburgh round house a photograph published in the july 1895 issue of scribners magazine shows the widespread destruction of property during the great railroad strike of july 1877.
of labor essential and to the liberty the 1880s witnessed a new wave of labor organizing.
at its center stood the knights of labor.
the knights were the first group to try to organize unskilled workers as well as skilled women alongside men and blacks as well as whites although even the knights excluded the despised asian immigrants on the west coast.
the group reached a peak membership of how did reformers of the period approach the problems of an industrial society.
nearly 800 000 in 1886 and involved millions of workers in strikes boycotts political action and educational and social activities.
caught between nostalgia for the era of small production and acknowledgment of the factorys triumph labor reformers of the gilded age put forward a wide array of programs from the eight hour day to public employment in hard times currency reform anarchism socialism and the creation of a vaguely defined cooperative commonwealth all these ideas arose from the conviction that the social conditions of the 1880s needed drastic change.
americans declared terence v powderly head of the knights of labor were not the free people that we imagine we are the labor movement launched a sustained assault on the understanding of freedom grounded in social darwinism and liberty of contract.
because of unrestrained economic growth and political corruption the knights charged ordinary americans had lost control of their economic livelihoods and their own government.
reaching back across the divide of the civil war labor defined employers as a new slave power concentrated capital warned george e mcneill a shoemaker and factory worker who became one of the movements most eloquent writers had become a greater power than that of the state extremes of wealth and poverty he warned threatened the very existence of democratic government.
the remedy was to engraft republican principles into our industrial system by guaranteeing a basic set of economic rights for all americans.
labor raised the question whether meaningful freedom could exist in a situation of extreme economic inequality.
on july 4 1886 the federated trades of the pacific coast rewrote the declaration of independence.
workers the new declaration claimed had been subjected not to oppressive government but to the unjust domination of a special class it went on to list among mankinds inalienable rights life and the means of living liberty and the conditions essential to liberty middle class reformers dissatisfaction with social conditions in the gilded age extended well beyond aggrieved workers.
supreme court justice john marshall harlan in the late 1880s spoke of a deep feeling of unease a widespread fear that the country was in real danger of another kind of slavery that would result from the aggregation of capital in the hands of a few individuals alarmed by fear of class warfare and the growing power of concentrated capital social thinkers offered numerous plans for change.
in the last quarter of the century more than 150 utopian or cataclysmic novels appeared predicting that social conflict would end either in a new harmonious social order or in total catastrophe.
one popular novel of the era caesars column 1891 by ignatius donnelly ended with civilized society destroyed in a savage civil war between labor and capital.
of the many books proposing more optimistic remedies for the unequal distribution of wealth the most popular were progress and poverty 1879 by henry george the cooperative commonwealth 1884 by laurence gronlund and edward bellamys looking backward 1888.
all three were among the centurys greatest best sellers their extraordinary success testifying to what george called a wide spread consciousness.
that there is something radically wrong in the present social organization all three an engraving from frank leslies illustrated newspaper october 16 1886 shows black delegate frank j farrell introducing terence v powderly leader of the knights of labor at the labor organizations national convention in richmond virginia.

a placard illustrates how the labor movement identified gilded age employers with the slave power of the pre civil war era.
writers though in very different ways sought to reclaim an imagined golden age of social harmony and american freedom.
progress and poverty although it had no direct impact on government policy progress and poverty probably commanded more public attention than any book on economics in american history.
an antislavery newspaper editor in california in the 1850s and 1860s henry george had witnessed firsthand the rapid monopolization of land in the state.
his book began with a famous statement of the problem suggested by its title the growth of squalor and misery alongside material progress.
his solution was the single tax which would replace other taxes with a levy on increases in the value of real estate.
the single tax would be so high that it would prevent speculation in both urban and rural land.
no one knows how many of henry georges readers actually believed in this way of solving the nations ills.
but millions responded to his clear explanation of economic relationships and his stirring account of how the social distress long thought to be confined to the old world had made its appearance in the new.
freedom lay at the heart of georges analysis.
the proper name for the political movement spawned by his book he once wrote was freedom men who would do for the question of industrial slavery what the republican party had done for the slavery of blacks.
george rejected the traditional equation of liberty with ownership of land since the single tax in effect made land the common property of the entire society.
in other ways however his definition of freedom was thoroughly in keeping with mainstream thought.
despite calling for a single massive public intervention in the economy george saw government as a repressive power whose functions in the co operative society of the future would be lim how did reformers of the period approach the problems of an industrial society.
ited to enhancing the quality of life building public baths museums libraries gardens and the like.
the cooperative c o m m o n w e a lt h quite different in outlook was the cooperative commonwealth the first book to popularize socialist ideas for an american audience.
its author laurence gronlund was a lawyer who had emigrated from denmark in 1867.
socialism the belief that private control of economic enterprises should be replaced by government ownership in order to ensure a fairer distribution of the benefits of the wealth produced became a major political force in western europe in the late nineteenth century.
in the united states however where access to private property was widely considered essential to individual freedom socialist beliefs were largely confined to immigrants whose writings frequently in foreign languages attracted little attention.
gronlund began the process of socialisms americanization.
while karl marx the nineteenth centurys most influential socialist theorist had predicted that socialism would come into being via a working class revolution gronlund portrayed it as the end result of a process of peaceful evolution not violent upheaval.
he thus made socialism seem more acceptable to middle class americans who desired an end to class conflict and the restoration of social harmony.
bellamy s utopia not until the early twentieth century would socialism become a significant presence in american public life.
as gronlund himself noted the most important result of the cooperative commonwealth was to prepare an audience for edward bellamys looking backward which promoted socialist ideas while ignoring that name bellamy wrote of nationalism not socialism.
bellamy lived virtually his entire life in the small industrial city of chicopee falls massachusetts.
in looking backward his main character falls asleep in the late nineteenth century only to awaken in the year 2000 in a world where cooperation has replaced class strife excessive individualism and cutthroat competition.
inequality has been banished and with it the idea of liberty as a condition to be achieved through individual striving free of governmental restraint.
freedom bellamy insisted was a social condition resting on interdependence not autonomy.
from todays vantage point bellamys utopia with citizens obligated to labor for years in an industrial army controlled by a single great trust seems a chilling social blueprint.
yet the book inspired the creation of hundreds of nationalist clubs devoted to bringing into existence the world of 2000 and left a profound mark on a generation of reformers and intellectuals.
bellamy held out the hope of retaining the material abundance made possible by industrial capitalism while eliminating inequality.
in proposing that the state guarantee economic security to all bellamy offered a farreaching expansion of the idea of freedom.
i am aware that you called yourself free in the nineteenth century a resident of the year 2000 tells bellamys rip van winkle.
but the meaning of the word could not then have been at all what it is at present or it could not have been applied to a edward bellamy author of the utopian novel looking backward.
16 americas gilded age 1870 1890 labor and the republic society in which so many lived in a state of galling personal dependence upon others as to the very means of life a social gospel by 1888 when looking backward appeared social darwinism and the laissez faire definition of freedom were under attack from many quarters including the labor movement and middle class writers like george and bellamy as well as clergymen shocked by the inequities in the emerging industrial order.
most of the eras protestant preachers concentrated on attacking individual sins like drinking and sabbath breaking and saw nothing immoral about the pursuit of riches.
their gospel of wealth gave a moral underpinning to the liberty of contract outlook.
but the outlines of what came to be called the social gospel were taking shape in the writings of walter rauschenbusch a baptist minister in new york city washington gladden a congregational clergyman in columbus ohio and others.
they insisted that freedom and spiritual self development required an equalization of wealth and power and that unbridled competition mocked the christian ideal of brotherhood.
the social gospel movement originated as an effort to reform protestant churches by expanding their appeal in poor urban neighborhoods and making them more attentive to the eras social ills.
the movements adherents established missions and relief programs in urban areas that attempted to alleviate poverty combat child labor and encourage the construction of better working class housing.
they worked with the knights of labor and other groups demanding health and safety laws.
some suggested that a more cooperative organization of the economy should replace competitive capitalism.
within american catholicism as well a group of priests and bishops emerged who attempted to alter the churchs traditional hostility to movements for social reform and its isolation from contemporary currents of social thought.
with most of its parishioners working men and women they argued the church should lend its support to the labor movement.
these developments suggested the existence of widespread dissatisfaction with the liberty of contract understanding of freedom.
the haymarket a f fa i r the year of the dedication of the statue of liberty 1886 also witnessed an unprecedented upsurge in labor activity.
inspired by a successful strike by western railroad unions against lines controlled by the powerful financier jay gould workers flooded into the knights of labor.
its membership only 100 000 in 1885 rose more than sevenfold in the following year.
on may 1 1886 some 350 000 workers in cities across the country demonstrated for an eight hour day.
having originated in the united states may 1 or may day as it came to be called soon became an annual date of parades picnics and protests celebrated around the world by organized labor.
the most dramatic events of 1886 took place in chicago a city with a large and vibrant labor movement that brought together native born and immigrant workers whose outlooks ranged from immigrant socialism and anarchism to american traditions of equality and anti monopoly.
in 1885 the iron moulders union one of the most powerful organizations of how did reformers of the period approach the problems of an industrial society.
skilled industrial workers in the country had organized a strike against a wage reduction at the great mccormick plant that produced agricultural machinery.
the company brought in strikebreakers and private police who battled in the streets with the strikers.
fearing chaos the mayor and prominent business leaders persuaded the company to settle on the unions terms.
but in february 1886 after the company installed new machinery that reduced its dependence on the iron moulders traditional skills it announced that henceforth the factory would operate on a nonunion basis.
the result was a bitter prolonged strike.
this time chicagos city government sided with the company.
on may 3 1886 four strikers were killed by police when they attempted to prevent strikebreakers from entering the factory.
the next day a rally was held in haymarket square to protest the killings.
near the end of the speeches someone whose identity has never been determined threw a bomb into the crowd killing a policeman.
the panicked police opened fire shooting several bystanders and a number of their own force.
soon after police raided the offices of labor and radical groups and arrested of their leaders.
employers took the opportunity to paint the labor movement as a dangerous and un american force prone to violence and controlled by foreign born radicals.
the mccormick strike was defeated and the union local destroyed.
eight anarchists were charged with plotting and carrying out the bombing.
even though the evidence against them was extremely weak a jury convicted the haymarket martyrs four were hanged one committed suicide in prison and the remaining three were imprisoned until john peter altgeld a pro labor governor of illinois commuted their sentences in 1893.
seven of the eight men accused of plotting the haymarket bombing were foreign born six germans and an english immigrant.
the last was albert parsons a native of alabama who had served in the confederate army in the civil war and edited a republican newspaper in texas during reconstruction.
fearing violence because of his political views and the fact that his wife lucy parsons was black albert parsons moved to chicago during the 1870s.
having survived the ku klux klan in reconstruction texas parsons perished on the illinois gallows for a crime that he like the other haymarket martyrs did not commit.
labor and politics the haymarket affair took place amid an outburst of independent labor political activity.
one study has identified more than 100 local political tickets associated with the knights of labor between 1886 and 1888 from a cartoon from the 1880s depicts radicals as foreigners attempting to destroy the foundations of american society.

their major aim was to end the use of public and private police forces and court injunctions against strikes and labor organizations.
at least sixty achieved some kind of electoral success.
in kansas city a coalition of black and irish american workers and middle class voters elected tom hanna as mayor.
he proceeded to side with unions rather than employers in industrial disputes.
the most celebrated labor campaign took place in new york city where in 1886 somewhat to his own surprise henry george found himself thrust into the role of labors candidate for mayor.
georges aim in running was to bring attention to the single tax on land.
the labor leaders who organized the united labor party had more immediate goals in mind especially stopping the courts from barring strikes and jailing unionists for conspiracy.
george ran a spirited campaign speaking at factories immigrant associations and labor parades and rallies.
a few days after the dedication of the statue of liberty new yorkers flocked to the polls to elect their mayor.
nearly 70 000 voted for george who finished second eclipsing the total of the republican candidate theodore roosevelt and coming close to defeating democrat abram hewitt.
in a political system that within living memory had witnessed the disappearance of the whig party the rise and fall of the know nothings and the emergence of the republicans the events of 1886 suggested that labor might be on the verge of establishing itself as a permanent political force.
in fact that year marked the high point of the knights of labor.
facing increasing employer hostility and with a poorly organized structure that could not assimilate the great spurt in new members the knights soon declined.
the major parties moreover proved remarkably resourceful in appealing to labor voters.
thus americas gilded age witnessed deep and sometimes violent divisions over the definition of freedom in a rapidly industrializing society.
the battle between upholders of social darwinism and laissez faire who saw freedom as the right of individuals to pursue their economic interests without outside restraint and those who believed in collective efforts to create industrial freedom for ordinary americans would continue for many decades.
in the early twentieth century reformers would turn to new ways of addressing the social conditions of freedom and new means of increasing ordinary americans political and economic liberty.
but before this in the 1890s the nation would face its gravest crisis since the civil war and the boundaries of freedom would once again be redrawn.

l o ne of the most popular songs of 1892 bore the title father was killed by a pinkerton man it was inspired by an incident during a bitter strike at andrew carnegies steelworks at homestead pennsylvania the nineteenth centurys most widely publicized confrontation between labor and capital.
the strike pitted one of the nations leading industrial corporations against a powerful union the amalgamated association which represented the skilled iron and steelworkers among the complexs 3 800 employees.
homesteads twelve steel mills were the most profitable and technologically advanced in the world.
the union contract gave the amalgamated association a considerable say in their operation including the right to approve the hiring of new workers and to regulate the pace of work.
to carnegie and henry clay frick his local supervisor the unions power increasingly seemed an intolerable infringement on managements rights.
in 1892 they decided to operate the plant on a nonunion basis.
frick surrounded the factory with a fence topped by barbed wire constructed barracks to house strikebreakers and fired the entire workforce.
henceforth only workers who agreed not to join the union could work at homestead.
in response the workers including the unskilled laborers not included in the amalgamated association blockaded the steelworks and mobilized support from the local community.
the battle memorialized in song took place on july 6 1892 when armed strikers confronted 300 private policemen from the pinkerton detective agency.
seven workers and three pinkerton agents were killed and the pinkertons were forced to retreat.
four days later the governor of pennsylvania dispatched 8 000 militiamen to open the complex on managements terms.
the strikers held out until november but the unions defeat was now inevitable.
in the end the amalgamated association was destroyed.
the carnegie corporations tactics and the workers solidarity won the strikers widespread national sympathy.
ten thousand carnegie libraries declared the st louis post dispatch would not compensate the country for the evils resulting from homestead the strike became an international cause clbre as well.
british newspapers pointed out that their country restricted the use of private police forces far more severely than the united states.
britons they claimed understood economic liberty better than americans.
homestead demonstrated that neither a powerful union nor public opinion could influence the conduct of the largest corporations.
the writer hamlin garland who visited homestead two years after the strike found the workforce sullen and bitter.
he described a town as squalid and unlovely as could be imagined with dingy houses over which hung dense clouds of black smoke.
it was american he wrote only in the sense in which it represents the american idea of business w h a t w e r e t h e o r i g i n s a n d t h e s i g n i f i c a n c e o f po p u l i s m.
in fact two american ideas of freedom collided at homestead the employers definition based on the idea that property rights unrestrained by union rules or public regulation sustained the public good and the workers conception which stressed economic security and independence from what they considered the tyranny of employers.
the strife at homestead also reflected broader battles over american freedom during the 1890s.
like the homestead workers many americans came to believe that they were being denied economic independence and democratic self government long central to the popular understanding of freedom.
during the 1890s millions of farmers joined the populist movement in an attempt to reverse their declining economic prospects and to rescue the government from what they saw as control by powerful corporate interests.
the 1890s witnessed the imposition of a new racial system in the south that locked african americans into the status of second class citizenship denying them many of the freedoms white americans took for granted.
increasing immigration produced heated debates over whether the country should reconsider its traditional self definition as a refuge for foreigners seeking greater freedom on american shores.
at the end of the 1890s in the spanish american war the united states for the first time acquired overseas possessions and found itself ruling over subject peoples from puerto rico to the philippines.
was the democratic republic many americans wondered becoming an empire like those of europe.
rarely has the country experienced at one time so many debates over both the meaning of freedom and freedoms boundaries.
the populist challenge the fa r m e r s r e v o lt even as labor unrest crested a different kind of uprising was ripening in the south and the trans mississippi west a response to falling agricultural prices and growing economic dependency in rural areas.
like industrial workers small farmers faced increasing economic insecurity.
in the south the sharecropping system discussed in chapter 15 locked millions of ten andrew carnegies ironworks at homestead pennsylvania.
17 freedoms boundaries at home and abroad 1890 1900 the populist challenge ant farmers white and black into perpetual poverty.
the interruption of cotton exports during the civil war had led to the rapid expansion of production in india egypt and brazil.
the glut of cotton on the world market led to declining prices from 11 cents a pound in 1881 to 4 6 cents in 1894 throwing millions of small farmers deep into debt and threatening them with the loss of their land.
in the west farmers who had mortgaged their property to purchase seed fertilizer and equipment faced the prospect of losing their farms when unable to repay their bank loans.
farmers increasingly believed that their plight derived from the high freight rates charged by railroad companies excessive interest rates for loans from merchants and bankers and the fiscal policies of the federal government discussed in the previous chapter that reduced the supply of money and helped to push down farm prices.
through the farmers alliance the largest citizens movement of the nineteenth century farmers sought to remedy their condition.
founded in texas in the late 1870s the alliance spread to forty three states by 1890.
the farmers alternatives said j d fields a texas alliance leader were success and freedom or failure and servitude at first the alliance remained aloof from politics attempting to improve rural conditions by the cooperative financing and marketing of crops.
alliance exchanges would loan money to farmers and sell their produce.
but it soon became clear that farmers on their own could not finance this plan and banks refused to extend loans to the exchanges.
the alliance therefore proposed that the federal government establish warehouses where farmers could store their crops until they were sold.
using the crops as collateral the government would then issue loans to farmers at low interest rates thereby ending their dependence on bankers and merchants.
since it would have to be enacted by congress the subtreasury plan as this proposal was called led the alliance into politics.
the peoples party in the early 1890s the alliance evolved into the peoples party or populists the eras greatest political insurgency.
the party did not just appeal to farmers.
it sought to speak for all the producing classes and achieved some of its greatest successes in states like colorado and idaho where it won the support of miners and industrial workers.
it attracted veterans of the knights of labor by condemning the use of court injunctions and private police forces against strikers.
but its major base lay in the cotton and wheat belts of the south and west.
building on the farmers alliance network of local institutions the populists embarked on a remarkable effort of community organization and education.
to spread their message they published numerous pamphlets on political and economic questions established more than 1 000 local newspapers and sent traveling speakers throughout rural america.

in all essential respects the republic of our fathers is dead but although the populists used the familiar language of nineteenthcentury radicalism they were hardly a backward looking movement.
they embraced the modern technologies that made large scale cooperative enterprise possible the railroad the telegraph and the national market while looking to the federal government to regulate them in the public interest.
they promoted agricultural education and believed farmers should adopt modern scientific methods of cultivation.
they believed the federal government could move beyond partisan conflict to operate in a businesslike manner to promote the public good a vision soon to be associated with the progressive movement and many years later politicians like jimmy carter and barack obama.

populist coalition in some southern states the populists made remarkable efforts to unite black and white small farmers on a common political and economic program.
the obstacles to such an alliance were immense not merely the heritage of racism and the political legacy of the civil war but the fact that many white populists were landowning farmers while most blacks were tenants and agricultural laborers.
unwelcome in the southern branches of the farmers alliance black farmers formed their own organization the colored farmers alliance.
in 1891 it tried to organize a strike of cotton pickers on plantations in south carolina arkansas and texas.
the action was violently suppressed by local authorities and landowners some of them sympathetic to the white alliance but unwilling to pay higher wages to their own laborers.
in general southern white populists racial attitudes did not differ significantly from those of their non populist neighbors.

in most of the south however democrats fended off the populist challenge by resorting to the tactics they had used to retain power since the 1870s mobilizing whites with warnings about negro supremacy intimidating black voters and stuffing ballot boxes on election day.

debs and the pullman strike also in 1894 workers in the company owned town of pullman illinois where railroad sleeping cars were manufactured called a strike to protest a reduction in wages.
the american railway union whose 150 000 members included both skilled and unskilled railroad laborers announced that its members would refuse to handle trains with pullman cars.
when the boycott crippled national rail service president grover clevelands attorney general richard olney himself on the board of several railroad companies obtained a federal court injunction ordering the strikers back to work.
federal troops and u s marshals soon occupied railroad centers like chicago and sacramento.
violent clashes between troops and workers erupted from maine to california leaving thirty four persons dead.
the strike collapsed when the unions leaders including its charismatic president eugene v debs were jailed for contempt of court for violating the judicial order.
in the case of in re debs the supreme court unanimously confirmed the sentences and approved the use of injunctions against striking labor unions.
on his release from prison in november 1895 more than 100 000 persons greeted debs at a chicago railroad depot.

but urban workers did not rally to the populists whose core issues the subtreasury plan and lower mortgage interest rates had little meaning for them and whose demand for higher prices for farm goods would raise the cost of food and reduce the value of workers wages.
moreover the revivalist atmosphere of many populist gatherings and the biblical cadences of populist speeches were alien to the largely immigrant and catholic industrial working class.
urban workingclass voters in 1894 instead shifted en masse to the republicans who claimed that raising tariff rates which democrats had recently reduced would restore prosperity by protecting manufacturers and industrial workers from the competition of imported goods and cheap foreign labor.
in one of the most decisive shifts in congressional power in american history the republicans gained 117 seats in the house of representatives.

and free s i lv e r in 1896 democrats and populists joined to support william jennings bryan for the presidency.
a thirty six year old congressman from nebraska bryan won the democratic nomination after delivering to the national convention an electrifying speech that crystallized the farmers pride and grievances.

you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold at various points in the nineteenth century from debates over hard versus soft money in the jacksonian era to the greenback movement after the civil war the money question had played a central role in american politics.
bryans demand for free silver was the latest expression of the view that increasing the amount of currency in circulation would raise the prices farmers received for their crops and make it easier to pay off their debts.
his nomination wrested control of the democratic party from longdominant leaders like president grover cleveland who were closely tied to eastern businessmen.
there was more to bryans appeal however than simply free silver.
a devoutly religious man he was strongly influenced by the social gospel movement discussed in the previous chapter and tried to apply the teachings of jesus christ to uplifting the little people of the united states.
he championed a vision of the government helping ordinary americans that anticipated provisions of the new deal of the 1930s including a progressive income tax banking regulation and the right of workers to form unions.
many populists were initially cool to bryans campaign.
their party had been defrauded time and again by democrats in the south.
veteran populists feared that their broad program was in danger of being reduced to free silver but realizing that they could not secure victory alone the partys leaders endorsed bryans candidacy.
bryan broke with tradition and embarked on a nationwide speaking tour seeking to rally farmers and workers to his cause.

in fact while planters merchants and industrialists prospered the region as a whole sank deeper and deeper into poverty.
some industry did develop including mining in the appalachians textile production in the carolinas and georgia and furniture and cigarette manufacturing in certain southern cities.
the new upcountry cotton factories offered jobs to entire families of poor whites from the surrounding countryside.
but since the main attractions for investors were the souths low wages and taxes and the availability of convict labor these enterprises made little contribution to regional economic development.
with the exception of birmingham alabama which by 1900 had developed into an important center for the manufacture of iron and steel southern cities were mainly export centers for cotton tobacco and rice with little industry or skilled labor.

they supported the growth of a black middle class mostly professionals like teachers and physicians or businessmen like undertakers and shopkeepers serving the needs of black customers.
but the labor market was rigidly divided along racial lines.
black men were excluded from supervisory positions in factories and workshops and white collar jobs such as clerks in offices.
a higher percentage of black women than white worked for wages but mainly as domestic servants.
they could not find employment among the growing numbers of secretaries typists and department store clerks.
even after the demise of the knights of labor some local unions mainly of dockworkers and mine laborers had significant numbers of black members.
but in most occupations the few unions that existed in the south excluded blacks forming yet another barrier to their economic advancement.
the an 1878 poster seeking recruits for the kansas exodus.
the segregated south kansas exodus overall one historian has written the new south was a miserable landscape dotted only by a few rich enclaves that cast little or no light upon the poverty surrounding them trapped at the bottom of a stagnant economy some blacks sought a way out through emigration from the south.
in 1879 and 1880 an estimated 40 000 to 60 000 african americans migrated to kansas seeking political equality freedom from violence access to education and economic opportunity.
the name participants gave to this migration the exodus derived from the biblical account of the jews how did the liberties of blacks after 1877 give way to legal segregation across the south.

those promoting the exodus including former fugitive slave benjamin pap singleton the organizer of a real estate company distributed flyers and lithographs picturing kansas as an idyllic land of rural plenty.
lacking the capital to take up farming however most black migrants ended up as unskilled laborers in towns and cities.
but few chose to return to the south.
in the words of one minister active in the movement we had rather suffer and be free despite deteriorating prospects in the south most african americans had little alternative but to stay in the region.
the real expansion of job opportunities was taking place in northern cities.
but most northern employers refused to offer jobs to blacks in the expanding industrial economy preferring to hire white migrants from rural areas and immigrants from europe.
not until the outbreak of world war i in europe in 1914 cut off immigration did northern employers open industrial jobs to blacks setting in motion the great migration discussed in chapter 19.
until then the vast majority of african americans remained in the south.
the decline of black politics neither black voting nor black officeholding came to an abrupt end in 1877.
blacks continued to cast ballots in large numbers although democrats solidified their control of state and local affairs by redrawing district lines and substituting appointive for elective officials in counties with black majorities.
a few blacks even served in congress in the 1880s and 1890s.
nonetheless political opportunities became more and more restricted.

the banner of political leadership passed to black women activists.
the national association of colored women founded in 1896 brought together local and regional womens clubs to press for both womens rights and racial uplift.
most female activists emerged from the small urban black middle class and preached the necessity of respectable behavior as part and parcel of the struggle for equal rights.
they aided poor families offered lessons in home life and childrearing and battled gambling and drinking in black communities.
some poor blacks resented middle class efforts to instruct them in proper behavior.
but by insisting on the right of black women to be considered as respectable as their white counterparts the women reformers challenged the racial ideology that consigned all blacks to the status of degraded second class citizens.
for nearly a generation after the end of reconstruction despite fraud and violence black southerners continued to cast ballots.
in some states the republican party remained competitive.
in virginia a coalition of mostly black republicans and anti redeemer democrats formed an alliance known as the readjuster movement the name derived from their plan to scale back or readjust the state debt.
they governed the state between 1879 and 1883.
tennessee and arkansas also witnessed the formation of biracial political coalitions that challenged democratic party rule.
despite the limits of the populists interracial alliance the threat of a biracial political insurgency frightened the ruling democrats and contributed greatly to the disenfranchisement movement.
in north carolina for example the end of the populistrepublican coalition government in 1898 accomplished by a violent campaign that culminated in a riot in wilmington in which scores of blacks were killed was quickly followed by the elimination of black voting.
the elimination of black voting between 1890 and 1906 every southern state enacted laws or constitutional provisions meant to eliminate the black vote.
since the fifteenth amendment prohibited the use of race as a qualification for the suffrage how were such measures even possible.
southern legislatures drafted laws that on paper appeared color blind but that were actually designed to end black voting.
the most popular devices were the poll tax a fee that each citizen had to pay in order to retain the right to vote literacy tests and the requirement that a prospective voter demonstrate to election officials an understanding of the state constitution.
six southern states also adopted a grandfather clause exempting from the new requirements descendants of persons eligible to vote before the civil war when only whites of course could cast ballots in the south.
the racial intent of the grandfather clause was so clear that the supreme court in 1915 invalidated such laws for violating the fifteenth amendment.
the other methods of limiting black voting however remained on the books.
some white leaders presented disenfranchisement as a good government measure a means of purifying politics by ending the fraud violence and manipulation of voting returns regularly used against republicans and populists.
but ultimately as a charleston newspaper declared the aim was to make clear that the white south does not desire or intend ever to include black men among its citizens democrats persistently raised the how did the liberties of blacks after 1877 give way to legal segregation across the south.
threat of negro domination to justify the denial of the right to vote.
although election officials often allowed whites who did not meet the new qualifications to register numerous poor and illiterate whites also lost the right to vote a result welcomed by many planters and urban reformers.
louisiana for example reduced the number of blacks registered to vote from 130 000 in 1894 to 1 342 a decade later.
but 80 000 white voters also lost the right.
disenfranchisement led directly to the rise of a generation of southern demagogues who mobilized white voters by extreme appeals to racism.
tom watson who as noted before had tried to forge an interracial populist coalition in the 1890s reemerged early in the twentieth century as a power in georgia public life through vicious speeches whipping up prejudice against blacks jews and catholics.
as late as 1940 only 3 percent of adult black southerners were registered to vote.
the elimination of black and many white voters which reversed the nineteenth century trend toward more inclusive suffrage could not have been accomplished without the approval of the north.
in 1891 the senate defeated a proposal for federal protection of black voting rights in the south.
apart from the grandfather clause the supreme court gave its approval to disenfranchisement laws.
according to the fourteenth amendment any state that deprived male citizens of the franchise was supposed to lose part of its representation in congress.
but like much of the constitution this provision was consistently violated so far as africanamericans were concerned.
as a result southern congressmen wielded far greater power on the national scene than their tiny electorates warranted.
as for blacks for decades thereafter they would regard the loss of suffrage as being the loss of freedom the law of segregation along with disenfranchisement the 1890s saw the widespread imposition of segregation in the south.
laws and local customs requiring the separation of the races had numerous precedents.
they had existed in many parts african americans of all ages were required to abide by segregation laws.

southern schools and many other institutions had been segregated during reconstruction.
in the 1880s however southern race relations remained unsettled.
some railroads theaters and hotels admitted blacks and whites on an equal basis while others separated them by race or excluded blacks altogether.
in 1883 in the civil rights cases the supreme court invalidated the civil rights act of 1875 which had outlawed racial discrimination by hotels theaters railroads and other public facilities.
the fourteenth amendment the court insisted prohibited unequal treatment by state authorities not private businesses.
in 1896 in the landmark decision in plessy v ferguson the court gave its approval to state laws requiring separate facilities for blacks and whites.
the case arose in louisiana where the legislature had required railroad companies to maintain a separate car or section for black passengers.
a citizens committee of black residents of new orleans came together to challenge the law.
to create a test case homer plessy a light skinned african american refused a conductors order to move to the colored only part of his railroad car and was arrested.
to argue the case before the supreme court the citizens committee hired albion w tourge who as a judge in north carolina during reconstruction had waged a courageous battle against the ku klux klan.
citizenship is national and knows no color he insisted and racial segregation violated the fourteenth amendments guarantee of equal protection before the law.
but in an 8 1 decision the court upheld the louisiana law arguing that segregated facilities did not discriminate so long as they were separate but equal the lone dissenter john marshall harlan reprimanded the majority with an oft quoted comment our constitution is color blind segregation he insisted sprang from whites conviction that they were the dominant race a phrase used by the courts majority and it violated the principle of equal liberty.
to harlan freedom for the former slaves meant the right to participate fully and equally in american society.
segregation and white domination as harlan predicted states reacted to the plessy decision by passing laws mandating racial segregation in every aspect of southern life from schools to hospitals waiting rooms toilets and cemeteries.
some states forbade taxi drivers to carry members of different races at the same time.
despite the thin disguise harlans phrase of equality required by the courts separate but equal doctrine facilities for blacks were either nonexistent or markedly inferior.
in 1900 no public high school for blacks existed in the entire south.

the point was not so much to keep the races apart as to ensure that when they came into contact with each other whether in politics labor relations or social life whites held the upper hand.
for example many blacks could be found in whites only railroad cars.
but they entered as servants and nurses not as paying customers entitled to equal treatment.
how did the liberties of blacks after 1877 give way to legal segregation across the south.
an elaborate social etiquette developed with proper behavior differentiated by race.
one sociologist who studied the turn of the century south reported that in places of business blacks had to stand back and wait until whites had been served.
they could not raise their voices or in other ways act assertively in the presence of whites and they had to give way on the streets.
in shops whites but not blacks were allowed to try on clothing.
segregation affected other groups as well as blacks.
in some parts of mississippi where chinese laborers had been brought in to work the fields after the civil war three separate school systems white black and chinese were established.
in california black hispanic and american indian children were frequently educated alongside whites but state law required separate schools for those of mongolian or chinese descent in texas and california although mexicans were legally considered white they found themselves barred from many restaurants places of entertainment and other public facilities.
the rise of ly n c h i n g those blacks who sought to challenge the system or who refused to accept the demeaning behavior that was a daily feature of southern life faced not only overwhelming political and legal power but also the threat of violent reprisal.
in every year between 1883 and 1905 more than fifty persons the vast majority of them black men were lynched in the south that is murdered by a mob.
lynching continued well into the twentieth century.
by mid century the total number of victims since 1880 had reached nearly 5 000.
some lynchings occurred secretly at night others were advertised part of the crowd of 10 000 that watched the 1893 lynching of henry smith in paris texas.
smith was accused of raping and murdering a four year old girl.
the word justice was painted on the platform.

mobs engaged in activities that shocked the civilized world.
in 1899 sam hose a plantation laborer who killed his employer in self defense was brutally murdered near newman georgia before 2 000 onlookers some of whom arrived on a special excursion train from atlanta.
a crowd including young children watched as his executioners cut off hoses ears fingers and genitals burned him alive and then fought over pieces of his bones as souvenirs.
law enforcement authorities made no effort to prevent the lynching or to bring those who committed the crime to justice.
like many victims of lynchings hose was accused after his death of having raped a white woman.
many white southerners considered preserving the purity of white womanhood a justification for extralegal vengeance.
yet in nearly all cases as activist ida b.
wells argued in a newspaper editorial after a memphis lynching in 1892 the charge of rape was a bare lie born a slave in mississippi in 1862 wells had become a schoolteacher and editor.
her essay condemning the lynching of three black men in memphis led a mob to destroy her newspaper the memphis free press while she was out of the city.
wells moved to the north where she became the nations leading antilynching crusader.
she bluntly insisted that given the conditions of southern blacks the united states had no right to call itself the land of the free although many countries have witnessed outbreaks of violence against minority racial ethnic or religious groups widespread lynching of individuals over so long a period was a phenomenon unknown elsewhere.
canada for example has experienced only one lynching in its history in 1884 when a mob from the united states crossed the border into british columbia to lynch an indian teenager who had fled after being accused of murder.

two americas the politics of memory as the white north and south moved toward reconciliation in the 1880s and 1890s one cost was the abandonment of the dream of racial equality spawned by the civil war and written into the laws and constitution during reconstruction.
in popular literature and memoirs by participants at veterans reunions and in public memorials the civil war came to be remembered as a tragic family quarrel among white americans in which blacks had played no significant part.
it was a war of brother against brother in which both sides fought gallantly for noble causes local rights on the part of the south preservation of the union for the north.
slavery increasingly came to be viewed as a minor issue not the wars fundamental cause and reconstruction as a regrettable period of negro rule when former slaves how did the liberties of blacks after 1877 give way to legal segregation across the south.
had power thrust upon them by a vindictive north.
this outlook gave legitimacy to southern efforts to eliminate black voting lest the region once again suffer the alleged horrors of reconstruction.
southern governments erected monuments to the lost cause school history textbooks emphasized happy slaves and the evils of reconstruction and the role of black soldiers in winning the war was all but forgotten.
in fact when a group of black veterans attempted to participate in a florida ceremony commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the civil war in 1911 a white mob tore the military insignias off their jackets and drove them away.
r e d r aw i n g t h e b o u n da r i e s the effective nullification of the laws and amendments of reconstruction and the reduction of blacks to the position of second class citizens reflected nationwide patterns of thought and policy.
as the nineteenth century drew to a close american society seemed to be fracturing along lines of both class and race.
the result commented economist simon patten was a widespread obsession with redrawing the boundary of freedom by identifying and excluding those unworthy of the blessings of liberty.
the south he wrote has its negro the city has its slums.
the friends of american institutions fear the ignorant immigrant and the workingman dislikes the chinese as patten suggested many americans embraced a more and more restricted definition of nationhood.
the new exclusiveness was evident in the pages of popular periodicals filled with derogatory imagery depicting blacks and other lesser groups as little more than savages and criminals incapable of partaking in american freedom.

17 freedoms boundaries at home and abroad 1890 1900 the new immigration redrawing the boundaries and the new nativism the 1890s witnessed a major shift in the sources of immigration to the united states.
despite the prolonged depression 3 5 million newcomers entered the united states during the decade seeking jobs in the industrial centers of the north and midwest.
over half arrived not from ireland england germany and scandinavia the traditional sources of immigration but from southern and eastern europe especially italy and the russian and austro hungarian empires.
the new immigrants were widely described by native born americans as members of distinct races whose lower level of civilization explained everything from their willingness to work for substandard wages to their supposed inborn tendency toward criminal behavior.
they were beaten men from beaten races wrote economist francis amasa walker representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence american cities said an ohio newspaper were being overrun by foreigners who have no true appreciation of the meaning of liberty and therefore posed a danger to democratic government.
founded in 1894 by a group of boston professionals the immigration restriction league called for reducing immigration by barring the illiterate from entering the united states.
such a measure was adopted by congress early in 1897 but was vetoed by president cleveland.
like the south northern and western states experimented with ways to eliminate undesirable voters.
nearly all the states during the 1890s adopted the secret or australian ballot meant both to protect voters privacy and to limit the participation of illiterates who could no longer receive help from party officials at polling places.
several states ended the nineteenth century practice of allowing immigrants to vote before becoming citizens and adopted stringent new residency and literacy requirements.
none of these measures approached the scope of black disenfranchisement in the south or the continued denial of voting rights to women.
but suffrage throughout the country was increasingly becoming a privilege not a right.

between 1850 and 1870 nearly all chinese immigrants had been unattached men brought in by labor contractors to work in western gold fields railroad construction and factories.
in the early 1870s entire chinese families began to immigrate leading congress in 1875 to exclude chinese women from entering the country.

congress renewed the restriction ten years later and made it permanent in 1902.
at the time of exclusion 105 000 persons of chinese descent lived in the united states.
nearly all of them resided on the west coast where they suffered intense discrimination and periodic mob violence.
in the latenineteenth century west thousands of chinese immigrants were expelled from towns and mining camps and mobs assaulted chinese residences and businesses.
drawing on the legislation of the reconstruction era chinese victims sued local governments for redress when their rights were violated and petitioned congress for indemnity.
their demands for equal rights forced the state and federal courts to define the reach of the fourteenth amendment.
for example between 1871 and 1885 san francisco provided no public education for chinese children.
in 1885 the california supreme court in tape v hurley ordered the city to admit chinese students to public schools.
the state legislature responded by passing a law authorizing segregated education and the city established a school for chinese.

in 1904 the court cited fong yue ting in upholding a law barring anarchists from entering the united states demonstrating how restrictions on the rights of one group can become a precedent for infringing on the rights of others.
exclusion profoundly shaped the experience of chinese americans long stigmatizing them as incapable of assimilation and justifying their isolation from mainstream society.
congress for the first time also barred groups of whites from entering the country beginning in 1875 with prostitutes and convicted felons and in 1882 adding lunatics and those likely to become a public charge are we still a place of refuge for the oppressed of all nations wondered james b weaver the populist candidate for president in 1892.
the emergence of booker t washington the social movements that had helped to expand the nineteenth century boundaries of freedom now redefined their objectives so that they might be realized within the new economic and intellectual framework.
prominent black leaders for example took to emphasizing economic self help and individual advancement into the middle class as an alternative to political agitation.
symbolizing the change was the juxtaposition in 1895 of the death of frederick douglass with booker t washingtons widely praised speech at the atlanta cotton exposition that urged blacks to adjust to segregation and abandon agitation for civil and political rights.
born a slave in 1856 washington had studied as a young man at hampton institute virginia.
he adopted the outlook of hamptons founder general samuel armstrong who emphasized that obtaining farms or skilled jobs was far more important to african americans emerging from slavery than the rights of citizenship.
washington put this view into practice when he became head of tuskegee institute in alabama a center for vocational education education focused on training for a job rather than broad learning.
in his atlanta speech washington repudiated the abolitionist tradition that stressed ceaseless agitation for full equality.
he urged blacks not to try to combat segregation in all the things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress washington advised his people to seek the assistance of white employers who in a land racked by labor turmoil would prefer a docile dependable black labor force to unionized whites.
washingtons ascendancy rested in large part on his success in channeling aid from wealthy northern whites to tuskegee and to black politicians and newspapers who backed his program.
but his support in the black community also arose from a widespread sense that in the world of the late nineteenth century frontal in what ways did the boundaries of american freedom grow narrower in this period.
assaults on white power were impossible and that blacks should concentrate on building up their segregated communities.
the rise of the afl within the labor movement the demise of the knights of labor and the ascendancy of the american federation of labor afl during the 1890s reflected a similar shift away from a broadly reformist past to more limited goals.
as the homestead and pullman strikes demonstrated direct confrontations with the large corporations were likely to prove suicidal.
unions declared samuel gompers the afls founder and longtime president should not seek economic independence pursue the knights utopian dream of creating a cooperative commonwealth or form independent parties with the aim of achieving power in government.
rather the labor movement should devote itself to negotiating with employers for higher wages and better working conditions for its members.
like washington gompers spoke the language of the eras business culture.
indeed the afl policies he pioneered were known as business unionism gompers embraced the idea of freedom of contract shrewdly turning it into an argument against interference by judges with workers right to organize unions.
during the 1890s union membership rebounded from its decline in the late 1880s.
but at the same time the labor movement became less and less inclusive.
abandoning the knights ideal of labor solidarity the afl restricted membership to skilled workers a small minority of the labor force effectively excluding the vast majority of unskilled workers and therefore nearly all blacks women and new european immigrants.
afl membership centered on sectors of the economy like printing and building construction that were dominated by small competitive businesses with workers who frequently were united by craft skill and ethnic background.
afl unions had little presence in basic industries like steel and rubber or in the large scale factories that now dominated the economy.
the womens era changes in the womens movement reflected the same combination of expanding activities and narrowing boundaries.
the 1890s launched what would later be called the womens era three decades during which women although still denied the vote enjoyed larger opportunities than in the past for economic independence and played a greater and greater role in public life.
by now nearly every state had adopted laws giving married women control over their own wages and property and the right to sign separate contracts and make separate wills.
nearly 5 million women worked for wages in 1900.
although most were young unmarried and concentrated in traditional jobs such as domestic service and the garment industry a generation of college educated women was beginning to take its place in better paying clerical and professional positions.
through a network of womens clubs temperance associations and social reform organizations women exerted a growing influence on public affairs.
founded in 1874 the womens christian temperance union wctu grew to become the eras largest female organization with a womans holy war a lithograph from 1874 the year the womens christian temperance union was founded portrays an advocate of prohibition as an armed crusader against hard liquor.

they in turn are flanked by utah and wyoming which as territories had been the first parts of the united states to give women the right to vote.
although the image might lead viewers to assume that stanton and anthony had joined washington in heaven they were both still alive in 1896 membership by 1890 of 150 000.
under the banner of home protection it moved from demanding the prohibition of alcoholic beverages blamed for leading men to squander their wages on drink and treat their wives abusively to a comprehensive program of economic and political reform including the right to vote.
women insisted frances willard the groups president must abandon the idea that weakness and dependence were their nature and join assertively in movements to change society.
a wider freedom is coming to the women of america she declared in an 1895 speech to male and female strikers in a massachusetts shoe factory.
too long has it been held that woman has no right to enter these movements.
so much for the movements.
politics is the place for woman at the same time the center of gravity of feminism shifted toward an outlook more in keeping with prevailing racial and ethnic norms.
the earlier feminism of equal rights which claimed the ballot as part of a larger transformation of womens status was never fully repudiated.
the movement continued to argue for womens equality in employment education and politics.
but with increasing frequency the native born middle class women who dominated the suffrage movement claimed the vote as educated members of a superior race in what ways did the boundaries of american freedom grow narrower in this period.
a new generation of suffrage leaders suggested that educational and other voting qualifications did not conflict with the movements aims so long as they applied equally to men and women.
immigrants and former slaves had been enfranchised with ill advised haste declared carrie chapman catt president of the national american woman suffrage association created in 1890 to reunite the rival suffrage organizations formed after the civil war.
indeed catt suggested extending the vote to native born white women would help to counteract the growing power of the ignorant foreign vote in the north and the dangerous potential for a second reconstruction in the south.
elitism within the movement was reinforced when many advocates of suffrage blamed the slum vote for the defeat of a womens suffrage referendum in california.
in 1895 the same year that booker t washington delivered his atlanta address the national american woman suffrage association held its annual convention in that segregated city.
like other american institutions the organized movement for womens suffrage had made its peace with nativism and racism.
becoming a world power the new imperialism in the last years of the 1890s the narrowed definition of nationhood was projected abroad as the united states took its place as an imperial power on the international stage.
in world history the last quarter of the nineteenth century is known as the age of imperialism when rival european empires carved up large parts of the world among themselves.
for most of this period the united states remained a second rate power.
in 1880 the sultan of turkey decided to close three foreign embassies to reduce expenses.
he chose those in sweden belgium and the united states.
in that year the american navy was smaller than denmarks or chiles.
when european powers met at the berlin congress of 1884 1885 to divide most of africa among themselves the united states attended because of its relationship with liberia but did not sign the final agreement.
throughout the nineteenth century large empires dominated much of the globe.
some were land based like the russian ottoman and chinese empires and others included territories on several continents linked by sea such as the british french and spanish.
after 1870 a new imperialism arose dominated by european powers and japan.
belgium great britain and france consolidated their hold on colonies in africa and newly unified germany acquired colonies there as well.
the british and russians sought to increase their influence in central asia and all the european powers struggled to dominate parts of china.
by the early twentieth century most of asia africa the middle east and the pacific had been divided among these empires.
the justification for this expansion of imperial power was that it would bring modern civilization to the supposedly backward peoples of the non european world.
the natives according to their colonial occupiers would be instructed in western values labor practices and the christian religion.
eventually they would be accorded the right of self government although no one could be sure how long this would take.

17 freedoms boundaries at home and abroad 1890 1900 american becoming a world power expansionism territorial expansion of course had been a feature of american life from well before independence.
but the 1890s marked a major turning point in americas relationship with the rest of the world.
americans were increasingly aware of themselves as an emerging world power.
we are a great imperial republic destined to exercise a controlling influence upon the actions of mankind and to affect the future of the world proclaimed henry watterson an influential newspaper editor.
until the 1890s american expansion had taken place on the north american continent.
ever since the monroe doctrine see chapter 10 to be sure many americans had considered the western hemisphere an american sphere of influence.
there was persistent talk of acquiring cuba and president grant had sought to annex the dominican republic only to see the senate reject the idea.
the last territorial acquisition before the 1890s had been alaska purchased from russia by secretary of state william h seward in 1867 to much derision from those who could not see the purpose of american ownership of sewards icebox seward however was mostly interested in the aleutian islands a part of alaska that stretched much of the way to asia see the map on p 711 and that he believed could be the site of coaling stations for merchant ships plying the pacific.
most americans who looked overseas were interested in expanded trade not territorial possessions.
the countrys agricultural and industrial production could no longer be entirely absorbed at home.
by 1890 companies like singer sewing machines and john d rockefellers standard oil company aggressively marketed their products abroad.
especially during economic downturns business leaders insisted on the necessity of greater access to foreign customers.
the lure of empire one group of americans who spread the nations influence overseas were religious missionaries thousands of whom ventured abroad in the late nineteenth century to spread christianity prepare the world for the second coming of christ and uplift the poor.
inspired by dwight moody a methodist evangelist the student volunteer movement for foreign missions sent more than 8 000 missionaries to bring light to heathen worlds across the globe.
missionary work offered employment to those with few opportunities at home including blacks and women who made up a majority of the total.
a small group of late nineteenth century thinkers actively promoted american expansionism warning that the country must not allow itself to be shut out of the scramble for empire.
in our country 1885 josiah strong a prominent congregationalist clergyman sought to update the idea of manifest destiny.
having demonstrated their special aptitude for liberty and self government on the north american continent strong announced anglo saxons should now spread their institutions and values to inferior races throughout the world.
the economy would benefit he insisted since one means of civilizing savages was to turn them into consumers of american goods.
how did the united states emerge as an imperial power in the 1890s.
naval officer alfred t mahan in the influence of sea power upon history 1890 argued that no nation could prosper without a large fleet of ships engaged in international trade protected by a powerful navy operating from overseas bases.
mahan published his book in the same year that the census bureau announced that there was no longer a clear line separating settled from unsettled land.
thus the frontier no longer existed.
americans wrote mahan must now begin to look outward his arguments influenced the outlook of james g blaine who served as secretary of state during benjamin harrisons presidency 1889 1893.
blaine urged the president to try to acquire hawaii puerto rico and cuba as strategic naval bases.
although independent hawaii was already closely tied to the united states through treaties that exempted imports of its sugar from tariff duties and provided for the establishment of an american naval base at pearl harbor.
hawaiis economy was dominated by american owned sugar plantations that employed a workforce of native islanders and chinese japanese and filipino laborers under long term contracts.
early in 1893 a group of american planters organized a rebellion that overthrew the hawaii government of queen liliuokalani.
on the eve of leaving office harrison submitted a treaty of annexation to the senate.
after determining that a majority of hawaiians did not favor the treaty harrisons successor grover cleveland withdrew it.
in july 1898 in the midst of the spanish american war the united states finally annexed the hawaiian islands.
in 1993 the u s congress passed and president bill clinton signed a resolution expressing regret to native hawaiians for the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii.
with the participation of agents and citizens of the united states the depression that began in 1893 heightened the belief that a more aggressive foreign policy was necessary to stimulate american exports.
fears of economic and ethnic disunity fueled an assertive nationalism.
in the face of social conflict and the new immigration government and private organizations in the 1890s promoted a unifying patriotism.
these were the years when rituals like the pledge of allegiance and the practice of standing for the playing of the star spangled banner came into existence.
americans had long honored the stars and stripes but the cult of the flag including an official flag day dates to the 1890s.
new mass circulation newspapers also promoted nationalistic sentiments.
by the late 1890s papers like william randolph hearsts new york journal and joseph pulitzers new york world dubbed the yellow press by their critics after the color in which hearst printed a popular comic strip were selling a million copies each day by mixing sensational accounts of crime and political corruption with aggressive appeals to patriotic sentiments.
the splendid little war all these factors contributed to americas emergence as a world power in the spanish american war of 1898.
but the immediate origins of the war lay not at home but in the long cuban struggle for independence from spain.
ten years of guerrilla war had followed a cuban revolt in 1868.
the movement for independence resumed in 1895.
as reports circulated of widespread suffering caused by the spanish policy of rounding up civilians and moving them into detention camps the cuban struggle won growing support in the united states.

the yellow press blamed spain and insisted on retribution.
after spain rejected an american demand for a cease fire on the island and eventual cuban independence president mckinley in april asked congress for a declaration of war.
the purpose declared senator henry teller of colorado was to aid cuban patriots in their struggle for liberty and freedom to underscore the governments humanitarian intentions congress adopted the teller amendment stating that the united states had no intention of annexing or dominating the island.
secretary of state john hay called the spanish american conflict a splendid little war it lasted only four months and resulted in fewer than 400 american combat deaths.
having shown little interest in imperial expansion before 1898 mckinley now embraced the idea.
the wars most decisive engagement in fact took place not in cuba but at manila bay a strategic harbor in the philippine islands in the distant pacific ocean.
here on may 1 the american navy under admiral george dewey defeated a spanish fleet.
soon afterward soldiers went ashore becoming the first american army units to engage in combat outside the western hemisphere.
july witnessed another naval victory off santiago cuba and the landing of american troops on cuba and puerto rico.
r o o s e v e lt at san juan hill the most highly publicized land battle of the war took place in cuba.
this was the charge up san juan hill outside santiago by theodore roosevelts how did the united states emerge as an imperial power in the 1890s.
rough riders.
an ardent expansionist roosevelt had long believed that a war would reinvigorate the nations unity and sense of manhood which had suffered he felt during the 1890s.
a few months shy of his fortieth birthday when war broke out roosevelt resigned his post as assistant secretary of the navy to raise a volunteer cavalry unit which rushed to cuba to participate in the fighting.
roosevelt envisioned his unit as a cross section of american society and enrolled athletes from ivy league colleges western cowboys representatives of various immigrant groups and even some american indians.
but with the army still segregated he excluded blacks from his regiment.
ironically when the rough riders reached the top of san juan hill they found that black units had preceded them a fact roosevelt omitted in his reports of the battle which were widely reproduced in the popular press.
his heroic exploits made roosevelt a national hero.
he was elected governor of new york that fall and in 1900 became mckinleys vice president.
an american empire with the backing of the yellow press the war quickly escalated from a crusade to aid the suffering cubans to an imperial venture that ended with the united states in possession of a small overseas empire.
mckinley became convinced that the united states could neither return the philippines to spain nor grant them independence for which he believed the inhabitants unprepared.
in an interview with a group of methodist ministers the president spoke of receiving a divine revelation that americans had a duty to uplift and civilize the filipino people and to train them for self government.
in the treaty with spain that ended the war the united states acquired the philippines puerto rico and the pacific island of guam.
as for cuba before recognizing its independence mckinley forced the islands new government to approve the platt amendment to the new cuban constitution drafted by senator orville h platt of connecticut which authorized the united states to charge of the rough riders at san juan hill a painting by frederic remington depicts the celebrated unit commanded by theodore roosevelt in action in cuba during the spanishamerican war of 1898.

the united states also acquired a permanent lease on naval stations in cuba including what is now the facility at guantnamo bay.
the platt amendment passed the cuban congress by a single vote.
cuban patriots were terribly disappointed.
jos mart had fomented revolution in cuba from exile in the united states and then traveled to the island to take part in the uprising only to be killed in a battle with spanish soldiers in 1895.
to change masters is not to be free mart had written.
and the memory of the betrayal of 1898 would help to inspire another cuban revolution half a century later.
american interest in its new possessions had more to do with trade than gaining wealth from natural resources or large scale american settlement.
puerto rico and cuba were gateways to latin america strategic outposts from which american naval and commercial power could be projected throughout the hemisphere.

philippine war many cubans filipinos and puerto ricans had welcomed american intervention as a way of breaking spains long hold on these colonies.
large planters looked forward to greater access to american markets and local elites hoped that the american presence would fend off radical changes proposed by rebellious nationalist movements.
nationalists and labor leaders admired americas democratic ideals and believed that american participation in the destruction of spanish rule would lead to social reform and political self government.
but the american determination to exercise continued control direct or indirect led to a rapid change in local opinion nowhere more so than in the philippines.
filipinos had been fighting a war against spain since 1896.
after deweys victory at manila bay their leader emilio aguinaldo established a provisional government with a constitution modeled on that of the united states.
but once mckinley decided to retain possession of the islands the filipino movement turned against the united states.
the result was a second war far longer it lasted from 1899 to 1903 and bloodier it cost the lives of well more than 100 000 how did the united states emerge as an imperial power in the 1890s.

at the time however it was closely followed and widely debated in the united states.
press reports of atrocities committed by american troops the burning of villages torture of prisoners of war and rape and execution of civilians tarnished the nations self image as liberators.
we do not intend to free the people of the philippines complained mark twain.
we have gone there to conquer the mckinley administration justified its policies on the grounds that its aim was to uplift and civilize and christianize the filipinos although most residents of the islands were already roman catholics.
william howard taft who became governor general of the philippines in 1901 believed it might take a century to raise filipinos to the condition where they could appreciate what anglo saxon liberty is once in control of the philippines the colonial administration took seriously the idea of modernizing the islands.
it expanded railroads and united states territory as a result of the spanish american war the united states became the ruler of a farflung overseas empire.

then luzon then other islands perhaps also.
i walked the floor of the white house night after night until as being in the best interests of americans and midnight and i am not ashamed to tell you gentlemen that i went down on my knees and prayed to almighty god for light and guidance more than one filipinos.
and one night late it came to me this way mckinley offered a defense of american empire before you go i would like to say just a word about the philippine business.
i have been criticized a good deal about the philippines but dont deserve it.
the truth is i didnt want the philippines and when they came to us as a gift from the gods i did not know what to do with them.
when the spanish war broke out admiral dewey was at hong kong and i ordered him to go to manila and to capture or destroy the spanish fleet and he had to because if defeated he had no place to refit on that side of the globe and if the dons spanish were victorious they would likely cross the pacific and ravage our oregon and california coasts.
and so he had to destroy the spanish fleet and did it.
but that was as far as i thought then.
when i next realized that the philippines had dropped into our laps i confess i did not know what to do with them.
i sought counsel from all sides democrats as well as republicans but got little help.
i thought first we would take only manila i dont know how it was but it came 1 that we could not give them back to spain that would be cowardly and dishonorable 2 that we could not turn them over to france and germany our commercial rivals in the orient that would be bad business and discreditable 3 that we could not leave them to themselves they were unfit for self government and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there worse than spains was and 4 that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all and to educate the filipinos and uplift and civilize and christianize them and by gods grace do the very best we could by them as our fellow men for whom christ also died.
and then i went to bed and went to sleep and slept soundly and the next morning i sent for the chief engineer of the war department our map maker and i told him to put the philippines on the map of the united states pointing to a large map on the wall of his office and there they are and there they will stay while i am president.
f r o m a g u i n a l d o s c a s e a g a i n s t the united states 1899 emilio aguinaldo who led the filipino armed struggle for independence against spain and then another war against the united states when president mckinley decided to annex the philippines explained his reasons for opposing american imperialism in an article in the widely read magazine the north american review.
he contrasted american traditions of selfgovernment with the refusal to grant this right rebels against the english government if you could govern yourselves.
now the moral of all this obviously is give us the chance treat us exactly as you demanded to be treated at the hands of england when you rebelled against her autocratic methods.
now here is a unique spectacle the filipinos fighting for liberty the american people fighting them to give them liberty.
you entered into an alliance with our chiefs at hong kong and at singapore and you promised us your aid and protection in our attempt to form a government on to the philippines.

in the face of the world you emblazon humanity and liberty upon your standard while you cast your political constitution to the winds and attempt to trample down and exterminate a brave people whose only crime is that they are you have been deceived all along the line.
you have been greatly deceived in the personality of my countrymen.
you went to the philippines under the fighting for their liberty.
impression that their inhabitants were ignorant savages.
we have been represented by your popular press as if we were africans or mohawk indians.
you repeat constantly the dictum that we cannot govern ourselves.
with equal reason you might have said the same thing some fifty or sixty years questions ago of japan and little over a hundred years ago it was extremely questionable when you also were 1.
how persuasive is mckinleys account of how and why he decided to annex the philippines.

the united states said president mckinley had an obligation to its little brown brothers yet in all the new possessions american policies tended to serve the interests of land based local elites native born landowners in the philippines american sugar planters in hawaii and puerto rico and such policies bequeathed enduring poverty to the majority of the rural population.

american rule also brought with it american racial attitudes.
in an 1899 poem the british writer rudyard kipling urged the united states to take up the white mans burden of imperialism.
american proponents of empire agreed that the domination of non white peoples by whites formed part of the progress of civilization.
among the soldiers sent to the philippines to fight aguinaldo were a number of black regiments.
their letters from the front suggested that american atrocities arose from white troops applying to the filipino population the same treatment for colored peoples practiced at home.
is america any better than spain wondered george w prioleau a black cavalryman who had fought at san juan hill.
americas triumphant entry into the ranks of imperial powers sparked an intense debate over the relationship among political democracy race and american citizenship.
the american system of government had no provision for permanent colonies.
the right of every people to self government was one of the main principles of the declaration of independence.
the idea of an empire of liberty assumed that new territories would eventually be admitted as equal states and their residents would be american citizens.
in the aftermath of the spanish american war however nationalism democracy and american freedom emerged more closely identified than ever with notions of anglo saxon superiority.
leaders of both parties while determined to retain the new overseas possessions feared that people of what one congressman called an alien race and foreign tongue could not be incorporated into the union.
the foraker act of 1900 declared puerto rico an insular territory different from previous territories in the west.
its 1 million inhabitants were defined as citizens of puerto rico not the united states and denied a future path to statehood.
filipinos occupied a similar status.
in a series of cases decided between 1901 and 1904 and known collectively as the insular cases the supreme court held that the constitution did not fully apply to the territories recently acquired by the united states a significant limitation of the scope of american freedom.
congress the court how did the united states emerge as an imperial power in the 1890s.
declared must recognize the fundamental personal rights of residents of the philippines and puerto rico.
but otherwise it could govern them as it saw fit for an indefinite period of time.
thus two principles central to american freedom since the war of independence no taxation without representation and government based on the consent of the governed were abandoned when it came to the nations new possessions.
in the twentieth century the territories acquired in 1898 would follow different paths.
hawaii which had a sizable population of american missionaries and planters became a traditional territory.
its population except for asian immigrant laborers became american citizens and it was admitted as a state in 1959.
after nearly a half century of american rule the philippines achieved independence in 1946.
until 1950 the u s navy administered guam which remains today an unincorporated territory.
as for puerto rico it is sometimes called the worlds oldest colony because ever since the spanish conquered the island in 1493 it has lacked full self government.
congress extended american citizenship to puerto ricans in 1917.
puerto rico today remains in a kind of political limbo poised on the brink of statehood or independence.
the island has the status of a commonwealth.
it elects its own government but lacks a voice in congress and in the election of the u s president and key issues such as defense and environmental policy are controlled by the united states.
drawing the global color line just as american ideas about liberty and self government had circulated around the world in the age of revolution american racial attitudes had a global impact in the age of empire.
the turn of the twentieth century was a time of worldwide concern about immigration race relations and the white mans burden all of which inspired a global sense of fraternity some of the 1 200 filipinos exhibited at the 1904 louisiana purchase exposition in st louis.
the federal government displayed the filipinos in a native setting in order to win public support for the annexation of the philippines.

chinese exclusion in the united states strongly influenced anti chinese laws adopted in canada and american segregation and disenfranchisement became models for australia and south africa as they formed new governments they read in particular the proceedings of the mississippi constitutional convention of 1890 which pioneered ways to eliminate black voting rights.
one lesson these countries learned from the united states was that the failure of reconstruction demonstrated the impossibility of multiracial democracy.
the extremely hostile account of reconstruction by the british writer james bryce in his widely read book the american commonwealth published in london in 1888 circulated around the world.
bryce called african americans children of nature and insisted that giving them the right to vote had been a terrible mistake which had produced all kinds of corruption and misgovernment.
his book was frequently cited by the founders of the australian commonwealth 1901 to justify their white australia policy which barred the further immigration of asians.
the union of south africa inaugurated in 1911 saw its own policy of racial separation later known as apartheid as following in the footsteps of segregation in the united states.
south africa however went much further enacting laws that limited skilled jobs to whites and dividing the country into areas where black africans could and could not live.
even american proposals that did not become law such as the literacy test for immigrants vetoed by president cleveland influenced measures adopted overseas.
the united states too learned from other countries.
the gentlemans agreement that limited japanese immigration early in the twentieth century see chapter 19 followed a similar arrangement between japan and canada.
how did the united states emerge as an imperial power in the 1890s.
republic or empire the emergence of the united states as an imperial power sparked intense debate.
opponents formed the anti imperialist league.
it united writers and social reformers who believed american energies should be directed at home businessmen fearful of the cost of maintaining overseas outposts and racists who did not wish to bring non white populations into the united states.
among its prominent members were e l godkin the editor of the nation the novelist william dean howells and the labor leader george e mcneill.
the league held meetings throughout the country and published pamphlets called liberty tracts warning that empire was incompatible with democracy.
americas historic mission the league declared was to help the world by an example of successful self government not to conquer other peoples.
a republic of free men anti imperialists proclaimed should assist the people of puerto rico and the philippines in their own struggles for liberty rather than subjecting them to colonial rule.
in 1900 democrats again nominated william jennings bryan to run against mckinley.
the democratic platform opposed the philippine war for placing the united states in the un american position of crushing with military force another peoples desire for liberty and self government george s boutwell president of the anti imperialist league declared that the most pressing question in the election was the nations future character republic or empire but without any sense of contradiction proponents of an imperial foreign policy also adopted the language of freedom.
anti imperialists were the real infidels to the gospel of liberty claimed senator albert beveridge of indiana because america ventured abroad not for material gain or national power but to bring a new day of freedom to the peoples of the world.
americas was a benevolent imperialism rooted in a national mission to uplift backward cultures and spread liberty across the globe.
beveridge did not however neglect more practical considerations.
american trade he insisted henceforth must be with asia.
the pacific is our ocean.
where shall we turn for consumers of our surplus.
geography answers the question.
china is our natural customer and the philippines held the key to the commercial situation of the entire east riding the wave of patriotic sentiment inspired by the war and with the economy having recovered from the depression of 1893 1897 mckinley in 1900 repeated his 1896 triumph.
at the dawn of the twentieth century the united states seemed poised to take its place among the worlds great powers.
writers at home and overseas confidently predicted that american influence would soon span the globe.
in his 1902 book the new empire brooks adams a grandson of john quincy adams predicted that because of its economic power the united states would soon outweigh any single empire if not all empires combined years would pass before this prediction was fulfilled.
but in 1900 many features that would mark american life for much of the twentieth century were already apparent.
the united states had surpassed britain france and germany in industrial production.
the merger movement of 1897 1904 discussed in the previous chapter left broad sections of the economy under the control of giant corporations.

l i t was late afternoon on march 25 1911 when fire broke out at the triangle shirtwaist company.
the factory occupied the top three floors of a ten story building in the greenwich village neighborhood of new york city.
here some 500 workers mostly young jewish and italian immigrant women toiled at sewing machines producing ladies blouses some earning as little as three dollars per week.
those who tried to escape the blaze discovered that the doors to the stairwell had been locked the owners way it was later charged of discouraging theft and unauthorized bathroom breaks.
the fire department rushed to the scene with high pressure hoses.
but their ladders reached only to the sixth floor.
as the fire raged onlookers watched in horror as girls leapt from the upper stories.
by the time the blaze had been put out 46 bodies lay on the street and 100 more were found inside the building.
the triangle shirtwaist company was typical of manufacturing in the nations largest city a beehive of industrial production in small crowded factories.
new york was home to 30 000 manufacturing establishments with more than 600 000 employees more industrial workers than the entire state of massachusetts.
triangle had already played a key role in the eras labor history.
when 200 of its workers tried to join the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu the owners responded by firing them.
this incident helped to spark a general walkout of female garment workers in 1909 the uprising of the 20 000.
among the strikers demands was better safety in clothing factories.
the impoverished immigrants forged an alliance with middle and upper class female supporters including members of the womens trade union league which had been founded in 1903 to help bring women workers into unions.
alva belmont the ex wife of railroad magnate william vanderbilt contributed several of her cars to a parade in support of the striking workers.
by the time the walkout ended early in 1911 the ilgwu had won union contracts with more than 300 firms.
but the triangle shirtwaist company was not among them.
the triangle fire was not the worst fire disaster in american history seven years earlier over 1 000 people had died in a blaze on the general slocum excursion boat in new york harbor.
but it had an unrivaled impact on public consciousness.
more than twenty years later franklin d roosevelt would refer to it in a press conference as an example of why the government needed to regulate industry.
in its wake efforts to organize the citys workers accelerated and the state legislature passed new factory inspection laws and fire safety codes.
triangle focused attention on the social divisions that plagued american society during the first two decades of the twentieth century a period known as the progressive era.
these were years when economic expansion produced millions of new jobs and brought an unprecedented array of goods within reach of american consumers.
cities expanded rapidly by 1920 for the first time more americans lived in towns and why was the city such a central element in progressive america.
policemen stare up as the triangle fire of 1911 rages while the bodies of factory workers who plunged to their deaths to escape the blaze lie on the sidewalk.
cities than in rural areas.
yet severe inequality remained the most visible feature of the urban landscape and persistent labor strife raised anew the question of governments role in combating social inequality.
the fire and its aftermath also highlighted how traditional gender roles were changing as women took on new responsibilities in the workplace and in the making of public policy.
the word progressive came into common use around 1910 as a way of describing a broad loosely defined political movement of individuals and groups who hoped to bring about significant change in american social and political life.
progressives included forward looking businessmen who realized that workers must be accorded a voice in economic decision making and labor activists bent on empowering industrial workers.
other major contributors to progressivism were members of female reform organizations who hoped to protect women and children from exploitation social scientists who believed that academic research would help to solve social problems and members of an anxious middle class who feared that their status was threatened by the rise of big business.
everywhere in early twentieth century america the signs of economic and political consolidation were apparent in the power of a small directorate of wall street bankers and corporate executives the manipulation of democracy by corrupt political machines and the rise of new systems of managerial control in workplaces.
in these circumstances wrote benjamin p dewitt in his 1915 book the progressive movement the individual could not hope to compete.
slowly americans realized that they were not free as this and the following chapter will discuss progressive reformers responded to the perception of declining freedom in varied contradictory ways.
the era saw the expansion of political and economic freedom ch.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 an urban age and a consumer society through the reinvigoration of the movement for woman suffrage the use of political power to expand workers rights and efforts to improve democratic government by weakening the power of city bosses and giving ordinary citizens more influence on legislation.
it witnessed the flowering of understandings of freedom based on individual fulfillment and personal self determination the ability to participate fully in the ever expanding consumer marketplace and especially for women to enjoy economic and sexual freedoms long considered the province of men.
at the same time many progressives supported efforts to limit the full enjoyment of freedom to those deemed fit to exercise it properly.
the new system of white supremacy born in the 1890s became fully consolidated in the south.
growing numbers of native born americans demanded that immigrants abandon their traditional cultures and become fully americanized and efforts were made at the local and national levels to place political decision making in the hands of experts who did not have to answer to the electorate.
even as the idea of freedom expanded freedoms boundaries contracted in progressive america.
city of ambition 1910 by the photographer alfred stieglitz captures the stark beauty of new york citys new skyscrapers.
an urban age and a consumer society fa r m s and cities the progressive era was a period of explosive economic growth fueled by increasing industrial production a rapid rise in population and the continued expansion of the consumer marketplace.
in the first decade of the twentieth century the economys total output rose by about 85 percent.
for the last time in american history farms and cities grew together.
as farm prices recovered from their low point during the depression of the 1890s american agriculture entered what would later be remembered as its golden age the expansion of urban areas stimulated demand for farm goods.
farm families poured into the western great plains.

a new generation of journalists writing for mass circulation national magazines exposed the ills of industrial and urban life.
the shame of the cities by lincoln steffens published as a series in mcclures magazine in 1901 1902 and in book form in 1904 showed how party bosses and business leaders profited from political corruption.
mcclures also hired ida tarbell to expose the arrogance and economic machinations of john d rockefellers standard oil company.
published in two volumes in 1904 her history of the standard oil company was the most substantial product of what theodore roosevelt disparaged as muckraking the use of journalistic skills to expose the underside of american life.
major novelists of the era took a similar unsparing approach to social ills.
theodore dreisers sister carrie 1900 traced a hopeful young womans descent into prostitution in chicagos harsh urban environment.
perhaps the eras most influential novel was upton sinclairs the jungle 1906 whose description of unsanitary slaughterhouses and the sale of rotten meat stirred public outrage and led directly to the passage of the pure food and drug act and the meat inspection act of 1906.
immigration as a global process if one thing characterized early twentieth century cities it was their immigrant character.
the new immigration from southern and eastern europe why was the city such a central element in progressive america.
discussed in chapter 17 had begun around 1890 but reached its peak during the progressive era.
between 1901 and the outbreak of world war i in europe in 1914 some 13 million immigrants came to the united states the majority from italy russia and the austro hungarian empire.
in fact progressive era immigration formed part of a larger process of worldwide migration set in motion by industrial expansion and the decline of traditional agriculture.
poles emigrated not only to pittsburgh and chicago but to work in german factories and scottish mines.
italians sought jobs in belgium france and argentina as well as the united states.
as many as 750 000 chinese migrated to other countries each year.
during the years from 1840 to 1914 when immigration to the united states would be virtually cut off first by the outbreak of world war i and then by legislation perhaps 40 million persons emigrated to the united states and another 20 million to other parts of the western hemisphere including canada argentina brazil and the caribbean.
this population flow formed one part of a massive shifting of peoples throughout the world much of which took place in asia.
millions of persons migrated to southeast asia and the south pacific mainly from india and china.

an urban age and a consumer society numerous causes inspired this massive uprooting of population.
rural southern and eastern europe and large parts of asia were regions marked by widespread poverty and illiteracy burdensome taxation and declining economies.
political turmoil at home like the revolution that engulfed mexico after 1911 also inspired emigration.
not all of these immigrants could be classified as free laborers however.
large numbers of chinese mexican and italian migrants including many who came to the united states were bound to long term labor contracts.
these contracts were signed with labor agents who then provided the workers to american employers.
but all the areas attracting immigrants were frontiers of one kind or another agricultural mining or industrial with expanding job opportunities.
most european immigrants to the united states entered through ellis island.
located in new york harbor this became in 1892 the nations main facility for processing immigrants.
millions of americans today trace their ancestry to an immigrant who passed through ellis island.
the less fortunate who failed a medical examination or were judged to be anarchists prostitutes or in other ways undesirable were sent home.
at the same time an influx of asian and mexican newcomers was taking place in the west.
after the exclusion of immigrants from china in the late nineteenth century a small number of japanese arrived primarily to work as agricultural laborers in californias fruit and vegetable fields and on hawaiis sugar plantations.
by 1910 the population of japanese origin had grown to 72 000.
between 1910 and 1940 angel island in san francisco bay the ellis island of the west served as the main entry point for immigrants from asia.
far larger was mexican immigration.
between 1900 and 1930 some 1 million mexicans more than 10 percent of that countrys population why was the city such a central element in progressive america.
entered the united states a number exceeded by only a few european countries.
many mexicans entered through el paso texas the main southern gateway into the united states.
many ended up in the san gabriel valley of california where citrus growers searching for cheap labor had earlier experimented with native american south asian chinese and filipino migrant workers.
by 1910 one seventh of the american population was foreign born the highest percentage in the countrys history.
more than 40 percent of new york citys population had been born abroad.
in chicago and smaller industrial cities like providence milwaukee and san francisco the figure exceeded 30 percent.
although many newcomers moved west to take part in the expansion of farming most clustered in industrial centers.
by 1910 nearly three fifths of the workers in the twenty leading manufacturing and mining industries were foreign born.
the immigrant quest for freedom like their nineteenth century predecessors the new immigrants arrived imagining the united states as a land of freedom where all persons enjoyed equality before the law could worship as they pleased enjoyed economic opportunity and had been emancipated from the oppressive social hierarchies of their homelands.
america is a free country one polish immigrant wrote home.
you dont have to be a serf to anyone agents sent abroad by the american government to investigate the reasons for large scale immigration reported that the main impetus was a desire to share in the freedom and prosperity enjoyed by the people of the united states freedom they added was largely an economic ambition a desire to escape from hopeless poverty and achieve a standard of living impossible at home.
while some of the new immigrants especially jews fleeing religious persecution in the russian empire thought of themselves as permanent emigrants the majority initially planned to earn enough money to return home and purchase land.
groups like mexicans and italians included many birds of passage who remained only temporarily in the united states.
in 1908 a year of economic downturn in the united states more italians left the country than entered.
the new immigrants clustered in close knit ethnic neighborhoods with their own shops theaters and community organizations and often continued to speak their native tongues.
as early as 1900 more than 1 000 foreignlanguage newspapers were published in the united a community settlement map for chicago in 1900 illustrates the immigrant and racial neighborhoods in the nations second largest city.

churches were pillars of these immigrant communities.
in new yorks east harlem even anti clerical italian immigrants who resented the close alliance in italy between the catholic church and the oppressive state participated eagerly in the annual festival of the madonna of mt.
after italian americans scattered to the suburbs they continued to return each year to reenact the festival.
although most immigrants earned more than was possible in the impoverished regions from which they came they endured low wages long hours and dangerous working conditions.
in the mines and factories of pennsylvania and the midwest eastern european immigrants performed low wage unskilled labor while native born workers dominated skilled and supervisory jobs.
the vast majority of mexican immigrants became poorly paid agricultural mine and railroad laborers with little prospect of upward economic mobility.
my people are not in america remarked one slavic priest they are under it consumer freedom cities however were also the birthplace of a mass consumption society that added new meaning to american freedom.
there was of course nothing unusual in the idea that the promise of american life lay in part in the enjoyment by the masses of citizens of goods available in other countries only to the well to do.
not until the progressive era however did the advent of large downtown department stores chain stores in urban neighborhoods and retail mail order houses for farmers and small town resi in hester street painted in 1905 george luks a member of the ashcan school of urban artists captures the colorful street life of an immigrant neighborhood in new york city.

what does the nature of the audience suggest about movie theaters as places of a new social freedom.
does the painting help explain why some critics complained that movies promoted immorality.

an urban age and a consumer society dents make available to consumers throughout the country the vast array of goods now pouring from the nations factories.
by 1910 americans could purchase among many other items electric sewing machines washing machines vacuum cleaners and record players.
low wages the unequal distribution of income and the souths persistent poverty limited the consumer economy which would not fully come into its own until after world war ii.
but it was in progressive america that the promise of mass consumption became the foundation for a new understanding of freedom as access to the cornucopia of goods made available by modern capitalism.
leisure activities also took on the characteristics of mass consumption.
amusement parks dance halls and theaters attracted large crowds of city dwellers.
the most popular form of mass entertainment at the turn of the century was vaudeville a live theatrical entertainment consisting of numerous short acts typically including song and dance comedy acrobats magicians and trained animals.
in the 1890s brief motion pictures were already being introduced into vaudeville shows.
as the movies became longer and involved more sophisticated plot narratives separate theaters developed.
by 1910 25 million americans per week mostly working class urban residents were attending nickelodeons motion picture theaters whose five cent admission charge was far lower than at vaudeville shows.
the working woman the new visibility of women in urban public places at work as shoppers and in places of entertainment like cinemas and dance halls indicated that traditional gender roles were changing dramatically in progressive america.
as the triangle fire revealed more and more women were working for wages.
black women still worked primarily as domestics or in southern cotton fields.
immigrant women were largely confined to lowpaying factory employment.
but for native born white women the kinds of jobs available expanded enormously.
by 1920 around 25 percent of employed women were office workers or telephone operators and only 15 percent worked in domestic service the largest female job category of the nineteenth century.
female work was no longer confined to young unmarried white women and adult black women.
in 1920 of 8 million women working for wages one quarter were married and living with their husbands.

the working woman immigrant and native working class and professional became a symbol of female emancipation.
women faced special limitations on their economic freedom including wage discrimination and exclusion from many jobs.
yet almost in spite of themselves union leader abraham bisno remarked young immigrant working women developed a sense of independence they acquired the right to a personality something alien to the highly patriarchal family structures of the old country.
we enjoy our independence and freedom was the assertive statement of the bachelor girls social club a group of female mail order clerks in new york.
the growing number of younger women who desired a lifelong career wrote charlotte perkins gilman in her influential book women and economics 1898 offered evidence of a spirit of personal independence that pointed to a coming transformation of both economic and family life.
gilmans writings reinforced the claim that the road to womans freedom lay through the workplace.
in the home she argued women experienced not fulfillment but oppression and the housewife was an unproductive parasite little more than a servant to her husband and children.
by condemning women to a life of domestic drudgery prevailing gender norms made them incapable of contributing to society or enjoying freedom in any meaningful sense of the word.
the desire to participate in the consumer society produced remarkably similar battles within immigrant families of all nationalities between parents and their self consciously free children especially daughters.
contemporaries native and immigrant noted how the novelties and frivolities of fashion appealed to young working women who spent part of their meager wages on clothing and makeup and at places of entertainment.
daughters considered parents who tried to impose curfews or to prevent them from going out alone to dances or movies as old fashioned and not sufficiently american immigrant parents found it very difficult to adapt to what one mexican mother called this terrible freedom in this united states the mexican girls she told a sociologist studying immigrant life in los angeles seeing american girls with freedom they want it too the rise of table 18 4 percentage of women workers in various occupations occupation professional technical 8 2 11 7 clerical 4 0 18 7 sales workers 4 3 6 2 unskilled and semiskilled manufacturing 23 7 20 2 household workers 28 7 15 7 fordism if any individual exemplified the new consumer society it was henry ford.
the son of an immigrant irish farmer ford had worked as an apprentice in michigan machine shops and later as an engineer for the edison illuminating company.
ford did not invent the automobile but he developed the techniques of production and marketing that brought it within the reach of ordinary americans.
in 1905 he established the ford motor company one of dozens of small automobile manufacturing firms that emerged in these years.
three years later he introduced the model t a simple light vehicle sturdy enough to navigate the countrys poorly maintained roads.
while early european models like the mercedes aimed at an elite market and were superior in craftsmanship ford concentrated on standardizing output and lowering prices.
in 1913 fords factory in highland park michigan adopted the method of production known as the moving assembly line in which car frames were brought to workers on a continuously moving conveyor belt.
the process enabled ford to expand output by greatly reducing the time it took the return from toil a drawing by john sloan for the radical magazine the masses pictures working women not as downtrodden but as independent minded stylish and self confident.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 an urban age and a consumer society the assembly line at the ford motor company factory in highland park michigan around 1915 to produce each car.
in 1914 he raised wages at his factory to the unheard of level of five dollars per day more than double the pay of most industrial workers enabling him to attract a steady stream of skilled laborers.
labor conditions in the ford plant were not as appealing as the wages however assembly line work was monotonous the worker repeated the same basic motions for the entire day and ford used spies and armed detectives to prevent unionization.
when other businessmen criticized him for endangering profits by paying high wages ford replied that workers must be able to afford the goods being turned out by american factories.
fords output rose from 34 000 cars priced at 700 each in 1910 to 730 000 model ts that sold at a price of 316 well within the reach of many workers in 1916.
the economic system based on mass production and mass consumption came to be called fordism.

to consumer products the new advertising industry perfected ways of increasing sales often by linking goods with the idea of freedom.
numerous products took liberty as a brand name or used an image of the statue of liberty as a sales device.
the department store magnate edward filene called consumerism a school of freedom since shoppers made individual choices on basic questions of living.
economic abundance would eventually come to define the american way of life in which personal fulfillment was to be found through acquiring material goods.
the promise of abundance shifted the quest for freedom to the realm of private life but it also inspired political activism.
exclusion from the world of mass consumption would come to seem almost as great a denial of the why was the city such a central element in progressive america.

the assembly line made mass production like this possible.

the desire for consumer goods led many workers to join unions and fight for higher wages.
the argument that monopolistic corporations artificially raised prices at the expense of consumers became a weapon against the trusts.
consumers consciousness wrote walter lippmann who emerged in these years as one of the nations most influential social commentators was growing rapidly with the high cost of living as its rallying cry.
an american standard of living the maturation of the consumer economy gave rise to concepts a living wage and an american standard of living that offered a new language for criticizing the inequalities of wealth and power in progressive america.
father john a ryans influential book a living wage 1906 described a decent standard of living one that enabled a person to participate in the consumer economy as a natural and absolute right of citizenship.
ryan had grown up in minnesota in a family sympathetic to henry george the knights of labor and the populists.
his book sought to translate into american terms pope leo xiiis powerful statement of 1894 rerum novarum which criticized the divorce of economic life from ethical considerations endorsed the right of workers to organize unions and repudiated competitive individualism in favor of a more cooperative vision of the good society.
ryans insistence that economic relationships should be governed by moral standards had a powerful influence on social thought among american catholics.
the popularity of the idea of an american standard of living reflected in part the emergence of a mass consumption society during the progressive era.
for the first time in the nations history mass consumption came to occupy a central place in descriptions of american society and its future.
in the one of the numerous advertisements of the early twentieth century that invoked the statue of liberty to market consumer goods in this case a brand of crackers.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 varieties of progressivism gilded age social theorists like henry george had wondered why economic progress produced both increased wealth and abject misery.
the progressive generation was strongly influenced by the more optimistic writings of simon w patten a prophet of prosperity.
patten announced the end of the reign of want and the advent of a society of abundance and leisure.
in the dawning new civilization he proclaimed americans would enjoy economic equality in a world in which every one is independent and free va r i e t i e s o f p r o g r e s s i v i s m picturesque america a 1909 cartoon by harry grant dart offers a satirical comment on how advertising was threatening to overwhelm public life.
dart also includes a political comment he would rather advertise than be president on senator robert lafollette of wisconsin pictured at the top right delivering a speech.
for most americans however pattens new civilization lay far in the future.
the more immediate task in the progressives view was to humanize industrial capitalism and find common ground in a society still racked by labor conflict and experiencing massive immigration from abroad.
some progressives proposed to return to a competitive marketplace populated by small producers.
others accepted the permanence of the large corporation and looked to the government to reverse the growing concentration of wealth and to ensure social justice.
still others would relocate freedom from the economic and political worlds to a private realm of personal fulfillment and unimpeded self expression.
but nearly all progressives agreed that freedom must be infused with new meaning to deal with the economic and social conditions of the early twentieth century.
the old democracy wrote walter weyl associate editor of the new republic a weekly magazine that became the bible of progressive intellectuals provided no answer to the problems of a world in which the chief restrictions upon liberty were economic not political.
industrial freedom in progressive america complaints of a loss of freedom came not only from the most poorly paid factory workers but from better off employees as well.
large firms in the automobile electrical steel and other industries sought to implement greater control over the work process.
efficiency expert frederick w taylor pioneered what he called scientific management a program that sought to streamline production and boost profits by systematically controlling costs and work practices.
through scientific study the one best way of producing goods could be determined and implemented.
the role of workers was to obey the detailed instructions of supervisors.
not surprisingly many skilled workers saw the erosion of their traditional influence over the work process as a loss of freedom.
men and women complained samuel gompers whose american federation of labor afl represented such skilled workers cannot live during working hours under autocratic conditions and instantly become sons and daughters of freedom as they step outside the shop gates the great increase in the number of white collar workers the army of salespeople bookkeepers salaried professionals and corporate managers how did the labor and womens movements challenge the nineteenth century meanings of american freedom.
that sprang up with the new system of management also undermined the experience of personal autonomy.
for although they enjoyed far higher social status and incomes than manual workers many wrote one commentator were the kind of individuals who under former conditions would have been.
managing their own businesses not working for someone else.
these developments helped to place the ideas of industrial freedom and industrial democracy which had entered the political vocabulary in the gilded age at the center of political discussion during the progressive era.
lack of industrial freedom was widely believed to lie at the root of the much discussed labor problem since in an industrial age the prospect of managing ones own business seemed increasingly remote many progressives believed that the key to increasing industrial freedom lay in empowering workers to participate in economic decision making via strong unions.
louis d brandeis an active ally of the labor movement whom president woodrow wilson appointed to the supreme court in 1916 maintained that unions embodied an essential principle of freedom the right of people to govern themselves.
the contradiction between political liberty and industrial slavery brandeis insisted was americas foremost social problem.
workers deserved a voice not only in establishing wages and working conditions but also in making such managerial decisions as the relocation of factories layoffs and the distribution of profits.
the socialist presence economic freedom was also a rallying cry of american socialism which reached its greatest influence during the progressive era.
founded in 1901 the socialist party brought together surviving late nineteenth century radicals such as populists and followers of edward bellamy with a portion of the labor movement.
the party called for immediate reforms such as free college education legislation to improve the condition of laborers and as an ultimate goal democratic control over the economy through public ownership of railroads and factories.
it was the task of socialism said western labor leader john oneill to gather together the shards of liberty the fragments of the american heritage of freedom scattered by a government controlled by capitalist millionaires.
by 1912 the socialist party claimed 150 000 dues paying members published hundreds of newspapers enjoyed substantial support in the american federation of labor and had elected scores of local officials.
socialism flourished in diverse communities throughout the country.
on the lower east side of new york city it arose from the economic exploitation of immigrant workers and judaisms tradition of social reform.
here a vibrant socialist culture developed complete with yiddish language newspapers and theaters as well as large public meetings and street demonstrations.
in 1914 the district elected socialist meyer london to congress.
another center of socialist strength was milwaukee where victor berger a german born teacher and newspaper editor mobilized local afl unions into a potent political force that elected emil seidel mayor in 1910.
seidels administration provided aid to the unemployed forced the police to recognize the rights of strikers and won the respect of middle class residents for its honesty and freedom from machine domination.
socialism also made roller skaters with socialist leaflets during a new york city strike in 1916.
a scab is a worker who crosses the picket line during a strike.

it is not motherhood that keeps the housewife on her feet from dawn till dark it is house service not child service.

the spirit of personal independence in the women of today is sure proof that a change has come.
the radical change in the economic position of women is advancing upon us.
the growing individualization of democratic life brings economic independence for women necessarily involves a change in the home and family relation.
but if that change is for the advantage of individual and race we need not fear it.
it does not involve a change in the marriage relation except in withdrawing the element of economic dependence nor in the relation of mother to child save to improve it.
but it does involve the exercise of human faculty in women in social service and exchange rather than in domestic service solely.

f r o m j o h n m i t c h e l l t h e wo r k i n g m a n s c o n c e p t i o n o f industrial liberty 1910 during the progressive era the idea of industrial liberty moved to the center of political discussion.
progressive reformers and labor leaders like john mitchell head of the united mine workers condemned the prevailing idea of liberty of contract in favor of a broader definition of economic freedom.
practice of paying wages in merchandise.
from time immemorial it had been the custom of coal companies to conduct general supply stores and the workingmen were required as a condition of employment to accept products in lieu of money in return for services rendered.
this system was a great hardship to the workmen.
the question of the constitutionality of this legislation was carried into the courts and by the highest tribunal it was declared to be an invasion of the workmans liberty while the declaration of independence established civil and political liberty it did not as you all know establish industrial liberty.
liberty means more than the right to choose the field of ones employment.
he is not a free man whose family must buy food today with the money that is earned tomorrow.
he is not really free who is forced to work unduly long hours and for wages so low that he can not provide the necessities of life for himself and his family who must live in a crowded tenement and see his children go to work in the mills the mines and the factories before their bodies are developed and their minds trained.
to have freedom a man must be free from the harrowing fear of hunger and want he must be in such a position that by the exercise of reasonable frugality he can provide his family with all of the necessities and the reasonable comforts of life.
he must be able to educate his children and to provide against sickness accident and old age.
a number of years ago the legislatures of several coal producing states enacted laws requiring employers to pay the wages of their workmen in lawful money of the united states and to cease the to deny him the right to accept merchandise in lieu of money as payment of his wages.
this is typical of hundreds of instances in which laws that have been enacted for the protection of the workingmen have been declared by the courts to be unconstitutional on the grounds that they invaded the liberty of the working people.
is it not natural that the workingmen should feel that they are being guaranteed the liberties they do not want and denied the liberty that is of real value to them.

the gospel of debs no one was more important in spreading the socialist gospel or linking it to ideals of equality self government and freedom than eugene v debs the railroad union leader who as noted in the previous chapter had been jailed during the pullman strike of 1894.
for two decades debs criss crossed the country preaching that control of the economy by a democratic government held out the hope of uniting political equality and economic freedom as a champion of the downtrodden debs managed to bridge the cultural divide among new yorks jewish immigrants prairie socialists of the west and native born intellectuals attracted to the socialist ideal.

throughout the atlantic world of the early twentieth century socialism was a rising presence.
debs would receive more than 900 000 votes for president 6 percent of the total in 1912.
in that year the socialist appeal to reason published in girard kansas with a circulation of 700 000 was the largest weekly newspaper in the country and socialist max hayes polled one third of the vote when he challenged samuel gompers for the presidency of the afl.
in western europe socialism experienced even more pronounced growth.
in the last elections before the outbreak of world war i in 1914 socialists in france germany and scandinavia won between onesixth and one third of the vote.
socialism is coming declared the appeal to reason.
it is coming like a prairie fire and nothing can stop it afl and iww socialism was only one example of widespread discontent in progressive america.
the labor strife of the gilded age continued into the early twentieth century.
having survived the depression of the 1890s the american federation of labor saw its membership triple to 1 6 million between 1900 and 1904.
at the same time it sought to forge closer ties with forwardlooking corporate leaders willing to deal with unions as a way to stabilize employee relations.
afl president gompers joined with george perkins of the j p morgan financial empire and mark hanna who had engineered mckinleys election in the national civic federation which accepted the right of collective bargaining for responsible unions.
it helped to settle hundreds of industrial disputes and encouraged improvements in factory safety and the establishment of pension plans for long term workers.
most employers nonetheless continued to view unions as an intolerable interference with their authority and resisted them stubbornly.
the afl mainly represented the most privileged american workers skilled industrial and craft laborers nearly all of them white male and native born.
in 1905 a group of unionists who rejected the afls exclusionary policies formed the industrial workers of the world iww.
part trade union part advocate of a workers revolution that would seize the means of production and abolish the state the iww made solidarity its guiding principle extending a fraternal hand to every wage worker no matter what his religion fatherland or trade the organization sought to mobilize those excluded from the afl the immigrant factory labor force migrant timber and agricultural workers women blacks and even the despised chinese on the west coast.
the iwws most prominent leader was william big bill haywood who had worked in western mines as a youth.
dubbed by critics the most dangerous man in america haywood became a national figure in 1906 when he was kidnapped and spirited off to idaho accused of instigating the murder of a former anti union governor.
defended by labor lawyer clarence darrow haywood was found not guilty.
the new immigrants on strike the uprising of the 20 000 in new yorks garment industry mentioned earlier was one of a series of mass strikes among immigrant workers that placed labors demand for the right to bargain collectively at the forefront one big union the emblem of the industrial workers of the world.

varieties of progressivism of the reform agenda.
these strikes demonstrated that while ethnic divisions among workers impeded labor solidarity ethnic cohesiveness could also be a basis of unity so long as strikes were organized on a democratic basis.
the iww did not originate these confrontations but was sometimes called in by local unionists to solidify the strikers.
iww organizers printed leaflets posters and banners in multiple languages and insisted that each nationality enjoy representation on the committee coordinating a walkout.
it drew on the sense of solidarity within immigrant communities to persuade local religious leaders shopkeepers and officeholders to support the strikes.
the labor conflict that had the greatest impact on public consciousness took place in lawrence massachusetts.
the citys huge woolen mills employed 32 000 men women and children representing twenty five nationalities.
they worked six days per week and earned an average of sixteen cents per hour.
when the state legislature in january 1912 enacted a fifty four hour limit to the workweek employers reduced the weekly take home pay of those who had been laboring longer hours.
workers spontaneously went on strike and called on the iww for assistance.
in february haywood and a group of women strikers devised the idea of sending strikers children out of the city for the duration of the walkout.
socialist families in new york city agreed to take them in.
the sight of the children many of whom appeared pale and half starved marching up fifth avenue from the train station led to a wave of sympathy for the strikers.
i have worked in the slums of new york wrote one observer but i have never found children who were so uniformly ill nourished ill fed and illclothed a few days later city officials ordered that no more youngsters could leave lawrence.
when a group of mothers and children gathered at the railroad station in defiance of the order club wielding police drove them away producing outraged headlines around the world.
the governor of massachusetts soon intervened and the strike was settled on the workers terms.
a banner carried by the lawrence strikers gave a new slogan to the labor movement we want bread and roses too a declaration that workers sought not only higher wages but the opportunity to enjoy the finer things of life.
another highly publicized labor uprising took place in new orleans where a 1907 strike of 10 000 black and white dockworkers prevented employers efforts to eliminate their unions and reduce their wages.
this was a remarkable expression of interracial solidarity at a time when segregation had become the norm throughout the south.
other strikes proved less successful.
a six month walkout of 25 000 silk workers in paterson new jersey in 1913 failed despite publicity generated by the paterson how did the labor and womens movements challenge the nineteenth century meanings of american freedom.
pageant in which the strikers reenacted highlights of their struggle before a sympathetic audience at new yorks madison square garden.
a strike against the rockefeller owned colorado fuel and iron company was also unsuccessful.
mostly recent immigrants from europe and mexico the strikers demanded recognition of the united mine workers of america wage increases an eight hour workday and the right to shop and live in places not owned by the company.
when the walkout began in september 1913 the mine owners evicted 11 000 strikers and their families from company housing.
they moved into tent colonies which armed militia units soon surrounded.
on april 20 1914 the militia attacked the largest tent city at ludlow and burned it to the ground killing an estimated twenty to thirty men women and children.
seven months after the ludlow massacre the strike was called off.
labor and civil liberties the fiery organizer mary mother jones who at the age of eighty three had been jailed after addressing the colorado strikers later told a new york audience that the union had only the constitution the other side had the bayonets yet the struggle of workers for the right to strike and of labor radicals against restraints on open air speaking made free speech a significant public issue in the early twentieth century.
by and large the courts rejected their claims.
but these battles laid the foundation for the rise of civil liberties as a central component of freedom in twentieth century america.
state courts in the progressive era regularly issued injunctions prohibiting strikers from speaking picketing or distributing literature during labor disputes.
like the abolitionists before them the labor movement in the name of freedom demanded the right to assemble organize and spread their views.
the investigations of the commission on industrial relations revealed the absence of free speech in many factory communities with labor organizers prohibited from speaking freely under threat of either violence from private police or suppression by local authorities.
i dont think we live in a free country or enjoy civil liberties clarence darrow told the commission.
the iwws battle for civil liberties breathed new meaning into the idea of freedom of expression.
lacking union halls its organizers relied on songs street theater impromptu organizing meetings and street corner gatherings to spread their message and attract support.
in response to iww activities officials in los angeles spokane denver and more than a dozen other cities limited or prohibited outdoor meetings.

isadora duncan brought a new freedom to an old art form.
new feminism during the progressive era the word feminism first entered the political vocabulary.
one organization the feminist alliance constructed apartment houses with communal kitchens cafeterias and daycare centers to free women from the constraints of the home.
in 1914 a mass meeting at new yorks cooper union debated the question what is feminism the meeting was sponsored by heterodoxy a womens club located in greenwich village that brought together female professionals academics and reformers.
feminism said one speaker meant womens emancipation both as a human being and a sex being feminists forthright attack on traditional rules of sexual behavior added a new dimension to the discussion of personal freedom.
heterodoxy was part of a new radical bohemia a social circle of artists writers and others who reject conventional rules and practices.
its definition of feminism merged issues like the vote and greater economic opportunities with open discussion of sexuality.
in new yorks greenwich village and counterparts in chicago san francisco and other cities a lyrical left came into being in the prewar years.
its members formed discussion clubs attended experimental theaters and published magazines.
they confidently expected to preside over the emancipation of the human spirit from the prejudices of the nineteenth century.
one symbol of the new era was isadora duncan who brought from california a new expressive dance based on the free movement of a body liberated from the constraints of traditional technique and costume.
i beheld the dance i had always dreamed of wrote the novelist edith wharton on seeing a duncan performance satisfying every sense as a flower does or a phrase of mozarts another sign of artistic revolution was the armory show of 1913 an exhibition that exposed new yorkers to new cubist paintings from europe by artists previously unknown in the united states like pablo picasso.
the lyrical left made freedom the key to its vision of society.
at the famed salon in heiress mabel dodges new york living room a remarkable array of talented radicals gathered to discuss with equal passion labor unrest modern trends in the arts and sexual liberation.
although many progressives frequented the dodge salon there was a world of difference between the exuberant individualism of the lyrical left and most progressives preoccupation with order and efficiency.
what women are really after explained crystal eastman is freedom a graduate of new york university law school eastman had taken a leading role both in the suffrage movement and in investigating industrial accidents.
but her definition of freedom went beyond the vote beyond industrial democracy to encompass emotional and sexual self determination.
how did the labor and womens movements challenge the nineteenth century meanings of american freedom.
the rise of personal freedom during the progressive era as journalist william m reedy jested it struck sex oclock in america.
the founder of psychiatry sigmund freud lectured at clark university in worcester massachusetts in 1909 and discovered that his writings on infantile sexuality repression and the irrational sources of human behavior were widely known even in prudish america issues of intimate personal relations previously confined to private discussion blazed forth in popular magazines and public debates.
for the generation of women who adopted the word feminism to express their demand for greater liberty free sexual expression and reproductive choice emerged as critical definitions of womens emancipation.
greenwich village became a center of sexual experimentation.
the aura of tolerance attracted many homosexuals to the area and although organized demands for gay rights lay far in the future the gay community became an important element of the villages lifestyle.
but new sexual attitudes spread far beyond bohemia they flourished among the young unmarried self supporting women who made sexual freedom a hallmark of their oftproclaimed personal independence.
the birth control movement the growing presence of women in the labor market reinforced demands for access to birth control an issue that gave political expression to changing sexual behavior.
in the nineteenth century the right to control ones body generally meant the ability to refuse sexual advances including those of a womans husband.
now it suggested the ability to enjoy an active sexual life without necessarily bearing children.
emma goldman who had emigrated to the united states from lithuania at the age of sixteen toured the country lecturing on subjects from anarchism to the need for more enlightened attitudes toward homosexuality.
she regularly included the right to birth control in her speeches and distributed pamphlets with detailed information about various contraceptive devices.
i demand freedom for both sexes she proclaimed freedom of action freedom in love and freedom in motherhood goldman constantly ran afoul of the law.
by one count she was arrested more than forty times for dangerous or obscene statements or simply to keep her from speaking.
by forthrightly challenging the laws banning contraceptive information and devices margaret sanger one of eleven children of an irish american working class family placed the issue of birth control at the heart of the new feminism.
in 1911 she began a column on sex education what every girl should know for the call a new york socialist newspaper.
postal officials barred one issue containing a column on venereal disease from the mails.
the next issue of the call included a blank page with the headline what every girl should know nothing by order of the u s post office by 1914 the intrepid sanger was openly advertising birth control devices in her own journal the woman rebel.
no woman can call herself free she proclaimed who does not own and control her own body and can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother in 1916 sanger opened a clinic in a working class neighborhood of brooklyn and began distributing contraceptive devices to poor jewish and italian the much beloved and much feared emma goldman with a poster advertising a series of her lectures illustrating the remarkable variety of topics on which she spoke.

few progressives rallied to her defense.
but for a time the birth control issue became a crossroads where the paths of labor radicals cultural modernists and feminists intersected.
the iww and socialist party distributed sangers writings.
like the iww free speech fights and goldmans persistent battle for the right to lecture sangers travail was part of a rich history of dissent in the progressive era that helped to focus enlightened opinion on the ways local authorities and national obscenity legislation set rigid limits to americans freedom of expression.
native american progressivism many groups participated in the progressive impulse.
founded in 1911 the society of american indians was a reform organization typical of the era.
it brought together indian intellectuals to promote discussion of the plight of native americans in the hope that public exposure would be the first step toward remedying injustice.
because many of the societys leaders had been educated at government sponsored boarding schools the society united indians of many tribal backgrounds.
it created a pan indian public space independent of white control.
many of these indian intellectuals were not unsympathetic to the basic goals of federal indian policy including the transformation of communal landholdings on reservations into family farms.
but carlos montezuma a founder of the society of american indians became an outspoken critic.
born in arizona he had been captured as a child by members of a neighboring tribe and sold to a traveling photographer who brought him to chicago.
there montezuma attended school and eventually obtained a medical degree.
in 1916 montezuma established a newsletter wassaja meaning signaling that condemned federal paternalism toward the indians and called for the abolition of the bureau of indian affairs.
convinced that outsiders exerted too much power over life on the reservations he insisted that self determination was the only way for indians to escape poverty and marginalization we must free ourselves.
we must be independent how did the labor and womens movements challenge the nineteenth century meanings of american freedom.
but he also demanded that indians be granted full citizenship and all the constitutional rights of other americans.
montezumas writings had little influence at the time on government policy but indian activists would later rediscover him as a forerunner of indian radicalism.
the politics of progressivism effective freedom progressivism was an international movement.
in the early twentieth century cities throughout the world experienced similar social strains arising from rapid industrialization and urban growth.
in 1850 london and paris were the only cities whose population exceeded 1 million.
by 1900 there were twelve new york chicago and philadelphia in the united states and others in europe latin america and asia.
facing similar social problems reformers across the globe exchanged ideas and envisioned new social policies.
sun yat sen the chinese leader was influenced by the writings of henry george and edward bellamy.
the mayor of osaka japan called for a new social economy that replaced competition with cooperation.
as governments in britain france and germany instituted old age pensions minimum wage laws unemployment insurance and the regulation of workplace safety american reformers came to believe they had much to learn from the old world.
the term social legislation meaning governmental action to address urban problems and the insecurities of workingclass life originated in germany but soon entered the political vocabulary of the united states.
progressives believed that the modern era required a fundamental rethinking of the functions of political authority whether the aim was to combat the power of the giant corporations protect consumers civilize the marketplace or guarantee industrial freedom at the workplace.
drawing on the reform programs of the gilded age and the example of european legislation progressives sought to reinvigorate the idea of an activist socially conscious government.
even in south carolina with its strong tradition of belief in local autonomy governor richard i manning urged his constituents to modify their view of government as a threat to individual liberty to see it instead as a means for solving the ills of the body politic progressives could reject the traditional assumption that powerful government posed a threat to freedom because their understanding of freedom was itself in flux.
effective freedom wrote the philosopher john dewey was far different from the highly formal and limited concept of liberty as protection from outside restraint.
freedom was a positive not a negative concept the power to do specific things as such it depended on the distribution of powers that exists at a given time thus freedom inevitably became a political question.
freedom wrote deweys brilliant young admirer the writer randolph bourne means a democratic cooperation in determining the ideals and purposes and industrial and social institutions of a country state and local reforms throughout the western world social legislation proliferated in the early twentieth century.

18 the progressive era 1900 1916 children at play at the hudson bank gymnasium built in 1898 in a new york immigrant neighborhood by the outdoor recreation league one of many progressive era groups that sought to improve life in urban centers.
the politics of progressivism enacted most of the eras reform measures.
in cities progressives worked to reform the structure of government to reduce the power of political bosses establish public control of natural monopolies like gas and water works and improve public transportation.
they raised property taxes in order to spend more money on schools parks and other public facilities.
gilded age mayors hazen pingree and samuel golden rule jones pioneered urban progressivism.
a former factory worker who became a successful shoe manufacturer pingree served as mayor of detroit from 1889 to 1897.
he battled the business interests that had dominated city government forcing gas and telephone companies to lower their rates and established a municipal power plant.
jones had instituted an eight hour day and paid vacations at his factory that produced oil drilling equipment.
as mayor of toledo ohio from 1897 to 1905 he founded night schools and free kindergartens built new parks and supported the right of workers to unionize.
since state legislatures defined the powers of city government urban progressives often carried their campaigns to the state level.
pingree became governor of michigan in 1896 in which post he continued his battle against railroads and other corporate interests.
hiram johnson who as public prosecutor had secured the conviction for bribery of san francisco political boss abraham ruef was elected governor of california in 1910.
having promised to kick the southern pacific railroad out of politics he secured passage of the public utilities act one of the countrys strongest railroad regulation measures as well as laws banning child labor and limiting the working hours of women.
the most influential progressive administration at the state level was that of robert m la follette who made wisconsin a laboratory for democracy after serving as a republican member of congress la follette became convinced that an alliance of railroad and lumber companies controlled state politics.
elected governor in 1900 he instituted a series of measures known as the wisconsin idea including nominations of candidates for office through primary elections rather than by political bosses the taxation of corporate wealth and state regulation of railroads and public utilities.
to staff his administration he drew on nonpartisan faculty members from the university of wisconsin.
progressive democracy we are far from free wrote randolph bourne in 1913 but the new spirit of democracy is the angel that will free us progressives hoped to reinvigorate democracy by restoring political power to the citizenry and civic harmony to a divided society.
alarmed by the upsurge in violent class conflict and the in what ways did progressivism include both democratic and anti democratic impulses.
unrestricted power of corporations they believed that political reforms could help to create a unified people devoted to greater democracy and social reconciliation.
yet increasing the responsibilities of government made it all the more important to identify who was entitled to political participation and who was not.
the progressive era saw a host of changes implemented in the political process many seemingly contradictory in purpose.
the electorate was simultaneously expanded and contracted empowered and removed from direct influence on many functions of government.
democracy was enhanced by the seventeenth amendment which provided that u s senators be chosen by popular vote rather than by state legislatures by widespread adoption of the popular election of judges and by the use of primary elections among party members to select candidates for office.
several states including california under hiram johnson adopted the initiative and referendum the former allowed voters to propose legislation the latter to vote directly on it and the recall by which officials could be removed from office by popular vote.
the era culminated with a constitutional amendment enfranchising women the largest expansion of democracy in american history.
but the progressive era also witnessed numerous restrictions on democratic participation most strikingly the disenfranchisement of blacks in the south a process as noted in chapter 17 supported by many white southern progressives as a way of ending election fraud.
to make city government more honest and efficient many localities replaced elected mayors with appointed nonpartisan commissions or city managers a change that insulated officials from machine domination but also from popular control.
new literacy tests and residency and registration requirements common in northern as well as southern states limited the right to vote among the poor.
taken as a whole the electoral changes of the progressive era represented a significant reversal of the idea that voting was an inherent right of american citizenship.
and as will be noted in the next chapter most white progressives proved remarkably indifferent to the plight of african americans.
in the eyes of many progressives the fitness of voters not their absolute numbers defined a functioning democracy.
government by expert he didnt believe in democracy he believed simply in government the writer h l menckens quip about theodore roosevelt came uncomfortably close to the mark for many progressive advocates of an empowered state.
most progressive thinkers were highly uncomfortable with the real world of politics which seemed to revolve around the pursuit of narrow class ethnic and regional interests.
robert m la follettes reliance on college professors to staff important posts in his administration reflected a larger progressive faith in expertise.
the government could best exercise intelligent control over society through a democracy run by impartial experts who were in many respects unaccountable to the citizenry.
this impulse toward order efficiency and centralized management all in the name of social justice was an important theme of progressive reform.
the title of walter lippmanns influential 1914 work of social commentary drift and mastery posed the stark alternatives facing the nation.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 the politics of progressivism drift meant continuing to operate according to the outmoded belief in individual autonomy.
mastery required applying scientific inquiry to modern social problems.
the new generation of educated professionals lippmann believed could be trusted more fully than ordinary citizens to solve americas deep social problems.
political freedom was less a matter of direct participation in government than of qualified persons devising the best public policies.
jane a staff member greets an immigrant family at hull house the settlement house established in chicago by jane addams.
addams and hull house but alongside this elitist politics progressivism also included a more democratic vision of the activist state.
as much as any other group organized women reformers spoke for the more democratic side of progressivism.
still barred from voting and holding office in most states women nonetheless became central to the political history of the progressive era.
women challenged the barriers that excluded them from formal political participation and developed a democratic grassroots vision of progressive government.
in so doing they placed on the political agenda new understandings of female freedom.
the immediate catalyst was a growing awareness among women reformers of the plight of poor immigrant communities and the emergence of the condition of women and child laborers as a major focus of public concern.
the eras most prominent female reformer was jane addams who had been born in 1860 the daughter of an illinois businessman.
after graduating from college addams who never married resented the prevailing expectation that a womans life should be governed by what she called the family claim the obligation to devote herself to parents husband and children.
in 1889 she founded hull house in chicago a settlement house devoted to improving the lives of the immigrant poor.
hull house was modeled on toynbee hall which addams had visited after its establishment in a working class neighborhood of london in 1884.
unlike previous reformers who had aided the poor from afar settlement house workers moved into poor neighborhoods.
they built kindergartens and playgrounds for children established employment bureaus and health clinics and showed female victims of domestic abuse how to gain legal protection.
by 1910 more than 400 settlement houses had been established in cities throughout the country.
spearheads for reform addams was typical of the progressive eras new woman by 1900 there were more than 80 000 college educated women in the united states.
many found a calling in providing social services nursing and education to poor families in the growing cities.
the efforts of middle class women to uplift the poor and of laboring women to uplift themselves helped to shift the center of gravity of politics toward activist government.
women like addams discovered that even well organized social work was not enough to alleviate the problems of inadequate housing income and health.
government action was essential.
hull house instigated an array of reforms in chicago soon adopted elsewhere including stronger building and sanitation codes shorter working hours and safer labor conditions and the right of labor to organize.
in what ways did progressivism include both democratic and anti democratic impulses.
female activism spread throughout the country.
ironically the exclusion of blacks from jobs in southern textile mills strengthened the regions movement against child labor.
reformers portrayed child labor as a menace to white supremacy depriving white children of educations they would need as adult members of the dominant race.
these reformers devoted little attention to the condition of black children.
womens groups in alabama were instrumental in the passage of a 1903 state law restricting child labor.
by 1915 every southern state had followed suit.
but with textile mill owners determined to employ children and many poor families dependent on their earnings these laws were enforced only sporadically.
the settlement houses have been called spearheads for reform they produced prominent progressive figures like julia lathrop the first woman to head a federal agency the childrens bureau established in 1912 to investigate the conditions of mothers and children and advocate their interests.
florence kelley the daughter of civil war era radical republican congressman william d kelley and a veteran of hull house went on to mobilize womens power as consumers as a force for social change.
in the gilded age the writer helen campbell had brilliantly exposed the contradiction of a market economy in which fashionable women wore clothing produced by poor women in wretched sweatshops.
emancipation on the one side she pointedly observed has meant no corresponding emancipation for the other a generation later under kelleys leadership the national consumers league became the nations leading advocate of laws governing the working conditions of women and children.
freedom of choice in the marketplace kelley insisted enabled socially conscious consumers to unite with wage earners by refusing to purchase goods produced under exploitative conditions.
the campaign for woman suffrage after 1900 the campaign for womens suffrage moved beyond the elitism of the 1890s to engage a broad coalition ranging from middle class members of womens clubs to unionists socialists and settlement house workers.
for the first time it became a mass movement.
membership in the national american woman suffrage association grew from 13 000 in 1893 to more than 2 million by 1917.
the group campaigned throughout the country for the right to vote and began to enjoy some success.
by 1900 more than half the states allowed women to vote in local elections dealing with school issues and wyoming colorado idaho and utah had adopted full womens suffrage.
cynics charged that wyoming legislators used suffrage to attract more female migrants to their predominantly male state while utah hoped to visiting nurse on a new york city rooftop 1908.
efforts to uplift the immigrant poor offered new opportunities for professional employment to many women during the progressive era.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 the politics of progressivism in this 1912 woman suffrage parade in new york city a mother wheels a baby carriage to counteract the charge that allowing women to vote would undermine the family.
enhance the political power of husbands in polygamous marriages banned by law but still practiced by some mormons.
in colorado and idaho however the success of referendums in the 1890s reflected the power of the populist party a strong supporter of votes for women.
between 1910 and 1914 seven more western states enfranchised women.
in 1913 illinois became the first state east of the mississippi river to allow women to vote in presidential elections.
these campaigns which brought women aggressively into the public sphere were conducted with a new spirit of militancy.
they also made effective use of the techniques of advertising publicity and mass entertainment characteristic of modern consumer society.
californias successful 1911 campaign utilized automobile parades numerous billboards and electric signs and countless suffrage buttons and badges.
nonetheless state campaigns were difficult expensive and usually unsuccessful.
the movement increasingly focused its attention on securing a national constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote.
maternalist reform ironically the desire to exalt womens role within the home did much to inspire the reinvigoration of the suffrage movement.
many of the eras experiments in public policy arose from the conviction that the state had an obligation to protect women and children.
female reformers helped to launch a mass movement for direct government action to improve the living standards of poor mothers and children.
laws providing for mothers pensions state aid to mothers of young children who lacked male support spread rapidly after 1910.
the pensions tended to be less than generous and local eligibility requirements opened the door to unequal treatment white widows benefited the most single mothers were widely discriminated against and black women were almost entirely excluded.
maternalist reforms like mothers pensions rested on the assumption that the government should encourage womens capacity for bearing and raising children in what ways did progressivism include both democratic and anti democratic impulses.
in 1893 colorado became the first state to allow women to vote.
here well dressed women wait to vote alongside men in a 1907 election in denver.
and enable them to be economically independent at the same time.
both feminists and believers in conventional domestic roles supported such measures.
the former hoped that these laws would subvert womens dependence on men the latter that they would strengthen traditional families and the mother child bond.
other progressive legislation recognized that large numbers of women did in fact work outside the home but defined them as a dependent group like children in need of state protection in ways male workers were not.
in 1908 in the landmark case of muller v oregon louis d brandeis filed a famous brief citing scientific and sociological studies to demonstrate that because they had less strength and endurance than men long hours of labor were dangerous for women while their unique ability to bear children gave the government a legitimate interest in their working conditions.
persuaded by brandeiss argument the supreme court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of an oregon law setting maximum working hours for women.
thus three years after the notorious lochner decision invalidating a new york law limiting the working hours of male bakers discussed in chapter 16 the court created the first large breach in liberty of contract doctrine.
but the cost was high at the very time that women in unprecedented numbers were entering the labor market and earning college degrees brandeiss brief and the courts opinion solidified the view of women workers as weak dependent and incapable of enjoying the same economic rights as men.
by 1917 thirty states had enacted laws limiting the hours of labor of female workers.
many women derived great benefit from these laws others saw them as an infringement on their freedom.
while the maternalist agenda built gender inequality into the early foundations of the welfare state the very use of government to regulate working conditions called into question basic assumptions concerning liberty of contract.
although not all reformers were willing to take the step it was easy to extend the idea of protecting women and children to demand that government better the living and working conditions of men as well ch.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 the progressive presidents by insuring them against the impact of unemployment old age ill health and disability.
brandeis himself insisted that government should concern itself with the health income and future prospects of all its citizens.
the louis d brandeis progressive reformer and advocate of the labor movement was appointed to the supreme court in 1916 by president woodrow wilson.
idea of economic citizenship brandeis envisioned a different welfare state from that of the maternalist reformers one rooted less in the idea of healthy motherhood than in the notion of universal economic entitlements including the right to a decent income and protection against unemployment and work related accidents.
for him the right to assistance derived from citizenship itself not some special service to the nation as in the case of mothers or upstanding character which had long differentiated the deserving from the undeserving poor.
this vision too enjoyed considerable support in the progressive era.
by 1913 twenty two states had enacted workmens compensation laws to benefit workers male or female injured on the job.
this legislation was the first wedge that opened the way for broader programs of social insurance.
to avoid the stigma of depending on governmental assistance contributions from workers own wages funded these programs in part thus distinguishing them from charity dispensed by local authorities to the poor.
but state minimum wage laws and most laws regulating working hours applied only to women.
women and children may have needed protection but interference with the freedom of contract of adult male workers was still widely seen as degrading.
the establishment of a standard of living and working conditions beneath which no american should be allowed to fall would await the coming of the new deal.
the progressive presidents despite the ferment of progressivism on the city and state levels the most striking political development of the early twentieth century was the rise of the national state.
the process of nationalization was occurring throughout american life.
national corporations dominated the economy national organizations like the american medical association came into being to raise the incomes and respect of professions.
the process was even reflected in the consolidation of local baseball teams into the american and national leagues and the advent in 1903 of the world series.
only energetic national government progressives believed could create the social conditions of freedom.
despite creative experiments in social policy at the city and state levels the tradition of localism seemed to most progressives an impediment to a renewed sense of national purpose.
poverty economic insecurity and lack of industrial democracy were national problems that demanded national solutions.
the democratic national state wrote new republic editor herbert croly offered an alternative to control of americans lives by narrow interests that manipulated politics or by the all powerful corporations.
croly proposed a new synthesis of american political traditions.
to achieve the jeffersonian ends of democratic self determination and individual freedom he insisted the country needed to employ the hamiltonian means of government intervention in the economy.
each in his own way the how did the progressive presidents foster the rise of the nation state.
progressive presidents theodore roosevelt william howard taft and woodrow wilson tried to address this challenge.
theodore r o o s e v e lt in september 1901 the anarchist leon czolgosz assassinated william mckinley while the president visited the pan american exposition in buffalo new york.
at the age of forty two vice president theodore roosevelt became the youngest man ever to hold the office of president.
roosevelt was an impetuous energetic individual with a penchant for what he called the strenuous life of manly adventure.
in many ways he became the model for the twentieth century president an official actively and continuously engaged in domestic and foreign affairs.
the foreign policies of the progressive presidents will be discussed in the next chapter.
roosevelt regarded the president as the steward of the public welfare he moved aggressively to set the political agenda.
when the british writer h g wells visited the united states soon after the turn of the century he found that the steady trend towards concentration had become the cardinal topic of thought and discussion in the american mind roosevelts program which he called the square deal attempted to confront the problems caused by economic consolidation by distinguishing between good and bad corporations.
the former among which he included u s steel and standard oil served the public interest.
the latter were run by greedy financiers interested only in profit and had no right to exist.
soon after assuming office roosevelt shocked the corporate world by announcing his intention to prosecute under the sherman antitrust act the northern securities company.
created by financier j p morgan this holding company owned the stock and directed the affairs of three major western railroads.
it monopolized transportation between the great lakes and the pacific.
morgan was outraged.
wall street is paralyzed quipped one newspaper at the thought that a president of the united states should sink to enforce the law in 1904 the supreme court ordered northern securities dissolved a major victory for the antitrust movement.
r o o s e v e lt and economic president theodore roosevelt addressing a crowd in evanston illinois in 1902.
regulation roosevelt also believed that the president should be an honest broker in labor disputes rather than automatically siding with employers as his predecessors had usually done.
when a strike paralyzed the west virginia and pennsylvania coalfields in 1902 he summoned union and management leaders to the white house.
by threatening a federal takeover of the mines he persuaded the owners to allow the dispute to be settled by a commission he himself would appoint.
reelected in 1904 roosevelt pushed for more direct federal regulation of the economy.
appealing to the public for support he condemned the misuse of the vast power conferred by vast wealth he proposed to strengthen the interstate commerce commission which the supreme court had essentially limited to collecting economic statistics.
by this time journalistic exposs labor unrest and the agitation of progressive reformers had created significant public support for roosevelts regulatory program.
in 1906 putting the screws on him a 1904 cartoon depicts president theodore roosevelt squeezing ill gotten gains out of the trusts.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 the progressive presidents congress passed the hepburn act giving the icc the power to examine railroads business records and to set reasonable rates a significant step in the development of federal intervention in the corporate economy.
that year as has been noted also saw the pure food and drug act which established a federal agency to police the quality and labeling of food and drugs and the meat inspection act.
many businessmen supported these measures recognizing that they would benefit from greater public confidence in the quality and safety of their products.
but they were alarmed by roosevelts calls for federal inheritance and income taxes and the regulation of all interstate businesses.
the conservation movement a dedicated outdoorsman who built a ranch in north dakota in the 1880s roosevelt also moved to preserve parts of the natural environment from economic exploitation.
if the united states lagged behind europe in many areas of social policy it led the way in the conservation of national resources.
the first national park yellowstone in wyoming had been created in 1872 partly to preserve an area of remarkable natural beauty and partly at the urging of the northern pacific railroad which was anxious to promote western tourism.
in the 1890s the scottish born naturalist john muir organized the sierra club to help preserve forests which he called gods first temples from uncontrolled logging by timber companies and other intrusions of civilization.
congress in that decade authorized the president to withdraw forest reserves from economic development.
it was under roosevelt that conservation became a concerted federal policy.
relying for advice on gifford pinchot the head of the u s forest service he ordered that millions of acres be set aside as wildlife preserves and encouraged congress to create new national parks.
the creation of parks like yellowstone yosemite and glacier required the removal of indians who hunted and fished there as well as the reintroduction of animals that had previously disappeared.
city dwellers who visited the national parks did not realize that these were to a considerable extent artificially created and managed environments not primordial nature.
in some ways conservation was a typical progressive reform.
manned by experts the government could stand above political and economic battles serving the public good while preventing special interests from causing irreparable damage to the environment.
the aim was less to end the economic utilization of natural resources than to develop responsible scientific plans for their use.
pinchot halted timber companies reckless assault on the nations forests.
but unlike muir he believed that development and conservation could go hand in hand and that logging mining and grazing on public lands should be controlled not eliminated.
conservation also reflected the progressive thrust toward efficiency and control in this case control of nature itself.
in the view of progressive conservationists the wests scarcest resource water cried out for regulation.
governments at all levels moved to control the power of western rivers building dams and irrigation projects to regularize their flow prevent waste and provide water for large scale agriculture and urban development.
with such projects came political conflict as cities like los angeles and san francisco battled with rural areas for access to how did the progressive presidents foster the rise of the nation state.
after secretly buying up large tracts of land in the owens valley east of the city for example the city of los angeles constructed a major aqueduct between 1908 and 1913 over the vigorous objections of the valleys residents.
by the 1920s so much water had been diverted to the city that the once thriving farming and ranching businesses of owens valley could no longer operate.
taft in office having served nearly eight years as president roosevelt did not run again in 1908.
his chosen successor was william howard taft a federal judge from ohio who had served as governor of the philippines after the spanishamerican war.
taft defeated william jennings bryan making his third unsuccessful race for the white house.
tafts inaugural address expressed the progressive view of the state the scope of a modern government.
has been widened far beyond the principles laid down by the old laissezfaire school of political writers although temperamentally more conservative than roosevelt taft pursued antitrust policy even more aggressively.
he persuaded the supreme court in 1911 to declare john d rockefellers standard oil company one of roosevelts good trusts in violation of the sherman antitrust act and to order its breakup into separate marketing producing and refining companies.
the government also won a case against american tobacco which the court ordered to end pricing policies that were driving smaller firms out of business.
in these decisions the justices announced a new standard for judging large corporations the rule of reason which in effect implemented roosevelts old distinction between good and bad trusts.
big businesses were not in and of themselves antitrust violators unless they engaged in policies that stifled competition.
taft supported the sixteenth amendment to the constitution which authorized congress to enact a graduated income tax one whose rate of taxation is higher for wealthier citizens.
it was ratified shortly before he left office.
a 2 percent tax on incomes over 4 000 had been included in a tariff enacted in 1894 but had been quickly declared unconstitutional by the supreme court as a communistic threat to property the movement to resurrect the income tax united southern and western farmers who wished to reduce government dependence on revenue from the tariff which they believed discriminated against nonindustrial states and progressives who believed that taxation should be based on the ability to pay.
a key step in the modernization of the federal government the income tax provided a reliable and flexible source of revenue for a national state whose powers responsibilities and expenditures were growing rapidly.
despite these accomplishments taft seemed to gravitate toward the more conservative wing of the republican party.
only a few months after taking office he signed the payne aldrich tariff which reduced rates on imported goods but not nearly as much as reformers wished.
tafts rift with progressives grew deeper when richard a ballinger the new secretary of the interior concluded that roosevelt had exceeded his authority in placing land in forest reserves.
ballinger decided to return some of this land to the public domain where mining and lumber companies would have access to it.
gifford pinchot accused ballinger of colluding with business interests and theodore roosevelt and the conservationist john muir at glacier point yosemite valley california in 1906.
yosemite was set aside as a national park in 1890.
18 the progressive era 1900 1916 the progressive presidents repudiating the environmental goals of the roosevelt administration.
when taft fired pinchot in 1910 the breach with party progressives became irreparable.
in 1912 roosevelt challenged taft for the republican nomination.
defeated roosevelt launched an independent campaign as the head of the new progressive party.
the eugene v debs the socialist party candidate speaking in chicago during the 1912 presidential campaign.
election of all the crosscurrents of progressive era thinking about what mcclures magazine called the problem of the relation of the state and the corporation came together in the presidential campaign of 1912.
the four way contest between taft roosevelt democrat woodrow wilson and socialist eugene v debs became a national debate on the relationship between political and economic freedom in the age of big business.
at one end of the political spectrum stood taft who stressed that economic individualism could remain the foundation of the social order so long as government and private entrepreneurs cooperated in addressing social ills.
at the other end was debs.
relatively few americans supported the socialist partys goal of abolishing the capitalistic system altogether but its immediate demands including public ownership of the railroads and banking system government aid to the unemployed and laws establishing shorter working hours and a minimum wage summarized forward looking progressive thought.
but it was the battle between wilson and roosevelt over the role of the federal government in securing economic freedom that galvanized public attention in 1912.
the two represented competing strands of progressivism.
both believed government action necessary to preserve individual freedom but they differed over the dangers of increasing the governments power and the inevitability of economic concentration.
though representing a party thoroughly steeped in states rights and laissez faire ideology wilson was deeply imbued with progressive ideas.
freedom today he declared is something more than being let alone.
the program of a government of freedom must in these days be positive not negative merely as governor of new jersey wilson had presided over the implementation of a system of workmens compensation and state regulation of utilities and railroads.
new freedom and new nationalism strongly influenced by louis d brandeis with whom he consulted frequently during the campaign wilson insisted that democracy must be reinvigorated by restoring market competition and freeing government from domination by big business.
wilson feared big government as much as he feared the power of the corporations.
the new freedom as he called his program envisioned the federal government strengthening antitrust laws protecting the right of workers to unionize and actively encouraging small businesses creating in other words the conditions for the renewal of economic competition without increasing government regulation of the economy.
wilson warned that corporations were as likely to corrupt government as to be managed by it a forecast that proved remarkably accurate.
how did the progressive presidents foster the rise of the nation state.
to roosevelts supporters wilson seemed a relic of a bygone era his program they argued served the needs of small businessmen but ignored the inevitability of economic concentration and the interests of professionals consumers and labor.
wilson and brandeis spoke of the curse of bigness what the nation actually needed walter lippmann countered was frank acceptance of the benefits of bigness coupled with the intervention of government to counteract its abuses.
lippmann was expressing the core of the new nationalism roosevelts program of 1912.
only the controlling and directing power of the government roosevelt insisted could restore the liberty of the oppressed he called for heavy taxes on personal and corporate fortunes and federal regulation of industries including railroads mining and oil.
the progressive party platform offered numerous proposals to promote social justice.
drafted by a group of settlement house activists labor reformers and social scientists the platform laid out a blueprint for a modern democratic welfare state complete with woman suffrage federal supervision of corporate enterprise national labor and health legislation for women and children an eight hour day and living wage for all workers and a national system of social insurance covering unemployment medical care and old age.
described by roosevelt as the most important document since the end of the civil war the platform brought together many of the streams of thought and political experiences that flowed into progressivism.
roosevelts campaign helped to give freedom a modern social and economic content and established an agenda that would define political liberalism for much of the twentieth century.
wilsons first term the republican split ensured a sweeping victory for wilson who won about 42 percent of the popular vote although roosevelt humiliated taft by winning about 27 percent to the presidents 23 percent.
in office wilson proved himself a strong executive leader.
the presidential he established an office at the capitol so that he could conelection of 1912 fer regularly with members of congress about pending legislation and he was the first president to hold regular press conferences in order to influence public opinion directly 44 6 and continuously.
he delivered messages personally to congress rather than sending them in written form like all his predecessors since john adams.
29 15 3 14 with democrats in control of congress wilson moved 8 12 aggressively to implement his version of progressivism.
the first significant measure of his presidency was the 10 12 14 underwood tariff which substantially reduced duties on imports and to make up for lost revenue imposed a gradu6 ated income tax on the richest 5 percent of americans.
there followed the clayton act of 1914 which exempted electoral vote popular vote labor unions from antitrust laws and barred courts from party candidate share share issuing injunctions curtailing the right to strike.

18 the progressive era 1900 1916 suggested reading nations railroads and the warehouse act reminiscent of the populist subtreasury plan which extended credit to farmers when they stored their crops in federally licensed warehouses.
the expanding role of government some of wilsons policies seemed more in tune with roosevelts new nationalism than the new freedom of 1912.
he abandoned the idea of aggressive trust busting in favor of greater government supervision of the economy.
wilson presided over the creation of two powerful new public agencies.
in 1913 congress created the federal reserve system consisting of twelve regional banks.
they were overseen by a central board appointed by the president and empowered to handle the issuance of currency aid banks in danger of failing and influence interest rates so as to promote economic growth.
the law was a delayed response to the panic of 1907 when the failure of several financial companies threatened a general collapse of the banking system.
with the federal government lacking a modern central bank it had been left to j p morgan to assemble the funds to prop up threatened financial institutions.
morgans actions highlighted the fact that in the absence of federal regulation of banking power over finance rested entirely in private hands.
a second expansion of national power occurred in 1914 when congress established the federal trade commission ftc to investigate and prohibit unfair business activities such as price fixing and monopolistic practices.
both the federal reserve and ftc were welcomed by many business leaders as a means of restoring order to the economic marketplace and warding off more radical measures for curbing corporate power.
but they reflected the remarkable expansion of the federal role in the economy during the progressive era.
by 1916 the social ferment and political mobilizations of the progressive era had given birth to a new american state.
with new laws administrative agencies and independent commissions government at the local state and national levels had assumed the authority to protect and advance industrial freedom government had established rules for labor relations business behavior and financial policy protected citizens from market abuses and acted as a broker among the groups whose conflicts threatened to destroy social harmony.
but a storm was already engulfing europe that would test the progressive faith in empowered government as the protector of american freedom.

l i n 1902 w t stead published a short volume with the arresting title the americanization of the world or the trend of the twentieth century.
stead was an english editor whose sensational writings included an expos of london prostitution maiden tribute of modern babylon.
he would meet his death in 1912 as a passenger on the titanic the ocean liner that foundered after striking an iceberg in the north atlantic.
impressed by americans exuberant energies stead predicted that the united states would soon emerge as the greatest of worldpowers but what was most striking about his work was that stead located the source of american power less in the realm of military might or territorial acquisition than in the countrys single minded commitment to the pursuit of wealth and the relentless international spread of american culture art music journalism even ideas about religion and gender relations.
he foresaw a future in which the united states promoted its interests and values through an unending involvement in the affairs of other nations.
stead proved to be an accurate prophet.
the spanish american war had established the united states as an international empire.
despite the conquest of the philippines and puerto rico however the countrys overseas holdings remained tiny compared to those of britain france and germany.
and no more were added except for a strip of land surrounding the panama canal acquired in 1903 and the virgin islands purchased from denmark in 1917.
in 1900 great britain ruled over more than 300 million people in possessions scattered across the globe and france had nearly 50 million subjects in asia and africa.
compared with these the american presence in the world seemed very small.
as stead suggested americas empire differed significantly from those of european countries it was economic cultural and intellectual rather than territorial.
the world economy at the dawn of the twentieth century was already highly globalized.
an ever increasing stream of goods investments and people flowed from country to country.
although britain still dominated world banking and the british pound remained the major currency of international trade the united states had become the leading industrial power.
by 1914 it produced more than one third of the worlds manufactured goods.
already europeans complained of an american invasion of steel oil agricultural equipment and consumer goods.
spearheads of american culture like movies and popular music were not far behind.
europeans were fascinated by american ingenuity and mass production techniques.
many feared american products and culture would overwhelm their own.

the typewriter.
in every one of these the american maker is supreme meanwhile hundreds of thousands of americans traveled abroad each year in the early twentieth century.
and american racial and ethnic groups became heavily engaged in overseas politics.
through fraternal religious and political organizations based in their ethnic and racial communities irish americans supported irish independence american jews protested the treatment of their co religionists in russia and black americans hoped to uplift africa.
american influence was growing throughout the world.
americas growing connections with the outside world led to increasing military and political involvement.
in the two decades after 1900 many of the basic principles that would guide american foreign policy for the rest of the century were formulated.
the open door the free flow of trade investment information and culture emerged as a key principle of american foreign relations.
since the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market wrote woodrow wilson the flag of his nation must follow him and the doors of nations which are closed against him must be battered down americans in the twentieth century often discussed foreign policy in the language of freedom.
at least in rhetoric the united states ventured abroad including intervening militarily in the affairs of other nations not to pursue strategic goals or to make the world safe for american economic interests but to promote liberty and democracy.
a supreme faith in americas historic destiny and in the righteousness of its ideals enabled the countrys leaders to think of the united states simultaneously as an emerging great power and as the worldwide embodiment of freedom.
more than any other individual woodrow wilson articulated this vision of americas relationship to the rest of the world.
his foreign policy called by historians liberal internationalism rested on the conviction that economic and political progress went hand in hand.
thus greater worldwide freedom would follow inevitably from increased american investment and trade abroad.
frequently during the twentieth century this conviction would serve as a mask for american power and self interest.
it would also inspire sincere efforts to bring freedom to other peoples.
in either case liberal internationalism represented a shift from the nineteenth century tradition of promoting freedom primarily by example to active intervention to remake the world in the american image.
american involvement in world war i provided the first great test of wilsons belief that american power could make the world safe for democracy most progressives embraced the countrys participation in the war believing that the united states could help to spread progressive values throughout the world.
but rather than bringing progressivism to a russian advertisement for the singer sewing machine company one of the many american companies that marketed their goods worldwide in the early twentieth century.

the search for markets overseas would be a recurring theme of twentieth century american foreign policy.
other peoples the war destroyed it at home.
the government quickly came to view critics of american involvement not simply as citizens with a different set of opinions but as enemies of the very ideas of democracy and freedom.
as a result the war produced one of the most sweeping repressions of the right to dissent in all of american history.
an era of intervention just as they expanded the powers of the federal government in domestic affairs the progressive presidents were not reluctant to project american power outside the countrys borders.
at first their interventions were confined to the western hemisphere whose affairs the united states had claimed a special right to oversee ever since the monroe doctrine of 1823.
between 1901 and 1920 u s marines landed in caribbean countries more than twenty times.
usually they were dispatched to create a welcoming in what ways did the progressive presidents promote the expansion of american power overseas.

19 safe for democracy an era of intervention in his first major action in the region roosevelt engineered the separation of panama from colombia in order to facilitate the construction of a canal linking the atlantic and caribbean limon pacific oceans.
the idea of a canal across the fifty one milesea bay colon wide isthmus of panama had a long history.
in 1879 1881 madden the french engineer ferdinand de lesseps attempted to conlake locks gatun struct such a waterway but failed because of inadequate dam na funding and the toll exacted on his workers by yellow fever madden dam vi cha gatio and malaria.
roosevelt had long been a proponent of nne n l american naval development.
he was convinced that a canal darien panama gamboa would facilitate the movement of naval and commercial veslas cascadas g sels between the two oceans.
in 1903 when colombia of paraiso which panama was a part refused to cede land for the project pedro miguel locks lake miraflores roosevelt helped to set in motion an uprising by conspirators panama city lock miraflores locks led by philippe bunau varilla a representative of the panama balboa dam canal company.

like the building of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s independence from colombia the panama and much construction work today it involved the widespread use of canal drastically reduced the time it took immigrant labor.

in keeping with american segregation policies the best jobs were reserved for white americans who lived in their own communities complete with schools churches and libraries.
it also required a massive effort to eradicate the mosquitoes that carried the tropical diseases responsible in part for the failure of earlier french efforts.
when completed in 1914 the canal reduced the sea voyage between the east and west coasts of the united states by 8 000 miles.
i took the canal zone roosevelt exulted.
but the manner in which the canal had been initiated and the continued american rule over the canal zone would long remain a source of tension.
in 1977 president jimmy carter negotiated treaties that led to turning over the canals operation and control of the canal zone to panama in the year 2000 see chapter 26.

this held that the united states had the right to exercise an international police power in the western hemisphere a significant expansion of monroes pledge to defend the hemisphere against european intervention.
early in roosevelts administration british italian and german naval forces blockaded venezuela to ensure the payment of debts to european bankers.
roosevelt persuaded them to withdraw but the incident convinced him that financial instability in the new world would invite intervention from the old.

he soon arranged an executive agreement giving a group of american banks control over dominican finances.
in 1906 he dispatched troops to cuba to oversee a disputed election they remained in the country until 1909.
roosevelt also encouraged investment by american corporations like the united fruit company whose huge banana plantations soon dominated the economies of honduras and costa rica.
roosevelts successor william howard taft landed marines in nicaragua to protect a government friendly to american economic interests.
in general however taft emphasized economic investment and loans from american banks rather than direct military intervention as the best way to spread american influence.
as a result his foreign policy became known as dollar diplomacy.
in honduras nicaragua the dominican republic and even liberia the west african nation established in 1816 as a home for freed american slaves taft pressed for more efficient revenue collection stable government and access to land and labor by american companies.
moral imperialism the son of a presbyterian minister woodrow wilson brought to the presidency a missionary zeal and a sense of his own and the nations moral righteousness.
he appointed as secretary of state william jennings bryan a strong anti imperialist.
wilson repudiated dollar diplomacy and promised a new foreign policy that would respect latin americas independence and free it from foreign economic domination.
but wilson could not abandon the conviction that the united states had a responsibility to teach other peoples the lessons of democracy.
moreover he believed the export of american manufactured goods and investments went hand in hand with the spread of democratic ideals.
to wilson expanding american economic influence served a higher purpose than mere profit.

in 1915 he sent marines to occupy haiti after the government refused to allow american banks to oversee its financial dealings.
in 1916 he established a military government in the dominican republic with the united states controlling the countrys customs collections and paying its debts.
american soldiers remained in the dominican republic until 1924 and in haiti until 1934.
they built roads and schools but did little or nothing to promote democracy.
wilsons foreign policy underscored a paradox of modern american history the presidents who spoke the most about freedom were likely to intervene most frequently in the affairs of other countries.

two years later without wilsons knowledge but with the backing of the u s ambassador and of american companies that controlled mexicos oil and mining industries military commander victoriano huerta assassinated madero and seized power.
wilson was appalled.
the united states he announced would not extend recognition to a government of butchers he would teach latin americans he added to elect good men when civil war broke out in mexico wilson ordered american troops to land at vera cruz to prevent the arrival of weapons meant for huertas forces.
but to wilsons surprise mexicans greeted the marines as invaders rather than liberators.
vera cruz after all was where the forces of the conquistador hernn corts had landed in the sixteenth century and those of winfield scott during the mexican war.
more than 100 mexicans and 19 americans died in the fighting that followed.
huerta left the presidency in 1914 but civil war continued and neither side seemed grateful for wilsons interference.
in 1916 the war spilled over into the united states when pancho villa the leader of one faction attacked columbus new mexico where he killed seventeen americans.
wilson ordered 10 000 troops into northern mexico on an expedition that unsuccessfully sought to arrest villa.
mexico was a warning that it might be more difficult than wilson assumed to use american might to reorder the internal affairs of other nations or to apply moral certainty to foreign policy.
a m e r i c a a n d t h e g r e at wa r in june 1914 a serbian nationalist assassinated archduke franz ferdinand heir to the throne of the austro hungarian empire in sarajevo bosnia.
today sarajevo is the capital of bosnia and herzegovina.
this deed set in motion a chain of events that plunged europe into the most devastating war the world had ever seen.
in the years before 1914 european nations had engaged in a scramble to obtain colonial possessions overseas and had constructed a shifting series of alliances seeking military domination within europe.
in the aftermath of the assassination austria hungary the major power in eastern europe declared war on serbia.
within a little more than a month because of the european powers interlocking military alliances britain france russia and japan the allies found themselves at war with the central powers germany austria hungary and the ottoman empire whose holdings included modern day turkey and much of the middle east.
german forces quickly overran belgium and part of northern france.
the war then settled into a prolonged stalemate with bloody indecisive battles succeeding one another.
new military technologies submarines airplanes machine guns tanks and poison gas produced unprecedented slaughter.
in one five month battle at verdun in 1916 600 000 french and german soldiers perished nearly as many combatants as in the entire wilbur wright who with his brother orville made the first powered flight in 1903 circling the statue of liberty six years later.
world war i would reveal the military uses for this new technology.

its sinking by a german submarine in 1915 strengthened the resolve of those who wished to see the united states enter the european war.
america and the great war american civil war.
by the time the war ended an estimated 10 million soldiers and uncounted millions of civilians had perished.
and the war was followed by widespread famine and a worldwide epidemic of influenza that killed an estimated 21 million people more.
the great war or world war i as it came to be called dealt a severe blow to the optimism and self confidence of western civilization.
for decades philosophers reformers and politicians had hailed the triumph of reason and human progress.
despite increasingly bitter rivalries between european powers especially germany and britain as they competed for political and military dominance at home and carved up asia and africa into rival empires mankind seemed to have moved beyond the time when disputes were settled by war.
the conflict was also a shock to european socialist and labor movements.
of the two great ideologies that had arisen in the nineteenth century nationalism and socialism the former proved more powerful.
karl marx had called on the workers of the world to unite against their oppressors.
instead they marched off to kill each other.
neutrality and preparedness as war engulfed europe americans found themselves sharply divided.
british americans sided with their nation of origin as did many other americans who associated great britain with liberty and democracy and germany with repressive government.
on the other hand germanamericans identified with germany.
irish americans bitterly opposed any aid to the british a sentiment reinforced in 1916 when authorities in london suppressed the easter rebellion an uprising demanding irish independence and executed several of its leaders.
immigrants from the russian empire especially jews had no desire to see the united states aid the czars regime.
indeed the presence of russia the worlds largest despotic state as an ally of britain and france made it difficult to see the war as a clear cut battle between democracy and autocracy.
many feminists pacifists and social reformers moreover had become convinced that peace was essential h o w d i d t h e u n i t e d s t a t e s g e t i n v o l v e d i n wo r l d wa r i.
to further efforts to enhance social justice at home.
they lobbied vigorously against american involvement.
when war broke out in 1914 president wilson proclaimed american neutrality.
but as in the years preceding the war of 1812 naval warfare in europe reverberated in the united states.
britain declared a naval blockade of germany and began to stop american merchant vessels.
germany launched submarine warfare against ships entering and leaving british ports.
in may 1915 a german submarine sank the british liner lusitania which was carrying a large cache of arms off the coast of ireland causing the death of 1 198 passengers including 124 americans.
wilson composed a note of protest so strong that bryan resigned as secretary of state fearing that the president was laying the foundation for military intervention.
bryan had advocated warning americans not to travel on the ships of belligerents but wilson felt this would represent a retreat from the principle of freedom of the seas.
the sinking of the lusitania outraged american public opinion and strengthened the hand of those who believed that the united states must prepare for possible entry into the war.
these included longtime advocates of a stronger military establishment like theodore roosevelt and businessmen with close economic ties to britain the countrys leading trading partner and the recipient of more than 2 billion in wartime loans from american banks.
wilson himself had strong pro british sympathies and viewed germany as the natural foe of liberty by the end of 1915 he had embarked on a policy of preparedness a crash program to expand the american army and navy.
the road to war in may 1916 germany announced the suspension of submarine warfare against noncombatants.
wilsons preparedness program seemed to have succeeded in securing the right of americans to travel freely on the high seas without committing american forces to the conflict.
he kept us out of war became the slogan of his campaign for reelection.
with the republican party reunited after its split in 1912 the election proved to be one of the closest in american history.
wilson defeated republican candidate charles evans hughes by only twenty three electoral votes and about 600 000 popular votes out of more than 18 million cast.
partly because he seemed to promise not to send american soldiers to europe wilson carried ten of the twelve states that had adopted woman suffrage.
without the votes of women wilson would not have been reelected.
on january 22 1917 wilson called for a peace without victory in europe and outlined his vision for a world order including freedom of the seas restrictions a 1916 wilson campaign truck a new development in political campaigning promising peace prosperity and preparedness.
19 safe for democracy america and the great war on armaments and self determination for nations great and small.
almost immediately however germany announced its intention to resume submarine warfare against ships sailing to or from the british isles and several american merchant vessels were sunk.
the german government realized that its actions would probably lead wilson to intervene but german strategists gambled that the blockade would strangle britain economically before the arrival of american troops.
in march 1917 british spies intercepted and made public the zimmerman telegram a message by german foreign secretary arthur zimmerman calling on mexico to join in a coming war against the united states and promising to help it recover territory lost in the mexican war of 1846 1848.
a revolution in russia that same month overthrew the czar and established a constitutional government making it more plausible to believe that the united states would be fighting on the side of democracy.
on april 2 wilson went before congress to ask for a declaration of war against germany.
the world he proclaimed must be made safe for democracy.
its peace must be planted upon the tested foundation of political liberty the war resolution passed the senate 82 6 and the house 373 50.
the fourteen points not until the spring of 1918 did american forces arrive in europe in large numbers.
by then the world situation had taken a dramatic turn.
in november 1917 a communist revolution headed by vladimir lenin overthrew the russian government that had come to power the previous spring.
shortly thereafter lenin withdrew russia from the war and published the secret treaties by which the allies had agreed to divide up conquered territory after the war an embarrassment for wilson who had promised a just peace.
partly to assure the country that the war was being fought for a moral cause wilson in january 1918 issued the fourteen points the clearest statement of american war aims and of his vision of a new international order.
among the key principles were self determination for all nations freedom of the seas free trade open diplomacy an end to secret treaties the readjustment of colonial claims with colonized people given equal weight in deciding their futures and the creation of a general association of nations to preserve the peace.
wilson envisioned this last provision which led to the establishment after the war of the league of nations as a kind of global counterpart to the regulatory commissions progressives had created at home to maintain social harmony and prevent the powerful from exploiting the weak.
although purely an american program not endorsed by the other allies the fourteen points established the agenda for the peace conference that followed the war.
the united states threw its economic resources and manpower into the war.
when american troops finally arrived in europe they turned the tide of battle.
in the spring of 1918 they helped to repulse a german advance near paris and by july were participating in a major allied counteroffensive.
in september in the meuse argonne campaign more than 1 million american soldiers under general john j pershing helped to push back the outnumbered and exhausted german army.

to them the war offered the possibility of reforming american society along scientific lines instilling a sense of national unity and self sacrifice and expanding social justice.
that american power could now disseminate progressive values around the globe heightened the wars appeal.

19 safe for democracy the war at home almost without exception progressive intellectuals and reformers joined by prominent labor leaders and native born socialists rallied to wilsons support.
the roster included intellectuals like john dewey journalists such as walter lippmann and herbert croly afl head samuel gompers socialist writers like upton sinclair and prominent reformers including florence kelley and charlotte perkins gilman.
in the new republic dewey urged progressives to recognize the social possibilities of war the crisis he wrote offered the prospect of attacking the immense inequality of power within the united states thus laying the foundation for americans to enjoy effective freedom the wartime state like the civil war world war i created albeit temporarily a national state with unprecedented powers and a sharply increased presence in americans everyday lives.
under the selective service act of may 1917 24 million men were required to register with the draft and the army soon swelled from 120 000 to 5 million men.
the war seemed to bring into being the new nationalist state theodore roosevelt and so many progressives had desired.
new federal agencies moved to regulate industry transportation labor relations and agriculture.
headed by wall street financier bernard baruch the war industries board presided over all elements of war production from the distribution of raw materials to the prices of manufactured goods.
to spur efficiency it established standardized specifications for everything from automobile tires to shoe colors three were permitted black brown and white.
the railroad administration took control of the nations transportation system and the fuel agency rationed coal and oil.

how did the united states mobilize resources and public opinion for the war effort.
these agencies generally saw themselves as partners of business as much as regulators.
they guaranteed government suppliers a high rate of profit and encouraged cooperation among former business rivals by suspending antitrust laws.
at the same time however the war labor board which included representatives of government industry and the american federation of labor pressed for the establishment of a minimum wage eight hour workday and the right to form unions.
during the war wages rose substantially working conditions in many industries improved and union membership doubled.
to finance the war corporate and individual income taxes rose enormously.
by 1918 the wealthiest americans were paying 60 percent of their income in taxes.
tens of millions of americans answered the call to demonstrate their patriotism by purchasing liberty bonds.
once peace arrived the wartime state quickly withered away.
but for a time the federal government seemed well on its way to fulfilling the progressive task of promoting economic rationalization industrial justice and a sense of common national purpose.
the propaganda war during the civil war it had been left to private agencies union leagues the loyal publication society and others to mobilize prowar public opinion.
but the wilson administration decided that patriotism was too important to leave to the private sector.
many americans were skeptical about whether democratic america should enter a struggle between rival empires.
some vehemently opposed american participation notably the industrial workers of the world iww and the bulk of the socialist party which in 1917 condemned the declaration of war as a crime against the people of the united states and called on the workers of all countries to refuse to fight.
as the major national organization to oppose wilsons policy the socialist party became a rallying point for antiwar sentiment.
in mayoral elections across the country in the fall of 1917 the socialist vote averaged 20 percent far above the partys previous total.
in april 1917 the wilson administration created the committee on public information cpi to explain to americans and the world as its director george creel put it the cause that compelled america to take arms in defense of its liberties and free institutions enlisting academics journalists artists and advertising men the cpi flooded the country with prowar propaganda using every available medium from pamphlets of which it issued 75 million to posters newspaper advertisements and motion pictures.
it trained and dispatched across the country 75 000 fourminute men who delivered brief standardized talks sometimes in italian yiddish and other immigrant languages to audiences in movie theaters schools and other public venues.
never before had an agency of the federal government attempted the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses in the words of young edward bernays a member of creels staff who would later create the modern profession of public relations.
the cpis activities proved one adman wrote that it was possible to sway the ideas of whole populations change their habits of life create belief practically universal in any policy or idea in the 1920s advertisers a poster addressed to jewish immigrants by the u s food administration proclaims food will win the war it adds you came here seeking freedom now you must help preserve it copies were also printed in other european languages.

women during world war i two women hauling ice a job confined to men before the war and woman suffrage demonstrators in front of the white house.
great cause of freedom the cpi couched its appeal in the progressive language of social cooperation and expanded democracy.
abroad this meant a peace based on the principle of national self determination.
at home it meant improving industrial democracy a progressive journalist creel believed the war would accelerate the movement toward solving the age old problems of poverty inequality oppression and unhappiness he took to heart a warning from historian carl becker that a simple contrast between german tyranny and american democracy would not seem plausible to the average worker you talk to him of our ideals of liberty and he thinks of the shameless exploitation of labor and of the ridiculous gulf between wealth and poverty the cpi distributed pamphlets foreseeing a postwar society complete with a universal eight hour day and a living wage for all.
while democracy served as the key term of wartime mobilization freedom also took on new significance.
the war a cpi advertisement proclaimed was being fought in the great cause of freedom thousands of persons often draftees were enlisted to pose in giant human tableaus representing symbols of liberty.
one living representation of the liberty bell at fort dix new jersey included 25 000 people.
the most common visual image in wartime propaganda was the statue of liberty employed especially to rally support among immigrants.
you came here seeking freedom stated a caption on one statue of liberty poster.
you must now help preserve it buying liberty bonds became a demonstration of patriotism.
wilsons speeches cast the united states as a land of liberty fighting alongside a concert of free people to secure self determination for the oppressed peoples of the world.
the idea of freedom it seems requires an antithesis and the cpi found one in the german kaiser and more generally the german nation and people.
government propaganda whipped up hatred of the wartime foe by portraying it as a nation of barbaric huns.
how did the united states mobilize resources and public opinion for the war effort.
the coming of woman suffrage the enlistment of democracy and freedom as ideological war weapons inevitably inspired demands for their expansion at home.
in 1916 wilson had cautiously endorsed votes for women.
americas entry into the war threatened to tear the suffrage movement apart since many advocates had been associated with opposition to american involvement.
indeed among those who voted against the declaration of war was the first woman member of congress the staunch pacifist jeannette rankin of montana.
i want to stand by my country but i cannot vote for war she said.
although defeated in her reelection bid in 1918 rankin would return to congress in 1940.
she became the only member to oppose the declaration of war against japan in 1941 which ended her political career.
in 1968 at the age of eighty five rankin took part in a giant march on washington to protest the war in vietnam.
as during the civil war however most leaders of woman suffrage organizations enthusiastically enlisted in the effort.
women sold war bonds organized patriotic rallies and went to work in war production jobs.
some 22 000 served as clerical workers and nurses with american forces in europe.
many believed wartime service would earn them equal rights at home.
at the same time a new generation of college educated activists organized in the national womens party pressed for the right to vote with militant tactics many older suffrage advocates found scandalous.
the partys leader alice paul had studied in england between 1907 and 1910 when the british suffrage movement adopted a strategy that included arrests imprisonments and vigorous denunciations of a male dominated political system.
how could the country fight for democracy abroad paul asked while denying it to women at home.
she compared wilson to the kaiser and a group of her followers chained themselves to the white house fence a 1915 cartoon showing the western states where women had won the right to vote.

the combination of womens patriotic service and widespread outrage over the mistreatment of paul and her fellow prisoners pushed the administration toward full fledged support for woman suffrage.
we have made partners of the women in this war wilson proclaimed.
shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right in 1920 the long struggle ended with the ratification of the nineteenth amendment barring states from using sex as a qualification for the suffrage.
the united states became the twentyseventh country to allow women to vote.
in the early years of the twentieth century many states and localities in the south and west banned the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages.
wet counties allowed alcoholic beverages dry counties banned them.
prohibition became national with the adoption of the eighteenth amendment in 1919.
prohibition the war gave a powerful impulse to other campaigns that had engaged the energies of many women in the progressive era.
ironically efforts to stamp out prostitution and protect soldiers from venereal disease led the government to distribute birth control information and devices the very action for which margaret sanger had recently been jailed as noted in the previous chapter.

prohibition a movement inherited from the nineteenth century that had gained new strength and militancy in progressive america finally achieved national success during the war.
numerous impulses flowed into the renewed campaign to ban intoxicating liquor.
employers hoped it would create a more disciplined labor force.
urban reformers believed that it would promote a more orderly city environment and undermine urban political machines that used saloons as places to organize.
women reformers hoped prohibition would protect wives and children from husbands who engaged in domestic violence when drunk or who squandered their wages at saloons.
many native born protestants saw prohibition as a way of imposing american values on immigrants.
like the suffrage movement prohibitionists first concentrated on state campaigns.
by 1915 they had won victories in eighteen southern and midwestern states where the immigrant population was small and protestant denominations like baptists and methodists strongly opposed drinking.

failed to speak out against the broad suppression of freedom of expression.
civil liberties by and large had never been a major concern of progressives who had always viewed the national state as the embodiment of democratic purpose and insisted that freedom flowed from participating in the life of society not standing in opposition.
strong believers in the use of national power to improve social conditions progressives found themselves ill prepared to develop a defense of minority rights against majority or governmental tyranny.
from the afl to new republic intellectuals moreover supporters of the war saw the elimination of socialists and alien radicals as a necessary prelude to the integration of labor and immigrants into an ordered society an outcome they hoped would emerge from the war.
who is an american.
in many respects progressivism was a precursor to major developments of the twentieth century the new deal the great society the socially active state.
but in accepting the idea of race as a permanent defining characteristic of individuals and social groups progressives bore more resemblance to nineteenth century thinkers than to later twentieth century liberals with whom they are sometimes compared.
the race problem even before american participation in world war i what contemporaries called the race problem the tensions that arose from the countrys increasing ethnic diversity had become a major subject of public concern.
race referred to far more than black white relations.
the dictionary of races of peoples published in 1911 by the u s immigration commission listed no fewer than forty five immigrant races each supposedly with its own inborn characteristics.
they ranged from anglo saxons at the top down to hebrews northern italians and lowest of all southern italians supposedly violent undisciplined and incapable of assimilation.
in 1907 congress had decreed that an american woman who married an alien automatically forfeited her american citizenship.
popular best sellers like the passing of the great race published in 1916 by madison grant president of the new york zoological society warned that the influx of new immigrants and the low birthrate of native white women threatened the foundations of american civilization.
the new science of eugenics which studied the alleged mental characteristics of different races gave antiimmigrant sentiment an air of professional expertise.
if democracy could not flourish in the face of vast inequalities of economic power neither most progressives believed could it survive in a nation permanently divided along racial and ethnic lines.
americanization and pluralism somehow the very nationalization of politics and economic life served to heighten awareness of ethnic and racial difference and spurred demands for americanization the creation of a more homogeneous national culture.

by 1914 german americans numbered nearly 9 million including immigrants and persons of german parentage.
they had created thriving ethnic institutions including clubs sports associations schools and theaters.
on the eve of the war many americans admired german traditions in literature music and philosophy and one quarter of all the high school students in the country studied the german language.
but after american entry into the war the use of german and expressions of german culture became a target of prowar organizations.
in iowa governor william l harding issued a proclamation requiring that all oral communication in schools public places and over the telephone be conducted in english.

groups and apart asian mexicans puerto ricans americans no matter how coercive americanization programs assumed that european immigrants and especially their children could eventually adjust to the conditions of american life embrace american ideals and become productive citizens enjoying the full blessings of american freedom.
this assumption did not apply to non white immigrants or to blacks.

the war led to further growth of the southwests mexican population.
wartime demand for labor from the areas mine owners and large farmers led the government to exempt mexicans temporarily from the literacy test enacted in 1917.
mexicans were legally classified as white and many progressive reformers viewed the growing mexican population as candidates for americanization.

phoenix arizona established separate public schools for indians mexicans blacks and whites.
puerto ricans also occupied an ambiguous position within american society.
on the eve of american entry into world war i congress terminated the status citizen of puerto rico and conferred american citizenship on residents of the island.
the aim was to dampen support for puerto rican independence and to strengthen the american hold on a strategic outpost in the caribbean.
the change did not grant islanders the right to vote for president or representation in congress.
puerto rican men nonetheless were subject to the draft and fought overseas.
jos de diego the speaker of the house of the islands legislature wrote the president in 1917 asking that puerto rico be granted the democracy the united states was fighting for in europe.

born in great barrington massachusetts in 1868 and educated at fisk and harvard universities du bois lived to his ninety fifth year.
the unifying theme of his career was du boiss effort to reconcile the contradiction between what he called american freedom for whites and the continuing subjection of negroes his book the souls of black folk 1903 issued a clarion call for blacks dissatisfied with the accommodationist policies of booker t washington to press for equal rights.
du bois believed that educated african americans like himself the talented tenth of the black community must use their education and training to challenge inequality.
in some ways du bois was a typical progressive who believed that investigation exposure and education would lead to solutions for social problems.
as a professor at atlanta university he projected a grandiose plan for decades of scholarly study of black life in order to make the country aware of racism and point the way toward its elimination.
but he also understood the necessity of political action.
in 1905 du bois gathered a group of black leaders at niagara falls meeting on the canadian side since no american hotel would provide accommodations and organized the niagara movement which sought to reinvigorate the abolitionist tradition.
we claim for ourselves du bois wrote in the groups manifesto every single right that belongs to a freeborn american political civil and social and until we get these rights we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of america the declaration of principles adopted at niagara falls called for restoring to blacks the right to vote an end to racial segregation and complete equality in economic and educational opportunity.
these would remain the cornerstones of the black struggle for racial justice for decades to come.

with the notable exception of william monroe trotter most black leaders saw american participation in the war as an opportunity to make real the promise of freedom.
to trotter much publicized german atrocities were no worse than american lynchings rather than making the world safe for democracy the government should worry about making the south safe for the negroes yet the black press rallied to the war.
du bois himself in a widely reprinted editorial in the naacps monthly magazine the crisis called on africanamericans to close ranks and enlist in the army to help make our own america a real land of the free black participation in the civil war had helped to secure the destruction of slavery and the achievement of citizenship.
but during world war i closing ranks did not bring significant gains.
the navy barred blacks entirely and the segregated army confined most of the 400 000 blacks who served in the war to supply units rather than combat.
wilson feared as he noted in his diary that the overseas experience would go to their heads and the u s army campaigned strenuously to persuade the french not to treat black soldiers as equals not to eat or socialize with them or even shake their hands.

president why not make america safe for democracy in the new densely populated black ghettos of the north widespread support emerged for the universal negro improvement association a movement for african independence and black self reliance launched by marcus garvey a recent immigrant from jamaica.
freedom for garveyites meant national self determination.
blacks they insisted should enjoy the same internationally recognized identity enjoyed by other peoples in the aftermath of the war.
everywhere we hear the cry of freedom garvey proclaimed in 1921.
we desire a freedom that will lift us to the common standard of all men.
freedom that will give us a chance and opportunity to rise to the fullest of our ambition and that we cannot get in countries where other men rule and dominate du bois and other established black leaders viewed garvey as little more than a demagogue.
they applauded when the government deported him after a conviction for mail fraud.
but the massive following his movement achieved testified to the sense of betrayal that had been kindled in black communities during and after the war.
a worldwide upsurge the combination of militant hopes for social change and disappointment with the wars outcome was evident far beyond the black community.
in the union of soviet socialist republics or soviet union as russia had been renamed after the revolution lenins government had nationalized landholdings banks and factories and proclaimed the socialist dream of a workers government.
the russian revolution and the democratic aspirations unleashed by world war i sent tremors of hope and fear throughout the world.
like 1848 and in the future 1968 1919 was a year of worldwide social and political upheaval.
inspired by lenins call for revolution communist led governments came to power in bavaria a part of germany and hungary.

in spain anarchist peasants began seizing land.
crowds in india challenged british rule and nationalist movements in other colonies demanded independence.

the worldwide revolutionary upsurge produced a countervailing mobilization by opponents of radical change.
even as they fought the germans why was 1919 such a watershed year for the united states and the world.
the allies viewed the soviet government as a dire threat and attempted to overturn it.
in the summer of 1918 allied expeditionary forces british french japanese and americans landed in russia to aid lenins opponents in the civil war that had engulfed the country.
the last of them did not leave until 1920.
wilsons policies toward the soviet union revealed the contradictions within the liberal internationalist vision.
on the one hand in keeping with the principles of the fourteen points and its goal of a worldwide economic open door wilson hoped to foster trade with the new government.
on the other fear of communism as a source of international instability and a threat to private property inspired military intervention in russia.
the allies did not invite the soviet union to the versailles peace conference and wilson refused to extend diplomatic recognition to lenins government.
the soviet regime survived but in the rest of the world the tide of change receded.
by the fall the mass strikes had been suppressed and conservative governments had been installed in central europe.
anticommunism would remain a pillar of twentieth century american foreign policy.
upheaval in america in the united states 1919 also brought unprecedented turmoil.
it seemed all the more disorienting for occurring in the midst of a worldwide flu epidemic that killed between 20 and 40 million persons including nearly 700 000 americans.
racial violence as noted above was widespread.
in june bombs exploded at the homes of prominent americans including the attorney general a mitchell palmer who escaped uninjured.
among aggrieved american workers wartime language linking patriotism with democracy and freedom inspired hopes that an era of social justice and economic empowerment was at hand.
in 1917 wilson had told the afl while we are fighting for freedom we must see to it among other things that labor is free labor took him seriously more seriously it seems than wilson intended.
the government as one machinist put it had proclaimed to the world that the freedom and democracy we are fighting for shall be practiced in the industries of america by the wars end many americans believed that the country stood on the verge of what herbert hoover called a new industrial order sidney hillman leader of the garment workers union was one of those caught up in the utopian dreams inspired by the war and reinforced by the russian revolution.
one can hear the footsteps of the deliverer he wrote.
labor will rule and the world will be free in 1919 more than 4 million workers engaged in strikes the greatest wave of labor unrest in american history.
there were walkouts among many others by textile workers telephone operators and broadway actors.
throughout the country workers appropriated the imagery and rhetoric of the war parading in army uniforms with liberty buttons denouncing their employers as kaisers and demanding freedom in the workplace they were met by an unprecedented mobilization of employers government and private patriotic organizations.

their strike was ended by a court injunction obtained by attorney general palmer.
the an advertisement placed by a steel company in a pittsburgh newspaper announces in several languages that the steel strike of 1919 has failed the use of the figure of uncle sam illustrates how the companies clothed their anti union stance in the language of patriotism.
steel strike the wartime rhetoric of economic democracy and freedom helped to inspire the eras greatest labor uprising the 1919 steel strike.
centered in chicago it united some 365 000 mostly immigrant workers in demands for union recognition higher wages and an eight hour workday.
before 1917 the steel mills were little autocracies where managers arbitrarily established wages and working conditions and suppressed all efforts at union organizing.
during the war workers flooded into the amalgamated association the union that had been nearly destroyed by its defeat at homestead a generation earlier.
by the end of 1918 they had won an eighthour day.
employers anti union activities resumed following the armistice that ended the fighting.
for why this war asked one polish immigrant steelworker at a union meeting.
for why we buy liberty bonds.
for the mills.
no for freedom and america for everybody.
no more work like a horse and wagon.
for eight hour day in response to the strike steel magnates launched a concerted counterattack.
employers appealed to anti immigrant sentiment among native born workers many of whom returned to work and conducted a propaganda campaign that associated the strikers with the iww communism and disloyalty.
americanism vs alienism was the issue of the strike declared the new york tribune.
with middle class opinion having turned against the labor movement and the police in pittsburgh assaulting workers on the streets the strike collapsed in early 1920.
the local police with literature seized from a communist party office in cambridge massachusetts november 1919.
great red scare many progressives hoped to see the wartime apparatus of economic planning continue after 1918.
the wilson administration however quickly dismantled the agencies that had established controls over industrial production and the labor market although during the 1930s they would serve as models for some policies of franklin d roosevelts new deal.
wartime repression of dissent however continued.
it reached its peak with the red scare of 1919 1920 a short lived but intense period of political intolerance inspired by the postwar strike wave and the social tensions and fears generated by the russian revolution.

1919 and january 1920 dispatched federal agents to raid the offices of radical and labor organizations throughout the country.
they carried search warrants so broad that they reminded those with a sense of history of the writs of assistance against which james otis had eloquently protested as being destructive of liberty in 1761.
the palmer raids were overseen by the twenty four year old director of the radical division of the justice department j edgar hoover.
more than 5 000 persons were arrested most of them without warrants and held for months without charge.
the government deported hundreds of immigrant radicals including emma goldman the prominent radical speaker mentioned in the previous chapter.
hoover also began compiling files on thousands of americans suspected of holding radical political ideas a practice he would later continue as head of the federal bureau of investigation.
the abuse of civil liberties in early 1920 was so severe that palmer came under heavy criticism from congress and much of the press.
secretary of labor louis post began releasing imprisoned immigrants and the red scare collapsed.
even the explosion of a bomb outside the new york stock exchange in september 1920 which killed forty persons failed to rekindle it.
the perpetrators of this terrorist explosion the worst on american soil until the oklahoma city bombing of 1995 were never identified.
the reaction to the palmer raids planted the seeds for a new appreciation of the importance of civil liberties that would begin to flourish during the 1920s.
but in their immediate impact the events of 1919 and 1920 dealt a devastating setback to radical and labor organizations of all kinds and kindled an intense identification of patriotic americanism with support for the political and economic status quo.
the iww had been effectively destroyed and many moderate unions lay in disarray.
the socialist party crumbled under the weight of governmental repression the new york legislature expelled five socialist members and congress denied victor berger the seat to which he had been elected from wisconsin and internal differences over the russian revolution.
wilson at versailles the beating back of demands for fundamental social change was a severe rebuke to the hopes with which so many progressives had enlisted in the war effort.
wilsons inability to achieve a just peace based on the fourteen points compounded the sense of failure.
late in 1918 the president traveled to france to attend the versailles peace conference.
greeted by ecstatic paris crowds he declared that american soldiers had come to europe as crusaders not merely to win a war but to win a cause.
to lead the world on the way of liberty but he proved a less adept negotiator than part of the crowd that greeted president woodrow wilson in november 1918 when he traveled to paris to take part in the peace conference.

the versailles treaty did accomplish some of wilsons goals.

the treaty placed strict limits on the size of germanys future world war i and the versailles treaty redrew the map of europe and the middle east.

lloyd george persuaded wilson to agree to a clause declaring germany morally responsible for the war and setting astronomical reparations payments they were variously estimated at between 33 billion and 56 billion which crippled the german economy.
the wilsonian moment to many people around the world the great war seemed like a civil war among the nations of europe.
the carnage destroyed european claims that theirs was a higher civilization which gave them the right to rule over more barbaric peoples.
in this sense it helped to heighten the international prestige of the united states a latecomer to the war.
like the ideals of the american revolution the wilsonian rhetoric of self determination reverberated across the globe especially among oppressed minorities including blacks in the united states and colonial peoples seeking independence.
in fact these groups took wilsons rhetoric more seriously than he did.

he was among those disappointed by the failure of the versailles peace conference to apply the principle of self determination to the colonial world.
annexation of the philippines believing that colonial peoples required a long period of tutelage before they were ready for independence.
nonetheless wilsonian ideals quickly spread around the globe not simply the idea that government must rest on the consent of the governed but also wilsons stress on the equality of nations large and small and that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means rather than armed conflict.
these stood in sharp contrast to the imperial ideas and practices of europe.
in eastern europe whose people sought to carve new independent nations from the ruins of the austro hungarian and ottoman empires many considered wilson a popular saint the leading arabic newspaper al ahram published in egypt then under british rule gave extensive coverage to wilsons speech asking congress to declare war in the name of democracy and to the fourteen points and translated the declaration of independence into arabic for its readers.
in beijing students demanding that china free itself of foreign domination gathered at the american embassy shouting long live wilson japan proposed to include in the charter of the new league of nations a clause recognizing the equality of all people regardless of race.
hundreds of letters petitions and declarations addressed to president wilson made their way to the paris headquarters of the american delegation to the peace conference.
few reached the president as his private secretary gilbert close carefully screened his mail.
outside of europe however the idea of self determination was stillborn.
when the peace conference opened secretary of state robert lansing warned that the phrase was loaded with dynamite and would raise hopes which can never be realized wilsons language he feared had put dangerous ideas into the minds of certain races and would inspire impossible demands and cause trouble in many lands as lansing anticipated advocates of colonial independence descended on paris to lobby the peace negotiators.
arabs demanded that a unified independent state be carved from the old ottoman empire in the middle east.
nguyen that thanh a young vietnamese patriot working in paris pressed his peoples claim for greater rights within the french empire.
citing the declaration of independence he appealed unsuccessfully to wilson to help bring an end to french rule in vietnam.
du bois organized a pan african congress in paris that put forward the idea of a self governing nation to be carved out of germanys african colonies.
koreans indians irish and others also pressed claims for self determination.
the british and french however had no intention of applying this principle to their own empires.
they rebuffed the pleas of colonial peoples for self rule.
during the war the british had encouraged arab nationalism as a weapon against the ottoman empire and had also pledged to create a homeland in palestine for the persecuted jews of europe.
in fact the victors of world war i divided ottoman territory into a series of new territories including syria lebanon iraq and palestine controlled by the victorious allies under league of nations mandates south africa australia and japan acquired former german colonies in africa and asia.
nor did ireland achieve its independence at versailles.
only at the end of 1921 did britain finally agree to the creation of the irish free state while continuing to rule the northeastern corner of the island.
as for the japanese proposal to establish the principle of racial equality wilson with the support of great britain and australia engineered its defeat.
why was 1919 such a watershed year for the united states and the world.
the seeds of wars to come du bois as noted above had hoped that black participation in the war effort would promote racial justice at home and self government for colonies abroad.
we return he wrote in the crisis in may 1919 we return from fighting we return fighting.
make way for democracy but the wars aftermath both in the united states and overseas left him bitterly disappointed.
du bois concluded that wilson had never at any single moment meant to include in his democracy black americans or the colonial peoples of the world.
most men today he complained cannot conceive of a freedom that does not involve somebodys slavery in 1903 in the souls of black folk du bois had made the memorable prediction that the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line he now forecast a fight for freedom that would pit black and brown and yellow men throughout the world against racism and imperialism.
disappointment at the failure to apply the fourteen points to the noneuropean world created a pervasive cynicism about western use of the language of freedom and democracy.
wilsons apparent willingness to accede to the demands of the imperial powers helped to spark a series of popular protest movements across the middle east and asia and the rise of a new anti western nationalism.
it inspired the may 4 movement in china a mass protest against the decision at the versailles peace conference to award certain german concessions parts of china governed by foreign powers to japan.
some leaders like nguyen that thanh who took the name ho chi minh turned to communism in whose name he would lead vietnams long and bloody struggle for independence.
the soviet leader lenin in fact had spoken of the right of nations to self determination before wilson and with the collapse of the wilsonian moment.
lenins reputation in the colonial world began to eclipse that of the american president.
but whether communist or not these movements announced the emergence of anticolonial nationalism as a major force in world affairs which it would remain for the rest of the twentieth century.
your liberalness one egyptian leader remarked speaking of britain and america is only for yourselves yet ironically when colonial peoples demanded to be recognized as independent members of the international community they would invoke both the heritage of the american revolution the first colonial struggle that produced an independent nation and the wilsonian language whereby the self governing nationstate is the most legitimate political institution and all nations deserve equal respect.
as du bois recognized world war i sowed the seeds not of a lasting peace but of wars to come.
german resentment over the peace terms would help to fuel the rise of adolf hitler and the coming of world war ii.
in the breakup of czechoslovakia and yugoslavia violence over the status of northern ireland and the seemingly unending conflict in the middle east between arabs and israelis the world was still haunted by the ghost of versailles.

19 safe for democracy interrupting the ceremony a 1918 cartoon from the chicago tribune depicts senate opponents of the versailles treaty arriving just in time to prevent the united states from becoming permanently ensnared in foreign entanglements through the league of nations.
suggested reading americans feared that membership in the league would commit the united states to an open ended involvement in the affairs of other countries.
wilson asserted that the united states could not save the world without being continually involved with it.
his opponents led by senator henry cabot lodge of massachusetts argued that the league threatened to deprive the country of its freedom of action.
a considerable majority of senators would have accepted the treaty with reservations ensuring that the obligation to assist league members against attack did not supercede the power of congress to declare war.
as governor of new jersey and as president wilson had proved himself to be a skilled politician capable of compromising with opponents.
in this case however convinced that the treaty reflected the hand of god wilson refused to negotiate with congressional leaders.
in october 1919 in the midst of the league debate wilson suffered a serious stroke.
although the extent of his illness was kept secret he remained incapacitated for the rest of his term.
in effect his wife edith headed the government for the next seventeen months.
in november 1919 and again in march 1920 the senate rejected the versailles treaty.
american involvement in world war i lasted barely nineteen months but it cast a long shadow over the following decade and indeed the rest of the century.
in its immediate aftermath the country retreated from international involvements.
but in the long run wilsons combination of idealism and power politics had an enduring impact.
his appeals to democracy open markets and a special american mission to instruct the world in freedom coupled with a willingness to intervene abroad militarily to promote american interests and values would create the model for twentieth century american international relations.
on its own terms the war to make the world safe for democracy failed.
even great powers cannot always bend the world to their purposes.
the war brought neither stability nor democracy to most of the world and it undermined freedom in the united states.
it also led to the eclipse of progressivism.

hardings campaign centered on a return to normalcy and a repudiation of what he called wilsonism he received 60 percent of the popular vote.

these years witnessed the great depression 1929 1939 world war ii 1939 1945 and the advent of a cold war that pitted the united states and the soviet union former wartime allies against each other in a global contest for power.
these epochal events produced the deaths of tens of millions of people and wreaked economic havoc on hundreds of millions of others.
by the end of this period the united states and the world lived with the anxiety caused by the constant threat of nuclear war.
these developments could not have been anticipated in the immediate aftermath of world war i.
after that conflict the united states withdrew from active involvement in international affairs and enjoyed a decade of economic prosperity.
during the 1920s conservatism dominated the political arena.
the labor movement suffered setback after setback the government turned its back on many of the reforms of the progressive era and organized feminism faded from the public sphere.
a nineteenthcentury understanding of freedom based on liberty of contract in an unregulated marketplace much criticized in the years before world war i gained a new lease on life during the administrations of warren g harding and calvin coolidge.
if political dissent faded during the 1920s cultural differences seemed stronger than ever.
in the name of personal freedom many americans embraced a new culture centered in the nations cities based on consumption and enjoyment of new mass forms of leisure and entertainment including radio and motion pictures.
other americans living in rural areas of the south and west where traditional religion still held sway saw the new urban culture not as an expansion of freedom but as a threat to an understanding of freedom rooted in long established moral values.
during the 1920s debates over immigration prohibition the teaching of darwins theory of evolution in public schools and the behavior of young sexually liberated women in the nations cities reflected the tension between older and newer cultures each with its own definition of freedom.
the heady days of the 1920s came to an abrupt end with the stock market crash of 1929 which ushered in the great depression the greatest economic crisis in american history.
with the federal government unable to reverse the economic decline or relieve widespread distress the election of 1932 brought to the presidency franklin d roosevelt who promised a new deal for the american people.
roosevelt presided over a profound political and social transformation in government society and the understandings of freedom.
during his presidency the federal government undertook unprecedented initiatives in an attempt to stimulate economic recovery and expand americans economic liberties.
the government determined what farmers could plant required employers to deal with unions insured bank deposits regulated the stock market loaned money to home owners and provided payments to a majority of the elderly and unemployed.
it transformed the physical environment through hydroelectric dams reforestation projects and rural electrification.
under roosevelts leadership the democratic party was transformed into a coalition of farmers white southerners urban working class voters representing numerous ethnic groups and northern african americans.
it dominated national politics for many years.
the new deal helped to inspire and was powerfully influenced by a popular upsurge that redefined the idea of freedom to include a public guarantee of economic security for ordinary citizens.
even as the united states struggled with the economic crisis events abroad drew the country into the largest war in human history.
the rise of powerful dictatorships bent on military expansion germany in europe and japan in asia led inexorably to world war ii.
most americans hoped to remain aloof from the crisis.
this isolationism restrained roosevelts efforts to aid those fighting germany even though he saw hitlers conquests in europe as a threat to american security.
when the japanese attacked the american naval base at pearl harbor hawaii on december 7 1941 the united states entered the war.
world war ii expanded even further the size and power of the national government.
war production finally ended the depression and drew millions of americans from rural areas into the army or to industrial centers in the north and west.
the four freedoms roosevelts statement of allied war aims became the wartime rallying cry.
unlike during world war i the federal government promoted group equality as central to american freedom although the internment of more than 100 000 japanese americans revealed the limits of racial tolerance.
the war also placed on the national agenda for the first time since reconstruction the contradiction between the nations rhetoric of freedom and the condition of its black population.
it inspired an upsurge of black militancy expressed in the slogan double v victory over enemies overseas and over racial inequality at home.
no retreat into isolationism followed world war ii.
the united states had refused to join the league of nations but it became the leading member of the united nations which was established in 1945.
however the wartime alliance among the united states britain and the soviet union soon shattered replaced by the worldwide contest known as the cold war.
by the 1950s through a series of global anticommunist alliances the united states had taken on a permanent military presence throughout the world.
as in previous wars freedom both helped to mobilize public support for the cold war and was subtly changed in the process.
the defense of freedom increasingly equated with free enterprise became the rationale for the doctrine of containment or global opposition to the spread of communism.
the cold war also inspired an anticommunist crusade within the united states.
in the late 1940s and early 1950s thousands of americans accused of holding subversive beliefs lost their jobs and an atmosphere of political conformity dominated public life.
the battle to defend the free world abroad produced severe infringements on freedom at home.

nicola sacco a shoemaker and bartolomeo vanzetti an itinerant unskilled laborer were anarchists who dreamed of a society in which government churches and private property had been abolished.
they saw violence as an appropriate weapon of class warfare.
but very little evidence linked them to this particular crime.
one man claimed to have seen vanzetti at the wheel of the getaway car but all the other eyewitnesses described the driver quite differently.
disputed tests on one of the six bullets in the dead mans body suggested that it might have been fired from a gun owned by sacco.
neither fingerprints nor possession of stolen money linked either to the crime.
in the atmosphere of anti radical and antiimmigrant fervor however their conviction was a certainty.
i have suffered vanzetti wrote from prison for things that i am guilty of.
i am suffering because i am a radical and indeed i am a radical i have suffered because i was an italian and indeed i am an italian although their 1921 trial had aroused little public interest outside the italian american community the case of sacco and vanzetti attracted international attention during the lengthy appeals that followed.
there were mass protests in europe against their impending execution.
in the united states the movement to save their lives attracted the support of an impressive array of intellectuals including the novelist john dos passos the poet edna st vincent millay and felix frankfurter a professor at harvard law school and a future justice of the supreme court.
in response to the mounting clamor the governor of massachusetts appointed a three member commission to review the case headed by abbott lawrence lowell the president of harvard university and for many years an official of the immigration restriction league.
the commission upheld the verdict and death sentences and on august 23 1927 sacco and vanzetti died in the electric chair.
it is not every prisoner remarked the journalist heywood broun who has a president of harvard throw the switch for him the sacco vanzetti case laid bare some of the fault lines beneath the surface of american society during the 1920s.
the case the writer edmund wilson commented revealed the whole anatomy of american life with all its classes professions and points of view and.
it raised almost every fundamental question of our political and social system it demonstrated how long the red scare extended into the 1920s and how powerfully it undermined basic american freedoms.
it reflected the fierce cultural battles that raged in many communities during the decade.

the college presidents dos passoss lament was a bitter comment on the triumph of pro business conservatism during the 1920s.
in popular memory the decade that followed world war i is recalled as the jazz age or the roaring twenties.
with its flappers young sexually liberated women speakeasies nightclubs that sold liquor in violation of prohibition and a soaring stock market fueled by easy credit and a getrich quick outlook it was a time of revolt against moral rules inherited from the nineteenth century.
observers from europe where class divisions were starkly visible in work politics and social relations marveled at the uniformity of american life.
factories poured out standardized consumer goods their sale promoted by national advertising campaigns.
conservatism dominated a political system from which radical alternatives seemed to have been purged.
radio and the movies spread mass culture throughout the nation.
americans seemed to dress alike think alike go to the same movies and admire the same largerthan life national celebrities.
many americans however did not welcome the new secular commercial culture.
they resented and feared the ethnic and racial diversity of americas cities and what they considered the lax moral standards of urban life.
the 1920s was a decade of profound social tensions between rural and urban americans traditional and modern christianity participants in the burgeoning consumer culture and those who did not fully share in the new prosperity.

after a sharp postwar recession that lasted into 1922 the 1920s was a decade of prosperity.
productivity and economic output rose dramatically as new industries chemicals aviation electronics flourished and older ones like food processing and the manufacture of household appliances adopted henry fords moving assembly line.
the automobile was the backbone of economic growth.
the most celebrated american factories now turned out cars not textiles and steel as in the nineteenth century.
annual automobile production tripled during the 1920s from 1 5 to 4 8 million.
general motors which learned the secret of marketing numerous individual models and stylish designs surpassed ford with its cheap standardized model t replaced in 1927 by the model a.
by 1929 half of all american families owned a car a figure not reached in england until 1980.
the automobile industry stimulated the expansion of steel rubber and oil production road construction and other sectors of the economy.
it promoted tourism and the growth of suburbs already some commuters were driving to work and helped to reduce rural isolation.
during the 1920s american multinational corporations extended their sway throughout the world.
with europe still recovering from the great war american investment overseas far exceeded that of other countries.
the dollar replaced the british pound as the most important currency of international trade.
american companies produced 85 percent of the worlds cars and 40 percent of its manufactured goods.
general electric and international telephone and telegraph bought up companies in other countries.
international business machines ibm was the worlds leader in office supplies.
american oil companies built new refineries overseas.
american companies took control of raw materials abroad from rubber in liberia to oil in venezuela.
one of the more unusual examples of the global spread of american corporations was fordlandia an effort by the auto manufacturer henry ford to create a town in the heart of brazils amazon rain forest.
ford hoped to secure a steady supply of rubber for car tires.
but as in the united states where he had compelled immigrant workers to adopt american dress and diet he wanted to bring local inhabitants up to what he considered the proper standard of life this meant for example forbidding his workers from using alcohol and tobacco and trying to get them to eat brown rice and whole wheat bread instead of traditional brazilian foods.
eventually the climate and local insects destroyed the rubber trees that fords engineers lacking experience in tropical agriculture had planted much too close together while the workers rebelled against the long hours of labor and regimentation of the community.
who benefited and who suffered in the new consumer society of the 1920s.
a new society during the 1920s consumer goods of all kinds proliferated marketed by salesmen and advertisers who promoted them as ways of satisfying americans psychological desires and everyday needs.
frequently purchased on credit through new installment buying plans they rapidly altered daily life.
telephones made communication easier.
vacuum cleaners washing machines and refrigerators transformed work in the home and reduced the demand for domestic servants.
boosted by prohibition and an aggressive advertising campaign that according to the companys sales director made it impossible for the consumer to escape the product cocacola became a symbol of american life.
americans spent more and more of their income on leisure activities like vacations movies and sporting events.
by 1929 weekly movie attendance had reached 80 million double the figure of 1922.
hollywood films now dominated the world movie market.
movies had been produced early in the century in several american cities but shortly before world war i filmmakers gravitated to hollywood a district of los angeles attracted by the open space year round sunshine for outdoor filming and varied scenery.
in 1910 two french companies path and gaumont had been the worlds leading film producers.
by 1925 american releases outnumbered french by eight to one.
in the 1920s both companies abandoned film production for the more profitable business of distributing american films in europe.
radios and phonographs brought mass entertainment into americans living rooms.
the number of radios in americans homes rose from 190 000 in 1923 to just under 5 million in 1929.
these developments helped to create and spread a new celebrity culture in which recording film and sports stars moved to the top of the list of american heroes.
during the 1920s more than 100 million records were sold each year.
rca victor sold so many recordings of the great opera tenor enrico caruso that he is sometimes called the first modern celebrity.
he was soon joined by the film actor charlie chaplin baseball player babe ruth and boxer jack dempsey.
ordinary americans followed every detail of their lives.
perhaps the decades greatest celebrity in terms of intensive press coverage was the aviator charles lindbergh who in 1927 made the first solo nonstop flight across the atlantic.
andr siegfried a frenchman who had visited the united states four times since the beginning of the century commented in 1928 that a new society had come into being in which americans considered their standard of living a sacred acquisition which they will defend at any price in this new mass during the 1920s radio penetrated virtually the entire country.

the woman on the right is a cardboard cutout.
civilization widespread acceptance of going into debt to purchase consumer goods had replaced the values of thrift and self denial central to nineteenth century notions of upstanding character.
work once seen as a source of pride in craft skill or collective empowerment via trade unions now came to be valued as a path to individual fulfillment through consumption and entertainment.

the fruits of increased production were very unequally distributed.
real wages for industrial workers wages adjusted to take account of inflation rose by one quarter between 1922 and 1929 but corporate profits rose at more than twice that rate.
the process of economic concentration continued unabated.
a handful of firms dominated numerous sectors of the economy.
in 1929 1 percent of the nations banks controlled half of its financial resources.
most of the small auto companies that had existed earlier in the century had fallen by the wayside.
general motors ford and chrysler now controlled four fifths of the industry.
at the beginning of 1929 the share of national income of the wealthiest 5 percent of american families exceeded that of the bottom 60 percent.
a majority of families had no savings and an estimated 40 percent of the population remained in poverty unable to participate in the flourishing consumer economy.
improved productivity meant that goods could be produced with fewer workers.
during the 1920s more americans worked in the professions retailing finance and education but the number of manufacturing workers declined by 5 percent the first such drop in the nations history.
parts of new england were already experiencing the who benefited and who suffered in the new consumer society of the 1920s.
chronic unemployment caused by deindustrialization.
many of the regions textile companies failed in the face of low wage competition from southern factories or shifted production to take advantage of the souths cheap labor.
most advertisers directed their messages at businessmen and the middle class.
at the end of the decade 75 percent of american households still did not own a washing machine and 60 percent had no radio.
the fa r m e r s plight nor did farmers share in the decades prosperity.
the golden age of american farming had reached its peak during world war i when the need to feed war torn europe and government efforts to maintain high farm prices had raised farmers incomes and promoted the purchase of more land on credit.
thanks to mechanization and the increased use of fertilizer and insecticides agricultural production continued to rise even when government subsidies ended and world demand stagnated.
as a result farm incomes declined steadily and banks foreclosed tens of thousands of farms whose owners were unable to meet mortgage payments.
for the first time in the nations history the number of farms and farmers declined during the 1920s.
for example half the farmers in montana lost their land to foreclosure between 1921 and 1925.
extractive industries like mining and lumber also suffered as their products faced a glut on the world market.
during the decade some 3 million persons migrated out of rural areas.
many headed for southern california whose rapidly growing economy needed new labor.
the population of los angeles the wests leading industrial center a producer of oil automobiles aircraft and of course hollywood movies rose from 575 000 to 2 2 million during the decade largely because of an influx of displaced farmers from the midwest.
well before the 1930s rural america was in an economic depression.
farmers like this family of potato growers in rural minnesota did not share in the prosperity of the 1920s.

america wrote the historian charles beard was boring its way into the worlds consciousness.
in high wages efficient factories and the mass production of consumer goods americans seemed to have discovered the secret of permanent prosperity.
businessmen like henry ford and engineers like herbert hoover were cultural heroes.
photographers like lewis hine and margaret bourke white and painters like charles sheeler celebrated the beauty of machines and factories.
the man nobody knows a 1925 best seller by advertising executive bruce barton portrayed jesus christ as the greatest advertiser of his day.

they aimed to justify corporate practices to the public and counteract its long standing distrust of big business.
they succeeded in changing popular attitudes toward wall street.

but in the 1920s as the steadily rising price of stocks made front page news the market attracted more investors.
many assumed that stock values would rise forever.

some corporations during the 1920s implemented a new style of management.
they provided their employees with private pensions and medical insurance plans job security and greater workplace safety.
they established sports programs to occupy their employees leisure time.
they spoke of welfare capitalism a more socially conscious kind of business leadership and trumpeted the fact that they now paid more attention to the human factor in employment.
at the same time however employers in the 1920s embraced the american plan at whose core stood the open shop a workplace free of both government regulation and unions except in some cases company unions created and controlled by management.
collective bargaining declared one group of employers represented an infringement of personal liberty and a menace to the institutions of a free people prosperity they insisted depended on giving business complete freedom of action.
this message was reinforced in a propaganda campaign that linked unionism and socialism as examples of the sinister influence of foreigners on american life.
even the most forward looking companies continued to employ strikebreakers private detectives and the blacklisting of union organizers to prevent or defeat strikes.
during the 1920s organized labor lost more than 2 million members and unions agreed to demand after demand by employers in an effort to stave off complete elimination.
in cities like minneapolis new orleans and seattle once centers of thriving labor movements unions all but disappeared.
uprisings by the most downtrodden workers did occur sporadically throughout the decade.
southern textile mills witnessed desperate strikes by workers who charged employers with making slaves out of the men and women who labored there.
facing the combined opposition of business local politicians and the courts as well as the threat of violence such strikes were doomed to defeat.

the title of the work suggests that kiyoshi does not entirely approve of her behavior but he presents her as selfconfident and alluring.
japanese police took a dim view of modern women arresting those who applied makeup in public.
many american authorities were no more welcoming to new women the superintendent of public buildings and grounds in washington d c decreed that womens bathing suits must fall no higher than six inches above the knee.

the business of america but they won little support from white counterparts.
a few prominent feminists including elizabeth cady stantons daughter harriot stanton blatch joined the rapidly diminishing socialist party convinced that women should support an independent electoral force that promoted governmental protection of vulnerable workers.
the long standing division between two competing conceptions of womans freedom one based on motherhood the other on individual autonomy and the right to work now crystallized in the debate over an equal rights amendment era to the constitution promoted by alice paul and the national womens party.
this amendment proposed to eliminate all legal distinctions on account of sex in pauls opinion the era followed logically from winning the right to vote.
having gained political equality she insisted women no longer required special legal protection they needed equal access to employment education and all the other opportunities of citizens.
to supporters of mothers pensions and laws limiting womens hours of labor which the era would sweep away the proposal represented a giant step backward.
apart from the national womens party every major female organization from the league of women voters to the womens trade union league opposed the era.
in the end none of these groups achieved success in the 1920s.
the era campaign failed and only six states ratified a proposed constitutional amendment giving congress the power to prohibit child labor which farm groups and business organizations opposed.
in 1929 congress repealed the sheppard towner act of 1921 a major achievement of the maternalist reformers that had provided federal assistance to programs for infant and child health.

with her bobbed hair short skirts public smoking and drinking and unapologetic use of birth control methods such as the diaphragm the young single flapper epitomized the change in standards of sexual behavior at least in large cities.
she frequented dance halls and music clubs where white people now performed wild dances like the charleston that had long been popular in black communities.
she attended sexually charged hollywood films featuring stars like clara bow the provocative it girl and rudolph valentino the original on screen latin lover when valentino died of a sudden illness in 1926 crowds of grieving women tried to storm the funeral home.
what had been scandalous a generation earlier womens self conscious pursuit of personal pleasure became a device to market goods from automobiles to cigarettes.
in 1904 a woman had been arrested for smoking in public in new york city.
two decades later edward bernays the father of modern public relations masterminded a campaign to persuade women to smoke dubbing cigarettes womens torches of freedom the new freedom however was available only during one phase of a womans life.

20 from business culture to great depression business and government business and government the retreat from progressivism in 1924 a social scientist remarked that the united states had just passed through one of the most critical ten year periods in its history.
among the changes was the disintegration of progressivism as a political movement and body of thought.
the governments success in whipping up mass hysteria during the war seemed to undermine the very foundation of democratic thought the idea of the rational self directed citizen.
followers of sigmund freud emphasized the unconscious instinctual motivations of human behavior scientists pointed to wartime iq tests allegedly demonstrating that many americans were mentally unfit for self government.
the great bulk of people are stupid declared one advertising executive explaining why advertisements played on the emotions rather than providing actual information.
during the 1920s walter lippmann published two of the most penetrating indictments of democracy ever written public opinion and the phantom public which repudiated the progressive hope of applying intelligence to social problems in a mass democracy.
instead of acting out of careful consideration of the issues or even individual self interest lippmann claimed the american voter was ill informed and prone to fits of enthusiasm.
not only were modern problems beyond the understanding of ordinary men and women a sentiment that had earlier led lippmann to favor administration by experts but the independent citizen was nothing but a myth.
like advertising copywriters and journalists he continued the government had perfected the art of creating and manipulating public opinion a process lippmann called the manufacture of consent in 1929 the sociologists robert and helen lynd published middletown a classic study of life in muncie indiana a typical community in the american heartland.
the lynds found that new leisure activities and a new emphasis on consumption had replaced politics as the focus of public concern.
elections were no longer lively centers of public attention as in the nineteenth century and voter participation had fallen dramatically.
national statistics bore out their point the turnout of eligible voters over 80 percent in 1896 had dropped to less than 50 percent in 1924.
many factors helped to explain this decline including the consolidation of oneparty politics in the south the long period of republican dominance in national elections and the enfranchisement of women who for many years voted in lower numbers than men.
but the shift from public to private concerns also played a part.
the american citizens first importance to his country declared a muncie newspaper is no longer that of a citizen but that of a consumer the the policies of president calvin coolidge were music to the ears of big business according to one 1920s cartoonist.
republican era government policies reflected the pro business ethos of the 1920s.

they called on the federal government to lower taxes on personal incomes and business profits maintain high tariffs and support employers continuing campaign against unions.
the administrations of warren g harding and calvin coolidge obliged.
never before here or anywhere else declared the wall street journal has a government been so completely fused with business the two presidents appointed so many pro business members of the federal reserve board the federal trade commission and other progressive era agencies that complained nebraska senator george w norris they in effect repealed the regulatory system.
the harding administration did support secretary of commerce herbert hoovers successful effort to persuade the steel industry to reduce the workday from twelve to eight hours.
but it resumed the practice of obtaining court injunctions to suppress strikes as in a 1922 walkout of 250 000 railroad workers protesting a wage cut.
under william howard taft appointed chief justice in 1921 the supreme court remained strongly conservative.
a resurgence of laissezfaire jurisprudence eclipsed the progressive ideal of a socially active national state.
the court struck down a federal law that barred goods produced by child labor from interstate commerce.
it even repudiated muller v oregon see chapter 18 in a 1923 decision overturning a minimum wage law for women in washington d c now that women enjoyed the vote the justices declared they were entitled to the same workplace freedom as men.
this lamented florence kelley is a new dred scott decision which in the name of liberty of contract fills those words with the bitterest and most cruel mockery corruption in government warren g harding took office as president in 1921 promising a return to normalcy after an era of progressive reform and world war.
reflecting the prevailing get rich quick ethos his administration quickly became one of the most corrupt in american history.
a likeable somewhat ineffectual individual he called himself a man of limited talents from a small town harding seemed to have little regard for either governmental issues or the dignity of the presidency.
prohibition did not cause him to curb his appetite for liquor.
he continued a previous illicit affair with a young ohio woman nan britton.
the relationship did not become known until 1927 when britton published the presidents daughter about their child to whom harding had left nothing in his will.
although his cabinet included men of integrity and talent like secretary of state charles evans hughes and secretary of commerce herbert hoover harding also surrounded himself with cronies who used their offices for private gain.
attorney general harry daugherty accepted payments not to prosecute accused criminals.
the head of the veterans bureau charles forbes received kickbacks from the sale of government supplies.
the most notorious scandal involved secretary of the interior albert fall who accepted nearly 500 000 from private businessmen to whom he leased government oil reserves at teapot dome wyoming.
fall became the first cabinet member in history to be convicted of a felony.
this decision affirms your constitutional right to starve a 1923 cartoon criticizes the supreme court decision declaring unconstitutional a washington d c law establishing a minimum wage for women.

recent h1 voices of freedom from andr siegfried the gulf between atlantic monthly march 1928 the french writer andr siegfried in 1928 commented on the rise of an industrial economy and consumer culture and the changes they produced in american society.
never has europe more eagerly observed studied discussed america and never.
have the two continents been wider apart in their aspirations and ideals.
europe after all is not very different from what it was a generation ago but there has been born since then a new america.
the conquest of the continent has been completed and all recent american historians have noted the significance of the event the western frontier has disappeared the pioneer is no longer needed and with him the mystic dream of the west.
has faded away.
thus came the beginning of the era of organization the new problem was not to conquer adventurously but to produce methodically.
the great man of the new generation was no longer a pioneer like lincoln.
henry ford.
from this time on america has been no more an unlimited prairie with pure and infinite horizons in which free men may sport like wild horses but a huge factory of prodigious efficiency.
in the last twenty five or thirty years america has produced a new civilization.
from a moral point of view it is obvious that americans have come to consider their standard of living as a somewhat sacred acquisition which they will defend at any price.
this means that they would be ready to make many an intellectual or even moral concession in order to maintain that standard.
from a political point of view it seems that the notion of efficiency of production is on the way to taking precedence over the very notion of liberty.
in the name of efficiency one can obtain from the american all sorts of sacrifices in relation to his personal and even to certain of his political liberties.
mass production and mass civilization its natural consequence are the true characteristics of the new american society.
lincoln with his bible and classical tradition was easier for europe to understand than ford with his total absence of tradition and his proud creation of new methods and new standards especially conceived for a world entirely different from our own.

that the state may do much go very far indeed in order to improve the quality of its citizens physically mentally and morally is clear but the the problem for our determination is whether the individual has certain fundamental rights which must be respected.

20 from business culture to great depression a 1924 cartoon commenting on the scandals of the harding administration.
the white house capitol and washington monument have been sold to the highest bidder.
the election of business and government hardings successor calvin coolidge who as governor of massachusetts had won national fame for using state troops against striking boston policemen in 1919 was a dour man of few words.
but in contrast to his predecessor he seemed to exemplify yankee honesty.
the scandals subsided but otherwise coolidge continued his predecessors policies.
he twice vetoed the mcnary haugen bill the top legislative priority of congressmen from farm states.
this bill sought to have the government purchase agricultural products for sale overseas in order to raise farm prices.
coolidge denounced it as an unwarranted interference with the free market.
in 1924 coolidge was reelected in a landslide defeating john w davis a wall street lawyer nominated on the 103rd ballot by a badly divided democratic convention.
this was when the comedian will rogers made the quip often repeated in future years i am a member of no organized political party i am a democrat one sixth of the electorate in 1924 voted for robert la follette running as the candidate of a new progressive party which called for greater taxation of wealth the conservation of natural resources public ownership of the railroads farm relief and the end of child labor.
although such ideas had been proposed many times before world war i coolidge described the platform as a blueprint for a communistic and socialistic america.
despite endorsements from veteran progressives like jane addams and john dewey and the american federation of labor la follette could raise no more than 250 000 for his campaign.
he carried only his native wisconsin.
but his candidacy demonstrated the survival of some currents of dissent in a highly conservative decade.
in what ways did the government promote business interests in the 1920s.
economic diplomacy foreign affairs also reflected the close working relationship between business and government.
any student of modern diplomacy declared huntington wilson a state department official knows that in these days of competition capital trade agriculture labor and statecraft all go hand in hand if a country is to profit the 1920s marked a retreat from wilsons goal of internationalism in favor of unilateral american actions mainly designed to increase exports and investment opportunities overseas.
indeed what is sometimes called the isolationism of the 1920s represented a reaction against the disappointing results of wilsons military and diplomatic pursuit of freedom and democracy abroad.
the united states did play host to the washington naval arms conference of 1922 that negotiated reductions in the navies of britain france japan italy and the united states.
but the country remained outside the league of nations.
even as american diplomats continued to press for access to markets overseas the fordneymccumber tariff of 1922 raised taxes on imported goods to their highest levels in history a repudiation of wilsons principle of promoting free trade.
much foreign policy was conducted through private economic relationships rather than governmental action.
the united states emerged from world war i as both the worlds foremost center of manufacturing and the major financial power thanks to british and french debts for american loans that had funded their war efforts.
during the 1920s new york bankers sometimes acting on their own and sometimes with the cooperation of the harding and coolidge administrations solidified their international position by extending loans to european and latin american governments.
they advanced billions of dollars to germany to enable the country to meet its world war i reparations payments.
american industrial firms especially in auto agricultural machinery and electrical equipment manufacturing established plants overseas to supply the world market and take advantage of inexpensive labor.
american investors gained control over raw materials such as copper in chile and oil in venezuela.
in 1928 in the so called red line agreement british french and american oil companies divided oil producing regions in the middle east and latin america among themselves.
as before world war i the government dispatched soldiers when a change in government in the caribbean threatened american economic interests.
having been stationed in nicaragua since 1912 american marines withdrew in 1925.
but the troops soon returned in an effort to suppress a nationalist revolt headed by general augusto csar sandino.
having created a national guard headed by general anastasio somoza the marines finally departed in 1933.
a year later somoza assassinated sandino and seized power.
for the next forty five years he and his family ruled and plundered nicaragua.
somoza was overthrown in 1978 by a popular movement calling itself the sandinistas see chapter 26.
the birth of civil liberties among the casualties of world war i and the 1920s was progressivisms faith that an active federal government embodied the national purpose and a german cartoon inspired by president calvin coolidges dispatch of american troops to nicaragua.
while coolidge insisted that the united states acted in the interest of preserving international order residents of other countries often saw the united states as a grasping imperial power.
20 from business culture to great depression the birth of civil liberties enhanced the enjoyment of freedom.
wartime and postwar repression prohibition and the pro business policies of the 1920s all illustrated in the eyes of many progressives how public power could go grievously wrong.
this lesson opened the door to a new appreciation of civil liberties rights an individual may assert even against democratic majorities as essential elements of american freedom.
building on prewar struggles for freedom of expression by labor unions socialists and birth control advocates some reformers now developed a greater appreciation of the necessity of vibrant unrestricted political debate.
in the name of a new freedom for the individual the 1920s saw the birth of a coherent concept of civil liberties and the beginnings of significant legal protection for freedom of speech against the government.
the free mob wartime repression continued into the 1920s.
under the heading sweet land of liberty the nation magazine in 1923 detailed recent examples of the degradation of american freedom lynchings in alabama arkansas and florida the beating by columbia university students of an undergraduate who had written a letter defending freedom of speech and the press the arrest of a union leader in new jersey and 400 members of the iww in california refusal to allow a socialist to speak in pennsylvania.
throughout the 1920s artistic works with sexual themes were subjected to rigorous censorship.
the postal service removed from the mails books it deemed obscene.
the customs service barred works by the sixteenthcentury french satirist rabelais the modern novelist james joyce and many others from entering the country.
a local crusade against indecency made the phrase banned in boston a term of ridicule among upholders of artistic freedom.
bostons watch and ward committee excluded sixty five books from the citys bookstores including works by the novelists upton sinclair theodore dreiser and ernest hemingway.
hollywood producers feared that publicity over actress mary pickfords divorce actor wallace reids death from a drug overdose and a murder trial involving actor fatty arbuckle would reinforce the belief that movies promoted immorality.
in 1922 the film industry adopted the hays code a sporadically enforced set of guidelines that prohibited movies from depicting nudity long kisses and adultery and barred scripts that portrayed clergymen in a negative light or criminals sympathetically.
the code in some ways anticipated recent efforts by television networks music companies and video game producers to adopt self imposed guidelines to fend off governmental regulation.
filmmakers hoped that self censorship would prevent censorship by local governments a not uncommon occurrence since the courts deemed movies a business subject to regulation not a form of expression.
not until 1951 in a case involving the miracle a film many catholics found offensive would the supreme court declare movies an artistic form protected by the first amendment.
even as europeans turned in increasing numbers to american popular culture and consumer goods some came to view the country as a repressive cultural wasteland.
americans commented the british novelist d h lawrence who lived for a time in the united states prided themselves on being the land of the free but the free mob had destroyed the right to why did the protection of civil liberties gain importance in the 1920s.
i have never been in any country he wrote where the individual has such an abject fear of his fellow countrymen disillusionment with the conservatism of american politics and the materialism of the culture inspired some american artists and writers to emigrate to paris.
the lost generation of cultural exiles included novelists and poets like ernest hemingway gertrude stein and f scott fitzgerald.
europe they felt valued art and culture and appreciated unrestrained freedom of expression and of course allowed individuals to drink legally.
a clear and present danger during world war i the unitarian minister john haynes holmes later recalled there suddenly came to the fore in our nations life the new issue of civil liberties the arrest of antiwar dissenters under the espionage and sedition acts inspired the formation in 1917 of the civil liberties bureau which in 1920 became the american civil liberties union aclu.
for the rest of the century the aclu would take part in most of the landmark cases that helped to bring about a rights revolution its efforts helped to give meaning to traditional civil liberties like freedom of speech and invented new ones like the right to privacy.
when it began however the aclu was a small beleaguered organization.
a coalition of pacifists progressives shocked by wartime repression and lawyers outraged at what they considered violations of americans legal rights it saw its own pamphlets defending free speech barred from the mails by postal inspectors.
prior to world war i the supreme court had done almost nothing to protect the rights of unpopular minorities.
now it was forced to address the question of the permissible limits on political and economic dissent.
in its initial decisions it dealt the concept of civil liberties a series of devastating blows.
in 1919 the court upheld the constitutionality of the espionage act and the conviction of charles t schenck a socialist who had distributed antidraft leaflets through the mails.
speaking for the court justice oliver wendell holmes declared that the first amendment did not prevent congress from prohibiting speech that presented a clear and present danger of inspiring illegal actions.
free speech he observed would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic for the next half century holmess doctrine would remain the basic test in first amendment cases.
since the court usually allowed public officials to decide what speech was in fact dangerous it hardly provided a stable basis for the defense of free expression in times of crisis.
a week after schenck v united states the court unanimously upheld the conviction of eugene v debs for a speech condemning the war.
it also affirmed the wartime jailing of the editor of a german language newspaper whose editorials had questioned the drafts constitutionality.
the court and civil liberties also in 1919 the court upheld the conviction of jacob abrams and five other men for distributing pamphlets critical of american intervention in russia after the bolshevik revolution.
this time however holmes and louis brandeis dissented marking the emergence of a court minority committed to a broader defense of free speech.
six years after abrams the two ch.
20 from business culture to great depression t h e c u lt u r e w a r s again dissented when the majority upheld the conviction of benjamin gitlow a communist whose left wing manifesto calling for revolution led to his conviction under a new york law prohibiting criminal anarchy the only meaning of free speech holmes now declared was that advocates of every set of beliefs even proletarian dictatorship should have the right to convert the public to their views in the great marketplace of ideas an apt metaphor for a consumer society.
in approving gitlows conviction the court majority observed that the fourteenth amendment obligated the states to refrain from unreasonable restraints on freedom of speech and the press.
the comment marked a major step in the long process by which the bill of rights was transformed from an ineffective statement of principle into a significant protection of americans freedoms.
the tide of civil liberties decision making slowly began to turn.
by the end of the 1920s the supreme court had voided a kansas law that made it a crime to advocate unlawful acts to change the political or economic system and one from minnesota authorizing censorship of the press.
the new regard for free speech went beyond political expression.
in 1930 the court threw out the conviction of mary ware dennett for sending a sexeducation pamphlet the sex side of life through the mails.
three years later a federal court overturned the customs services ban on james joyces novel ulysses a turning point in the battle against the censorship of works of literature.
meanwhile brandeis was crafting an intellectual defense of civil liberties on grounds somewhat different from holmess model of a competitive market in ideas.
in 1927 the court upheld the conviction of the prominent california socialist and womens rights activist anita whitney for attending a convention of the communist labor party where speakers advocated violent revolution.
brandeis voted with the majority on technical grounds.
but he issued a powerful defense of freedom of speech as essential to active citizenship in a democracy those who won our independence believed.
that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.
the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people a month after the decision the governor of california pardoned whitney terming freedom of speech the indispensable birthright of every free american the intrepid mrs whitney was soon back in court for violating a california law making it a crime to display a red flag.
in 1931 the supreme court overturned the law as repugnant to the guaranty of liberty contained in the fourteenth amendment a judicial defense of civil liberties was slowly being born.
t h e c u lt u r e w a r s the fundamentalist r e v o lt although many americans embraced modern urban culture with its religious and ethnic pluralism mass entertainment and liberated sexual rules others found it alarming.
many evangelical protestants felt threatened by the decline of traditional values and the increased visibility of catholicism and judaism because of immigration.
they also resented the growing presence within mainstream protestant denominations of modernists who visions of freedom city activities with dance hall.

what kinds of freedom depicted by benton alarmed moral traditionalists.
does benton seem to celebrate or criticize urban life or both.

the day is past declared harry emerson fosdick pastor of new yorks first presbyterian church and a prominent modernist when you can ask thoughtful men to hold religion in one compartment of their minds and their modern world view in another convinced that the literal truth of the bible formed the basis of christian belief fundamentalists launched a campaign to rid protestant denominations of modernism and to combat the new individual freedoms that seemed to contradict traditional morality.
their most flamboyant apostle was billy sunday a talented professional baseball player who became a revivalist preacher.
between 1900 and 1930 sunday drew huge crowds with a highly theatrical preaching style and a message denouncing sins ranging from darwinism to alcohol.
he was said to have preached to 100 million people during his lifetime more than any other individual in history.
much of the press portrayed fundamentalism as a movement of backwoods bigots.
in fact it was a national phenomenon.
even in new york city the center of the new modern culture fosdick was removed from his ministry in 1924 whereupon john d rockefeller jr built the interdenominational riverside church for him.
fundamentalism remained an important strain of 1920s culture and politics.
prohibition which fundamentalists strongly supported succeeded in reducing the consumption of alcohol as well as public drunkenness and drink related diseases.
not until 1975 would per capita consumption of alcohol reach its pre prohibition level of 2 6 gallons per year.
too many americans however deemed prohibition a violation of individual freedom for the flow of illegal liquor to stop.
in urban areas prohibition led to large profits for the owners of illegal speakeasies and the bootleggers who supplied them.
it produced widespread corruption as police and public officials accepted bribes to turn a blind what were the major flash points between fundamentalism and pluralism in the 1920s.
eye to violations of the law.
these developments reinforced fundamentalists identification of urban life and modern notions of freedom with immorality and a decline of christian liberty.
the scopes trial in 1925 a trial in tennessee threw into sharp relief the division between traditional values and modern secular culture.
john scopes a teacher in a tennessee public school was arrested for violating a state law that prohibited the teaching of charles darwins theory of evolution.
his trial became a national sensation.
the proceedings were even carried live on national radio.
the scopes trial reflected the enduring tension between two american definitions of freedom.
fundamentalist christians strongest in rural areas of the south and west clung to the traditional idea of moral liberty voluntary adherence to time honored religious beliefs.
the theory that man had evolved over millions of years from ancestors like apes contradicted the biblical account of creation.
those who upheld the tennessee law identified evolutionists with feminists socialists and religious modernists all of whom they claimed substituted human judgment for the word of god.
to scopess defenders including the american civil liberties union which had persuaded him to violate the law in order to test its constitutionality freedom meant above all the right to independent thought and individual self expression.
to them the tennessee law offered a lesson in the dangers of religious intolerance and the merger of church and state.
the renowned labor lawyer clarence darrow defended scopes.
the trials highlight came when darrow called william jennings bryan to the stand as an expert witness on the bible.
viewing the trial as a duel to the death between science and christianity he accepted darrows challenge.
but bryan revealed an almost complete ignorance of modern science and proved unable to respond effectively to darrows sarcastic questioning.
does the serpent really crawl on its belly as punishment for having tempted eve in the garden of evil.
when bryan answered yes darrow inquired how it got around before being cursed on its tail.
asked whether god had actually created the world in six days bryan replied that these should be understood as ages not six days of twenty four hours thus opening the door to the very nonliteral interpretation of the bible fundamentalists rejected.
the jury found scopes guilty although the tennessee supreme court later overturned the decision on a technicality.
shortly after the trial ended bryan died and the movement for anti evolution laws disintegrated.
fundamentalists retreated for many years from battles over public education preferring to build their own schools and colleges where teaching could be done as they saw fit and preachers were trained to spread their interpretation of christianity.
the battle would be rejoined however toward the end of the twentieth century when fundamentalism reemerged as an important the anti evolution league selling its publications outside the tennessee courthouse where the scopes trial was taking place.

force in politics.
to this day the teaching of the theory of evolution in public schools arouses intense debate in parts of the united states.
the second klan few features of urban life seemed more alien to rural and small town native born protestants than their immigrant populations and cultures.
the wartime obsession with 100 percent americanism continued into the 1920s a decade of citizenship education programs in public schools legally sanctioned visits to immigrants homes to investigate their household arrangements and vigorous efforts by employers to instill appreciation for american values only an agile and determined immigrant commented the chicago tribune could hope to escape americanization by at least one of the many processes now being prepared for his special benefit in 1922 oregon became the only state ever to require all students to attend public schools a measure aimed said the states attorney general at abolishing parochial education and preventing bolshevists syndicalists and communists from organizing their own schools.
perhaps the most menacing expression of the idea that enjoyment of american freedom should be limited on religious and ethnic grounds was the resurgence of the ku klux klan in the early 1920s.
the klan had been reborn in atlanta in 1915 after the lynching of leo frank a jewish factory manager accused of killing a teenage girl.
by the mid 1920s it claimed more than 3 million members nearly all white native born protestants many of whom held respected positions in their communities.
unlike the klan of reconstruction the organization now sank deep roots in parts of the north and west.
it became the largest private organization in indiana and for a time controlled the state republican party.
it was partly responsible for the oregon law banning private schools.
in southern california its large marches and auto parades made the klan a visible presence.
the new klan attacked a far broader array of targets than during reconstruction.
what were the major flash points between fundamentalism and pluralism in the 1920s.
american civilization it insisted was endangered not only by blacks but by immigrants especially jews and catholics and all the forces feminism unions immorality even on occasion the giant corporations that endangered individual liberty closing the golden door the klans influence faded after 1925 when its leader in indiana was convicted of assaulting a young woman.
but the klans attacks on modern secular culture and political radicalism and its demand that control of the nation be returned to citizens of the old stock reflected sentiments widely shared in the 1920s.
the decade witnessed a flurry of legislation that offered a new answer to the venerable question who is an american some new laws redrew the boundary of citizenship to include groups previously outside it.
with women now recognized as part of the political nation congress in the cable act of 1922 overturned the 1907 law requiring american women who married foreigners to assume the citizenship of the husband except in the case of those who married asians who still forfeited their nationality.
two years later it declared all indians born in the united states to be american citizens although many western states continued to deny the vote to those living on reservations.
far more sweeping was a fundamental change in immigration policy.
immigration restriction had a long history.
the naturalization act of 1790 had barred blacks and asians from naturalization with the ban lifted for the former in 1870.
beginning in 1875 various classes of immigrants had been excluded among them prostitutes the mentally retarded and those with contagious diseases.
nonetheless prior to world war i virtually all the white persons who wished to pass through the golden door into the united states and become citizens were able to do so.
during the 1920s however the pressure for wholesale immigration restriction became a ku klux klan gathering in jackson michigan in 1924.
in the foreground is the klans drill team and band.
despite its rancor toward blacks catholics and jews the klan presented itself as part of mainstream america.
20 from business culture to great depression the only way to handle it a cartoon endorsing immigration restriction.
t h e c u lt u r e w a r s irresistible.
one index of the changing political climate was that large employers dropped their traditional opposition.
fears of immigrant radicalism now outweighed the desire for cheap unskilled labor especially since mechanization had halted the growth of the industrial labor force and the great migration of world war i had accustomed industrialists to employing african americans.
in 1921 a temporary measure restricted immigration from europe to 357 000 per year one third of the annual average before the war.
three years later congress permanently limited european immigration to 150 000 per year distributed according to a series of national quotas that severely restricted the numbers from southern and eastern europe.
the law aimed to ensure that descendants of the old immigrants forever outnumbered the children of the new.
however to satisfy the demands of large farmers in california who relied heavily on seasonal mexican labor the 1924 law established no limits on immigration from the western hemisphere.
the 1924 law did bar the entry of all those ineligible for naturalized citizenship that is the entire population of asia even though japan had fought on the american side in world war i.
the only asians still able to enter the united states were residents of the philippines who were deemed to be american nationals although not citizens because the islands had been u s territory since the spanish american war.
largely to bar further philippine immigration congress in 1934 established a timetable for the islands independence which was finally achieved in 1946.
the 1934 law established an immigration quota of fifty filipinos a year to the mainland united states but allowed their continued entry into the hawaiian islands to work as plantation laborers.
although a few chinese had tried to enter the country in the past in spite of exclusion legislation the law of 1924 established in effect for the first time a new category the illegal alien with it came a new enforcement mechanism the border patrol charged with policing the land boundaries of the united states and empowered to arrest and deport persons who entered the country in violation of the new nationality quotas or other restrictions.
later associated almost exclusively with latinos illegal aliens at first referred mainly to southern and eastern europeans who tried to sneak across the border from mexico or canada.
race and the law the new immigration law reflected the heightened emphasis on race as a determinant of public policy.
by the early 1920s political leaders of both north and south agreed upon the relegation of blacks to second class citizenship.
in a speech in alabama in 1921 president harding unconsciously echoed w e b.
du bois by affirming that the problem of race was a global one not confined to the south.
unlike du bois he believed the south showed the way to the problems solution.
it would be helpful he added to have that word equality eliminated from this consideration clearly the republican party of the civil war era was dead.
but race policy meant far more than black white relations.
america must be kept american declared president coolidge in signing the 1924 immigration law.
his secretary of labor james j davis commented that immigration policy once based on the need for labor and the notion of the what were the major flash points between fundamentalism and pluralism in the 1920s.
table 20 1 selected annual immigration quotas under the 1924 immigration act country quota immigrants in 1914 northern and western europe great britain and northern ireland 65 721 48 729 great britain only germany 25 957 35 734 ireland 17 853 24 688 includes northern ireland scandinavia sweden norway denmark finland 7 241 29 391 southern and eastern europe poland 6 524 not an independent state included in germany russia and austriahungary italy 5 802 283 738 russia 2 784 255 660 other africa total of various colonies and countries 1 000 1 539 no quota limit 122 695 western hemisphere asia china india japan korea 11 652 united states as an asylum of liberty must now rest on a biological definition of the ideal population.
although enacted by a highly conservative congress strongly influenced by nativism the 1924 immigration law also reflected the progressive desire to improve the quality of democratic citizenship and to employ scientific methods to set public policy.
it revealed how these aims were overlaid with pseudo scientific assumptions about the superiority and inferiority of particular races the seemingly scientific calculation of the new quotas based on the national origins of the american population dating back to 1790 involved a highly speculative analysis of past census returns with the results altered to increase allowable immigration by politically influential groups like irish americans.
non whites one fifth of the population in 1790 were excluded altogether when calculating quotas otherwise africa would have received a far higher quota than the tiny number allotted to it.
but then the entire concept of race as a basis for public policy lacked any rational foundation.
the supreme court admitted as much in 1923 when it rejected the claim of bhagat singh thind an indian born world war i veteran who asserted that as a pure aryan he was actually white and could therefore become an american citizen.
white the court declared was not a scientific concept at all but part of common speech to be interpreted with the understanding of the common man a forthright statement of what later scholars would call the social construction of race.
20 from business culture to great depression pluralism and t h e c u lt u r e w a r s liberty during the 1920s some americans challenged the idea that southern and eastern europeans were unfit to become citizens or could only do so by abandoning their traditions in favor of anglo saxon ways.
horace kallen himself of german jewish origin in 1924 coined the phrase cultural pluralism to describe a society that gloried in ethnic diversity rather than attempting to suppress it.
toleration of difference was part of the american idea kallen wrote.
anthopologists like franz boas alfred kroeber and ruth benedict insisted that no scientific basis existed for theories of racial superiority or for the notion that societies and races could be ranked on a fixed scale running from primitive to civilized these writings however had little immediate impact on public policy.
in the 1920s the most potent defense of a pluralist vision of american society came from the new immigrants themselves.
every major city still contained ethnic enclaves with their own civic institutions theaters churches and foreign language newspapers.
their sense of separate identity had been heightened by the emergence of independent nation states in eastern europe after the war.
it would be wrong to be sure to view ethnic communities as united in opposition to americanization.
in a society increasingly knit together by mass culture and a consumer economy few could escape the pull of assimilation.
the department store dance hall and motion picture theater were as much agents of americanization as the school and workplace.
from the perspective of many immigrant women moreover assimilation often seemed not so much the loss of an inherited culture as a loosening of patriarchal bonds and an expansion of freedom.
but most immigrants resented the coercive aspects of americanization programs so often based on the idea of the superiority of protestant mainstream culture.
promoting tolerance in the face of immigration restriction prohibition a revived ku klux klan and widespread anti semitism and anti catholicism immigrant groups asserted the validity of cultural diversity and identified toleration of difference religious cultural and individual as the essence of american freedom.
in effect they reinvented themselves as ethnic americans claiming an equal share in the nations life but in addition the right to remain in many respects culturally distinct.
the roman catholic church urged immigrants to learn english and embrace american principles but it continued to maintain separate schools and other institutions.
in 1924 the catholic holy name society brought 10 000 marchers to washington to challenge the klan and to affirm catholics loyalty to the nation.
throughout the country organizations like the anti defamation league of bnai brith founded in 1916 to combat anti semitism and the national catholic welfare council lobbied in the name of personal liberty for laws prohibiting discrimination against immigrants by employers colleges and government agencies.
the americanization movement declared a polish newspaper in chicago had not the smallest particle of the true american spirit the spirit of freedom the brightest virtue of which is the broadest possible tolerance what were the major flash points between fundamentalism and pluralism in the 1920s.
the zion lutheran church in nebraska where robert meyer was arrested for teaching a bible lesson in german in violation of state law.
the case led to the landmark supreme court decision of meyer v nebraska an important rebuke to world war i xenophobia.
the efforts of immigrant communities to resist coerced americanization and of the catholic church to defend its school system broadened the definition of liberty for all americans.
in landmark decisions the supreme court struck down oregons law mentioned earlier requiring all students to attend public schools and nebraskas prohibiting teaching in a language other than english one of the anti german measures of world war i.
the protection of the constitution the decision in meyer v nebraska 1923 declared extends to all to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue a startling rebuke to enforced americanization.
the decision expanded the freedom of all immigrant groups.
in its aftermath federal courts overturned various hawaii laws imposing special taxes and regulations on private japanese language schools.
in these cases the court also interpreted the fourteenth amendments guarantee of equal liberty to include the right to marry establish a home and bring up children and to practice religion as one chose without interference from the state the decisions gave pluralism a constitutional foundation and paved the way for the courts elaboration two generations later of a constitutional right to privacy.
the emergence of harlem the 1920s also witnessed an upsurge of self consciousness among black americans especially in the norths urban ghettos.
with european immigration all but halted the great migration of world war i continued apace.
nearly 1 million blacks left the south during the 1920s and the black population of new york chicago and other urban centers more than doubled.
new yorks harlem gained an international reputation as the capital of black america a mecca for migrants from the south and immigrants from the west indies 150 000 of whom entered the united states between 1900 and 1930.
unlike the southern newcomers most of whom had been agricultural workers the west indians included a large number of well educated professional and white collar workers.
their encounter with american racism appalled them.
i had heard of prejudice in america wrote the poet ch.
20 from business culture to great depression t h e c u lt u r e w a r s a black family arriving in chicago in 1922 as part of the great migration from the rural south.
and novelist claude mckay who emigrated from jamaica in 1912 but never dreamed of it being so intensely bitter the 1920s became famous for slumming as groups of whites visited harlems dance halls jazz clubs and speakeasies in search of exotic adventure.
the harlem of the white imagination was a place of primitive passions free from the puritanical restraints of mainstream american culture.
the real harlem was a community of widespread poverty its residents confined to low wage jobs and because housing discrimination barred them from other neighborhoods forced to pay exorbitant rents.
most harlem businesses were owned by whites even the famed cotton club excluded black customers and employed only light skinned dancers in its renowned chorus line.
few blacks north or south shared in the prosperity of the 1920s.
the harlem renaissance but harlem also contained a vibrant black cultural community that established links with new yorks artistic mainstream.

at the same time the theater flourished in harlem freeing black writers and actors from the constraints imposed by white producers.
the term new negro associated in politics with pan africanism and the militancy of the garvey movement in art meant the rejection of established stereotypes and a search for black values to put in their place.
this quest led the writers of what came to be called the harlem renaissance to the roots of the black experience africa the rural souths folk traditions and the life of the urban ghetto.
claude mckay made the major character of what were the major flash points between fundamentalism and pluralism in the 1920s.
his novel home to harlem 1928 a free spirit who wandered from one scene of exotic life to another in search of a beautiful girl he had known.
du bois feared that a novel like mckays with its graphic sex and violence actually reinforced white prejudices about black life.
harlem renaissance writings however also contained a strong element of protest.
this mood was exemplified by mckays poem if we must die a response to the race riots of 1919.
the poem affirmed that blacks would no longer allow themselves to be murdered defenselessly by whites if we must die let it not be like hogs hunted and penned in an inglorious spot while round us bark the mad and hungry dogs making their mock at our accursed lot.
like men well face the murderous cowardly pack pressed to the wall dying but fighting back.

hoover seemed to exemplify what was widely called the new era of american capitalism.
in 1922 while serving as secretary of commerce he published american individualism which condemned government regulation as an interference with the economic opportunities of ordinary americans but also insisted that self interest should be subordinated to public service.
hoover considered himself a progressive although he preferred what he called associational action in which private agencies directed regulatory and welfare policies to government intervention in the economy.

the hoover administration in 1931 opposed efforts to save money by reducing the size of the army warning that this would lessen our means of maintaining domestic peace and order hoovers response in the eyes of many americans president hoovers response to the depression seemed inadequate and uncaring.
leading advisers including andrew mellon the wealthy secretary of the treasury told hoover that economic downturns were a normal part of capitalism which weeded out unproductive firms and encouraged moral virtue among the less fortunate.
businessmen strongly opposed federal aid to the unemployed and many publications called for individual belt tightening as the road to recovery.
some initially saw a silver lining in the depression.

few political leaders understood how important consumer spending had become in the american economy.
most held to the conventional view that government intervention to aid those who had lost their jobs would do little to spur economic recovery and would encourage americans to rely on government charity to address misfortune.

federal aid.
weakens the sturdiness of our national character what were the causes of the great depression and how effective were the governments responses by 1932.
strongly opposed on principle to direct federal intervention in the economy hoover remained committed to associational action he put his faith in voluntary steps by business to maintain investment and employment something few found it possible to do and efforts by local charity organizations to assist needy neighbors.
he called numerous conferences of business and labor leaders and established commissions to encourage firms to cooperate in maintaining prices and wages without governmental dictation.
hoover attempted to restore public confidence making frequent public statements that the tide had turned but these made him increasingly seem out of touch with reality.
about the unemployed men who appeared on city streets offering apples at five cents apiece hoover would later write many persons left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples the worsening economic outlook some administration remedies like the hawley smoot tariff which hoover signed with some reluctance in 1930 made the economic situation worse.

but further than this hoover would not go.
he adamantly opposed offering direct relief to the unemployed it would do them a disservice he told congress.
freedom in the modern world in 1927 the new school for social research in new york city organized a series of lectures on the theme of freedom in the modern world.
founded eight years earlier as a place where free thought and intellectual integrity could flourish in the wake of wartime repression the schools distinguished faculty included the philosopher john dewey and historian charles beard who had resigned from columbia university in 1917 to protest the dismissal of antiwar professors.
the lectures painted a depressing portrait of american freedom on the eve of the great depression.
the idea of freedom declared economist walton h hamilton had become an intellectual instrument for looking backward.
liberty of contract has been made the be all and end all of personal freedom.
the domain of business has been defended against control from without in the name of freedom the free exchange of ideas moreover had not recovered from the crisis of world war i.
the sacred dogmas of patriotism and big business said the educator horace kallen dominated teaching the press and public debate.
a definition of freedom reigned supreme that celebrated the unimpeded reign of economic enterprise yet tolerated the surveillance of private life and individual conscience.
the prosperity of the 1920s had reinforced this definition of freedom.
with the economic crash compounded by the ineffectiveness of the hoover administrations response it would be discredited.
by 1932 the seeds had already been planted for a new conception of freedom that combined two different elements in a sometimes uneasy synthesis.
one was the progressive belief in a socially conscious state making what dewey called positive and constructive changes in economic arrangements.
the other which arose in the 1920s centered on respect for civil liberties and cultural pluralism and declared that realms of life like group identity personal behavior and the free expression of ideas lay outside legitimate state concern.
these two principles would become the hallmarks of modern liberalism which during the 1930s would redefine american freedom.

like other artists who found it difficult to obtain work during the depression he was hired by the works projects administration a new deal agency to paint murals for government buildings.
this one was inspired by the construction of the grand coulee dam on the columbia river and the davis dam on the colorado river two of the many new deal projects that expanded the nations infrastructure and provided employment to victims of the depression.

l e arly in 1941 the unemployed woody guthrie soon to become one of the countrys most popular songwriters and folk singers brought his family to portland oregon.
he hoped to star in a film about the great public works projects under way on the columbia river.
given a temporary job by the bonneville power authority the public agency that controlled the columbia dams guthrie produced a song every day for the next month.
one roll on columbia became a popular statement of the benefits that resulted when government took the lead in economic planning and in improving the lot of ordinary citizens and on up the river is the grand coulee dam the biggest thing built by the hand of a man to run the great factories and water the land so roll on columbia roll on.
your power is turning our darkness to dawn.
so roll on columbia roll on the columbia river winds its way on a 1 200 mile course from canada through washington and oregon to the pacific ocean.
because of its steep descent from uplands to sea level it produces an immense amount of energy.
residents of the economically underdeveloped pacific northwest had long dreamed of tapping this unused energy for electricity and irrigation.
but not until the 1930s did the federal government launch the program of dam construction that transformed the region.
the project created thousands of jobs for the unemployed and the network of dams produced abundant cheap power.
when the grand coulee dam went into operation in 1941 it was the largest man made structure in world history.
it eventually produced more than 40 percent of the nations hydroelectric power.
the dam provided the cheapest electricity in the country for towns that sprang up out of nowhere farms on what had once been deserts in eastern washington and oregon and factories that would soon be producing aluminum for world war ii airplanes.
the project also had less appealing consequences.
from time immemorial the columbia river had been filled with salmon.
but the grand coulee dam made no provision for the passage of fish and the salmon all but vanished.
this caused little concern during the depression but became a source of controversy later in the century as americans became more concerned about preserving the natural environment.
the grand coulee dam was part of what one scholar has called a public works revolution that transformed the american economy and landscape during the 1930s.
the roosevelt administration spent far more money on building roads dams airports bridges and housing than any other activity.
franklin d roosevelt believed regional economic planning like that in the northwest would promote economic growth ease the domestic and working lives of ordinary americans and keep control of key natural resources in public rather than private hands.
it promises one supporter what were the major policy initiatives of the new deal in the hundred days.
wrote a world replete with more freedom and happiness than mankind has ever known the columbia river project reflected broader changes in american life and thought during the new deal of the 1930s.
roosevelt oversaw the transformation of the democratic party into a coalition of farmers industrial workers the reform minded urban middle class liberal intellectuals northern african americans and somewhat incongruously the white supremacist south united by the belief that the federal government must provide americans with protection against the dislocations caused by modern capitalism.
liberalism traditionally understood as limited government and free market economics took on its modern meaning.
thanks to the new deal it now referred to active efforts by the national government to uplift less fortunate members of society.
freedom too underwent a transformation during the 1930s.
the depression had discredited the ideas that social progress rests on the unrestrained pursuit of wealth and that apart from unfortunates like widows and orphans most poverty is self inflicted.
the new deal elevated a public guarantee of economic security to the forefront of american discussions of freedom.
the 1930s were a decade of dramatic social upheaval.
social and political activists most notably a revitalized labor movement placed new issues on the political agenda.
when one writer in 1941 published a survey of democratic thought beginning in the ancient world he concluded that what distinguished his own time was its awareness of the social conditions of freedom thanks to the new deal he wrote economic security had at last been recognized as a political condition of personal freedom regional economic planning like that in the northwest reflected this understanding of freedom.
so did other new deal measures including the social security act which offered aid to the unemployed and aged and the fair labor standards act which established a national minimum wage.
yet while the new deal significantly expanded the meaning of freedom it did not erase freedoms boundaries.
its benefits flowed to industrial workers but not tenant farmers to men far more fully than women and to white americans more than blacks who in the south still were deprived of the basic rights of citizenship.
the first new deal fdr and the election of it is indeed paradoxical that franklin d roosevelt who had been raised in privilege on a new york country estate came to be beloved as the symbolic representative of ordinary citizens.

he graduated from harvard in 1904 and six years later won election to the new york legislature from duchess county site of his familys home at hyde park.
after serving as undersecretary of the navy during world war i he ran for vice president on the ill fated democratic ticket of 1920 headed by james m cox.
in 1921 he contracted polio and lost the use of his legs a fact carefully concealed from the public in that pre television era.
very few americans realized that the president who projected an image of vigorous leadership during the 1930s and world war ii was confined to a wheelchair.
in his speech accepting the democratic nomination for president in 1932 roosevelt promised a new deal for the american people.
but his campaign offered only vague hints of what this might entail.
roosevelt spoke of the governments responsibility to guarantee every man.
a right to make a comfortable living but he also advocated a balanced federal budget and criticized his opponent president hoover for excessive government spending.
the biggest difference between the parties during the campaign was the democrats call for the repeal of prohibition.
battered by the economic what were the major policy initiatives of the new deal in the hundred days.
crisis americans in 1932 were desperate for new leadership and roosevelt won a resounding victory.

for nearly the entire decade of the 1930s conservative governments ruled britain and france.
they were more interested in preserving public order than relieving suffering or embarking on policy innovations.

roosevelt conceived of the new deal as an alternative to socialism on the left nazism on the right and the inaction of upholders of unregulated capitalism.
he hoped to reconcile democracy individual liberty and economic planning.

at first he relied heavily for advice on a group of intellectuals and social workers who took up key positions in his administration.
they included secretary of labor frances perkins a veteran of hull house and the new york consumers league who had been among the eyewitnesses to the triangle fire of 1911 harry hopkins who had headed emergency relief efforts during roosevelts term as governor of new york secretary of the interior harold ickes a veteran of theodore roosevelts progressive campaign of 1912 and louis brandeis who had advised woodrow wilson during the 1912 campaign and now offered political advice to fdr while serving on the supreme court.
the presence of these individuals reflected how roosevelt drew on the reform traditions of the progressive era.
but progressivism as noted in chapter 18 was hardly a unified movement and roosevelts advisers did not speak with one voice.
brandeis believed that large corporations not only wielded excessive power but had contributed to the depression by keeping prices artificially high and failing to increase workers purchasing power.
they should be broken up he insisted not regulated.
but the brains trust a group of academics that included a number of columbia university professors saw bigness as inevitable in a modern economy.

roosevelt confronted a banking system on the verge of collapse.
as bank funds invested in the stock market lost their value and panicked depositors withdrew their savings bank after bank had closed its doors.
by march 1933 banking had been suspended in a majority of the states that is people could not gain access to money in their bank accounts.
roosevelt declared a bank holiday temporarily halting all bank operations and called congress into special session.
on march 9 it rushed to pass the emergency banking act which provided funds to shore up threatened institutions.
further measures soon followed that transformed the american financial system.
the glass steagall act barred commercial banks from becoming involved in the buying and selling of stocks.
until its repeal in the 1990s the law prevented many of the irresponsible practices that had contributed to the stock market crash.
the same law established the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic a government system that insured the accounts of individual depositors.
and roosevelt took the united states off the gold standard that is he severed the link between the countrys currency and its gold reserves thus making possible the issuance of more money in the hope of stimulating business activity.
together these measures rescued the financial what were the major policy initiatives of the new deal in the hundred days.
system and greatly increased the governments power over it.
about 5 000 banks one third of the nations total had failed between 1929 and 1933 representing a loss of tens of millions of dollars to depositors.
in 1936 not a single bank failed in the united states.
the nra the emergency banking act was the first of an unprecedented flurry of legislation during the first three months of roosevelts administration a period known as the hundred days seizing on the sense of crisis and the momentum of his electoral victory roosevelt won rapid passage of laws he hoped would promote economic recovery.
he persuaded congress to create a host of new agencies whose initials soon became part of the language of politics nra aaa ccc.
never in american history had a president exercised such power or so rapidly expanded the role of the federal government in peoples lives.
the centerpiece of roosevelts plan for combating the depression the national industrial recovery act was to a large extent modeled on the government business partnership established by the war industries board of world war i roosevelt called it the most important and far reaching legislation ever enacted by the american congress the act established the national recovery administration nra which would work with groups of business leaders to establish industry codes that set standards for output prices and working conditions.
thus cutthroat competition in which companies took losses to drive competitors out of business would be ended.
these industrywide arrangements would be exempt from antitrust laws.
the nra reflected how even in its early days the new deal reshaped understandings of freedom.
in effect fdr had repudiated the older idea of liberty based on the idea that the best way to encourage economic activity and ensure a fair distribution of wealth was to allow market competition to operate unrestrained by the government.
and to win support from labor section 7a of the new law recognized the workers right to organize unions a departure from the open shop policies of the 1920s and a step toward government support for what workers called industrial freedom headed by hugh s johnson a retired general and businessman the nra quickly established codes that set standards for production prices and wages in the textile steel mining and auto industries.
johnson launched a publicity campaign to promote the nra and its symbol the blue eagle which stores and factories that abided by the codes displayed.
but after initial public enthusiasm the nra became mired in controversy.
large companies dominated the codewriting process.
an inquiry conducted by the labor lawyer clarence darrow in 1934 concluded that they used the nra to drive up prices limit production lay off workers and divide markets among themselves at the expense of smaller competitors.
many anti union employers ignored section 7a.
the government lacked the manpower to police the 750 codes in effect by 1935.
the nra produced neither economic recovery nor peace between employers and workers.
the spirit of the new deal a 1933 cartoon in the washington star depicts the federal government through the national recovery administration promoting peace between workers and employers.
21 the new deal 1932 1940 the first new deal government jobs the hundred days also brought the government into providing relief to those in need.
roosevelt and most of his advisers shared the widespread fear that direct government payments to the unemployed would undermine individual self reliance.
indeed one of the first measures of the hundred days had been the economy act which reduced federal spending in an attempt to win the confidence of the business community.
but with nearly a quarter of the workforce unemployed spending on relief was unavoidable.
in may 1933 congress created the federal emergency relief administration to make grants to local agencies that aided those impoverished by the depression.
fdr however much preferred to create temporary jobs thereby combating unemployment while improving the nations infrastructure of roads bridges public buildings and parks.
in march 1933 congress established the civilian conservation corps ccc which set unemployed young men to work on projects like forest preservation flood control and the improvement of national parks and wildlife preserves.
by the time the program ended in 1942 more than 3 million persons had passed through ccc camps where they received government wages of 30 per month.
public works projects one section of the national industrial recovery act created the public works administration pwa with an appropriation of 3 3 billion.
directed by secretary of the interior harold ickes it built roads schools hospitals and other public facilities including new york citys triborough bridge and the overseas highway between miami and key west florida.
in november yet another agency the civil works administration cwa was launched.
by january 1934 it employed more than 4 million persons in the construction of highways tunnels courthouses and airports.
but as the cost spiraled a civilian conservation corps workforce in yosemite national park 1935.
what were the major policy initiatives of the new deal in the hundred days.
upward and complaints multiplied that the new deal was creating a class of americans permanently dependent on government jobs roosevelt ordered the cwa dissolved.
some new deal public works initiatives looked to government planned economic transformation as much as economic relief.
the tennessee valley authority tva another product of the hundred days built a series of dams to prevent floods and deforestation along the tennessee river and to provide cheap electric power for homes and factories in a seven state region where many families still lived in isolated log cabins.
the tva put the federal government for the first time in the business of selling electricity in competition with private companies.
it was a preview of the program of regional planning that spurred the economic development of the west.
the new deal and a g r i c u lt u r e another policy initiative of the hundred days addressed the disastrous plight of american farmers.
the agricultural adjustment act aaa authorized the federal government to try to raise farm prices by setting production quotas for major crops and paying farmers not to plant more.
many crops already in the field were destroyed.
in 1933 the government ordered more than 6 million pigs slaughtered as part of the policy a step critics found strange at a time of widespread hunger.
the aaa succeeded in significantly raising farm prices and incomes.
but not all farmers benefited.
benefits flowed to property owning farmers a map published by the public works administration in 1935 depicts some of the numerous infrastructure projects funded by the new deal.
among the most famous public works projects are the triborough bridge in new york city the key west highway in florida and the grand coulee dam in washington.
overall the new deal spent 250 billion in todays money to construct among other things 40 000 public buildings 72 000 schools 80 000 bridges and 8 000 parks.

the new deal and housing owning ones home had long been a widely shared american ambition.
a man is not a whole and complete man walt whitman had written in the 1850s unless he owns a house and the ground it stands on for many members of the middle class home ownership had become a mark of respectability.
for workers it offered economic security at a time of low wages erratic employment and limited occupational mobility.
on the eve of world war i a considerably higher percentage of immigrant workers than the native born middle class owned their homes.
the depression devastated the american housing industry.
the construction of new residences all but ceased and banks and savings and loan associations that had financed home ownership collapsed or to remain afloat foreclosed on many homes a quarter of a million in 1932 alone.
in 1931 president hoover convened a conference on home building and home ownership to review the housing crisis.
the president called owning a home an american birthright the embodiment of the spirit of enterprise of independence and of.
freedom rented apartments he pointed out did not inspire immortal ballads like home sweet home or the little gray home in the west.
papers presented at the conference revealed that millions of americans lived in overcrowded unhealthy urban slums or in ramshackle rural dwellings.
private enterprise alone it seemed clear was unlikely to solve the nations housing crisis.
hoovers administration established a federally sponsored bank to issue home loans.
not until the new deal however did the government systematically enter the housing market.
roosevelt spoke of the security of the home as a fundamental right akin to the security of livelihood and the security of social insurance in 1933 and 1934 his administration ch.

the first new deal moved energetically to protect home owners from foreclosure and to stimulate new construction.
the home owners loan corporation and federal housing administration fha insured millions of long term mortgages issued by private banks.
at the same time the federal government itself built thousands of units of low rent housing.
new deal housing policy represented a remarkable departure from previous government practice.
thanks to the fha and later the veterans administration home ownership came within the reach of tens of millions of families.
it became cheaper for most americans to buy single family homes than to rent apartments.
other important measures of roosevelts first two years in office included the ratification of the twenty first amendment to the constitution which repealed prohibition the establishment of the federal communications commission to oversee the nations broadcast airwaves and telephone communications and the creation of the securities and exchange commission to regulate the stock and bond markets.
taken together the first new deal was a series of experiments some of which succeeded and some of which did not.
they transformed the role of the federal government constructed numerous public facilities and provided relief to millions of needy persons.
but they did not end the depression.
some 10 million americans more than 20 percent of the workforce remained unemployed when 1934 came to an end.
the court and the new deal in 1935 the supreme court still controlled by conservative republican judges who held to the nineteenth century understanding of freedom as liberty of contract began to invalidate key new deal laws.
first came the nra declared unconstitutional in may in a case brought by the schechter poultry company of brooklyn which had been charged with violating the code adopted by the chicken industry.
in a unanimous decision the court declared the nra unlawful because in its codes and other regulations it delegated legislative powers to the president and attempted to regulate local businesses that did not engage in interstate commerce.

t h e g r a s s r o o t s r e v o lt labors great upheaval the most striking development of the mid 1930s was the mobilization of millions of workers in mass production industries that had successfully resisted unionization.
labors great upheaval as this era of unprecedented militancy was called came as a great surprise.
unlike in the past however the federal government now seemed to be on the side of labor a commitment embodied in the national industrial recovery act and in the wagner act discussed later of 1935 which granted workers the legal right to form unions.
with the severe reduction of european immigration ethnic differences among workers had diminished in importance.
american born children of the new immigrants now dominated the industrial labor force and organizers no longer had to distribute materials in numerous languages as the iww had done.
and a cadre of militant labor leaders many of them socialists and communists with long experience in organization had survived the repression of the 1920s.
they provided leadership to the labor upsurge.
american factories at the outset of the new deal were miniature dictatorships in which unions were rare workers could be beaten by supervisors and fired at will and management determined the length of the workday and speed of the assembly line.
in industrial communities scattered across the country local government firmly supported the companies.

workers demands during the 1930s went beyond better wages.
they included an end to employers arbitrary power in the workplace and basic civil liberties for workers including the right to picket distribute literature and meet to discuss their grievances.
all these goals required union recognition.
roosevelts election as president did much to rekindle hope among those who called themselves in the words of a worker writing to secretary of labor frances perkins slaves of the depression his inauguration unleashed a flood of poignant letters to the federal government describing what a louisiana sugar laborer called the terrible and inhuman condition of many workers.

san francisco experienced the countrys first general strike since 1919.
it began with a walkout of dockworkers led by the fiery communist harry bridges.
workers demanded recognition of the international longshoremens association and an end to the hated shape up system in which they had to gather en masse each day to wait for work assignments.
the year 1934 also witnessed a strike of 400 000 textile workers in states from new england to the deep south demanding recognition of the united textile workers.
many of these walkouts including those in toledo minneapolis and san francisco won at least some of the workers demands.
but the textile strike failed.
the rise of the cio the labor upheaval posed a challenge to the american federation of labors traditional policy of organizing workers by craft welders or machine repairers for example rather than seeking to mobilize all the workers in a given industry such as steel manufacturing.

in december 1936 the united auto workers uaw a fledgling cio union unveiled the sit down a strikingly effective tactic that the iww had pioneered three decades earlier.
rather than walking out of a plant thus enabling management to bring in strikebreakers workers halted production but remained inside.
in the uaws first sit down strike 7 000 general motors workers seized control of the fisher body plant in cleveland.
sitdowns soon spread to gm plants in flint michigan the nerve center of automobile production.
when local police tried to storm the flint plants workers fought them off.
democratic governor frank murphy who had been elected with strong support from the cio declared his unwillingness to use force to dislodge the strikers.
the strikers demonstrated a remarkable spirit of unity.
they cleaned the plant oiled the idle machinery settled disputes among themselves prepared meals and held concerts of labor songs.
workers wives shuttled food into the plant.
they made a palace out of what had been their prison wrote one reporter.
on february 11 general motors agreed to negotiate with the uaw.
not until 1941 would the bitterly anti union henry ford sign a labor contract.
but by the end of 1937 the uaw claimed 400 000 members.
the victory in the auto industry reverberated throughout industrial america.
steelworkers had suffered memorable defeats in the struggle for unionization notably at homestead in 1892 and in the great steel strike of 1919.
u s steel the countrys single most important business firm owner of an industrial empire that stretched across several states and employed more than 200 000 workers had been among the strongest opponents of unionization.
but in march 1937 fearing a sit down campaign and aware that it could no longer count on the aid of state and federal authorities the company agreed to recognize the steel workers organizing committee forerunner of the united steelworkers of america.

unlike the afl traditionally hostile to government intervention in labor management relations the cio put forward an ambitious program for federal action to shield americans from economic and social insecurity including public housing universal health care and unemployment and old age insurance.
building on the idea so prominent in the 1920s that the key to prosperity lay in an american standard of living based on mass consumption cio leaders explained the depression as the result of an imbalance of wealth and income.
the role of unions in cooperation with the government they argued was to create a consumers demand by raising wages and redistributing wealth.
only in this way could society absorb the products that rolled off modern assembly lines.
the pathbreaking 1937 agreement between the uaw and general motors spoke of a rate of pay commensurate with an american standard of living by mid decade many new dealers accepted the underconsumptionist explanation of the depression which saw lack of sufficient consumer demand as its underlying cause.
they concluded that the government must act to raise dramatically wage earners share of the national income.
voices of protest other popular movements of the mid 1930s also placed the question of economic justice on the political agenda.
in california the novelist upton sinclair won the democratic nomination for governor in 1934 as the head of the end poverty in california movement.
sinclair called for the state to use idle factories and land in cooperative ventures that would provide jobs for the unemployed.
he lost the election after being subjected to one of the first modern negative media campaigns.
sinclairs opponents circulated false newsreels showing armies of unemployed men marching to california to support his candidacy and a fake endorsement from the communist party.
the rise to national prominence of huey long offered another sign of popular dissatisfaction with the slow pace of economic recovery.
longs career embodied both louisianas populist and socialist traditions winn parish his home had voted for both of these third parties and the states heritage of undemocratic politics.
driven by intense ambition and the desire to help uplift the states common people long won election as governor in 1928 and in 1930 took a seat in the u s senate.
from washington he dominated every branch of state government.
he used his dictatorial power to build roads schools and hospitals and to increase the tax burden on louisianas oil companies.

he was on the verge of announcing a run for president when the son of a defeated political rival assassinated him in 1935.
also in the mid 1930s the radio priest father charles e coughlin attracted millions of listeners with weekly broadcasts attacking wall street bankers and greedy capitalists and calling for government ownership of key industries as a way of combating the depression.
initially a strong supporter of fdr coughlin became increasingly critical of the president for what he considered the failure of the new deal to promote social justice.
his crusade would later shift to anti semitism and support for european fascism.
dr francis townsend a california physician meanwhile won wide support for a plan by which the government would make a monthly payment of 200 to older americans with the requirement that they spend it immediately.
this he argued would boost the economy.
by the end of 1934 townsend clubs claimed more than 2 million members.
along with the rise of the cio these signs of popular discontent helped to spark the second new deal.
the second new deal spurred by the failure of his initial policies to pull the country out of the depression and the growing popular clamor for greater economic equality and buoyed by democratic gains in the midterm elections of 1934 roosevelt in 1935 launched the second new deal.
the first had focused on economic recovery.
the emphasis of the second was economic security a guarantee that americans would be protected against unemployment and poverty.
boys roosevelts relief administrator harry hopkins told his staff this is our hour.
weve got to get everything we want a public works program social security wages and hours everything now or never the idea that lack of consumer demand caused the depression had been popularized by huey long francis townsend and the cio.
by 1935 more and more new dealers had concluded that the government should no longer try to plan business recovery but should try to redistribute the national income so as to sustain mass purchasing power in the consumer economy.

congress levied a highly publicized tax on large fortunes and corporate profits a direct response to the popularity of huey longs share our wealth campaign.
it created the rural electrification agency rea to bring electric power to homes that lacked it 80 percent of farms were still without electricity in 1934 in part to enable more americans to purchase household appliances.
the rea proved to be one of the second new deals most successful programs.
by 1950 90 percent of the nations farms had been wired for electricity and almost all now possessed radios electric stoves refrigerators and mechanical equipment to milk cows.
in addition the federal government under the second new deal tried to promote soil conservation and family farming.
this effort resulted from the belief that the country would never achieve prosperity so long as farmers standard of living lagged well behind that of city dwellers and that rural poverty resulted mainly from the poor use of natural resources.
thus farmers received federal assistance in reducing soil loss in their fields.
the federal government also purchased significant amounts of marginal and eroded land and converted these areas from farms into national grasslands and parks.
it encouraged more environmentally conscious agricultural techniques.
these measures like those of the aaa mainly benefited landowners not sharecroppers tenants or migrant workers.
in the long run the second new deal failed to arrest the trend toward larger farms and fewer farmers.
the a poster by the artist vera bock for the federal art project of the works progress administration depicts farmers and laborers joining hands to produce prosperity.
wpa and the wagner act in 1934 roosevelt had severely curtailed federal employment for those in need.
now he approved the establishment of the works progress administration wpa which hired some 3 million americans in virtually every walk of life each year until it ended in 1943.
under harry hopkinss direction the wpa changed the physical face of the united states.
it constructed thousands of public buildings and bridges more than 500 000 miles of roads and 600 airports.
it built stadiums swimming pools and sewage treatment plants.
unlike previous work relief programs the wpa employed many out of work white collar workers and professionals even doctors and dentists.
perhaps the most famous wpa projects were in the arts.
the wpa set hundreds of artists to work decorating public buildings with murals.
it hired writers to produce local histories and guidebooks to the forty eight states and to record the recollections of ordinary americans including hundreds of former slaves.
its federal theater project put on plays including an all black production of macbeth and sinclair lewiss drama it cant happen here about fascism coming to the united states.
the federal music project established orchestras and choral groups and the federal dance project sponsored ballet and modern dance programs.
thanks to the wpa audiences across the country enjoyed their first glimpse of live musical and theatrical performances and their first opportunity to view exhibitions of american art.
also in 1935 congress created the national youth administration to provide relief to american teenagers and young adults.
another major initiative of the second new deal the wagner act was known at the time as labors magna carta a reference to an early landmark in the history of freedom.
this brought democracy into the what were the major initiatives of the second new deal and how did they differ from the first new deal.
american workplace by empowering the national labor relations board to supervise elections in which employees voted on union representation.
it also outlawed unfair labor practices including the firing and blacklisting of union organizers.
the bills main sponsor robert wagner of new york told the senate that the ability of workers to pool their strength through collective bargaining represented the next step in the evolution of american freedom he also promised that unionization and higher wages would aid economic recovery by boosting the purchasing power of ordinary americans.
the american w e l fa r e state the centerpiece of the second new deal was the social security act of 1935.
it embodied roosevelts conviction that the national government had a responsibility to ensure the material well being of ordinary americans.
it created a system of unemployment insurance old age pensions and aid to the disabled the elderly poor and families with dependent children.
none of these were original ideas.
the progressive platform of 1912 had called for old age pensions.
assistance to poor families with dependent children descended from the mothers pensions promoted by maternalist reformers.
many european countries had already adopted national unemployment insurance plans.
what was new however was that in the name of economic security the american government would now supervise not simply temporary relief but a permanent system of social insurance.
the social security act launched the american version of the welfare state a term that originated in britain during world war ii to refer to a system of income assistance health coverage and social services for all citizens.
the act illustrated both the extent and the limits of the changes an art exhibit in a new york city alley in 1938.
the works progress administration tried to broaden the audience for art by displaying it in unusual venues.
21 the new deal 1932 1940 a reckoning with liberty ushered in by the second new deal.
the american welfare state marked a radical departure from previous government policies but compared with similar programs in europe it has always been far more decentralized involved lower levels of public spending and covered fewer citizens.
the original social security bill for example envisioned a national system of health insurance.
but congress dropped this after ferocious opposition from the american medical association which feared government regulation of doctors activities and incomes.
the social security system some new dealers desired a program funded by the federal governments general tax revenues and with a single set of eligibility standards administered by national officials.
but secretary of labor frances perkins along with powerful members of congress wished to keep relief in the hands of state and local authorities and believed that workers should contribute directly to the cost of their own benefits.
roosevelt himself preferred to fund social security by taxes on employers and workers rather than out of general government revenues.
he believed that paying such taxes gave contributors a legal moral and political right to collect their old age pensions and unemployment benefits which no future congress could rescind.
as a result social security emerged as a hybrid of national and local funding control and eligibility standards.
old age pensions were administered nationally but paid for by taxes on employers and employees.
such taxes also paid for payments to the unemployed but this program was highly decentralized with the states retaining considerable control over the level of benefits.
the states paid most of the cost of direct poor relief under the program called aid to dependent children and eligibility and the level of payments varied enormously from place to place.
as will be discussed later the combination of local administration and the fact that domestic and agricultural workers were not covered by unemployment and old age benefits meant that social security at first excluded large numbers of americans especially unmarried women and non whites.
nonetheless social security represented a dramatic departure from the traditional functions of government.
the second new deal transformed the relationship between the federal government and american citizens.
before the 1930s national political debate often revolved around the question of whether the federal government should intervene in the economy.
after the new deal debate rested on how it should intervene.
in addition the government assumed a responsibility which it has never wholly relinquished for guaranteeing americans a living wage and protecting them against economic and personal misfortune.
laissez faire is dead wrote walter lippmann and the modern state has become responsible for the modern economy and the task of insuring.
the standard of life for its people a reckoning with liberty a 1935 poster promoting the new social security system.
the depression made inevitable in the words of one writer a reckoning with liberty for too many americans roosevelt proclaimed life was no how did the new deal recast the meaning of american freedom.
longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness the 1930s produced an outpouring of books and essays on freedom.
the large majority took for granted the need for a new definition.
in a volume entitled land of the free 1938 the poet archibald macleish used photographs of impoverished migrants and sharecroppers to question the reality of freedom in desperate times.
we told ourselves we were free he wrote.
now we wonder if the liberty is done.
or if theres something different men can mean by liberty like the civil war the new deal recast the idea of freedom by linking it to the expanding power of the national state.
our democracy wrote father john a ryan a prominent catholic social critic finds itself.
in a new age where not political freedom but social and industrial freedom is the most insistent cry influenced by ryan the national catholic welfare conference in 1935 declared that social justice required a government guarantee of continuous employment and a decent livelihood and adequate security for all americans.
a 1935 survey by fortune magazine found that among poor respondents 90 percent believed that the government should guarantee that every man who wants work has a job fdr and the idea of freedom along with being a superb politician roosevelt was a master of political communication.
at a time when his political opponents controlled most newspapers he harnessed radios power to bring his message directly into american homes.
by the mid 1930s more than two thirds of american families owned radios.
they listened avidly to roosevelts radio addresses known as fireside chats roosevelt adeptly appealed to traditional values in support of new policies.
he gave the term liberalism its modern meaning.
in the nineteenth century liberalism had been a shorthand for limited government and freemarket economics.
roosevelt consciously chose to employ it to describe a large active socially conscious state.
he reclaimed the word freedom from conservatives and made it a rallying cry for the new deal.
in his second fireside chat roosevelt juxtaposed his own definition of liberty as greater security for the average man to the older notion of liberty of contract which served the interests of the privileged few henceforth he would consistently link freedom with economic security and identify entrenched economic inequality as its greatest enemy.
the liberty of a democracy he declared in 1938 was not safe if citizens could not sustain an acceptable standard of living even as roosevelt invoked the word to uphold the new deal liberty in the sense of freedom from powerful government became the fighting slogan of his opponents.
their principal critique of the new deal was that its reckless spending undermined fiscal responsibility and its new government regulations restricted american freedom.
when conservative businessmen and politicians in 1934 formed an organization to mobilize opposition to roosevelts policies they called it the american liberty league.
robert taft of ohio leader of the republicans in congress accused roosevelt of sacrificing individual freedom in a misguided effort to improve the conditions of the poor fdr delivering one of his fireside chats in 1938.
roosevelt was the first president to make effective use of the radio to promote his policies.
voices of freedom f r o m f r a n k l i n d.
r o o s e v e lt fi r e s i d e c h a t 1 9 3 4 president roosevelt pioneered the use of the new mass medium of radio to speak directly to americans in their homes.
he used his fireside chats to mobilize support for new must be taken over into an all embracing government.
we have avoided on the other hand traditions and outline his definition of the equally untenable theory that it is an interference with liberty to offer reasonable help when private enterprise is in need of help.
the freedom.
course we have followed fits the american to those who say that our expenditures for public practice of government a practice of taking action step by step of regulating only to meet concrete needs a practice of courageous recognition of deal programs link them with american works and other means for recovery are a waste that we cannot afford i answer that no country however rich can afford the waste of its human resources.
demoralization caused by vast unemployment is our greatest extravagance.
morally it is the greatest menace to our social order.
some people try to tell me that we must make up our minds that in the future we shall permanently have millions of unemployed just as other countries have had them for over a decade.
what may be necessary for those countries is not my responsibility to determine.
but as for this country i stand or fall by my refusal to accept as a necessary condition of our future a permanent army of unemployed.
in our efforts for recovery we have avoided on the one hand the theory that business should and change.
i believe with abraham lincoln that the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all or cannot do so well for themselves in their separate and individual capacities i am not for a return to that definition of liberty under which for many years a free people were being gradually regimented into the service of the privileged few.
i prefer and i am sure you prefer that broader definition of liberty under which we are moving forward to greater freedom to greater security for the average man than he has ever known before in the history of america.
from john steinbeck the har vest gypsies o n t h e ro a d t o t h e g r a p e s o f wr a t h 1 9 3 8 john steinbecks popular novel the grapes of wrath 1939 and the film version that followed shortly thereafter focused national attention on the plight of homeless migrants displaced from their farms as a result of the great depression.
before that book appeared steinbeck had published a series of newspaper articles based on eyewitness accounts of the migrants which became the basis for his novel.
in california we find a curious attitude toward a group that makes our agriculture successful.
the migrants are needed and they are hated.
the migrants are hated for the following reasons that they are ignorant and dirty people that they are carriers of disease that they increase the necessity for police and the tax bill for schooling in a community and that if they are allowed to organize they can simply by refusing to work wipe out the seasons crops.
let us see what kind of people they are where they come from and the routes of their wanderings.
in the past they have been of several races encouraged to come and often imported as cheap labor.
chinese in the early period then filipinos japanese and mexicans.
these were foreigners and as such they were ostracized and segregated and herded about.
but in recent years the foreign migrants have begun to organize and at this danger they have been deported in great numbers for there was a new reservoir from which a great quantity of cheap labor could be obtained.
the drought in the middle west has driven the agricultural populations of oklahoma nebraska and parts of kansas and texas westward.
thousands of them are crossing the borders in ancient rattling automobiles destitute and hungry and homeless ready to accept any pay so that they may eat and feed their children.
the earlier foreign migrants have invariably been drawn from a peon class.
this is not the case with the new migrants.
they are small farmers who have lost their farms or farm hands who have lived with the family in the old american way.
they have come from the little farm districts where democracy was not only possible but inevitable where popular government whether practiced in the grange in church organization or in local government was the responsibility of every man.
and they have come into the country where because of the movement necessary to make a living they are not allowed any vote whatever but are rather considered a properly unprivileged class.
as one little boy in a squatters camp said when they need us they call us migrants and when weve picked their crop were bums and we got to get out questions 1.
what does roosevelt mean by the difference between the definition of liberty that has existed in the past and his own broader definition of liberty.
according to steinbeck how do depression era migrant workers differ from those in earlier periods.
do the migrant workers described by steinbeck enjoy liberty as roosevelt understands it.
21 the new deal 1932 1940 a reckoning with liberty this 1935 cartoon by william gropper portrays uncle sam as gulliver tied down by lilliputians in the famous eighteenthcentury novel gullivers travels by jonathan swift.
in this case the bonds are the numerous agencies and laws created by the new deal which gropper suggests are inhibiting the country from getting back on its feet during the great depression.
as the 1930s progressed opponents of the new deal invoked the language of liberty with greater and greater passion.
the u s chamber of commerce charged fdr with attempting to sovietize america.
even though his own administration had abandoned laissez faire in the face of economic disaster former president hoover launched strident attacks on his successor for endangering fundamental american liberties in the challenge to liberty 1934 hoover called the new deal the most stupendous invasion of the whole spirit of liberty the nation had ever seen.
the election of by 1936 with working class voters providing massive majorities for the democratic party and businesses large and small bitterly estranged from the new deal politics reflected class divisions more completely than at any other time in american history.
conceptions of freedom divided sharply as well.
americans wrote george soule editor of the new republic confronted two opposing systems of concepts about liberty reflecting the needs and purposes of two opposing parts of the population one was the idea of freedom for private enterprise the other socialized liberty based on an equitably shared abundance a fight for the possession of the ideal of freedom reported the new york times emerged as the central issue of the presidential campaign of 1936.
the democratic platform insisted that in a modern economy the government has an obligation to establish a democracy of opportunity for all the people in his speech accepting renomination roosevelt launched a blistering attack against economic royalists who he charged sought to establish a new tyranny over the average man economic rights he went on how did the new deal recast the meaning of american freedom.
were the precondition of liberty poor men are not free men throughout the campaign fdr would insist that the threat posed to economic freedom by the new despotism of large corporations was the main issue of the election.
as roosevelts opponent republicans chose kansas governor alfred landon a former theodore roosevelt progressive.
landon denounced social security and other measures as threats to individual liberty.
opposition to the new deal planted the seeds for the later flowering of an antigovernment conservatism bent on upholding the free market and dismantling the welfare state.
but in 1936 roosevelt won a landslide reelection with more than 60 percent of the popular vote.
he carried every state except maine and vermont.
roosevelts victory was all the more remarkable in view of the heavy support most of the nations newspapers and nearly the entire business community gave to the republicans.
his success stemmed from strong backing from organized labor and his ability to unite southern white and northern black voters protestant farmers and urban catholic and jewish ethnics industrial workers and middle class home owners.
these groups made up the so called new deal coalition which would dominate american politics for nearly half a century.
the court fight roosevelts second inaugural address was the first to be delivered on january 20.
in order to lessen a newly elected presidents wait before taking office the recently ratified twentieth amendment had moved inauguration day from march 4.
fdr called on the nation to redouble its efforts to aid those who have too little the depression he admitted had not been conquered i see one third of a nation ill housed ill clad and ill nourished emboldened by his electoral triumph roosevelt now made what many considered a serious political miscalculation.
on the pretense that several members of the supreme court were too old to perform their functions he proposed that the president be allowed to appoint a new justice for each one who remained on the court past age seventy an age that six of the nine had already surpassed.
fdrs aim of course was to change the balance of power on a court that he feared might well invalidate social security the wagner act and other measures of the second new deal.
the plan aroused cries that the president was an aspiring dictator.
congress rejected it.
but roosevelt accomplished his underlying purpose.
the supreme court it is sometimes said follows the election returns.
coming soon after roosevelts landslide victory of 1936 the threat of court packing inspired an astonishing about face on the part of key justices.
beginning in march 1937 the court suddenly revealed a new willingness to support economic regulation by both the federal government and the states.
it upheld a minimum wage law of the state of washington similar to the new york measure it had declared unconstitutional a year earlier.
it turned aside challenges to social security and the wagner act.
in subsequent cases the court affirmed federal power to regulate wages hours child labor agricultural production and numerous other aspects of economic life.
announcing a new judicial definition of freedom chief justice charles evans hughes pointed out that the words freedom of contract did not fall in a cartoon commenting on roosevelts proposal to pack the supreme court from the richmond times dispatch january 8 1937.
21 the new deal 1932 1940 figure 21 2 unemployment percentage of civilian labor force unemployed 1925 1945 the limits of change appear in the constitution.
liberty however did and this hughes continued required the protection of law against the evils which menace the health safety morals and welfare of the people the courts new willingness to accept the new deal marked a permanent change in judicial policy.
having declared dozens of economic laws unconstitutional in the decades leading up to 1937 the justices have rarely done so since.
1925 1927 1930 1933 1936 1939 1942 1945 year the new deal did not really solve the problem of unemployment which fell below 10 percent only in 1941 as the united states prepared to enter world war ii.
the end of the second new deal even as the court made its peace with roosevelts policies the momentum of the second new deal slowed.
the landmark united states housing act did pass in 1937 initiating the first major national effort to build homes for the poorest americans.
but the fair labor standards bill failed to reach the floor for over a year.
when it finally passed in 1938 it banned goods produced by child labor from interstate commerce set forty cents as the minimum hourly wage and required overtime pay for hours of work exceeding forty per week.
this last major piece of new deal legislation established the practice of federal regulation of wages and working conditions another radical departure from pre depression policies.
the year 1937 also witnessed a sharp downturn of the economy.
with economic conditions improving in 1936 roosevelt had reduced federal funding for farm subsidies and wpa work relief.
the result was disastrous.
as government spending fell so did business investment industrial production and the stock market.
unemployment still 14 percent at the beginning of 1937 rose to nearly 20 percent by years end.
in 1936 in the general theory of employment interest and money john maynard keynes had challenged economists traditional belief in the sanctity of balanced budgets.
large scale government spending he insisted was necessary to sustain purchasing power and stimulate economic activity during downturns.
such spending should be enacted even at the cost of a budget deficit a situation in which the government spends more money than it takes in.
by 1938 roosevelt was ready to follow this prescription which would later be known as keynesian economics.
in april he asked congress for billions more for work relief and farm aid.
by the end of the year the immediate crisis had passed.
but the events of 1937 1938 marked a major shift in new deal philosophy.
rather than economic planning as in 1933 1934 or economic redistribution as in 1935 1936 public spending would now be the governments major tool for combating unemployment and stimulating economic growth.
the second new deal had come to an end.
the limits of change roosevelt conceived of the second new deal and especially social security as expanding the meaning of freedom by extending assistance to broad groups of needy americans the unemployed elderly and dependent as a right of citizenship not charity or special privilege.
but political realities especially the power of inherited ideas about gender and black disenfranchisement in the south powerfully affected the drafting of legislation.
different groups of americans experienced the new deal in radically different ways.
how did new deal benefits apply to women and minorities.
the new deal and american women the new deal brought more women into government than ever before in american history.
a number of talented women including secretary of labor frances perkins advised the president and shaped public policy.
most prominent of all was eleanor roosevelt fdrs distant cousin whom he had married in 1905.
she transformed the role of first lady turning a position with no formal responsibilities into a base for political action.
she traveled widely spoke out on public issues wrote a regular newspaper column that sometimes disagreed openly with her husbands policies and worked to enlarge the scope of the new deal in areas like civil rights labor legislation and work relief.
but even as the new deal increased womens visibility in national politics organized feminism already in disarray during the 1920s disappeared as a political force.
indeed the depression inspired widespread demands for women to remove themselves from the labor market to make room for unemployed men.
because the depression hit industrial employment harder than low wage clerical and service jobs where women predominated the proportion of the workforce made up of women rose.
the government tried to reverse this trend.
the economy act of 1932 prohibited both members of a married couple from holding federal jobs.
until its repeal in 1937 it led to the dismissal of numerous female civil service employees whose husbands worked for the government.
many states and localities prohibited the hiring of women whose husbands earned a living wage and employers from banks to public school systems barred married women from jobs.
although the cio organized female workers it too adhered to the idea that women should be supported by men.
the working wife whose husband is employed said a vice president of the united auto workers should be barred from industry eleanor roosevelt transformed the role of first lady by taking an active and visible part in public life.
here she visits a west virginia coal mine in 1933.
21 the new deal 1932 1940 the limits of change most new deal programs did not exclude women from benefits although the ccc restricted its camps to men.
but the ideal of the male headed household powerfully shaped social policy.
since paying taxes on ones wages made one eligible for the most generous social security programs old age pensions and unemployment insurance they left most women uncovered since they did not work outside the home.
the program excluded the 3 million mostly female domestic workers altogether.
those who need protection most are completely overlooked the sister of a household worker complained to secretary of labor perkins.
what about the poor domestics both in private homes and private institutions.
what have you done for them.
nothing the southern veto roosevelt made the federal government the symbolic representative of all the people including racial and ethnic groups generally ignored by previous administrations.
yet the power of the solid south helped to mold the new deal welfare state into an entitlement of white americans.
after the souths blacks lost the right to vote around the turn of the century democrats enjoyed a political monopoly in the region.
democratic members of congress were elected again and again.
with results predetermined many whites did not bother to vote only about 20 percent of eligible southern voters cast ballots in the election of 1920.
but this tiny electorate had an enormous impact on national policy.
committee chairmanships in congress rest on seniority how many years a member has served in office.
beginning in 1933 when democrats took control of congress southerners took the key leadership positions.
despite his personal popularity roosevelt felt he could not challenge the power of southern democrats if he wished legislation to pass.
at their insistence the social security law excluded agricultural and domestic workers the largest categories of black employment.
roosevelt spoke of social securitys universality but the demand for truly comprehensive coverage came from the political left and black organizations.
congressman ernest lundeen of minnesota in 1935 introduced a bill establishing a federally controlled system of old age unemployment and health benefits for all wage workers plus support for female heads of households with dependents.
black organizations like the urban league and the naacp supported the lundeen bill and lobbied strenuously for a system that enabled agricultural and domestic workers to receive unemployment and old age benefits and that established national relief standards.
the social security act however not lundeens proposal became law.
its limitations complained the pittsburgh courier a black newspaper reflected the power of reactionary elements in the south who cannot bear the thought of negroes getting pensions and compensations and who feared that the inclusion of black workers would disrupt the regions lowwage racially divided labor system.
the stigma of w e l fa r e because of the southern veto the majority of black workers found themselves confined to the least generous and most vulnerable wing of the new welfare state.
the public assistance programs established by social security how did new deal benefits apply to women and minorities.
notably aid to dependent children and to the poor elderly were open to all americans who could demonstrate financial need.
but they set benefits at extremely low levels and authorized the states to determine eligibility standards including moral behavior as defined by local authorities.
as a result public assistance programs allowed for widespread discrimination in the distribution of benefits.
because recipients did not pay social security taxes they soon came to bear the humiliating stigma of dependency on government handouts which would soon come to be known as welfare in 1942 the national resources planning board noted that because of their exclusion from programs which give aid under relatively favorable conditions blacks were becoming disproportionately dependent on welfare a program widely viewed with popular disfavor.
the situation the report concluded seemed certain to stigmatize blacks as recipients of unearned government assistance and welfare as a program for minorities thus dooming it forever to inadequate standards of aid over time this is precisely what happened until the federal government abolished its responsibility for welfare in 1996 during the presidency of bill clinton.
the indian new deal overall the depression and new deal had a contradictory impact on americas racial minorities.
under commissioner of indian affairs john collier the administration launched an indian new deal collier ended the policy of forced assimilation and allowed indians unprecedented cultural autonomy.
he replaced boarding schools meant to eradicate the tribal heritage of indian children with schools on reservations and dramatically increased spending on indian health.
he secured passage of the indian reorganization act of 1934 ending the policy dating back to the dawes act of 1887 of dividing indian lands into small plots for individual families and selling off the rest.
federal authorities once again recognized indians right to govern their own affairs except where specifically limited by national laws.
such limitations however could weigh heavily on indian tribes.
the navajos the nations largest tribe refused to cooperate with the reorganization act as a protest against a federal soil conservation program that required them to reduce their herds of livestock.
the new deal marked the most radical shift in indian policy in the nations history.
but living conditions on the desperately poor reservations did not significantly improve and new deal programs often ignored indians interests.
the building of the grand coulee dam on the columbia river flooded thousands of acres where indians had hunted and fished for centuries.
but the government did not make any of the irrigation water available to the regions reservations.
the new deal and mexican americans for mexican americans the depression was a wrenching experience.
with demand for their labor plummeting more than 400 000 one fifth of the population of mexican origin returned to mexico some voluntarily others at the strong urging of local authorities in the southwest.
a majority of those encouraged to leave the country were recent immigrants but they included perhaps 200 000 mexican american children who had been born ch.

the limits of change in the united states and were therefore citizens.
those who remained mostly worked in grim conditions in californias vegetable and fruit fields whose corporate farms benefited enormously from new deal dam construction that provided them with cheap electricity and water for irrigation.
the wagner and social security acts did not apply to agricultural laborers.
when the workers tried to organize a union as part of the decades labor upsurge they were brutally suppressed.
in his 1939 book factories in the field the writer carey mcwilliams exposed the low wages inadequate housing and political repression under which the migrant laborers suffered which the new deal did nothing to alleviate.
mexican american leaders struggled to develop a consistent strategy for their people.
they sought greater rights by claiming to be white americans in order to not suffer the same discrimination as african americans but also sought the backing of the mexican government and promoted a mystical sense of pride and identification with mexican heritage later given the name la raza.
last hired first fired as the last hired and first fired african americans were hit hardest by the depression.
even those who retained their jobs now faced competition from unemployed whites who had previously considered positions like waiter and porter beneath them.
with an unemployment rate double that of whites blacks benefited disproportionately from direct government relief and especially in northern cities jobs on new deal public works projects.
half of the families in harlem received public assistance during the 1930s.
the depression propelled economic survival to the top of the black agenda.
demonstrations in harlem demanded jobs in the neighborhoods white owned stores with the slogan dont buy where you cant work w e b.
du bois abandoned his earlier goal of racial integration as unrealistic for the foreseeable future.
blacks he wrote must recognize themselves as a nation within a nation he called on blacks to organize for economic survival by building an independent cooperative economy within their segregated communities and to gain control of their own separate schools a position reminiscent of that of booker t washington whom he had earlier condemned.
a new deal for blacks although roosevelt seems to have had little personal interest in race relations or civil rights he appointed mary mcleod bethune a prominent black educator as a special adviser on minority affairs and a number of other how did new deal benefits apply to women and minorities.
blacks to important federal positions.
key members of his administration including his wife eleanor and secretary of the interior harold ickes a former president of the chicago chapter of the naacp directed national attention to the injustices of segregation disenfranchisement and lynching.
in 1939 eleanor roosevelt resigned from the daughters of the american revolution when the organization refused to allow the black singer marian anderson to present a concert at constitution hall in washington.
the presidents wife arranged for anderson to sing on the steps of the lincoln memorial and for the concert to be broadcast nationally on the radio.
thanks to the new deal bethune proclaimed a new day had dawned when blacks would finally reach the promised land of liberty the decade witnessed a historic shift in black voting patterns.
in the north and west where they enjoyed the right to vote blacks in 1934 and 1936 abandoned their allegiance to the party of lincoln and emancipation in favor of democrats and the new deal.
but their hopes for broad changes in the nations race system were disappointed.
despite a massive lobbying campaign southern congressmen prevented passage of a federal antilynching law.
fdr offered little support.
i did not choose the tools with which i must work he told walter white of the naacp he could not jeopardize his economic programs by alienating powerful members of congress.
the ccc established segregated work camps.
because of the exclusion of agricultural and domestic workers social securitys old age pensions and unemployment benefits and the minimum wages established by the fair labor standards act left uncovered 60 percent of all employed blacks and 85 percent of black women.
federal discrimination federal housing policy which powerfully reinforced residential segregation revealed the limits of new deal freedom.
as in the case of social security local officials put national housing policy into practice in a way that reinforced existing racial boundaries.
nearly all municipalities north as well as south insisted that housing built or financially aided by the federal government be racially segregated.
in texas some communities financed three sets of housing projects for whites blacks and mexicans.
the federal housing administration moreover had no hesitation about insuring mortgages that contained clauses barring future sales to nonwhite buyers and it refused to channel money into integrated neighborhoods.
in some cases the presence of a single black family led the agency to declare an entire block off limits for federal mortgage insurance.
along with discriminatory practices by private banks and real estate companies federal policy became a major factor in further entrenching housing segregation in the united states.
federal employment practices also discriminated on the basis of race.
as late as 1940 of the 150 000 blacks holding federal jobs only 2 percent occupied positions other than clerk or custodian.
in the south many new deal construction projects refused to hire blacks at all.
they give all the work to white people and give us nothing a black resident of mississippi wrote to fdr in 1935.
the new deal began the process of modernizing southern agriculture but tenants black and white footed much of the bill.
tens of thousands of sharecroppers as noted earlier were driven off the land as a result a black clergyman carrying a sign outside peoples drugstore in washington d c in the late 1930s.
the dont buy where you cant work campaign targeted stores that served black customers but refused to hire black employees.
21 the new deal 1932 1940 a new conception of america of the aaa policy of raising crop prices by paying landowners to reduce cotton acreage.
support for civil rights would eventually become a test of liberal credentials.
but in the 1930s one could advocate roosevelts economic program and oppose antilynching legislation and moves to incorporate black workers within social security.
theodore bilbo the notoriously racist senator from mississippi was one of the new deals most loyal backers.
not until the great society of the 1960s would those left out of social security and other new deal programs racial minorities many women migrants and other less privileged workers win inclusion in the american welfare state.
a new conception of america a map of charlotte north carolina prepared by the home owners loan corporation illustrates how federal agencies engaged in redlining of neighborhoods containing blue collar and black residents.
wealthy areas coded green were given the best credit ratings and white collar districts in blue the second best.
residents of red districts found it almost impossible to obtain government housing loans.
but if the new deal failed to dismantle the barriers that barred non whites from full participation in american life the 1930s witnessed the absorption of other groups into the social mainstream.
with catholics and jews occupying prominent posts in the roosevelt administration and new immigrant voters forming an important part of its electoral support the new deal made ethnic pluralism a living reality in american politics.
the election of the italian american fiorello la guardia as mayor of new york city in 1933 symbolized the coming to power of the new immigrants.
although elected as a republican la guardia worked closely with fdr and launched his own program of spending on housing parks and public works.
la guardias was one of numerous little new deals that brought ethnic working class voters to power in communities throughout the industrial heartland.
thanks to the virtual cutoff of southern and eastern european immigration in 1924 the increasing penetration of movies chain stores and mass advertising into ethnic communities and the common experience of economic crisis the 1930s witnessed an acceleration of cultural assimilation.
but the process had a different content from the corporate sponsored americanization plans of the preceding years.
for the children of the new immigrants labor and political activism became agents of a new kind of americanization.
one could participate fully in the broader society without surrendering ones ideals and ethnic identity.
unionism is americanism became a cio rallying cry.
the mesabi range a minnesota miner wrote to secretary of labor perkins complaining of low wages and management hostility to unions in the iron rich region isnt americanized yet the heyday of american communism in the mid 1930s for the first time in american history the left an umbrella term for socialists communists labor radicals and many new deal liberals enjoyed a shaping influence on the nations politics and culture.

and intellectual impulse that helped to redraw the boundaries of american freedom.
an obscure faction ridden organization when the depression began the communist party experienced remarkable growth during the 1930s.
the partys membership never exceeded 100 000 but several times that number passed through its ranks.
the partys commitment to socialism resonated with a widespread belief that the depression had demonstrated the bankruptcy of capitalism.
but it was not so much the partys ideology as its vitality its involvement in a mind boggling array of activities including demonstrations of the unemployed struggles for industrial unionism and a renewed movement for black civil rights that for a time made it the center of gravity for a broad democratic upsurge.
at the height of the popular front a period during the mid 1930s when the communist party sought to ally itself with socialists and new dealers in movements for social change urging reform of the capitalist system rather than revolution communists gained an unprecedented respectability.
earl browder the partys leader even appeared on the cover of time magazine.
it is one of the eras ironies that an organization with an undemocratic structure and closely tied to stalins dictatorial regime in russia should have contributed to the expansion of freedom in the united states.
but the communist party helped to imbue new deal liberalism with a militant spirit and a more pluralistic understanding of americanism.
redefining the people in theater film and dance the popular front vision of american society sank deep roots and survived much longer than the political moment from which it sprang.
in this broad left wing culture social and economic radicalism not support for the status quo defined true americanism ethnic and racial diversity was the glory of american society and the american way of life meant unionism and social citizenship not the unbridled pursuit of wealth.
the american people viewed by many intellectuals in the 1920s as representing mean spirited fundamentalism and crass commercialism were suddenly rediscovered as embodiments of democratic virtue.

despite bringing ethnic and northern black voters into its political coalition the democratic party said little about ethnocultural issues fearful of rekindling the divisive battles of the 1920s.
but the popular front forthrightly sought to promote the idea that the countrys strength lay in diversity tolerance and the rejection of ethnic prejudice and class privilege.
the cio avidly promoted the idea of ethnic and racial inclusiveness.
it broke decisively with the afls tradition of exclusionary unionism.
the cio embraced cultural pluralism an idea as noted in chapter 20 previously associated with intellectuals like horace kallen and the self defense of ethnic and catholic communities against enforced americanization.

popular front culture moved well beyond new deal liberalism in condemning racism as incompatible with true americanism.
in the 1930s groups like the american jewish committee and the national conference of christians and jews actively promoted ethnic and religious tolerance defining pluralism as the american way but whether in harlem or east los angeles the communist party was the eras only predominantly white organization to make fighting racism a top priority.

the scottsboro case an international cause clbre.
the case revolved around nine young black men arrested for the rape of two white women in alabama in 1931.
despite the weakness of the evidence against the scottsboro boys and the fact that one of the two accusers recanted alabama authorities three times put them on trial and three times won convictions.
landmark supreme court decisions overturned the first two verdicts and established legal principles that greatly expanded the definition of civil liberties that defendants have a constitutional right to effective legal representation and that states cannot systematically exclude blacks from juries.
but the court allowed the third set of convictions to stand which led to prison sentences for five of the defendants.
in 1937 a defense lawyer worked out a deal whereby alabama authorities released nearly all the defendants on parole although the last of the scottsboro boys did not leave prison until thirteen years had passed.
despite considerable resistance from white workers determined to preserve their monopoly of skilled positions and access to promotions the cio welcomed black members and advocated the passage of antilynching laws and the return of voting rights to southern blacks.
the cio brought large numbers of black industrial workers into the labor movement for the first time and ran extensive educational campaigns to persuade white workers to recognize the interests they shared with their black counterparts.
black workers many of them traditionally hostile to unions because of their long experience of exclusion responded with enthusiasm to cio organizing efforts.
the union offered the promise of higher wages dignity in the workplace and an end to the arbitrary power of often racist foremen.

21 the new deal 1932 1940 labor the scottsboro boys flanked by two prison guards with their lawyer samuel liebowitz.
a new conception of america and civil liberties another central element of popular front public culture was its mobilization for civil liberties especially the right of labor to organize.
the struggle to launch industrial unions encountered sweeping local restrictions on freedom of speech as well as repression by private and public police forces.
nationwide publicity about the wave of violence directed against the southern tenant farmers union in the south and the cio in industrial communities in the north elevated the rights of labor to a central place in discussions of civil liberties.
the american civil liberties union primarily concerned in the 1920s with governmental repression by 1934 concluded that the masters of property posed as great a danger to freedom of speech and assembly as political authorities.
beginning in 1936 a senate subcommittee headed by robert m la follette jr exposed the methods employers used to combat unionization including spies and private police forces.
workers had no liberties at all an employee of general motors wrote to the committee from saginaw michigan.
the extensive violence unleashed against strikers in californias cotton and lettuce fields made that state the committee report concluded seem more like a european dictatorship than part of the united states.
labor militancy helped to produce an important shift in the understanding of civil liberties.
previously conceived of as individual rights that must be protected against infringement by the government the concept now expanded to include violations of free speech and assembly by powerful private groups.
as a result just as the federal government emerged as a guarantor of economic security it also became a protector of freedom of expression.
by the eve of world war ii civil liberties had assumed a central place in the new deal understanding of freedom.
in 1939 attorney general frank murphy established a civil liberties unit in the department of justice.
for the first time in our history murphy wrote the president the full weight of the department will be thrown behind the effort to preserve in this country the blessings of liberty meanwhile the same supreme court that in 1937 relinquished its role as a judge of economic legislation moved to expand its authority over civil liberties.
the justices insisted that constitutional guarantees of free thought and expression were essential to nearly every other form of freedom and therefore deserved special protection by the courts.
thus civil liberties replaced liberty of contract as the judicial foundation of freedom.
in 1937 the court overturned on free speech grounds the conviction of angelo herndon a communist organizer jailed in georgia for inciting insurrection three years later it invalidated an alabama law that prohibited picketing in labor disputes.
since 1937 the large majority of state and national laws overturned by the courts have been those that infringe on civil liberties not the property rights of business.
the new appreciation of free expression was hardly universal.
in 1938 the house of representatives established an un american activities committee to investigate disloyalty.
its expansive definition of un american included communists labor radicals and the left of the democratic party and its hearings led to the dismissal of dozens of federal employees on charges of subversion.
two years later congress enacted the smith act which made it a federal crime to teach advocate or encourage the overthrow of the h o w d i d t h e po p u l a r f r o n t i n f l u e n c e a m e r i c a n c u l t u r e i n t h e 1 9 3 0 s.
government.
a similar pursuit of radical views took place at the state level.
the new york legislatures rapp coudert committee held sweeping hearings investigating subversive influences in new york citys public colleges resulting in the firing in 1941 of some sixty faculty members charged with communist sympathies.
the end of the new deal by then the new deal as an era of far reaching social reform had already begun to recede.
one reason was that more and more southern democrats were finding themselves at odds with roosevelts policies.
in 1938 the administration released a report on economic conditions in the south along with a letter by the president referring to the region as the nations no.
1 economic problem the document revealed that the south lagged far behind other parts of the country in industrialization and investment in education and public health.
its per capita income stood at half that of the rest of the nation.
also in 1938 a new generation of homegrown radicals southern new dealers black activists labor leaders communists even a few elected officials founded the southern conference for human welfare to work for unionization unemployment relief and racial justice.
until the late 1930s prominent southern democrats had been strong supporters of the new deal while at the same time working to shape legislation to allow for the local administration of relief and the exclusion of most black workers.
now southern business and political leaders feared that continuing federal intervention in their region would encourage unionization and upset race relations.
roosevelt concluded that the enactment of future new deal measures required a liberalization of the southern democratic party.
in 1938 he tried to persuade the regions voters to replace conservative congressmen with ones who would support his policies.
the souths small electorate dealt him a stinging rebuke.
in the north where the economic downturn the court packing plan and the upsurge of cio militancy alarmed many middle class voters republicans increased their congressional representation.
a period of political stalemate followed the congressional election of 1938.
for many years a conservative coalition of southern democrats and northern republicans dominated congress.
further reform initiatives became almost impossible and congress moved to abolish existing ones beginning with the federal theater project which had alarmed conservatives because of the presence of radicals and homosexuals on its payroll.
congress repealed an earlier tax on corporate profits and rejected a proposed program of national medical insurance.
the administration moreover increasingly focused its attention on the storm gathering in europe.
even before december 1941 when the united states entered world war ii dr.

new deal the new deal in american history given the scope of the economic calamity it tried to counter the new deal seems in many ways quite limited.
compared to later european welfare states social security remained restricted in scope and modest in cost.
21 the new deal 1932 1940 suggested reading new deal failed to address the problem of racial inequality which in some ways it actually worsened.
yet even as the new deal receded its substantial accomplishments remained.
it greatly expanded the federal governments role in the american economy and made it an independent force in relations between industry and labor.
the government told farmers what they could and could not plant required employers to deal with unions insured bank deposits regulated the stock market loaned money to home owners and provided payments to a majority of the elderly and unemployed.
it transformed the physical environment through hydroelectric dams reforestation projects rural electrification and the construction of innumerable public facilities.
it restored faith in democracy and made the government an institution directly experienced in americans daily lives and directly concerned with their welfare.
it redrew the map of american politics.
it helped to inspire and was powerfully influenced by a popular upsurge that recast the idea of freedom to include a public guarantee of economic security for ordinary citizens and that identified economic inequality as the greatest threat to american freedom.
one thing the new deal failed to do was generate sustained prosperity.
more than 15 percent of the workforce remained unemployed in 1940.
only the mobilization of the nations resources to fight world war ii would finally end the great depression.

l b y far the most popular works of art produced during world war ii were paintings of the four freedoms by the magazine illustrator norman rockwell.
in his state of the union address delivered before congress on january 6 1941 president roosevelt spoke eloquently of a future world order founded on the essential human freedoms freedom of speech freedom of worship freedom from want and freedom from fear.
the four freedoms became roosevelts favorite statement of allied aims.
at various times he compared them with the ten commandments the magna carta and the emancipation proclamation.
they embodied roosevelt declared in a 1942 radio address the rights of men of every creed and every race wherever they live and made clear the crucial difference between ourselves and the enemies we face today rockwells paintings succeeded in linking the four freedoms with the defense of traditional american values.
words like freedom or liberty declared one wartime advertisement draw close to us only when we break them down into the homely fragments of daily life this insight helps to explain rockwells astonishing popularity.
born in new york city in 1894 rockwell had lived in the new york area until 1939 when he and his family moved to arlington vermont where they could enjoy as he put it the clean simple country life as opposed to the complicated world of the city drawing on the lives of his vermont neighbors rockwell translated the four freedoms into images of real people situated in small town america.
each of the paintings focuses on an instantly recognizable situation.
an ordinary citizen rises to speak at a town meeting members of different religious groups are seen at prayer a family enjoys a thanksgiving dinner a mother and father stand over a sleeping child.
the four freedoms paintings first appeared in the saturday evening post early in 1943 letters of praise poured in to the magazines editors.
the government produced and sold millions of reprints.
the paintings toured the country as the centerpiece of the four freedoms show which included theatrical presentations parades and other events aimed at persuading americans to purchase war bonds.
by the end of its tour the four freedoms show had raised 133 million.
even as rockwell invoked images of small town life to rally americans to the war effort however the country experienced changes as deep as at any time in its history.
many of the economic trends and social movements that we associate with the last half of the twentieth century had their roots in the war years.
as during world war i but on a far larger scale wartime mobilization expanded the size and scope of government and energized the economy.
the gross national product more than doubled and unemployment disappeared as war production finally w h a t s t e p s l e d t o a m e r i c a n p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n wo r l d wa r i i.
conquered the depression.
the demand for labor drew millions of women into the workforce and sent a tide of migrants from rural america to the industrial cities of the north and west permanently altering the nations social geography.
some 30 million americans moved during the war half going into military service and half taking up new jobs.
world war ii gave the country a new and lasting international role and greatly strengthened the idea that american security was global in scope and could only be protected by the worldwide triumph of core american values.
government military spending sparked the economic development of the south and west laying the foundation for the rise of the modern sunbelt.
the war created a close link between big business and a militarized federal government a military industrial complex as president dwight d eisenhower would later call it that long survived the end of fighting.
world war ii also redrew the boundaries of american nationality.
in contrast to world war i the government recognized the new a draft of fdrs four freedoms speech of 1941 shows how he added the words everywhere in the world 8 and 13 lines down indicating that the four freedoms should be truly international ideals.

fighting world war ii immigrants of the early twentieth century and their children as loyal americans.
black americans second class status assumed for the first time since reconstruction a prominent place on the nations political agenda.
but toleration had its limits.
with the united states at war with japan the federal government removed more than 100 000 japanese americans the majority of them american citizens from their homes and placed them in internment camps.
as a means of generating support for the struggle the four freedoms provided a crucial language of national unity.
but this unity obscured divisions within american society that the war in some ways intensified divisions reflected in debates over freedom.
while some americans looked forward to a worldwide new deal others envisioned free enterprise replacing government intervention in the economy.
the war gave birth to the modern civil rights movement but strengthened the commitment of many white americans to maintain the existing racial order.
the movement of women into the labor force challenged traditional gender relations but most men and not a few women longed for the restoration of family life with a male breadwinner and a wife responsible for the home.
even rockwells popular paintings suggested some of the ambiguities within the idea of freedom.
with the exception of freedom of speech which depicts civic democracy in action the paintings emphasized private situations.
the message seemed to be that americans were fighting to preserve freedoms enjoyed individually or within the family rather than in the larger public world.
this emphasis on freedom as an element of private life would become more and more prominent in postwar america.
f i g h t i n g w o r l d wa r i i good neighbors during the 1930s with americans preoccupied by the economic crisis international relations played only a minor role in public affairs.
from the outset of his administration nonetheless fdr embarked on a number of departures in foreign policy.
in 1933 hoping to stimulate american trade he exchanged ambassadors with the soviet union whose government his republican predecessors had stubbornly refused to recognize.
roosevelt also formalized a policy initiated by herbert hoover by which the united states repudiated the right to intervene militarily in the internal affairs of latin american countries.
this good neighbor policy as it was called had mixed results.
during the 1930s the united states withdrew its w h a t s t e p s l e d t o a m e r i c a n p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n wo r l d wa r i i.
troops from haiti and nicaragua.
fdr accepted cubas repeal of the platt amendment discussed in chapter 17 which had authorized american military interventions on that island.
these steps offered a belated recognition of the sovereignty of americas neighbors.
but while roosevelt condemned economic royalists wealthy businessmen at home like previous presidents he felt comfortable dealing with undemocratic governments friendly to american business interests abroad.
the united states lent its support to dictators like anastasio somoza in nicaragua rafael trujillo molina in the dominican republic and fulgencio batista in cuba.
he may be a son of a bitch but hes our son of a bitch fdr said of somoza.
however as the international crisis deepened in the 1930s the roosevelt administration took steps to counter german influence in latin america by expanding hemispheric trade and promoting respect for american culture.
nelson rockefeller the head of an office that hoped to expand cultural relations in the hemisphere sent the artists of the american ballet caravan and the nbc symphony orchestra on latin american tours.
this was a far different approach to relations with central and south america than the military interventions of the first decades of the century.
the road to war ominous developments in asia and europe quickly overshadowed events in latin america.
by the mid 1930s it seemed clear that the rule of law was disintegrating in international relations and that war was on the horizon.
in 1931 seeking to expand its military and economic power in asia japan invaded manchuria a province of northern china.
six years later its troops moved farther into china.
when the japanese overran the city of nanjing they massacred an estimated 300 000 chinese prisoners of war and civilians.
an aggressive power threatened europe as well.
after brutally consolidating his rule in germany adolf hitler embarked on a campaign to control the entire continent.
in violation of the versailles treaty he feverishly pursued german rearmament.
in 1936 he sent troops to occupy the rhineland a demilitarized zone between france and germany established after world war i.
the failure of britain france and the united states to oppose this action convinced hitler that the democracies could not muster the will to halt his aggressive plans.
italian leader benito mussolini the founder of fascism a movement similar to hitlers nazism invaded and conquered ethiopia.
when general francisco franco in 1936 led an uprising against the democratically elected government of spain hitler poured in arms seeing the conflict as a testing ground for new weaponry.
in 1939 franco emerged victorious from a bitter civil war establishing yet another fascist government in europe.
as part of a campaign to unite all europeans of german origin in a single empire hitler in 1938 annexed austria and the sudetenland an ethnically german part of czechoslovakia.
shortly thereafter he gobbled up all of that country.
as the 1930s progressed roosevelt became more and more alarmed at hitlers aggression as well as his accelerating campaign against germanys jews whom the nazis stripped of citizenship and property and began to deport to concentration camps.
in a 1937 speech in chicago fdr called for international action to quarantine aggressors.
but no further steps followed.
roosevelt had little choice but to follow the policy of appeasement this hand guides the reich a nazi propaganda poster from 1930s germany.

to most americans the threat arising from japanese and german aggression seemed very distant.
moreover hitler had more than a few admirers in the united states.
obsessed with the threat of communism some americans approved his expansion of german power as a counterweight to the soviet union.
businessmen did not wish to give up profitable overseas markets.
henry ford did business with nazi germany throughout the 1930s.
indeed ford plants there employed slave labor provided by the german government.
trade with japan also continued including shipments of american trucks and aircraft and considerable amounts of oil.
until 1941 80 percent of japans oil supply came from the united states.
many americans remained convinced that involvement in world war i had been a mistake.
senate hearings in 1934 1935 headed by gerald p nye of north dakota revealed that international bankers and arms exporters had pressed the wilson administration to enter that war and had profited handsomely from it.
pacifism spread on college campuses where tens of thousands of students took part in a strike for peace in 1935.
ethnic allegiances reinforced americans traditional reluctance to enter foreign conflicts.
many americans of german and italian descent celebrated the expansion of national power in their countries of origin even when they disdained their dictatorial governments.
irish americans remained strongly anti british.
isolationism the 1930s version of americans long standing desire to avoid foreign entanglements dominated congress.
beginning in 1935 lawmakers passed a series of neutrality acts that banned travel on belligerents ships and the sale of arms to countries at war.
these policies congress hoped would allow the united states to avoid the conflicts over freedom of the seas that had contributed to involvement in world war i.
despite the fact that the spanish civil war pitted a democratic government against an aspiring fascist dictator the western democracies including the united states imposed an embargo on arms shipments to both sides.
some 3 000 americans volunteered to fight in the abraham lincoln brigade on the side of the spanish republic.
but with germany supplying the forces of franco the decision by democratic countries to abide by the arms embargo contributed substantially to his victory.
war in europe in the munich agreement of 1938 britain and france had caved in to hitlers aggression.
in 1939 the soviet union proposed an international agreement to oppose further german demands for territory.
britain and w h a t s t e p s l e d t o a m e r i c a n p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n wo r l d wa r i i.
france who distrusted stalin and saw germany as a bulwark against the spread of communist influence in europe refused.
stalin then astonished the world by signing a nonaggression pact with hitler his former sworn enemy.
on september 1 immediately after the signing of the nazi soviet pact germany invaded poland.
this time britain and france who had pledged to protect poland against aggression declared war.
but germany appeared unstoppable.
within a year the nazi blitzkrieg lightning war had overrun poland and much of scandinavia belgium and the netherlands.
on june 14 1940 german troops occupied paris.
hitler now dominated nearly all of europe as well as north africa.
in september 1940 germany italy and japan created a military alliance known as the axis.
for one critical year britain stood virtually alone in fighting germany.
winston churchill who became prime minister in 1940 vowed to resist a threatened nazi invasion.
in the battle of britain of 1940 1941 the german air force launched devastating attacks on london and other cities.
the royal air force eventually turned back the air assault.
but churchill pointedly called on the new world with all its power and might to step forward to rescue the old.
toward intervention roosevelt viewed hitler as a mad gangster whose victories posed a direct threat to the united states.
but most americans remained desperate to remain out of the conflict.
what worries me especially fdr wrote to kansas editor william allen white is that public opinion over here is patting itself on the back every morning and thanking god for the atlantic ocean and the pacific ocean after a tumultuous debate congress in 1940 agreed to allow the sale of arms to britain on a cash and carry basis that is they had to be paid for in cash and transported in british ships.
it also approved plans for military rearmament.
but with a presidential election looming roosevelt was reluctant to go further.
opponents of involvement in europe organized the america first committee with hundreds of thousands of members and a leadership that included well known figures like henry ford father coughlin and charles a lindbergh.
in 1940 breaking with a tradition that dated back to george washington roosevelt announced his candidacy for a third term as president.
the international situation was too dangerous and domestic recovery too fragile he insisted for him to leave office.
republicans chose as his opponent a political amateur wall street businessman and lawyer wendell willkie.
differences between the candidates were far more muted than in 1936.
both supported the law enacted in september 1940 that established the nations first peacetime draft.
willkie endorsed new deal social legislation.
he captured more votes than roosevelts previous opponents but fdr still emerged with a decisive victory.
during 1941 the united states became more and more closely allied with those fighting germany and japan.
america fdr declared would be the great arsenal of democracy but with britain virtually bankrupt it could no longer pay for supplies.
at roosevelts urging congress passed the lend lease act which authorized military aid so long as countries promised somehow to return it all after the war.
under the laws provisions the united states funneled billions of dollars worth of arms to britain and a newsreel theater in new yorks times square announces hitlers blitzkrieg in europe in the spring of 1940.

fdr also froze japanese assets in the united states halting virtually all trade between the countries including the sale of oil vital to japan.
those who believed that the united states must intervene to stem the rising tide of fascism tried to awaken a reluctant country to prepare for war.
interventionists popularized slogans that would become central to wartime mobilization.
in june 1941 refugees from germany and the occupied countries of europe joined with americans to form the free world association which sought to bring the united states into the war against hitler.
the same year saw the formation of freedom house.
with a prestigious membership that included university presidents ministers businessmen and labor leaders freedom house described the war raging in europe as an ideological struggle between dictatorship and the free world in october 1941 it sponsored a fight for freedom rally at new yorks madison square garden complete with a patriotic variety show entitled its fun to be free the rally ended by demanding an immediate declaration of war against germany.

both were repaired and later took part in the pacific war.
pearl harbor until november 1941 the administrations attention focused on europe.
but at the end of that month intercepted japanese messages revealed that an assault in the pacific was imminent.
no one however knew where it would come.
on december 7 1941 japanese planes launched from aircraft carriers bombed the naval base at pearl harbor in hawaii the first attack by a foreign power on american soil since the war of 1812.
pearl harbor was a complete and devastating surprise.
in a few hours more than 2 000 american servicemen were killed and 187 aircraft and 18 naval vessels including 8 battleships had been destroyed or damaged.
by a stroke of fortune no aircraft carriers which would prove decisive in the pacific war happened to be docked at pearl harbor on december 7.
w h a t s t e p s l e d t o a m e r i c a n p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n wo r l d wa r i i.
some of the 13 000 american troops forced to surrender to the japanese on corregidor island in the philippines in may 1942.
to this day conspiracy theories abound suggesting that fdr knew of the attack and did nothing to prevent it so as to bring the united states into the war.
no credible evidence supports this charge.
indeed with the country drawing ever closer to intervention in europe roosevelt hoped to keep the peace in the pacific.
but secretary of labor frances perkins who saw the president after the attack remarked that he seemed calm his terrible moral problem had been resolved terming december 7 a date which will live in infamy roosevelt asked congress for a declaration of war against japan.
the combined vote in congress was 477 in favor and 1 against pacifist jeanette rankin of montana who had also voted against american entry into world war i.
the next day germany declared war on the united states.
america had finally joined the largest war in human history.
the war in the pacific world war ii has been called a gross national product war meaning that its outcome turned on which coalition of combatants could outproduce the other.
in retrospect it appears inevitable that the entry of the united states with its superior industrial might would ensure the defeat of the axis powers.
but the first few months of american involvement witnessed an unbroken string of military disasters.

at bataan in the philippines the japanese forced 78 000 american and filipino troops to lay down their arms the largest surrender in american military history.
thousands perished on the ensuing death march to a prisoner of war camp and thousands more died of disease and starvation after they arrived.
at the same time german submarines sank hundreds of allied merchant and naval vessels during the battle of the atlantic.
soon however the tide of battle began to turn.
in may 1942 in the battle of the coral sea the american navy turned back a japanese fleet intent on attacking australia.
the following month it inflicted devastating losses on the japanese navy in the battle of midway island.
these victories allowed american forces to launch the bloody campaigns that one by one drove the w h a t s t e p s l e d t o a m e r i c a n p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n wo r l d wa r i i.

by the spring of 1943 the allies also gained the upper hand in the atlantic as british and american destroyers and planes devastated the german submarine fleet.
but even though roosevelt was committed to liberating europe from nazi control american troops did not immediately become involved on the european continent.
as late as the end of 1944 more american military personnel were deployed in the pacific than against germany.
in july 1943 american and british forces invaded sicily beginning the liberation of italy.
a popular uprising in rome overthrew the mussolini government whereupon germany occupied most of the country.
fighting there raged throughout 1944.
the major involvement of american troops in europe did not begin until june 6 1944.
on that date known as d day nearly 200 000 american british and canadian soldiers under the command of general dwight d eisenhower landed in normandy in northwestern france.
more than a million troops followed them ashore in the next few weeks in the most massive sea land operation in history.
after fierce fighting german armies retreated eastward.
by august paris had been liberated.
the crucial fighting in europe however took place on the eastern front the scene of an epic struggle between germany and the soviet union.
more than 3 million german soldiers took part in the 1941 invasion.
after sweeping through western russia german armies in august 1942 launched a siege of stalingrad a city located deep inside russia on the volga river.
this proved to be a catastrophic mistake.
bolstered by an influx of military supplies from the united states the russians surrounded the german troops and forced them to surrender.
some 800 000 germans and 1 2 million russians perished in the fighting.
the german surrender at stalingrad in january 1943 marked the turning point of the european war.
combined with a russian victory at kursk six months later in the greatest tank battle in history the campaign in the east devastated hitlers forces and sent surviving units on a long retreat back toward germany.

was the horrifying culmination of the nazi belief that germans constituted a master race destined to rule the world.
the home front mobilizing for war at home world war ii transformed the role of the national government.
fdr created federal agencies like the war production board the war manpower commission and the office of price administration to regulate the allocation of labor control the shipping industry establish manufacturing quotas and fix wages prices and rents.
the number of federal workers rose from 1 million to 4 million part of a tremendous growth in new jobs that pushed the unemployment rate down from 14 percent in 1940 to 2 percent three years later.
the government built housing for war workers and forced civilian industries to retool for war production.
michigans auto factories now turned out trucks tanks and jeeps for the army.
by 1944 american factories produced a ship every day and a plane every five minutes.
the gross national product rose from 91 billion to 214 billion during the war and the federal governments expenditures amounted to twice the combined total of the previous 150 years.
the government marketed billions of dollars worth of war bonds increased taxes and began the practice of withholding income tax directly from weekly paychecks.
before the war only the 4 million wealthiest americans paid income taxes by 1945 more than 40 million did so.
the government one historian writes moved during the war from class taxation to mass taxation prisoners at a german concentration camp liberated by allied troops in 1945.

during the war general motors and other automakers produced vehicles for the armed forces rather than cars for consumers.
the home front and the war the relationship between the federal government and big business changed dramatically from the days of the second new deal.
if you are going to go to war in a capitalist country observed secretary of war henry stimson you had better let business make money out of the process as corporate executives flooded into federal agencies concerned with war production roosevelt offered incentives to spur production low interest loans tax concessions and contracts with guaranteed profits.
the great bulk of federal spending went to the largest corporations furthering the long term trend toward economic concentration.
by the end of the war the 200 biggest industrial companies accounted for almost half of all corporate assets in the united states.
americans marveled at the achievements of wartime manufacturing.
thousands of aircraft 100 000 armored vehicles and 2 5 million trucks rolled off american assembly lines and entirely new products like synthetic rubber replaced natural resources now controlled by japan.
government sponsored scientific research perfected inventions like radar jet engines and early computers that helped to win the war and would have a large impact on postwar life.
these accomplishments not only made it possible to win a two front war but also helped to restore the reputation of business and businessmen which had reached a low point during the depression.
federal funds reinvigorated established manufacturing areas and created entirely new industrial centers.
world war ii saw the west coast emerge as a focus of military industrial production.
the government invested billions of dollars in the shipyards of seattle portland and san francisco and in the steel plants and aircraft factories of southern california.
by the wars end california had received one tenth of all federal spending and los angeles had become the nations second largest manufacturing center.
nearly 2 million americans moved to california for jobs in defense related industries and millions more passed through for military training and embarkation to the pacific war.
in the south the combination of rural out migration and government investment in military related factories and shipyards hastened a shift from agricultural to industrial employment.
during the war southern per capita income rose from 60 percent to 70 percent of the national average.
but the south remained very poor when the war ended.
much of its rural population still lived in small wooden shacks with no indoor plumbing.
the region had only two cities houston and new orleans with populations exceeding 500 000.
despite the expansion of war production the souths how did the united states mobilize economic resources and promote popular support for the war effort.
wartime army and navy bases and airfields bases and stations army camps forts and posts naval bases economy still relied on agriculture and extractive industries mining lumber oil or manufacturing linked to farming like the production of cotton textiles.
labor in airfields wartime organized labor repeatedly described world war ii as a crusade for freedom that would expand economic and political democracy at home and abroad and win for unions a major voice in politics and industrial management.
during the war labor entered a three sided arrangement with government and business that allowed union membership to soar to unprecedented levels.
in order to secure industrial peace and stabilize war production the federal government forced reluctant employers to recognize unions.
in 1944 when montgomery ward the large mail order company defied a pro union order the army seized its headquarters and physically evicted its president.
for their part union leaders agreed not to strike and conceded employers right to managerial prerogatives and a fair profit despite the gains produced by labor militancy during the 1930s unions only became firmly established in many sectors of the economy during 500 miles 500 kilometers as this map indicates the military and naval facilities built by the federal government during world war ii were concentrated in the south and west sparking the economic development of these regions.

by 1945 union membership stood at nearly 15 million onethird of the non farm labor force and the highest proportion in american history.
but if labor became a partner in government it was very much a junior partner.
the decline of the new deal already evident in the late 1930s proceeded during the war.
congress continued to be dominated by a conservative alliance of republicans and southern democrats.
they left intact core new deal programs like social security but eliminated agencies thought to be controlled by leftists including the civilian conservation corps national youth administration and works progress administration.
congress rejected roosevelts call for a cap on personal incomes and set taxes on corporate profits at a level far lower than fdr requested.
despite the no strike pledge 1943 and 1944 witnessed numerous brief walkouts in which workers protested the increasing speed of assembly line production and the disparity between wages frozen by government order and expanding corporate profits.
fighting for the four freedoms previous conflicts including the mexican war and world war i had deeply divided american society.
in contrast world war ii came to be remembered as the good war a time of national unity in pursuit of indisputably noble goals.
but all wars require the mobilization of patriotic public opinion.
by 1940 to sell goods we must sell words had become a motto of advertisers.
foremost among the words that helped to sell world war ii was freedom talk of freedom pervaded wartime america.
to roosevelt the four freedoms expressed deeply held american values worthy of being spread worldwide.
freedom from fear meant not only a longing for peace but a more general desire for security in a world that appeared to be out of control.
freedom of speech and religion scarcely required detailed explanation.
but their prominent place among the four freedoms accelerated the process by which first amendment protections of free expression moved to the center of americans definition of liberty.
in 1941 the administration celebrated with considerable fanfare the 150th anniversary of the bill of rights the first ten amendments to the constitution.
fdr described their protections against tyrannical government as defining characteristics of american life central to the rights of free men and free women in 1943 the supreme court reversed a 1940 ruling and on first amendment grounds upheld the right of jehovahs witnesses to refuse to salute the american flag in public schools.
the decision stood in sharp contrast to the coercive patriotism of world war i and it affirmed the sanctity of individual conscience as a bedrock of freedom even in times of crisis.
the justices contrasted the american system of constitutional protection for unpopular minorities with nazi tyranny.
freedom in this recruitment poster for the boy scouts a svelte miss liberty prominently displays the bill of rights widely celebrated during world war ii as the centerpiece of american freedom.
the home front from want the most ambiguous of the four freedoms fortune magazine remarked was freedom from want.
yet this great inspiring phrase as a pennsylvania steelworker put it in a letter to the president seemed to strike the deepest chord in a nation just emerging from the depression.
roosevelt initially meant it to refer to the elimination of barriers to international trade.
but he visions of freedom patriotic fan.
this fan marketed to women during world war ii illustrates how freedom and patriotism were closely linked.
at the far left and right owners are instructed in ways to help win the war and preserve american freedom.
the five middle panels suggest some of the eras definitions of freedom freedom to listen presumably without government censorship selfgovernment freedom of assembly the right to choose ones work and freedom to play questions 1.
compare the elements of freedom depicted on the fan with the four freedoms of president roosevelt.
what aspects of freedom are not depicted in the fan.
22 fighting for the four freedoms the home front quickly came to link freedom from want to an economic goal more relevant to the average citizen protecting the future standard of living of the american worker and farmer by guaranteeing that the depression would not resume after the war.
this he declared would bring real freedom for the common man when norman rockwells paintings of the four freedoms first appeared in the saturday evening post each was accompanied by a brief essay.
three of these essays by the celebrated authors stephen vincent bent booth tarkington and will durant emphasized that the values rockwell depicted were essentially american and the opposite of those of the axis powers.
for freedom from want the editors chose an unknown filipino poet carlos bulosan who had emigrated to the united states at the age of sixteen.
bulosans essay showed how the four freedoms could inspire hopes for a better future as well as nostalgia for rockwells imagined small town past.
bulosan wrote of those americans still outside the social mainstream migrant workers cannery laborers black victims of segregation for whom freedom meant having enough to eat sending their children to school and being able to share the promise and fruits of american life the office of war information the history of the office of war information owi created in 1942 to mobilize public opinion illustrates how the political divisions generated by the new deal affected efforts to promote the four freedoms.
the liberal democrats who dominated the owis writing staff sought to make the conflict a peoples war for freedom the owi feared that americans had only a vague understanding of the wars purposes and that the populace seemed more fervently committed to paying back the japanese for their attack on pearl harbor than ridding the world of fascism.
they utilized radio film the press and other media to give the conflict an ideological meaning while seeking to avoid the nationalist hysteria of world war i wartime mobilization drew on deep seated american traditions.
the portrait of the united states holding aloft the torch of liberty in a world overrun by oppression reached back at least as far as the american revolution.
the description of a world half slave and half free recalled the great emancipator.
but critics charged that the owi seemed most interested in promoting the definition of freedom roosevelt had emphasized during the 1930s.
one of its first pamphlets listed as elements of freedom the right to a job at fair pay and to adequate food clothing shelter and medical care.
concerned that the owi was devoting as much time to promoting new deal social programs as to the war effort congress eliminated most of its funding.
the in this patriotic war poster issued by the office of war information the words of abraham lincoln are linked to the struggle against nazi tyranny.
fifth freedom after congress curtailed the owi the selling of america became overwhelmingly a private affair.
under the watchful eye of the war advertising council private companies joined in the campaign to promote wartime patriotism while positioning themselves and their brand names for the postwar world.
alongside advertisements urging americans to purchase war bonds guard against revealing military secrets and grow victory gardens to allow food to be sent to the army the war witnessed a burst of how did the united states mobilize economic resources and promote popular support for the war effort.
in this advertisement by the liberty motors and engineering corporation published in the february 1944 issue of fortune uncle sam offers the fifth freedom free enterprise to wardevastated europe.
to spread its message the company offered free enlargements of its ad.
messages marketing advertisers definition of freedom.
without directly criticizing roosevelt they repeatedly suggested that he had overlooked a fifth freedom.
the national association of manufacturers and individual companies bombarded americans with press releases radio programs and advertisements attributing the amazing feats of wartime production to free enterprise americans on the home front enjoyed a prosperity many could scarcely remember.
despite the rationing of scarce consumer items like coffee meat and gasoline consumers found more goods available in 1944 than when the war began.
with the memory of the depression still very much alive businessmen predicted a postwar world filled with consumer goods with freedom of choice among abundant possibilities assured if only private enterprise were liberated from government controls.
one advertisement for royal typewriters entitled what this war is all about explained that victory would hasten the day when you.
can once more walk into any store in the land and buy anything you want certainly ads suggested the war did not imply any alteration in american institutions.
im fighting for freedom said a soldier in an ad by the nash kelvinator corporation.
so dont anybody tell me ill find america changed women at war during the war the nation engaged in an unprecedented mobilization of womanpower to fill industrial jobs vacated by men.
owi publications encouraged women to go to work hollywood films glorified the independent woman and private advertising celebrated the achievements of rosie the riveter the female industrial laborer depicted as muscular and selfreliant in norman rockwells famous magazine cover.
with 15 million men in the armed forces women in 1944 made up more than one third of the civilian labor force and 350 000 served in auxiliary military units.

even though most women workers still labored in clerical and service jobs new opportunities suddenly opened in industrial professional and government positions previously restricted to men.
on the west coast one third of the workers in aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding were women.
for the first time in history married women in their thirties outnumbered the young and single among female workers.
women forced unions like the united auto workers to confront issues like equal pay for equal work maternity leave and childcare facilities for working mothers.
defense companies sponsored swing bands and dances to boost worker morale and arranged dates between male and female workers.
having enjoyed what one wartime worker called a taste of freedom doing mens jobs for mens wages and sometimes engaging in sexual activity while unmarried many women hoped to remain in the labor force once peace returned.
women this print part of the america in the war exhibition shown simultaneously in twenty six american museums in 1943 offers a stylized image of women workers assembling shells in a factory while men march off to war.
at work we as a nation proclaimed one magazine article must change our basic attitude toward the work of women but change proved difficult.
the government employers and unions depicted work as a temporary necessity not an expansion of womens freedom.
advertisements assured women laboring in factories that they too were fighting for freedom but their language spoke of sacrifice and military victory not rights independence or self determination.
one union publication even declared there should be a law requiring the women who have taken over mens jobs to be laid off after the war when the war ended most female war workers especially those in better paying industrial employment did indeed lose their jobs.
despite the upsurge in the number of working women the advertisers world of tomorrow rested on a vision of family centered prosperity.
like how did the united states mobilize economic resources and promote popular support for the war effort.
norman rockwells four freedoms paintings these wartime discussions of freedom simultaneously looked forward to a day of material abundance and back to a time when the family stood as the bedrock of society.
the american way of life celebrated during the war centered on the woman with a husband to meet every night at the door and a home stocked with household appliances and consumer goods.
advertisements portrayed working women dreaming of their boyfriends in the army and emphasized that with the proper makeup women could labor in a factory and remain attractive to men.
men in the army seem to have assumed that they would return home to resume traditional family life.
in one wartime radio program a young man described his goal for peacetime havin a home and some kids and breathin fresh air out in the suburbs.
livin and workin decent like free people v i s i o n s o f p o s t wa r f r e e d o m toward an american century the prospect of an affluent future provided a point of unity between new dealers and conservatives business and labor.
and the promise of prosperity to some extent united two of the most celebrated blueprints for the postwar world.
one was the american century publisher henry luces 1941 effort to mobilize the american people both for the coming war and for an era of postwar world leadership.
americans luces book insisted must embrace the role history had thrust upon them as the dominant power in the world they must seize the opportunity to share with all peoples their magnificent industrial products and the great american ideals foremost among which stood love of freedom after the war american power and american values would underpin a previously unimaginable prosperity the abundant life luce called it produced by free economic enterprise the idea of an american mission to spread democracy and freedom goes back to the revolution.
but traditionally it had envisioned the country as an example not an active agent imposing the american model throughout the globe.
luces essay anticipated important aspects of the postwar world.
but its bombastic rhetoric and a title easily interpreted as a call for an american imperialism aroused immediate opposition among liberals and the left.
henry wallace offered their response in the price of free world victory an address delivered in may 1942 to the free world association.
wallace secretary of agriculture during the 1930s and one of the more liberal new dealers had replaced vice president john nance garner as roosevelts running mate in 1940.
in contrast to luces american century a world of business dominance no less than of american power wallace predicted that the war would usher in a century of the common man the march of freedom said wallace would continue in the postwar world.
that world however would be marked by international cooperation not any single powers rule.

luce and wallace both spoke the language of freedom.
luce offered a confident vision of worldwide free enterprise while wallace anticipated a unlike the lathe operator on the previous page the woman operating industrial machinery on the cover of the september 1942 issue of mccalls magazine remains glamorous with makeup in place and hair unruffled.
22 fighting for the four freedoms visions of postwar freedom global new deal.
but they had one thing in common a new conception of americas role in the world tied to continued international involvement the promise of economic abundance and the idea that the american experience should serve as a model for all other nations.
neither took into account the ideas that other countries might have developed as to how to proceed once the war had ended.
the despite the new independence enjoyed by millions of women propaganda posters during world war ii emphasized the male dominated family as an essential element of american freedom.
way of life of free men even as congress moved to dismantle parts of the new deal liberal democrats and their left wing allies unveiled plans for a postwar economic policy that would allow all americans to enjoy freedom from want.
in 1942 and 1943 the reports of the national resources planning board nrpb offered a blueprint for a peacetime economy based on full employment an expanded welfare state and a widely shared american standard of living.
economic security and full employment were the boards watchwords.
it called for a new bill of rights that would include all americans in an expanded social security system and guarantee access to education health care adequate housing and jobs for able bodied adults.
labor and farm organizations church and civil rights groups and liberal new dealers hailed the reports as offering a vision of freedom for the postwar world.
the nrpbs plan for a full employment economy with a fair distribution of income said the nation embodied the way of life of free men the reports continued a shift in liberals outlook that dated from the late 1930s.
rather than seeking to reform the institutions of capitalism liberals would henceforth rely on government spending to secure full employment social welfare and mass consumption while leaving the operation of the economy in private hands.
the reports appeared to reflect the views of british economist john maynard keynes who as noted in the previous chapter had identified government spending as the best way to promote economic growth even if it caused budget deficits.
the war had in effect ended the depression by implementing a military version of keynesianism.
in calling for massive spending on job creation and public works urban redevelopment rural electrification an overhaul of the transportation system and the like the nrpb proposed the continuation of keynesian spending in peacetime.
but this went so far beyond what congress was willing to support that it eliminated the nrpbs funding.
an economic bill of rights roosevelt had not publicized or promoted the nrpb reports of 1942 and 1943.
yet mindful that public opinion polls showed a large majority of americans favoring a guarantee of employment for those who could not find work the president in 1944 called for an economic bill of rights the original bill of rights restricted the power of government in the name of liberty.
fdr proposed to expand its power in order to secure full employment an adequate income medical care education and a decent home for all americans.
true individual freedom he declared cannot exist without economic security and independence already ill and preoccupied with the war roosevelt spoke only occasionally of the economic bill of rights during the 1944 presidential campaign.
what visions of americas postwar role began to emerge during the war.
the replacement of vice president henry wallace by harry s truman then a little known senator from missouri suggested that the president did not intend to do battle with congress over social policy.
congress did not enact the economic bill of rights.
but in 1944 it extended to the millions of returning veterans an array of benefits including unemployment pay scholarships for further education low cost mortgage loans pensions and job training.
the servicemens readjustment act or gi bill of rights was one of the most farreaching pieces of social legislation in american history.
aimed at rewarding members of the armed forces for their service and preventing the widespread unemployment and economic disruption that had followed world war i it profoundly shaped postwar society.
by 1946 more than 1 million veterans were attending college under its provisions making up half of total college enrollment.
almost 4 million would receive home mortgages spurring the postwar suburban housing boom.
during 1945 unions civil rights organizations and religious groups urged congress to enact the full employment bill which tried to do for the entire economy what the gi bill promised veterans.
the measure established a right to employment for all americans and required the federal government to increase its level of spending to create enough jobs in case the economy failed to do so.
the target of an intense business lobbying campaign the bill only passed in 1946 with the word full removed from its title and after its commitment to governmental job creation had been eliminated.
but as the war drew to a close most americans embraced the idea that the government must continue to play a major role in maintaining employment and a high standard of living.
the road to serfdom the failure of the full employment bill confirmed the political stalemate that had begun with the elections of 1938.
it also revealed the renewed intellectual respectability of fears that economic planning represented a threat to liberty.
when the new republic spoke of full employment as the road to freedom it subtly acknowledged the impact of the road to serfdom 1944 a surprise best seller by friedrich a hayek a previously obscure austrian born economist.
hayek claimed that even the best intentioned government efforts to direct the economy posed a threat to individual liberty.
he offered a simple message planning leads to dictatorship coming at a time when the miracles of war production had reinvigorated belief in the virtues of capitalism and with the confrontation with nazism highlighting the danger of merging economic and political power hayek offered a new intellectual justification for opponents of active ben shahns poster our friend for the congress of industrial organizations political action committee urges workers to vote for fdr during his campaign for a fourth term.
22 fighting for the four freedoms the american dilemma government.
in a complex economy he insisted no single person or group of experts could possibly possess enough knowledge to direct economic activity intelligently.
a free market he wrote mobilizes the fragmented and partial knowledge scattered throughout society far more effectively than a planned economy.
unlike many of his disciples hayek was not a doctrinaire advocate of laissez faire.
his book endorsed measures that later conservatives would denounce as forms of socialism minimum wage and maximum hours laws antitrust enforcement and a social safety net guaranteeing all citizens a basic minimum of food shelter and clothing.
hayek moreover criticized traditional conservatives for fondness for social hierarchy and authoritarian government.
i am not a conservative he would later write.
but by equating fascism socialism and the new deal and by identifying economic planning with a loss of freedom he helped lay the foundation for the rise of modern conservatism and a revival of laissez faire economic thought.
as the war drew to a close the stage was set for a renewed battle over the governments proper role in society and the economy and the social conditions of american freedom.
the american dilemma arthur poiniers cartoon for the detroit free press june 19 1941 illustrates how during world war ii white ethnics of british german irish french polish italian and scandinanvian descent were incorporated within the boundaries of american freedom.
the unprecedented attention to freedom as the defining characteristic of american life had implications that went far beyond wartime mobilization.
world war ii reshaped americans understanding of themselves as a people.
the struggle against nazi tyranny and its theory of a master race discredited ethnic and racial inequality.
originally promoted by religious and ethnic minorities in the 1920s and the popular front in the 1930s a pluralist vision of american society now became part of official rhetoric.
what set the united states apart from its wartime foes the government insisted was not only dedication to the ideals of the four freedoms but also the principle that americans of all races religions and national origins could enjoy those freedoms equally.
racism was the enemys philosophy americanism rested on toleration of diversity and equality for all.
by the end of the war the new immigrant groups had been fully accepted as loyal ethnic americans rather than members of distinct and inferior races and the contradiction between the principle of equal freedom and the actual status of blacks had come to the forefront of national life.
patriotic assimilation among other things world war ii created a vast melting pot especially for european immigrants and their children.
millions of americans moved out of urban ethnic neighborhoods and isolated rural enclaves into the army and industrial plants where they came into contact with people of very different backgrounds.
what one historian has called their patriotic assimilation differed sharply from the forced americanization of world war i.
while the wilson administration had established how did american minorities face threats to their freedom at home and abroad d u r i n g wo r l d wa r i i.
anglo saxon culture as a national norm roosevelt promoted pluralism as the only source of harmony in a diverse society.
the american way of life wrote the novelist pearl buck in an owi pamphlet rested on brotherhood the principle that persons of many lands can live together.
and if they believe in freedom they can become a united people government and private agencies eagerly promoted equality as the definition of americanism and a counterpoint to nazism.
officials rewrote history to establish racial and ethnic tolerance as the american way.
to be an american fdr declared had always been a matter of mind and heart and never.
a matter of race or ancestry a statement more effective in mobilizing support for the war than in accurately describing the nations past.
mindful of the intolerance spawned by world war i the owi highlighted nearly every groups contributions to american life and celebrated the strength of a people united in respect for diversity.
one owi pamphlet described prejudice as a foreign import rather than a homegrown product and declared bigots more dangerous than spies they were fighting for the enemy horrified by the uses to which the nazis put the idea of inborn racial difference biological and social scientists abandoned belief in a link among race culture and intelligence an idea only recently central to their disciplines.
ruth benedicts races and racism 1942 described racism as a travesty of scientific knowledge in the same year ashley montagus mans most dangerous myth the fallacy of race became a best seller.
by the wars end racism and nativism had been stripped of intellectual respectability at least outside the south and were viewed as psychological disorders.
hollywood too did its part portraying fighting units whose members representing various regional ethnic and religious backgrounds put aside group loyalties and prejudices for the common cause.
air force featured a bomber crew that included an anglo saxon officer a jewish sergeant and a polish american gunner.
in the film bataan the ethnically balanced platoon included a black soldier even though the real army was racially segregated.
the wars most popular motion picture this is the army starring among others future president ronald reagan offered a vision of postwar society that celebrated the ethnic diversity of the american people.
intolerance of course hardly disappeared from american life.
one correspondent complained to norman rockwell that he included too many foreign looking faces in his freedom of worship painting.
many business and government circles still excluded jews.
along with the fact that early reports of the holocaust were too terrible to be believed anti semitism contributed to the governments unwillingness to allow more than a handful of european jews 21 000 during the course of the war to find refuge in the united states.
roosevelt himself learned during the war of the extent of hitlers final solution to the jewish presence in europe.
but he failed to authorize air strikes that might have destroyed german death camps.
nonetheless the war made millions of ethnic americans especially the children of the new immigrants feel fully american for the first time.
during the war one new york ethnic recalled the italo americans stopped being italo and started becoming americans but the event that inspired this comment the harlem race riot of 1943 suggested that patriotic assimilation stopped at the color line.
22 fighting for the four freedoms the the american dilemma bracero program the war had a far more ambiguous meaning for non white groups than for whites.
on the eve of pearl harbor racial barriers remained deeply entrenched in american life.
southern blacks were still trapped in a rigid system of segregation.
asians could not emigrate to the united states or become naturalized citizens.
as noted in the previous chapter more than 400 000 mexican americans had been voluntarily repatriated by local authorities in the southwest during the depression.
most american indians still lived on reservations in dismal poverty.
the war set in motion changes that would reverberate in the postwar years.
under the bracero program agreed to by the mexican and american governments in 1942 the name derives from brazo the spanish word for arm tens of thousands of contract laborers crossed into the united states to take up jobs as domestic and agricultural workers.
initially designed as a temporary response to the wartime labor shortage the program lasted until 1964.
during the period of the bracero program more than 4 5 million mexicans entered the united states under government labor contracts while a slightly larger number were arrested for illegal entry by the border patrol.
braceros were supposed to receive decent housing and wages.
but since they could not become citizens and could be deported at any time they found it almost impossible to form unions or secure better working conditions.
although the bracero program reinforced the status of immigrants from mexico as an unskilled labor force wartime employment opened new opportunities for second generation mexican americans.
hundreds of thousands of men and women emerged from ethnic neighborhoods or barrios to work in defense industries and serve in the army where unlike blacks they fought alongside whites.
a new chicano culture a fusion of mexican heritage and american experience was being born.
contact with other groups led many to learn english and sparked a rise in interethnic marriages.
mexican american rights the zoot suit riots of 1943 in which club wielding sailors and policemen attacked mexican american youths wearing flamboyant clothing on the streets of los angeles illustrated the limits of wartime tolerance.
our latin american boys complained one activist are not segregated at the front line.
they are dying that democracy may live yet when they return home the activist continued they are not considered good enough to go into a caf but the contrast between the wars rhetoric of freedom and pluralism and the reality of continued discrimination inspired a heightened consciousness of civil rights.
for example mexican americans brought complaints of discrimination before the fair employment practices commission fepc to fight the practice in the southwest of confining them to the lowest paid work or paying them lower wages than white workers doing the same jobs.
perhaps half a million mexican american men and women served in the armed forces.
and with discrimination against mexicans an increasing embarrassment in view of roosevelts good neighbor policy texas the state with the largest population of mexican descent in 1943 how did american minorities face threats to their freedom at home and abroad d u r i n g wo r l d wa r i i.
unanimously passed the oddly named caucasian race equal privileges resolution.
it stated that since all the nations of the north and south american continents were united in the struggle against nazism all persons of the caucasian race were entitled to equal treatment in places of public accommodation.
since texas law had long defined mexicans as white the measure applied to them while not challenging the segregation of blacks.
the resolution lacked an enforcement mechanism.
indeed because of continued discrimination in texas the mexican government for a time prohibited the state from receiving laborers under the bracero program.
indians during the war the war also brought many american indians closer to the mainstream of american life.
some 25 000 served in the army including the famous navajo code talkers who transmitted messages in their complex native language which the japanese could not decipher.
insisting that the united states lacked the authority to draft indian men into the army the iroquois issued their own declaration of war against the axis powers.
tens of thousands of indians left reservations for jobs in war industries.
exposed for the first time to urban life and industrial society many chose not to return to the reservations after the war ended indeed the reservations did not share in wartime prosperity.
some indian veterans took advantage of the gi bill to attend college after the war an opportunity that had been available to very few indians previously.
asian americans in wartime asian americans war experience was paradoxical.
more than 50 000 the children of immigrants from china japan korea and the philippines fought in the army mostly in all asian units.
with china an ally in the pacific war congress in 1943 ended decades of complete exclusion by establishing a nationality quota for chinese immigrants.
the annual limit of 105 hardly suggested a desire for a large scale influx.
but the image of the chinese as gallant fighters defending their country against japanese aggression called into question long standing racial stereotypes.
as in the case of mexican americans large numbers of chinese americans moved out of ethnic ghettos to work alongside whites in jobs on the home front.
the experience of japanese americans was far different.
many americans viewed the war against germany as an ideological struggle.
but both sides saw the pacific war as a race war.
japanese propaganda depicted americans as a self indulgent people contaminated by ethnic and racial diversity as opposed to the racially pure japanese.
in the united states long standing prejudices and the shocking attack on pearl harbor combined to produce an unprecedented hatred of japan.
in all our history according to one historian no foe has been detested as were the japanese government propaganda and war films portrayed the japanese foe as rats dogs gorillas and snakes bestial and subhuman.
they blamed japanese aggression on a violent racial or national character not as in the case of germany and italy on tyrannical rulers.
on the one year anniversary of the pearl harbor attack the cover of colliers magazine depicts japanese prime minister hideki tojo as a vampire bat one of many wartime images that sought to dehumanize the pacific foe.
22 fighting for the four freedoms the american dilemma about 70 percent of japanese americans in the continental united states lived in california where they dominated vegetable farming in the los angeles area.
one third were first generation immigrants or issei but a substantial majority were nisei american born and therefore citizens.
many of the latter spoke only english had never been to japan and had tried to assimilate despite prevailing prejudice.
but the japanese american community could not remain unaffected by the rising tide of hatred.
the government bent over backward to include german americans and italian americans in the war effort.
it ordered the arrest of only a handful of the more than 800 000 german and italian nationals in the united states when the war began.
but it viewed every person of japanese ethnicity as a potential spy.
japanese in this 1942 photograph by dorothea lange members of a japanese american family await relocation to an internment camp.
american internment california as discussed in chapter 19 had a long history of hostility toward the japanese.
now inspired by exaggerated fears of a japanese invasion of the west coast and pressured by whites who saw an opportunity to gain possession of japanese american property the military persuaded fdr to issue executive order 9066.
promulgated in february 1942 this ordered the expulsion of all persons of japanese descent from the west coast.
that spring and summer authorities removed more than 110 000 men women and children nearly two thirds of them american citizens to internment camps far from their homes.
the order did not apply to persons of japanese descent living in hawaii where they represented nearly 40 percent of the population.
despite hawaiis vulnerability its economy could not function without japanese american labor.
but the treatment of mainland japanese americans provided ammunition for japans claim that its aggressions in asia were intended to defend the rights of non white peoples against colonial rule and a racist united states.
the internees were subjected to a quasi military discipline in the camps.
living in former horse stables makeshift shacks or barracks behind barbed wire fences they were awakened for roll call at 6 45 each morning and ate their meals which rarely included the japanese cooking to which they were accustomed in giant mess halls.
armed guards patrolled the camps and searchlights shone all night.
privacy was difficult to come by and medical facilities were often nonexistent.
nonetheless the internees did their best to create an atmosphere of home decorating their accommodations with pictures flowers and curtains planting vegetable gardens and setting up activities like sports clubs and art classes for themselves.
internment revealed how easily war can undermine basic freedoms.
there were no court hearings no due process and no writs of habeas corpus.
one searches the wartime record in vain for public protests among non japanese against the gravest violation of civil liberties since the end of slavery.
the press supported the policy almost unanimously.
in congress only senator robert taft of ohio spoke out against it.
groups publicly committed to fighting discrimination from the communist party to the naacp and the american jewish committee either defended the policy or remained silent.
the courts refused to intervene.

speaking for a 6 3 majority justice hugo black usually an avid defender of civil liberties upheld the legality of the internment policy insisting that an order applying only to persons of japanese descent was not based on race.
the court has never overturned the korematsu decision.
as justice robert h jackson warned in his dissent it lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of national security.
the government marketed war bonds to the internees.
it established a loyalty oath program expecting japanese americans to swear allegiance to the government that had imprisoned them and to enlist in the army.
some young men refused and about 200 were sent to prison for resisting the draft.
let us out and then maybe ill think about risking my skin for the land of the free one of the resisters remarked.
but 20 000 japaneseamericans joined the armed forces from the camps along with another 13 000 from hawaii.
a long campaign for acknowledgment of the injustice done to japanese americans followed the end of the war.
in 1988 congress gulf of mexico 400 miles 400 kilometers more than 100 000 japaneseamericans the majority american citizens were forcibly moved from their homes to internment camps during world war ii.
22 fighting for the four freedoms the american dilemma apologized for internment and provided 20 000 in compensation to each surviving victim.
president bill clinton subsequently awarded fred korematsu the presidential medal of freedom.
blacks and the war although the treatment of japanese americans revealed the stubborn hold of racism in american life the wartime message of freedom portended a major transformation in the status of blacks.
there never has been there isnt now and there never will be roosevelt declared any race of people on the earth fit to serve as masters over their fellow men yet nazi germany cited american practices as proof of its own race policies.
washington remained a rigidly segregated city and the red cross refused to mix blood from blacks and whites in its blood banks thereby critics charged in effect accepting nazi race theories.
charles drew the black scientist who pioneered the techniques of storing and shipping blood plasma a development of immense importance to the treatment of wounded soldiers protested bitterly against this policy pointing out that it had no scientific basis.
in 1940 and 1941 even as roosevelt called for aid to the free peoples of europe thirteen lynchings took place in the united states.
the war spurred a movement of black population from the rural south to the cities of the north and west that dwarfed the great migration of world war i and the 1920s.
about 700 000 black migrants poured out of the south on what they called liberty trains seeking jobs in the industrial heartland.
they encountered sometimes violent hostility nowhere more so than in detroit where angry white residents forced authorities to evict black tenants from a new housing project.
in 1943 a fight at a detroit city park spiraled into a race riot that left thirty four persons dead and a hate strike of 20 000 workers protested the upgrading of black employees in a plant manufacturing aircraft engines.
the war failed to end lynching.
isaac simmons a black minister was murdered in 1944 for refusing to sell his land to a white man who believed it might contain oil.
the criminals went unpunished.
this took place in liberty mississippi.
blacks during world war ii red cross blood banks separated blood from black and white americans one illustration of the persistence of racial segregation.
this 1943 poster by the naacp points out that the concept of negro and white blood has no scientific basis.
and military service when world war ii began the air force and marines had no black members.
the army restricted the number of black enlistees and contained only five black officers three of them chaplains.
the navy accepted blacks only as waiters and cooks.
during the war more than 1 million blacks served in the armed forces.
they did so in segregated units largely confined to construction transport and other noncombat tasks.
many northern black draftees were sent to the south for military training where they found themselves excluded from movie theaters and servicemens clubs on military bases and abused when they ventured into local towns.
black soldiers sometimes had to give up their seats on railroad cars to accommodate nazi prisoners of war.

the segregated army recruits training with their rifles at the u s marine base at parris island south carolina in 1941.
when southern black veterans returned home and sought benefits through the gi bill they encountered even more evidence of racial discrimination.
on the surface the gi bill contained no racial differentiation in offering benefits like health care college tuition assistance job training and loans to start a business or purchase a farm.
but local authorities who administered its provisions allowed southern black veterans to use its education benefits only at segregated colleges limited their job training to unskilled work and low wage service jobs and limited loans for farm purchase to white veterans.
birth of the civil rights movement in 1942 a public opinion survey sponsored by the armys bureau of intelligence found that the vast majority of white americans were unaware that there is any such thing as a negro problem and were convinced that blacks were satisfied with their social and economic conditions.
they would soon discover their mistake.
the war years witnessed the birth of the modern civil rights movement.
angered by the almost complete exclusion of african americans from jobs in the rapidly expanding war industries of 100 000 aircraft workers in 1940 fewer than 300 were blacks the black labor leader a philip randolph in july 1941 called for a march on washington.
his demands included access to defense employment an end to segregation and a national antilynching law.
randolph who as founder of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters had long battled racism among both employers and unions hurled roosevelts rhetoric back at the president.
he declared racial discrimination undemocratic un american and pro hitler the prospect of thousands of angry blacks descending on washington remarked one official scared the government half to death to persuade voices of freedom from henr y r luce the american centur y 1941 even before the united states entered world war ii some americans were thinking of a postwar world in which the united states would exert its influence throughout the globe.

hence they have failed to play their part as a world power a failure which has had disastrous consequences for themselves and for all mankind.

but its very existence marked a significant shift in public policy.

to blacks freedom from fear meant among other things an end to lynching and freedom from want included doing away with discrimination in getting jobs if in whites eyes freedom was a possession to be defended he observed to blacks and other racial minorities it remained a goal to be achieved our fight for freedom said a returning black veteran of the pacific war begins when we get to san francisco what the negro wants during the war a broad political coalition centered on the left but reaching well beyond it called for an end to racial inequality in america.

laws to ban discrimination in employment and housing.
despite considerable resistance from rank and file white workers cio unions especially those with strong left liberal and communist influence made significant efforts to organize black workers and win them access to skilled positions.
afl craft unions by and large continued their long tradition of excluding black workers.
but during world war ii the cio was probably more racially integrated than any labor organization since the knights of labor in the 1880s.
the new black militancy created a crisis for moderate white southerners.
they now saw their middle ground evaporating as blacks demanded an end to segregation while southern politicians took up the cry of protecting white supremacy.
the latter also spoke the language of freedom.
defenders of the racial status quo interpreted freedom to mean the right to shape their regions institutions without outside interference.
the war emergency insisted governor frank dixon of alabama should not be used as a pretext to bring about the abolition of the color line even as the war gave birth to the modern civil rights movement it also planted the seeds for the souths massive resistance to desegregation during the 1950s.
in the rest of the country however the status of black americans assumed a place at the forefront of enlightened liberalism.
far more than in the 1930s federal officials spoke openly of the need for a dramatic change in race relations.

but the books great surprise came in willkies attack on our imperialisms at home unless the united states addressed the mocking paradox of racism he insisted its claim to world leadership would lack moral authority.
if we want to talk about freedom willkie wrote we must mean freedom for everyone inside our frontiers an world war ii reinvigorated the movement for civil rights.

american dilemma no event reflected the new concern with the status of black americans more than the publication in 1944 of an american dilemma a sprawling account of the countrys racial past present and future written by the swedish social scientist gunnar myrdal.
the book offered an uncompromising portrait of how deeply racism was entrenched in law politics economics and social behavior.
but myrdal combined this sobering analysis with admiration for what he called the american creed belief in equality justice equal opportunity and freedom.
the war he argued had made americans more aware than ever of the contradiction between this creed and the reality of racial inequality.
he concluded that there is bound to be a redefinition of the negros status as a result of this war myrdals notion of a conflict between american values and american racial policies was hardly new frederick douglass and w e b.
du bois had said much the same thing.
but in the context of a worldwide struggle against nazism and rising black demands for equality at home his book struck a chord.
it identified a serious national problem and seemed to offer an almost painless path to peaceful change in which the federal government would take the lead in outlawing discrimination.
this coupling of an appeal to american principles with federal social engineering established a liberal position on race relations that would survive for many years.
by 1945 support for racial justice had finally taken its place on the liberal left agenda alongside full employment civil liberties and the expansion of the new deal welfare state.
roosevelt himself rarely spoke out on racial issues.
but many liberals insisted that racial discrimination must be confronted head on through federal antilynching legislation equal opportunity in the workplace an end to segregated housing and schools and the expansion of social security programs to cover agricultural and domestic workers.
this wartime vision of a racially integrated full employment economy formed a bridge between the new deal and the great society of the 1960s see chapter 25.

paul robeson the black actor singer and battler for civil rights leading oakland dockworkers in singing the national anthem in 1942.
world war ii gave a significant boost to the vision shared by robeson and others on the left of an america based on genuine equality.
black internationalism in the nineteenth century black radicals like david walker and martin delany had sought to link the fate of african americans with that of peoples of african descent in other parts of the world especially the caribbean and africa.
in the first decades of the twentieth century this kind of international consciousness was reinvigorated.
in a sense the global imposition of white supremacy brought forth a feeling of racial solidarity across national and geographic lines.
garveyism discussed in chapter 19 was one example another was reflected in the five pan african congresses that met between 1919 and 1945.
attended by black intellectuals from the united states the caribbean europe and africa these gatherings denounced the colonial rule of africa and sought to establish a sense of unity among all people in the african diaspora a term used to describe the scattering of a people with a single national religious or racial identity.

through these gatherings du bois robeson and others developed an outlook that linked the plight of black americans with that of people of color worldwide.
racism they came to believe originated not in irrational hatred but in the slave trade and slavery.
in the modern age it was perpetuated by colonialism.
thus freeing africa from colonial rule would encourage greater equality at home.
world war ii stimulated among african americans an even greater awareness of the links between racism in the united states and colonialism abroad.

t h e e n d o f t h e wa r as 1945 opened allied victory was assured.
in december 1944 in a desperate gamble hitler launched a surprise counterattack in france that pushed allied forces back fifty miles creating a large bulge in their lines.
the largest single battle ever fought by the u s army the battle of the bulge produced more than 70 000 american casualties.
but by early 1945 the assault had failed.
in march american troops crossed the rhine river and entered the industrial heartland of germany.
hitler took his own life and shortly afterward soviet forces occupied berlin.
on may 8 known as v e day for victory in europe came the formal end to the war against germany.
in the pacific american forces moved ever closer to japan.
they had reconquered guam in august 1944 and landed in the philippines two months later where they destroyed most of the remainder of the enemy fleet in the naval battle of leyte gulf.
the most terrible weapon franklin d roosevelt defeated republican nominee thomas e dewey the governor of new york to win an unprecedented fourth term in 1944.
but fdr did not live to see the allied victory.
he succumbed to a stroke on april 12 1945.
to his successor harry s truman fell one of the most momentous decisions ever confronted by an american president whether to use the atomic bomb against japan.
truman did not know about the bomb until after he became president.
then secretary of war stimson informed him that the united states had secretly developed the most terrible weapon ever known in human history the bomb was a practical realization of the theory of relativity a rethinking of the laws of physics developed early in the twentieth century by the german scientist albert einstein.
energy and matter einstein showed represented two forms of the same phenomenon.
according to his famous equation e mc2 the energy contained in matter equals its mass times the speed of light squared an enormous amount.
by using certain forms of uranium or the man made element plutonium an atomic reaction could be created that transformed part of the mass into energy.
this energy could be harnessed to provide a form of controlled power or it could be unleashed in a tremendous explosion.
having fled to the united states from hitlers germany einstein in 1939 warned roosevelt that nazi scientists were trying to develop an atomic weapon and urged the president to do likewise.
in the following year fdr authorized what came to be known as the manhattan project a topsecret program in which american scientists developed an atomic bomb during world war ii.
the weapon was tested successfully in new mexico in july 1945.
how did the end of the war begin to shape the postwar world.
the dawn of the atomic age on august 6 1945 an american plane dropped an atomic bomb that detonated over hiroshima japan a target chosen because almost alone among major japanese cities it had not yet suffered damage.
in an instant nearly every building in the city was destroyed.
of the citys population of 280 000 civilians and 40 000 soldiers approximately 70 000 died immediately.
because atomic bombs release deadly radiation the death toll kept rising in the months that followed.
by the end of the year it reached at least 140 000.
thousands more perished over the next five years.
on august 9 the united states exploded a second bomb over nagasaki killing 70 000 persons.
on the same day the soviet union declared war on japan and invaded manchuria.
within a week japan surrendered.
because of the enormous cost in civilian lives more than twice americas military fatalities in the entire pacific war the use of the bomb remains controversial.
the japanese had fought ferociously while being driven from one pacific island after another.
an american invasion of japan some advisers warned truman might cost as many as 250 000 american lives.
no such invasion was planned however until 1946 and considerable evidence had accumulated that japan was nearing surrender.
already some of its officials had communicated a willingness to end the war if emperor hirohito could remain on his throne.
this fell short of the allies demand for unconditional surrender but the victors would in the end agree to hirohitos survival.
japans economy had been crippled and its fleet destroyed and it would now have to fight the soviet union as well as the united states.
some of the scientists who had worked on the bomb urged truman to demonstrate its power to international observers.
but truman did not hesitate.
the bomb was a weapon and weapons are created to be used.
the nature of the war the dropping of the atomic bombs was the logical culmination of the way world war ii had been fought.
all wars inflict suffering on noncombatants.
on august 10 1945 the day after the detonation of the atomic bomb over nagasaki the japanese photographer yosuke yamahata captured this image of dazed survivors in the devastated city.
22 fighting for the four freedoms the end of the war but never before had civilian populations been so ruthlessly targeted.
military personnel represented 90 percent of those who died in world war i.
but of the estimated 50 million persons who perished during world war ii including 400 000 american soldiers perhaps 20 million were civilians.
germany had killed millions of members of inferior races it had repeatedly bombed london and other cities.
the allies carried out even more deadly air assaults on civilian populations.
early in 1945 the firebombing of dresden killed some 100 000 people mostly women children and elderly men.
on march 9 nearly the same number died in an inferno caused by the bombing of tokyo.
four years of war propaganda had dehumanized the japanese in american eyes and few persons criticized trumans decision in 1945.
but public doubts began to surface especially after john hersey published hiroshima 1946 a graphic account of the horrors suffered by the civilian population.
general dwight d eisenhower who thought the use of the bomb unnecessary later wrote i hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon planning the postwar world even as the war raged a series of meetings between allied leaders formulated plans for the postwar world.
churchill roosevelt and stalin met at tehran iran in 1943 and at yalta in the southern soviet union early in 1945 to hammer out agreements.
the final big three conference took place at potsdam near berlin in july 1945.
it involved stalin truman and churchill replaced midway in the talks by clement attlee who became prime minister when his labour party swept the british elections.
at potsdam the allied leaders established a military administration for germany and agreed to place top nazi leaders on trial for war crimes.
relations among the three allies were often uneasy as each maneuvered to maximize its postwar power.
neither britain nor the united states trusted stalin.
the delay in the allied invasion of france until 1944 which left the soviets to do the bulk of the fighting against germany angered the russians.
but since stalins troops had won the war on the eastern front it was difficult to resist his demand that eastern europe become a soviet sphere of influence a region whose governments can be counted on to do a great powers bidding.
y a lta and bretton woods at yalta roosevelt and churchill entered only a mild protest against soviet plans to retain control of the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania and a large part of eastern poland in effect restoring russias pre world war i western borders.
stalin agreed to enter the war against japan later in 1945 to include noncommunists in the pro soviet government of poland and to allow free and unfettered elections there.
but he was intent on establishing communism in eastern europe.
he believed as he put it to yugoslav communist leader josip broz tito that in modern war whoever occupies a territory also imposes his own social system yalta saw the high water mark of wartime american soviet cooperation.
but it planted seeds of conflict since the participants soon disagreed over the fate of eastern europe.
how did the end of the war begin to shape the postwar world.
tension also existed between britain and the united states.
churchill rejected american pressure to place india and other british colonies on the road to independence.
he concluded private deals with stalin to divide southern and eastern europe into british and soviet spheres of influence.
britain also resisted unsuccessfully american efforts to reshape and dominate the postwar economic order.
a meeting of representatives of forty five nations at bretton woods new hampshire in july 1944 replaced the british pound with the dollar as the main currency for international transactions.
during the 1930s as noted in the previous chapter fdr had taken the united states off the gold standard allowing the government to issue more money in the hope of stimulating business activity.
the bretton woods conference reestablished the link between the dollar and gold.
it set the dollars value at 35 per ounce of gold and gave other currencies a fixed relationship to the dollar.
the conference also created two american dominated financial institutions.
the world bank would provide money to developing countries and to help rebuild europe.
the international monetary fund would work to prevent governments from devaluing their currencies to gain an advantage in international trade as many had done during the depression.
although the details took many years to emerge bretton woods created the framework for the postwar capitalist economic system based on a freer international flow of goods and investment and a recognition of the united states as the worlds financial leader.
determined to avoid a recurrence of the great depression american leaders believed that the removal of barriers to free trade would encourage the growth of the world economy an emphasis that remains central to american foreign policy to this day.
the united nations early in the war the allies also agreed to establish a successor to the league of nations.
in a 1944 conference at dumbarton oaks near washington d c they developed the structure of the united nations un.
there would be a general assembly essentially a forum for discussion where each member enjoyed an equal voice and a security council responsible for maintaining world peace.
along with six rotating members the council would have five permanent ones britain china france the soviet union and the united states each with the power to veto resolutions.
in june 1945 representatives of fifty one countries met in san francisco to adopt the un charter which outlawed force or the threat of force as a means of settling international disputes.
in july the u s senate endorsed the charter.
in contrast to the bitter dispute over membership in the league of nations after world war i only two members of the u s senate voted against joining the the big three stalin roosevelt and churchill at their first meeting in tehran iran in 1943 where they discussed the opening of a second front against germany in western europe.
22 fighting for the four freedoms the end of the war un.
at the conclusion of the san francisco conference that established the united nations president truman urged americans to recognize that no matter how great our strength we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please.
this is the price which each nation will have to pay for world peace.
and what a reasonable price that is peace in this 1941 photograph three boy scouts hispanic white and asian hold a poster celebrating freedom in front of the capitol in washington d c but not harmony world war ii produced a radical redistribution of world power.
japan and germany the two dominant military powers in their regions before the war were utterly defeated.
britain and france though victorious were substantially weakened.
only the united states and the soviet union were able to project significant influence beyond their national borders.
overall however the united states was clearly the dominant world power.
what rome was to the ancient world wrote the journalist walter lippmann america is to be to the world of tomorrow but peace did not usher in an era of international harmony.
the soviet occupation of eastern europe created a division soon to be solidified in the cold war.
the dropping of the atomic bombs left a worldwide legacy of fear.
it remained to be seen how seriously the victorious allies took their wartime rhetoric of freedom.
in august 1941 four months before the united states entered the war fdr and british prime minister winston churchill had met for a conference on warships anchored off the coast of newfoundland and issued the atlantic charter.
the charter promised that the final destruction of nazi tyranny would be followed by open access to markets the right of all peoples to choose their form of government and a global extension of the new deal so that people everywhere would enjoy improved labor standards economic advancement and social security it referred specifically to two of roosevelts four freedoms freedom from want and freedom from fear.
but freedom of speech and of worship had been left out because of british reluctance to apply them to its colonial possessions especially india.
the four freedoms speech and the atlantic charter had been primarily intended to highlight the differences between anglo american ideals and nazism.
nonetheless they had unanticipated consequences.
as one of roosevelts speechwriters remarked when you state a moral principle you are stuck with it no matter how many fingers you have kept crossed at the moment the language with which world war ii was fought helped to lay the foundation for postwar ideals of human rights that extend to all mankind.
during the war mahatma gandhi the indian nationalist leader wrote to roosevelt that the idea that the allies are fighting to make the world safe for freedom of the individual and for democracy seems hollow so long as india and for that matter africa are exploited by great britain and america has the negro problem in her own home allied victory saved mankind from a living nightmare a worldwide system of dictatorial rule and slave labor in which peoples deemed inferior suffered the fate of european jews and of the victims of japanese outrages in asia.
but disputes over the freedom of colonial peoples overseas and non whites in the united states foretold more wars and social upheavals to come.

l o n september 16 1947 the 160th anniversary of the signing of the constitution the freedom train opened to the public in philadelphia.
a traveling exhibition of 133 historical documents the train bedecked in red white and blue soon embarked on a sixteenmonth tour that took it to more than 300 american cities.
never before or since have so many cherished pieces of americana among them the mayflower compact the declaration of independence and the gettysburg address been assembled in one place.
after leaving the train visitors were encouraged to rededicate themselves to american values by taking the freedom pledge and adding their names to a freedom scroll.
the idea for the freedom train perhaps the most elaborate peacetime patriotic campaign in american history originated in 1946 with the department of justice.
president harry s truman endorsed it as a way of contrasting american freedom with the destruction of liberty by the hitler tyranny since direct government funding raised fears of propaganda however the administration turned the project over to a nonprofit group the american heritage foundation headed by winthrop w aldrich chairman of chase manhattan bank.
by any measure the freedom train was an enormous success.
it attracted more than 3 5 million visitors and millions more took part in the civic activities that accompanied its journey including labormanagement forums educational programs and patriotic parades.
the powerful grassroots response to the train wrote the new republic revealed a popular hunger for tangible evidence of american freedom behind the scenes however the freedom train demonstrated that the meaning of freedom remained as controversial as ever.
the liberal staff members at the national archives who proposed the initial list of documents had included the wagner act of 1935 which guaranteed workers the right to form unions as well as president roosevelts four freedoms speech of 1941 with its promise to fight freedom from want the more conservative american heritage foundation removed these documents.
they also deleted from the original list the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments which had established the principle of equal civil and political rights regardless of race after the civil war and fdrs 1941 order establishing the fair employment practices commission which congress had recently allowed to expire.
in the end nothing on the train referred to organized labor or any twentieth century social legislation.
the only documents relating to blacks were the emancipation proclamation the thirteenth amendment and a 1776 letter by south carolina patriot henry laurens criticizing slavery.
many black americans initially voiced doubts regarding the exhibit.
on the eve of the trains unveiling the poet langston hughes wondered whether there would be jim crow on the freedom train when it stops w h a t s e r i e s o f e v e n t s a n d i d e o l o g i c a l c o n f l i c t s p r o m p t e d t h e c o l d wa r.
in mississippi hughes asked will it be made plain everybodys got a right to board the freedom train in fact with the truman administration about to make civil rights a major priority the trains organizers announced that they would not permit segregated viewing.
in an unprecedented move the american heritage foundation canceled visits to memphis tennessee and birmingham alabama when local authorities insisted on separating visitors by race.
the freedom train visited forty seven other southern cities without incident and was hailed in the black press for breaching if only temporarily the walls of segregation.
even as the freedom train reflected a new sense of national unease about expressions of racial inequality its journey also revealed the growing impact of the cold war.
originally intended to contrast american freedom with nazi tyranny the train quickly became caught up in the emerging struggle with communism.
in the spring of 1947 a few months before the train was dedicated president truman committed the united states to the worldwide containment of soviet power and inaugurated a program to root out disloyal persons from government employment.
soon attorney general tom c clark was praising the freedom train as a means of preventing foreign ideologies from infiltrating the united states and of aiding the country in its internal war against subversive elements the federal bureau of investigation began compiling reports on those who found the train objectionable.
the freedom train revealed how the cold war helped to reshape freedoms meaning identifying it ever more closely with anticommunism free enterprise and the defense of the social and economic status quo.
o r i g i n s o f t h e c o l d wa r the two powers the united states emerged from world war ii as by far the worlds greatest power.
although most of the army was quickly demobilized the country boasted the worlds most powerful navy and air force.
the united states accounted for half the worlds manufacturing capacity.
it alone possessed the atomic bomb.
as discussed in the previous chapter the roosevelt administration was determined to avoid a retreat to isolationism like the an advertisement for the freedom train links this traveling display of historic documents with the heritage of the american revolution.

it believed that the united states could lead the rest of the world to a future of international cooperation expanding democracy and ever increasing living standards.
new institutions like the united nations and world bank had been created to promote these goals.
american leaders also believed that the nations security depended on the security of europe and asia and that american prosperity required global economic reconstruction.
the only power that in any way could rival the united states was the soviet union whose armies now occupied most of eastern europe including the eastern part of germany.
its crucial role in defeating hitler and its claim that communism had wrested a vast backward nation into modernity gave the soviet union considerable prestige in europe and among colonial peoples struggling for independence.
like the united states the soviets looked forward to a world order modeled on their own society and values.
having lost more than 20 million dead and suffered vast devastation during the war however stalins government was in no position to embark on new military adventures.
unless they were completely out of their minds said american undersecretary of state dean acheson the russians were hardly likely to go to war with the far more powerful united states.
but having done by far the largest amount of ground fighting in the defeat of hitler the soviet government remained determined to establish a sphere of influence in eastern europe through which germany had twice invaded russia in the past thirty years.
the roots of containment fdr seems to have believed that the united states could maintain friendly relations with the soviet union once world war ii ended.
in retrospect however it seems all but inevitable that the two major powers to emerge from the war would come into conflict.
born of a common foe rather than common long term interests values or history their wartime alliance began to unravel almost from the day that peace was declared.
the first confrontation of the cold war took place in the middle east.
at the end of world war ii soviet troops had occupied parts of northern iran hoping to pressure that country to grant it access to its rich oil fields.
under british and american pressure however stalin quickly withdrew soviet forces.
at the same time however the soviets installed procommunist governments in poland romania and bulgaria a step they claimed was no different from american domination of latin america or britains determination to maintain its own empire.
but many americans became convinced that stalin was violating the promise of free elections in poland that had been agreed to at the yalta conference of 1945.
early in 1946 in his famous long telegram from moscow american diplomat george kennan advised the truman administration that the soviets could not be dealt with as a normal government.
communist ideology drove them to try to expand their power throughout the world he claimed and only the united states had the ability to stop them.
while kennan believed that the russians could not be dislodged from control of eastern europe his telegram laid the foundation for what became known as the policy of containment according to which the united states committed itself to preventing any further expansion of soviet power.
w h a t s e r i e s o f e v e n t s a n d i d e o l o g i c a l c o n f l i c t s p r o m p t e d t h e c o l d wa r.
the iron curtain shortly afterward in a speech at fulton missouri britains former wartime prime minister winston churchill declared that an iron curtain had descended across europe partitioning the free west from the communist east.
churchills speech helped to popularize the idea of an impending long term struggle between the united states and the soviets.
but not until march 1947 in a speech announcing what came to be known as the truman doctrine did the president officially embrace the cold war as the foundation of american foreign policy and describe it as a worldwide struggle over the future of freedom.
the truman doctrine harry s truman never expected to become president.
until democratic party leaders chose him to replace henry wallace as roosevelts running mate in 1944 he was an undistinguished senator from missouri who had risen in politics through his connection with the boss of the kansas city political machine tom pendergast.
when he assumed the presidency after roosevelts death in april 1945 truman found himself forced to decide foreign policy debates in which he had previously played virtually no role.
convinced that stalin could not be trusted and that the united states had a responsibility to provide leadership to a world that he tended to view in stark black and white terms truman soon determined to put the policy of containment into effect.
the immediate occasion for this epochal decision came early in 1947 when britain informed the united states that because its economy had been shattered by the war it could no longer afford its traditional international role.
britain had no choice but to end military and financial aid to two crucial governments greece a monarchy threatened by a communist led rebellion and turkey from which the soviets were demanding joint control of the straits linking the black sea and the mediterranean.
britain asked the united states to fill the vacuum.
the soviet union had little to do with the internal problems of greece and turkey where opposition to corrupt undemocratic regimes was largely homegrown.
neither had held truly free elections.
but they occupied strategically important sites at the gateway to southeastern europe and the oil rich middle east.
truman had been told by senate leader arthur vandenberg that the only way a reluctant public and congress would support aid to these governments was for the president to scare hell out of the american people.
to rally popular backing truman rolled out the heaviest weapon in his rhetorical arsenal the defense of freedom.
as the leader of the free world the united states must now shoulder the responsibility of supporting freedom loving peoples wherever communism threatened them.
twenty four times in the eighteen minute speech truman used the words free or freedom building on the wartime division of the globe into free and enslaved worlds and invoking a far older vision of an american mission to defend president harry s truman delivering his truman doctrine speech before congress on march 12 1947.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 origins of the cold war liberty against the forces of darkness the truman doctrine created the language through which most americans came to understand the postwar world.
more than any other statement a prominent senator would write this speech established the guiding spirit of american foreign policy truman succeeded in persuading both republicans and democrats in congress to support his policy beginning a long period of bipartisan support for the containment of communism.
as trumans speech to congress suggested the cold war was in part an ideological conflict.
both sides claimed to be promoting freedom and social justice while defending their own security and each offered its social system as a model the rest of the world should follow.
while his request to congress was limited to 400 million in military aid to two governments aid that enabled both greece and turkey to defeat their domestic foes trumans rhetoric suggested that the united states had assumed a permanent global responsibility.
the speech set a precedent for american assistance to anticommunist regimes throughout the world no matter how undemocratic and for the creation of a set of global military alliances directed against the soviet union.
there soon followed the creation of new national security bodies immune from democratic oversight such as the atomic energy commission national security council and central intelligence agency cia the last established in 1947 to gather intelligence and conduct secret military operations abroad.
a page from a dutch pamphlet promoting the marshall plan.
the marshall plan the language of the truman doctrine and the future it sketched of openended worldwide responsibilities for the united states alarmed many americans.
are we to shoulder the mantle of nineteenth century british imperialism asked the san francisco chronicle.
are we asking for a third world war but the threat of american military action overseas formed only one pillar of containment.
secretary of state george c marshall spelled out the other in a speech at harvard university in june 1947.
marshall pledged the united states to contribute billions of dollars to finance the economic recovery of europe.
two years after the end of the war much of the continent still lay in ruins.
food shortages were widespread and inflation was rampant.
the economic chaos exacerbated by the unusually severe winter of 1946 1947 had strengthened the communist parties of france and italy.
american policymakers feared that these countries might fall into the soviet orbit.
the marshall plan offered a positive vision to go along with containment.
it aimed to combat the idea widespread since the great depression that capitalism was in decline and communism the wave of the future.
it defined the threat to american security not so much as soviet military power but as economic and political instability which could be breeding grounds for communism.
avoiding trumans language of a world divided between free and unfree blocs marshall insisted our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger poverty desperation and chaos freedom meant more than simply anticommunism it required the emergence of the political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist in effect the marshall plan envisioned a new deal for europe an extension to that continent of roosevelts wartime four w h a t s e r i e s o f e v e n t s a n d i d e o l o g i c a l c o n f l i c t s p r o m p t e d t h e c o l d wa r.
as a booklet explaining the idea to europeans put it the aim was a higher standard of living for the entire nation maximum employment for workers and farmers greater production or in the words of a slogan used to popularize the marshall plan prosperity makes you free the marshall plan proved to be one of the most successful foreign aid programs in history.
by 1950 western european production exceeded prewar levels and the region was poised to follow the united states down the road to a massconsumption society.
since the soviet union refused to participate fearing american control over the economies of eastern europe the marshall plan further solidified the division of the continent.
at the same time the united states worked out with twenty three other western nations the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which proposed to stimulate freer trade among the participants creating an enormous market for american goods and investment.
the reconstruction of japan under the guidance of general douglas macarthur the supreme commander in japan until 1948 the country adopted a new democratic constitution and eliminated absentee landlordism so that most tenant farmers became owners of land.
thanks to american insistence and against the wishes of most japanese leaders the new constitution gave women the right to vote for the first time in japans history.
a century after the seneca falls convention womens suffrage had become an intrinsic part of american understandings of freedom.
furthermore article 9 of the new constitution stated that japan would renounce forever the policy of war and armed aggression and would maintain only a modest self defense force.
the united states also oversaw the economic reconstruction of japan.
initially the united states proposed to dissolve japans giant industrial corporations which had contributed so much to the nations war effort.
but this plan was abandoned in 1948 in favor of an effort to rebuild japans industrial base as a bastion of anticommunist strength in asia.
by the 1950s thanks to american economic assistance the adoption of new technologies and low spending on the military japans economic recovery was in full swing.
the berlin blockade and nato meanwhile the cold war intensified and despite the marshall plan increasingly took a militaristic turn.
at the end of world war ii each of the four victorious powers assumed control of a section of occupied germany bales of american cotton in a warehouse at the french port of le havre 1949.
part of the marshall plan aid program the shipment helped to revive the french cotton industry.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 origins of the cold war children in berlin celebrate the arrival of a plane bringing supplies to counter the soviet blockade of the city in 1948 and of berlin located deep in the soviet zone.
in june 1948 the united states britain and france introduced a separate currency in their zones a prelude to the creation of a new west german government that would be aligned with them in the cold war.
in response the soviets cut off road and rail traffic from the american british and french zones of occupied germany to berlin although stalin kept supply routes open from the east since soviet forces occupied part of the divided city.
an eleven month airlift followed with western planes supplying fuel and food to their zones of the city.
when stalin lifted the blockade in may 1949 the truman administration had won a major victory.
soon two new nations emerged east and west germany each allied with a side in the cold war.
berlin itself remained divided.
the citys western part survived as an isolated enclave within east germany.
not until 1991 would germany be reunified.
also in 1949 the soviet union tested its first atomic bomb ending the american monopoly of the weapon.
in the same year the united states canada and ten western european nations established the north atlantic treaty organization nato pledging mutual defense against any future soviet attack.
soon west germany became a crucial part of nato.
many europeans feared german rearmament.
but france and other victims of nazi aggression saw nato as a kind of double containment in which west germany would serve as a bulwark against the soviets while integration into the western alliance tamed and civilized german power.
the north atlantic treaty was the first long term military alliance between the united states and europe since the treaty of amity and commerce with france during the american revolution.
the soviets formalized their own eastern european alliance the warsaw pact in 1955.
the growing communist challenge in 1949 communists led by mao zedong emerged victorious in the long chinese civil war a serious setback for the policy of containment.

in the wake of soviet american confrontations over southern and eastern europe and berlin the communist victory in china and soviet success in developing an atomic bomb the national security council approved a call for a permanent military build up to enable the united states to pursue a global crusade against communism.
known as nsc 68 this 1950 manifesto described the cold war as an epic struggle between the idea of freedom and the idea of slavery under the grim oligarchy of the kremlin at stake in the world conflict it insisted was nothing less than the survival of the free world one of the most important policy statements of the early cold war nsc 68 helped to spur a dramatic increase in american military spending.
the korean war initially american postwar policy focused on europe.
but it was in asia that the cold war suddenly turned hot.
occupied by japan during world war ii korea had been divided in 1945 into soviet and american zones.
these soon evolved into two governments communist north korea and anticommunist south korea undemocratic but aligned with the united states.
in june 1950 the north korean army invaded the south hoping to reunify the country under communist control.
north korean soldiers soon occupied most of the peninsula.
viewing korea as a clear test of the policy of containment the truman administration persuaded the united nations security council to authorize the use of force to repel the invasion.
the soviets who could have vetoed the resolution were boycotting security council meetings to protest the refusal to seat communist china.
american troops did the bulk of the fighting on this first battlefield of the cold war.
in september 1950 general douglas macarthur launched a daring counterattack at inchon behind north korean lines.
the invading forces retreated northward and macarthurs army soon occupied most of north korea.
truman now hoped to unite korea under a pro american government.
but in october 1950 when un forces neared the chinese border hundreds of thousands of chinese troops intervened driving them back in bloody fighting.
macarthur demanded the right to push north again and w h a t s e r i e s o f e v e n t s a n d i d e o l o g i c a l c o n f l i c t s p r o m p t e d t h e c o l d wa r.
possibly even invade china and use nuclear weapons against it.
but truman fearing an all out war on the asian mainland refused.
macarthur did not fully accept the principle of civilian control of the military.
when he went public with criticism of the president truman removed him from command.
the war then settled into a stalemate around the thirty eighth parallel the original boundary between the two koreas.
not until 1953 was an armistice agreed to essentially restoring the prewar status quo.
there has never been a formal peace treaty ending the korean war.
the korean war as this map indicates when general douglas macarthur launched his surprise landing at inchon north korean forces controlled nearly the entire korean peninsula.

23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 a photograph of a street battle in seoul south korea during the korean war illustrates the ferocity of the fighting.
origins of the cold war more than 33 000 americans died in korea.
the asian death toll reached an estimated 1 million korean soldiers and 2 million civilians many of them victims of starvation after american bombing destroyed irrigation systems essential to rice cultivation along with hundreds of thousands of chinese troops.
korea made it clear that the cold war which began in europe had become a global conflict.
taken together the events of 1947 1953 showed that the world had moved very far from the hopes for global harmony symbolized by the founding of the united nations in 1945.
no longer did the united states speak of one world the title of wendell willkies influential wartime book.
instead the world had been divided in two.
the united states now stood as the undisputed leader of what was increasingly known as the west although it included japan where permanent american military bases were established or the free world.
nato was soon followed by seato in southeast asia and cento in the middle east forming a web of military alliances that ringed the soviet union and china.
cold war critics in the soviet union stalin had consolidated a brutal dictatorship that jailed or murdered millions of soviet citizens.
with its one party rule stringent state control of the arts and intellectual life and governmentcontrolled economy the soviet union presented a stark opposite of democracy and free enterprise as a number of contemporary critics few of them sympathetic to soviet communism pointed out however casting the cold war in terms of a worldwide battle between freedom and slavery had unfortunate consequences.
george kennan whose long telegram had inspired the policy of containment observed that such language made it impossible to view international crises on a case by case basis or to determine which genuinely involved either freedom or american interests.
w h a t s e r i e s o f e v e n t s a n d i d e o l o g i c a l c o n f l i c t s p r o m p t e d t h e c o l d wa r.
in a penetrating critique of trumans policies walter lippmann one of the nations most prominent journalists objected to turning foreign policy into an ideological crusade to view every challenge to the status quo as part of a contest with the soviet union lippmann correctly predicted would require the united states to recruit and subsidize an array of satellites clients dependents and puppets it would have to intervene continuously in the affairs of nations whose political problems did not arise from moscow and could not be easily understood in terms of the battle between freedom and slavery.
world war ii he went on had shaken the foundations of european empires.
in the tide of revolutionary nationalism now sweeping the world communists were certain to play an important role.
it would be a serious mistake lippmann warned for the united states to align itself against the movement for colonial independence in the name of anticommunism.
imperialism and decolonization world war ii had increased awareness in the united states of the problem of imperialism and had led many african americans to identify their own struggle for equality with the strivings of non white colonial peoples overseas.
many movements for colonial independence borrowed the language of the american declaration of independence in demanding the right to self government.
liberal democrats and black leaders urged the truman administration to take the lead in promoting worldwide decolonization insisting that a free world worthy of the name should not include colonies and empires.
in 1946 the united states granted independence to the philippines a move hailed by nationalist movements in other colonies.
but as the cold war developed the united states backed away from pressuring its european allies to move toward granting self government to colonies like french indochina the dutch east indies and british possessions like the gold coast and nigeria in africa and malaya in asia.
even after granting independence to india and pakistan in 1947 britain was determined to retain much of its empire.
in practice geopolitical and economic interests shaped american foreign policy as powerfully as the idea of freedom.
but american policymakers used the language of a crusade for freedom to justify actions around the world that had little to do with freedom by almost any definition.
no matter how repressive to its own people if a nation joined the worldwide anticommunist alliance led by the united states it was counted as a member of the free world.
the republic of south africa for example was considered a part of the free world even though its white minority had deprived the black population of nearly all their rights.
was there not some way one critic asked that the united states could accept the aid of tyrants on practical grounds without corrupting our speeches by identifying tyranny with freedom.
t h e c o l d wa r a n d t h e i d e a o f f r e e d o m among other things the cold war was an ideological struggle a battle in a popular phrase of the 1950s for the hearts and minds of people throughout the world.
like other wars it required popular mobilization in ch.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the cold war and the idea of freedom which the idea of freedom played a central role.
during the 1950s freedom became an inescapable theme of academic research popular journalism mass culture and official pronouncements.
henry luce who had popularized the idea of an american century explained that freedom was the one word out of the whole human vocabulary through which time magazine could best explain america to the rest of the world.
in many ways the cold war established the framework for the discussion of freedom.
the a poster for the red menace one of numerous anticommunist films produced by hollywood during the 1950s.
c u lt u r a l cold war one of the more unusual cold war battlefields involved american history and culture.
many scholars read the american creed of pluralism tolerance and equality back into the past as a timeless definition of americanism ignoring the powerful ethnic and racial strains with which it had always coexisted.
under the code name militant liberty national security agencies encouraged hollywood to produce anticommunist movies such as the red menace 1949 and i married a communist 1950 and urged that film scripts be changed to remove references to less than praiseworthy aspects of american history such as indian removal and racial discrimination.
the central intelligence agency and defense department emerged as unlikely patrons of the arts.
as noted in chapter 21 the federal government had openly financed all sorts of artistic works during the 1930s.
but cold war funding for the arts remained top secret in part because congress proved reluctant to spend money for this purpose in part because americans charged communist governments with imposing artistic conformity.
in an effort to influence public opinion abroad the soviet union sponsored tours of its world famous ballet companies folk dance troupes and symphony orchestras.
to counteract the widespread european view of the united states as a cultural backwater the cia secretly funded an array of overseas publications conferences publishing houses concerts and art exhibits.
and to try to improve the international image of american race relations the government sent jazz musicians and other black performers abroad especially to africa and asia.
works produced by artists who considered themselves thoroughly nonpolitical became weapons in the cultural cold war.
the cia promoted the so called new york school of painters led by jackson pollock.
for pollock the essence of art lay in the process of creation not the final product.
his action paintings made by spontaneously dripping and pouring paint over large canvases produced works of vivid color and energy but without any recognizable subject matter.
many members of congress much preferred norman rockwells readily understandable illustrations of smalltown life to pollocks abstract expressionism some called pollocks works un american and wondered aloud if they were part of a communist plot.
but the cia funded the museum of modern art in new york which championed the new york school and helped arrange for exhibitions overseas.
it hoped to persuade europeans not only that these paintings demonstrated that the united states represented artistic leadership as well as military power but that such art embodied the free individual expression denied to artists in communist countries.
pollocks paintings john cages musical compositions which incorporated chance sounds rather than a fixed score and the graceful freedom of george balanchines choreography were all described as artistic reflections of the essence of american life.
h o w d i d t h e c o l d wa r r e s h a p e i d e a s o f a m e r i c a n f r e e d o m.
visitors to the museum of modern art in new york city contemplate a work by jackson pollock whose paintings exemplified the artistic school of abstract expressionism promoted during the cold war as a reflection of american freedom.
the paintings had no recognizable subject other than reminding the viewer of how pollock had created them by flinging paint at the canvas.
i want to express my feelings rather than illustrate them pollock declared.
freedom and totalitarianism along with freedom the cold wars other great mobilizing concept was totalitarianism the term originated in europe between the world wars to describe fascist italy and nazi germany aggressive ideologically driven states that sought to subdue all of civil society including churches unions and other voluntary associations to their control.
such states according to the theory of totalitarianism left no room for individual rights or alternative values and therefore could never change from within.
by 1950 the year the mccarran internal security act barred totalitarians from entering the united states the term had become a shorthand way of describing those on the other side in the cold war.
as the eventual collapse of communist governments in eastern europe and the soviet union would demonstrate the idea of totalitarianism greatly exaggerated the totality of government control of private life and thought in these countries.
but its widespread use reinforced the view that the greatest danger to freedom lay in an overly powerful government.
just as the conflict over slavery redefined american freedom in the nineteenth century and the confrontation with the nazis shaped understandings of freedom during world war ii the cold war reshaped them once again.
russia had already conquered america the poet archibald macleish complained in 1949 since politics was conducted under a kind of upsidedown russian veto whatever moscow stood for was by definition the opposite of freedom including anything to which the word socialized could be attached.
in the largest public relations campaign in american history the american medical association raised the specter of socialized medicine to discredit and defeat trumans proposal for national health insurance.
the real estate industry likewise mobilized against public housing terming it socialized housing similar to policies undertaken by moscow.
the soviets opposed organized religion so to strengthen our national resistance to communism congress in 1954 added the words under god to the pledge of allegiance.
cartoonist bill mauldin illustrated the essence of the idea of totalitarianism in this 1946 cartoon a dictatorial government that refuses to accept the legitimacy of difference of opinion.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the rise of human the cold war and the idea of freedom rights the cold war also affected the emerging concept of human rights.
the idea that there are rights that are applicable to all of humanity originated during the eighteenth century in the enlightenment and the american and french revolutions.
the atrocities committed during world war ii as well as the global language of the four freedoms and the atlantic charter forcefully raised the issue of human rights in the postwar world.
after the war the victorious allies put numerous german officials on trial before special courts at nuremberg for crimes against humanity.
for the first time individuals were held directly accountable to the international community for violations of human rights.
the trials resulted in prison terms for many nazi officials and the execution of ten leaders.
the united nations charter includes strong language prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race sex or religion.
in 1948 the un general assembly approved a far more sweeping document the universal declaration of human rights drafted by a committee chaired by eleanor roosevelt.
it identified a broad range of rights to be enjoyed by people everywhere including freedom of speech religious toleration and protection against arbitrary government as well as social and economic entitlements like the right to an adequate standard of living and access to housing education and medical care.
the document had no enforcement mechanism.
some considered it an exercise in empty rhetoric.
but the core principle that a nations treatment of its own citizens should be subject to outside evaluation slowly became part of the language in which freedom was discussed.
ambiguities of human rights the american and french revolutions of the late eighteenth century had introduced into international relations the idea of basic rights belonging to all persons simply because they are human.
in a sense this was the origin of the idea of human rights principles so fundamental that no government has a right to violate them.
the antislavery movement had turned this idea into a powerful weapon against the legitimacy of slavery.
yet the debates over the universal declaration of human rights revealed the tensions inherent in the idea tensions that persist to the present day.
to what extent do human rights supercede national sovereignty.
who has the authority to enforce human rights that a government is violating.
the united nations.
regional bodies like the organization of american states and the european union.
a single country as the united states would claim to be doing in the iraq war that began in 2003.
the covenant of the league of nations the predecessor of the united nations created after world war i had contained a clause allowing the league to intervene when a government violated the rights of its own citizens.
one reason for the lack of an enforcement mechanism in the universal declaration of human rights was that both the united states and the soviet union refused to accept outside interference in their internal affairs or restraints on their ability to conduct foreign policy as they desired.

questions 1.
what does the cartoon suggest about the degree of commitment to human rights in the postwar world.
what definition of freedom do the words of eleanor roosevelt illustrate.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the truman presidency would lead to an international investigation of the negro question in this country in 1947 the naacp did file a petition with the united nations asking it to investigate racism in the united states as a violation of human rights.
conditions in states like mississippi should be of concern to all mankind it argued because if democracy failed to function in the leading democracy in the world the prospects for democracy were weakened everywhere.
but the un decided that it lacked jurisdiction.
nonetheless since the end of world war ii the enjoyment of human rights has increasingly taken its place in definitions of freedom across the globe especially perhaps where such rights are flagrantly violated.
after the cold war ended the idea of human rights would play an increasingly prominent role in world affairs.
but during the 1950s cold war imperatives shaped the concept.
neither the united states nor the soviet union could resist emphasizing certain provisions of the universal declaration while ignoring others.
the soviets claimed to provide all citizens with social and economic rights but violated democratic rights and civil liberties.
many americans condemned the nonpolitical rights as a step toward socialism.
in 1950 freedom house began yearly assessments of the status of freedom in the worlds nations.
it adopted purely political criteria emphasizing citizens rights to participate in open elections and to speak out on public issues.
considering access to employment housing education medical care and the like as part of the definition of freedom the reports argued would be a serious mistake.
eleanor roosevelt saw the universal declaration of human rights as an integrated body of principles a combination of traditional civil and political liberties with the social conditions of freedom outlined in her husbands economic bill of rights of 1944.
but to make it easier for member states to ratify the document the un divided it into two covenants civil and political rights and economic social and cultural rights.
it took until 1992 for the u s congress to ratify the first.
it has never approved the second.
the truman presidency the fa i r deal with the end of world war ii president trumans first domestic task was to preside over the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.
more than 12 million men remained in uniform in august 1945.
they wanted nothing more than to return home to their families.
demobilization proceeded at a rapid pace.
within a year the armed forces had been reduced to 3 million.
some returning soldiers found the adjustment to civilian life difficult.
the divorce rate in 1945 rose to double its prewar level.
others took advantage of the gi bill of rights discussed in the previous chapter to obtain home mortgages set up small businesses and embark on college educations.
the majority of returning soldiers entered the labor force one reason why more than 2 million women workers lost their jobs.
the government abolished wartime agencies that regulated industrial production and labor relations and it dismantled wartime price controls leading to a sharp rise in prices.
in the immediate aftermath of world war ii president truman backed by party liberals and organized labor moved to revive the stalled momentum of the new deal.
trumans program which he announced in what were the major initiatives of trumans domestic policies.
september 1945 and would later call the fair deal focused on improving the social safety net and raising the standard of living of ordinary americans.
he called on congress to increase the minimum wage enact a program of national health insurance and expand public housing social security and aid to education.
truman complained one republican leader was out new dealing the new deal the postwar strike wave in 1946 a new wave of labor militancy swept the country.
the afl and cio launched operation dixie a campaign to bring unionization to the south and by so doing shatter the hold of anti labor conservatives on the regions politics.
more than 200 labor organizers entered the region seeking support especially in the southern textile industry the steel industry in the birmingham region and agriculture.
with war production at an end overtime work diminished even as inflation soared following the removal of price controls.
the resulting drop in workers real income sparked the largest strike wave in american history.
nearly 5 million workers including those in the steel auto coal and other key industries walked off their jobs demanding wage increases.
the strike of 750 000 steelworkers represented the largest single walkout in american history to that date.
even hollywood studios shut down because of a strike of actors and other employees of the movie industry that lasted for the better part of a year.
one historian calls this period the closest thing to a national general strike in industry in the twentieth century president truman feared the strikes would seriously disrupt the economy.
when railroad workers stopped work and set up picket lines the infuriated president prepared a speech in which he threatened to draft them all into the army and hang a few traitors language toned down by his advisers.
the walkout soon ended as did a coal strike after the truman administration secured a court order requiring the miners to return to work.
to resolve other strikes truman appointed federal fact finding boards which generally recommended wage increases although not enough to restore workers purchasing power to wartime levels.
the republican resurgence in the congressional elections of 1946 large numbers of middle class voters alarmed by the labor turmoil voted republican.
many workers disappointed by trumans policies stayed at home.
this was a lethal combination for the democratic party.
for the first time since the 1920s republicans swept to control of both houses of congress.
meanwhile in the face of vigorous opposition from southern employers and public officials and the reluctance of many white workers to join interracial labor unions operation dixie had failed to unionize the south or dent the political control of conservative democrats in the region.
the election of 1946 ensured that a conservative coalition of republicans and southern democrats would continue to dominate congress.

23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the truman presidency congress turned aside trumans fair deal program.
it enacted tax cuts for wealthy americans and over the presidents veto in 1947 passed the taft hartley act which sought to reverse some of the gains made by organized labor in the past decade.
the measure authorized the president to suspend strikes by ordering an eighty day cooling off period and it banned sympathy strikes and secondary boycotts labor actions directed not at an employer but at those who did business with him.
it outlawed the closed shop which required a worker to be a union member when taking up a job and authorized states to pass right to work laws prohibiting other forms of compulsory union membership.
it also forced union officials to swear that they were not communists.
while hardly a slave labor bill as the afl and cio called it the taft hartley act made it considerably more difficult to bring unorganized workers into unions.
over time as population and capital investment shifted to states with right to work laws like texas florida and north carolina taft hartley contributed to the decline of organized labors share of the nations workforce.
postwar racial segregation and exclusion were not confined to the south in the post world war ii period.
here in 1947 picketers stand outside a seattle grocery store that refused to serve non whites.
a campaign by black activists supported by a coalition of unions church groups jewish organizations and communists forced most of the citys stores and restaurants to treat customers on an equal basis.
civil rights during his first term truman reached out in unprecedented ways to the nations black community.
the war as noted in the previous chapter had inspired a new black militancy and led many whites to reject american racial practices as reminiscent of hitlers theory of a master race.
in the years immediately following world war ii the status of black americans enjoyed a prominence in national affairs unmatched since reconstruction.
between 1945 and 1951 eleven states from new york to new mexico established fair employment practices commissions and numerous cities passed laws against discrimination in access to jobs and public accommodations.
some of these measures addressed other racial groups besides blacks for example california in 1947 repealed its laws permitting local school districts to provide segregated education for children of chinese descent and those barring aliens from owning land.
a broad civil rights coalition involving labor religious groups and black organizations supported these measures.
the naacp its ranks swollen during the war launched a voter registration campaign in the south.
by 1952 20 percent of black southerners were registered to vote nearly a seven fold increase since 1940.
most of the gains took place in the upper south in alabama and mississippi the heartland of white supremacy the numbers barely budged.
law enforcement agencies finally took the crime of lynching seriously.
in 1952 for the first time since record keeping began seventy years earlier no lynchings took place in the united states.
in another indication that race relations were in flux the brooklyn dodgers in 1947 challenged the long standing exclusion of black players from major league baseball by adding jackie robinson to their team.
robinson who possessed both remarkable athletic ability and a passion for what were the major initiatives of trumans domestic policies.
equality had been tried and acquitted for insubordination in 1944 when he refused to move to the back of a bus at fort hood texas while serving in the army.
but he promised dodger owner branch rickey that he would not retaliate when subjected to racist taunts by opposing fans and players.
his dignity in the face of constant verbal abuse won robinson nationwide respect and his baseball prowess earned him the rookie of the year award.
his success opened the door to the integration of baseball and led to the demise of the negro leagues to which black players had previously been confined.
to secure these rights in october 1947 a commission on civil rights appointed by the president issued to secure these rights one of the most devastating indictments ever published of racial inequality in america.
it called on the federal government to assume the responsibility for abolishing segregation and ensuring equal treatment in housing employment education and the criminal justice system.
truman hailed the report as an american charter of human freedom the impact of americas race system on the nations ability to conduct the cold war was not far from his mind.
truman noted that if the united states were to offer the peoples of the world a choice of freedom or enslavement it must correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy in february 1948 truman presented an ambitious civil rights program to congress calling for a permanent federal civil rights commission national laws against lynching and the poll tax and action to ensure equal access to jobs and education.
congress as truman anticipated approved none of his proposals.
but in july 1948 just as the presidential campaign was getting under way truman issued an executive order desegregating the armed forces.
the armed services became the first large institution in american life to promote racial integration actively and to attempt to root out long standing racist practices.
the korean war would be the first american conflict fought by an integrated army since the war of independence.
truman genuinely despised racial discrimination.
but his focus on civil rights also formed part of a strategy to win reelection by reinvigorating and expanding the political coalition roosevelt had created.
with calls for federal health insurance the repeal of the taft hartley act and aid to public education the democratic platform of 1948 was the most progressive in the partys history.
led by hubert humphrey the young mayor of minneapolis party liberals overcame southern resistance and added a strong civil rights plank to the platform.

23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the truman presidency the dixiecrat wallace blacks led by a philip randolph left picketing at the 1948 democratic national convention.
the delegates adoption of a strong civil rights plank led representatives of several southern states to withdraw and nominate their own candidate for president strom thurmond.
and r e v o lt s i say the time has come humphrey told the democratic national convention to walk out of the shadow of states rights and into the sunlight of human rights whereupon numerous southern delegates dubbed dixiecrats by the press walked out of the gathering.
they soon formed the states rights democratic party and nominated for president governor strom thurmond of south carolina.
although his platform called for the complete segregation of the races and his campaign drew most of its support from those alarmed by trumans civil rights initiatives thurmond denied charges of racism.
the real issue of the election thurmond insisted was freedom the states rights democratic party he declared stood for individual liberty and freedom the right of people to govern themselves trumans plans for extending federal power into the south to enforce civil rights thurmond charged would convert america into a hitler state also in 1948 a group of left wing critics of trumans foreign policy formed the progressive party and nominated former vice president henry a wallace for president.
wallace advocated an expansion of social welfare programs at home and denounced racial segregation even more vigorously than truman.
when he campaigned in the south angry white crowds attacked him.
but his real difference with the president concerned the cold war.
wallace called for international control of nuclear weapons and a renewed effort to develop a relationship with the soviet union based on economic cooperation rather than military confrontation.
he announced his willingness to accept support from all americans who agreed with him including socialists and communists.
the influence of the now much reduced communist party in wallaces campaign led to an exodus of new deal liberals and severe attacks on his candidacy.
a vote for wallace truman declared was in effect a vote for stalin.
the c a m pa i g n wallace threatened to draw votes from truman on the left and thurmond to undermine the presidents support in the south where whites had voted solidly for the democrats throughout the twentieth century.
but trumans main opponent fortunately for the president was the colorless republican thomas a dewey.
certain of victory and an ineffective speaker and campaigner dewey seemed unwilling to commit himself on controversial issues.
his speeches wrote one hostile newspaper amounted to nothing more than clichs agriculture is important.
our rivers are full of fish.
you cannot have freedom without liberty.
our future lies ahead truman by contrast ran an aggressive campaign.
he crisscrossed the country by train what were the major initiatives of trumans domestic policies.

the four way 1948 campaign was the last before televi4 sion put a premium on brief political advertisements and entertaining slogans rather than substantive debate and 28 13 the last in which a full spectrum of ideologies was present8 1 14 ed to the american public.
virtually every public opinion poll and newspaper report predicted a dewey victory.
9 11 12 trumans success by 303 to 189 electoral votes represented one of the greatest upsets in american political history.

272 713 other candidates socialist prohibition in retrospect the states rights campaign offered a presocialist labor socialist workers view of the political transformation that by the end of the twentieth century would leave every southern state in the republican column.
as for wallace he suffered the humiliation of polling fewer popular votes 1 16 million than thurmond 1 17 million.
his crushing defeat inaugurated an era in which public criticism of the foundations of american foreign policy became all but impossible.
the anticommunist crusade for nearly half a century the cold war profoundly affected american life.
there would be no return to normalcy as after world war i.
the militaryindustrial establishment created during world war ii would be permanent not temporary.
the united states retained a large and active federal government and poured money into weapons development and overseas bases.
national security became the stated reason for a host of government projects including aid to higher education and the building of a new national highway system justified by the need to speed the evacuation of major cities in the event of nuclear war.
the cold war encouraged a culture of secrecy and dishonesty.
not until decades later was it revealed that during the 1950s and 1960s both the soviet and american governments conducted experiments in which unwitting soldiers were exposed to chemical biological and nuclear weapons.
american nuclear tests conducted on pacific islands and in nevada exposed thousands of civilians to radiation that caused cancer and birth defects.
cold war military spending helped to fuel economic growth and support scientific research that not only perfected weaponry but also led to improved aircraft computers medicines and other products with a large impact on civilian life.
since much of this research took place at universities the cold war promoted the rapid expansion of american higher ch.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the anticommunist crusade a crowd in las vegas nevada watches a mushroom cloud rise from the test of an atomic bomb in the distance in 1951.
the government publicized such tests and even broadcast one on television.
it failed to issue warnings of the danger of nuclear fallout and only years later did it admit that many onlookers had contracted diseases from radiation.
the cold war reshaped immigration policy with refugees from communism being allowed to enter the united states regardless of national origin quotas.
the international embarrassment caused by american racial policies contributed to the dismantling of segregation.
and like other wars the cold war encouraged the drawing of a sharp line between patriotic americans and those accused of being disloyal.
containment not only of communism but of unorthodox opinions of all kinds took place at home as well as abroad.
at precisely the moment when the united states celebrated freedom as the foundation of american life the right to dissent came under attack.
l o y a lt y and d i s l o y a lt y dividing the world between liberty and slavery automatically made those who could be linked to communism enemies of freedom.
although the assault on civil liberties came to be known as mccarthyism it began before senator joseph r mccarthy of wisconsin burst onto the national scene in 1950.
in 1947 less than two weeks after announcing the truman doctrine the president established a loyalty review system in which government employees were required to demonstrate their patriotism without being allowed to confront accusers or in some cases knowing the charges against them.
the loyalty program failed to uncover any cases of espionage.
but the federal government dismissed several hundred persons from their jobs and thousands resigned rather than submit to investigation.
also in 1947 the house un american activities committee huac launched a series of hearings about communist influence in hollywood.
calling well known screenwriters directors and actors to appear before the committee ensured it a wave of national publicity which its members relished.
celebrities like producer walt disney and actors gary cooper w h a t e f f e c t s d i d t h e a n t i c o m m u n i s m o f t h e c o l d wa r h a v e o n a m e r i c a n p o l i t i c s a n d c u l t u r e.
movie stars led by actors humphrey bogart and lauren bacall on their way to attend the 1947 hearings of the house unamerican activities committee in a demonstration of support for those called to testify about alleged communist influence in hollywood.
and ronald reagan testified that the movie industry harbored numerous communists.
but ten unfriendly witnesses refused to answer the committees questions about their political beliefs or to name names identify individual communists on the grounds that the hearings violated the first amendments guarantees of freedom of speech and political association.
the committee charged the hollywood ten who included the prominent screenwriters ring lardner jr and dalton trumbo with contempt of congress and they served jail terms of six months to a year.
hollywood studios blacklisted them denied them employment along with more than 200 others who were accused of communist sympathies or who refused to name names.
the spy trials a series of highly publicized legal cases followed which fueled the growing anticommunist hysteria.
whittaker chambers an editor at time magazine testified before huac that during the 1930s alger hiss a high ranking state department official had given him secret government documents to pass to agents of the soviet union.
hiss vehemently denied the charge but a jury convicted him of perjury and he served five years in prison.
a young congressman from california and a member of huac richard nixon achieved national prominence because of his dogged pursuit of hiss.
in another celebrated case the truman administration put the leaders of the communist party on trial for advocating the overthrow of the government.
in 1951 eleven of them were sentenced to five years in prison.
the most sensational trial involved julius and ethel rosenberg a working class jewish communist couple from new york city quite different from hiss a member of the eastern protestant establishment.
in 1951 a jury convicted the rosenbergs of conspiracy to pass secrets demonstrators at a 1953 rally in washington d c demanding the execution of julius and ethel rosenberg.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the anticommunist crusade concerning the atomic bomb to soviet agents during world war ii when the soviets were american allies.
their chief accuser was david greenglass ethel rosenbergs brother who had worked at the los alamos nuclear research center.
the case against julius rosenberg rested on highly secret documents that could not be revealed in court.
when they were released many years later the scientific information they contained seemed too crude to justify the governments charge that julius had passed along the secret of the atomic bomb although he may have helped the soviets speed up their atomic program.
the government had almost no evidence against ethel rosenberg and greenglass later admitted that he had lied in some of his testimony about her.
indeed prosecutors seem to have indicted her in the hope of pressuring julius to confess and implicate others.
but in the atmosphere of hysteria their conviction was certain.
even though they had been convicted of conspiracy a far weaker charge than spying or treason judge irving kaufman called their crime worse than murder they had helped he declared to cause the korean war.
despite an international outcry the death sentence was carried out in 1953.
controversy still surrounds the degree of guilt of both hiss and the rosenbergs although almost no one today defends the rosenbergs execution.
but these trials powerfully reinforced the idea that an army of soviet spies was at work in the united states.
mccarthy senator joseph r mccarthy at the armymccarthy hearings of 1954.
mccarthy points to a map detailing charges about the alleged extent of the communist menace while the armys lawyer joseph welch listens in disgust.
and mccarthyism in this atmosphere a little known senator from wisconsin suddenly emerged as the chief national pursuer of subversives and gave a new name to the anticommunist crusade.
joseph r mccarthy had won election to the senate in 1946 partly on the basis of a fictional war record he falsely claimed to have flown combat missions in the pacific.
in a speech at wheeling west virginia in february 1950 mccarthy announced that he had a list of 205 communists working for the state department.
the charge was preposterous the numbers constantly changed and mccarthy never identified a single person guilty of genuine disloyalty.
but with a genius for self promotion mccarthy used the senate subcommittee he chaired to hold hearings and level wild charges against numerous individuals as well as the defense department the voice of america and other government agencies.
although many republicans initially supported his rampage as a weapon against the truman administration mccarthy became an embarrassment to the party after the election of republican dwight d eisenhower as president in 1952.
but mccarthy did not halt his campaign.
he even questioned eisenhowers anticommunism.
mccarthys downfall came in 1954 when a senate committee investigated his charges that the army had harbored w h a t e f f e c t s d i d t h e a n t i c o m m u n i s m o f t h e c o l d wa r h a v e o n a m e r i c a n p o l i t i c s a n d c u l t u r e.
and coddled communists.
the nationally televised army mccarthy hearings revealed mccarthy as a bully who browbeat witnesses and made sweeping accusations with no basis in fact.
the dramatic high point came when mccarthy attacked the loyalty of a young lawyer in the firm of joseph welch the armys chief lawyer.
let us not assassinate this lad further welch pleaded.
you have done enough.
have you no sense of decency sir after the hearings ended the republican controlled senate voted to condemn mccarthy for his behavior.
he died three years later.
but the word mccarthyism had entered the political vocabulary a shorthand for character assassination guilt by association and abuse of power in the name of anticommunism.
an atmosphere of fear by the early 1950s the anticommunist crusade had created a pervasive atmosphere of fear.
one commentator described washington d c as a city rife with spying suspicion and defamation by rumor with democratic freedoms at risk as power slipped into the hands of those whose values are the values of dictatorship and whose methods are the methods of the police state but anticommunism was as much a local as a national phenomenon.
states created their own committees modeled on huac that investigated suspected communists and other dissenters.
states and localities required loyalty oaths of teachers pharmacists and members of other professions and they banned communists from fishing holding a drivers license and in indiana working as a professional wrestler.
private organizations like the american legion national association of manufacturers and daughters of the american revolution also persecuted individuals for their beliefs.
the better america league of southern california gathered the names of nearly 2 million alleged subversives in the region.
previous membership in organizations with communist influence or even participation in campaigns in which communists had taken part such as the defense of the government of spain during the spanish civil war of the 1930s suddenly took on sinister implications.
throughout the country in the late 1940s and 1950s those who failed to testify about their past and present political beliefs and to inform on possible communists frequently lost their jobs.
local anticommunist groups forced public libraries to remove from their shelves un american books like the tales of robin hood who took from the rich to give to the poor.
universities refused to allow left wing speakers to appear on campus and fired teachers who refused to sign loyalty oaths or to testify against others.
as during world war i the courts did nothing to halt the political repression demonstrating once again james madisons warning that popular hysteria could override parchment barriers like the bill of rights that sought to prevent infringements on freedom.
in 1951 in dennis v united states the supreme court upheld the jailing of communist party leaders even though the charges concerned their beliefs not any actions they had taken.
even many liberals retreated from the idea that freedom of expression was a birthright of all americans.
the american civil liberties union condemned mccarthys tactics but refused to defend the indicted communist party leaders.
fire cartoonist herbert block known as herblock offered this comment in 1949 on the danger to american freedom posed by the anticommunist crusade.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the uses of the anticommunist crusade anticommunism there undoubtedly were soviet spies in the united states.
yet the tiny communist party hardly posed a threat to american security.
and the vast majority of those jailed or deprived of their livelihoods during the mccarthy era were guilty of nothing more than holding unpopular beliefs and engaging in lawful political activities.
anticommunism had many faces and purposes.
a popular mass movement it grew especially strong among ethnic groups like polishamericans with roots in eastern european countries now dominated by the soviet union and among american catholics in general who resented and feared communists hostility to religion.
government agencies like the federal bureau of investigation fbi used anticommunism to expand their power.
under director j edgar hoover the fbi developed files on thousands of american citizens including political dissenters homosexuals and others most of whom had no connection to communism.
anticommunism also served as a weapon wielded by individuals and groups in battles unrelated to defending the united states against subversion.
mccarthy and his republican followers often seemed to target not so much stalin as the legacy of roosevelt and the new deal.
for many democrats aggressive anticommunism became a form of self defense against republican charges of disloyalty and a weapon in a struggle for the partys future.
the campaign against subversion redrew the boundaries of acceptable democratic liberalism to exclude both communists and those willing to cooperate with them as in the days of the popular front.
indeed sympathetic association with communists past or present became grounds for dismissal from ones job under the governments loyalty program.
as the historian henry steele commager argued in a 1947 magazine article the anticommunist crusade promoted a new definition of loyalty conformity.
anything other than uncritical and unquestioning acceptance of america as it is wrote commager could now be labeled unpatriotic.
for business anticommunism became part of a campaign to identify government intervention in the economy with socialism.
white supremacists employed anticommunism against black civil rights business used it against unions and upholders of sexual morality and traditional gender roles raised the cry of subversion against feminism and homosexuality both supposedly responsible for eroding the countrys fighting spirit.
those barred from government service now included homosexuals and members of nudist colonies.
anticommunist politics at its height from the late 1940s to around 1960 the anticommunist crusade powerfully structured american politics and culture.
especially after their unexpected defeat in 1948 republicans in congress used a drumbeat of charges of subversion to block trumans political program.
the most important actions of congress were ones the president opposed.
after launching the governments loyalty program in 1947 truman had become increasingly alarmed at the excesses of the anticommunist crusade.
he vetoed the mccarran internal security bill of 1950 which required subversive groups to register with the government allowed the denial of passports to their members and authorized their deportation or detention on w h a t e f f e c t s d i d t h e a n t i c o m m u n i s m o f t h e c o l d wa r h a v e o n a m e r i c a n p o l i t i c s a n d c u l t u r e.
presidential order.
but congress quickly gave the measure the two thirds majority necessary for it to become law.
the mccarran walter act of 1952 the first major piece of immigration legislation since 1924 also passed over the presidents veto.
truman had appointed a commission on immigration whose report whom shall we welcome called for replacing the quotas based on national origins with a more flexible system taking into account family reunion labor needs and political asylum.
but the mccarran walter act kept the quotas in place.
it also authorized the deportation of immigrants identified as communists even if they had become citizens.
but the renewed fear of aliens sparked by the anticommunist crusade went far beyond communists.
in 1954 the federal government launched operation wetback which employed the military to invade mexican american neighborhoods and round up and deport illegal aliens.
within a year some 1 million mexicans had been deported.
truman did secure passage of a 1950 law that added previously excluded self employed and domestic workers to social security.
otherwise however the idea of expanding the new deal welfare state faded.
in its place private welfare arrangements proliferated.
the labor contracts of unionized workers established health insurance plans automatic cost of living wage increases paid vacations and pension plans that supplemented social security.
western european governments provided these benefits to all citizens.
in the united states union members in major industries enjoyed them but not the nonunionized majority of the population a situation that created increasing inequality among laboring americans.
the cold war and organized labor every political and social organization had to cooperate with the anticommunist crusade or face destruction a wrenching experience for movements like labor and civil rights in which communists had been some of the most militant organizers.
after the passage of the taft hartley act of 1947 which withdrew bargaining rights and legal protection from unions whose leaders failed to swear that they were not communists the cio expelled numerous left wing officials and eleven communist led unions representing nearly 1 million workers.
organized labor emerged as a major supporter of the foreign policy of the cold war.
internal battles over the role of communists and their allies led to the purging of some of the most militant union leaders often the ones most committed to advancing equal rights to women and racial minorities in the workplace.
this left organized labor less able to respond to the economys shift to an emphasis on service rather than manufacturing and to the rise of the civil rights movement.
cold war civil rights the civil rights movement also underwent a transformation.
at first mainstream black organizations like the naacp and urban league protested the truman administrations loyalty program.
they wondered aloud why the program and congressional committees defined communism as unamerican but not racism.
anticommunist investigators often cited attendance at interracial gatherings as evidence of disloyalty.
but while a few prominent black leaders notably the singer and actor paul robeson and the veteran crusader for equality w e b.
du bois became outspoken critics of voices of freedom from national security council nsc 68 1950 a critical document of early cold war thinking nsc 68 called for the united states to pursue a global crusade against communism in the name of freedom.
although not made public until years later the manifesto had a strong impact in government circles and helped to spur a sharp increase in military spending.
each individual compatible with the rights of every other individual.
the freedom of the individual has as its counterpart therefore the negative responsibility of the individual not to exercise his freedom in ways inconsistent with the freedom of other individuals and the positive responsibility to make constructive use of his freedom in the building of a just society.
from this idea of freedom with responsibility derives the marvelous diversity the deep tolerance the lawfulness of the free society.
this is the the soviet union unlike previous aspirants to hegemony is animated by a new fanatic faith antithetical to our own and seeks to impose its absolute authority over the rest of the world.
the kremlin regards the united states as the only major threat to the achievement of its fundamental design.
there is a basic conflict between the idea of freedom under a government of laws and the idea of slavery under the grim oligarchy of the kremlin which has explanation of the strength of free men.
it constitutes the integrity and the vitality of a free and democratic system.
the free society attempts to create and maintain an environment in which every individual has the opportunity to realize his creative powers.
it also explains why the free society tolerates those within it who would use their freedom to destroy it.
by the same token in relations between nations the come to a crisis with the polarization of power.
and the exclusive possession of atomic weapons by the two protagonists.
the implacable purpose of the slave state to eliminate the challenge of freedom has placed the two great powers at opposite poles.
it is this fact which gives the present polarization of prime reliance of the free society is on the strength and appeal of its idea and it feels no compulsion sooner or later to bring all societies into conformity with it.
for the free society does not fear it welcomes diversity.
it derives its strength from its hospitality even to antipathetic hostile ideas.
it is a market for free trade in ideas secure in its faith that free men power the quality of crisis.
the free society values the individual as an end in will take the best wares.
the idea of freedom is the most contagious idea in himself requiring of him only that measure of selfdiscipline and self restraint which make the rights of history more contagious than the idea of submission to authority.
from henry steele commager who is loyal to america harpers september 1947 in a sharply worded essay written in 1947 the prominent historian henry steele commager commented on how the anticommunist crusade was stifling the expression of dissent and promoting an idea of patriotism that equated loyalty to the nation with the uncritical acceptance of american society and institutions.
popular concept of progress and regards america as a finished product perfect and complete.
it is it must be added easily satisfied.
for it wants not intellectual conviction nor spiritual conquest but mere outward conformity.
in matters of loyalty it takes the word for the deed the gesture for the principle.
it is content with the flag salute.
it is satisfied with membership in respectable organizations and as it assumes that every member of a liberal organization is a communist concludes increasingly congress is concerned with the eradication of disloyalty and the defense of americanism and scarcely a day passes.
that the outlines of the new loyalty and the new americanism are not etched more sharply in public policy.
in the making is a revival of the red hysteria of the early 1920s one of the shabbiest chapters in the history of american democracy and more than a revival for the new crusade is designed not merely to frustrate communism but to formulate a positive definition of americanism and a positive concept of loyalty.
what is this new loyalty.
it is above all conformity.
it is the uncritical and unquestioning acceptance of america as it is the political institutions the social relationships the economic practices.
it rejects inquiry into the race question or socialized medicine or public housing or into the wisdom or validity of our foreign policy.
it regards as particularly heinous any challenge to what is called the system of private enterprise identifying that system with americanism.
it abandons.
the once that every member of a conservative one is a true american.
it has not yet learned that not everyone who saith lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.
it is designed neither to discover real disloyalty nor to foster true loyalty.
the concept of loyalty as conformity is a false one.
it is narrow and restrictive denies freedom of thought and of conscience.
what do men know of loyalty who make a mockery of the declaration of independence and the bill of rights.
questions 1 what does nsc 68 see as the essential elements of the free society.
2 why does commager feel that the new patriotism makes a mockery of the bill of rights.
3 is there any connection between the idea of a global battle over the future of freedom outlined in nsc 68 and the infringements on civil liberties at home deplored by commager.
23 the united states and the cold war 1945 1953 the anticommunist crusade the cold war most felt they had no choice but to go along.
the naacp purged communists from local branches.
when the government deprived robeson of his passport and indicted du bois for failing to register as an agent of the soviet union few prominent americans white or black protested.
the charge against du bois was so absurd that even at the height of mccarthyism the judge dismissed it.
the cold war caused a shift in thinking and tactics among civil rights groups.
organizations like the southern conference for human welfare in which communists and noncommunists had cooperated in linking racial equality with labor organizing and economic reform had been crucial to the struggles of the 1930s and war years.
their demise left a gaping hole that the naacp with its narrowly legalistic strategy could not fill.
black organizations embraced the language of the cold war and used it for their own purposes.
they insisted that by damaging the american image abroad racial inequality played into the russians hands.
thus they helped to cement cold war ideology as the foundation of the political culture while complicating the idea of american freedom.
president truman as noted above had called for greater attention to civil rights in part to improve the american image abroad.
all in all however the height of the cold war was an unfavorable time to raise questions about the imperfections of american society.
in 1947 two months after the truman doctrine speech undersecretary of state dean acheson delivered a major address defending the presidents pledge to aid free peoples seeking to preserve their democratic institutions acheson chose as his audience the delta council an organization of mississippi planters bankers and merchants.
he seemed unaware that to make the case for the cold war he had ventured into what one historian has called the american siberia a place of grinding poverty whose black population 70 percent of the total enjoyed neither genuine freedom nor democracy.
most of the deltas citizens were denied the very liberties supposedly endangered by communism.
after 1948 little came of the truman administrations civil rights flurry.
state and local laws banning discrimination in employment and housing remained largely unenforced.
in 1952 the democrats showed how quickly the issue had faded by nominating for president adlai stevenson of illinois a candidate with little interest in civil rights with southern segregationist john sparkman as his running mate.
the following year hortense gabel director of the eminently respectable new york state committee against discrimination in housing reported that the shadow of fear hung over the civil rights movement.
given the persecution of dissent and the widespread sentiment that equated any criticism of american society with disloyalty a great many people are shying away from all activity in the civil liberties and civil rights fronts time would reveal that the waning of the civil rights impulse was only temporary.
but it came at a crucial moment the late 1940s and early 1950s when the united states experienced the greatest economic boom in its history.
the rise of an affluent society transformed american life opening new opportunities for tens of millions of white americans in rapidly expanding suburbs.
but it left blacks trapped in the declining rural areas of the south and urban ghettos of the north.
the contrast between new opportunities and widespread prosperity for whites and continued discrimination for blacks would soon inspire a civil rights revolution and with it yet another redefinition of american freedom.

1953 2010 c i n the last half of the twentieth century the united states experienced profound changes both at home and in its role in the larger world.
the cold war produced increasing american involvement in the affairs of other nations across the globe.
sometimes indirectly sometimes through direct military intervention the united states sought to prevent the further spread of communism and to ensure the existence of governments friendly to american strategic and economic interests.
the sudden and unexpected collapse of communism in the soviet union and eastern europe between 1989 and 1991 left the united states by far the worlds foremost military power.
at home these years witnessed far reaching changes in the nature of american society and a dramatic expansion in the rights of american citizens and their understandings of freedom.
on the surface the decade of the 1950s seemed uneventful.
it was a time of widespread affluence in the united states the beginning of an unprecedented economic expansion that lasted until the early 1970s.
millions of americans moved to the suburbs where they enjoyed access to an astonishing array of consumer goods that poured out of american factories including cars television sets and household appliances.
the postwar baby boom dramatically increased the population.
american understandings of freedom centered on the enjoyment of economic affluence and consumer choice within the context of traditional family life with women finding fulfillment within their suburban homes.
even during this time of consensus when sharp political divisions and economic strife seemed to have vanished from american life seeds of discontent sprouted.
a few artists and social commentators began to criticize the stifling atmosphere of conformity.
the supreme courts decision in 1954 outlawing racial segregation in public schools justified in part by the damage jim crow inflicted on the world standing of the united states in the cold war helped to inspire the revival of the struggle for racial justice.
the montgomery bus boycott of 1955 launched the southern phase of the civil rights movement which forced the entire country to rethink whether the united states could genuinely call itself the land of the free if it confined millions of americans to second class citizenship.
these seeds of protest flowered in the 1960s a decade of social conflict and of dramatic expansion of the boundaries of american freedom.
the civil rights revolution reached its climax with demonstrations throughout the south and the passage in 1964 and 1965 of national laws protecting blacks civil rights and restoring to them the right to vote in the south.
although the movement splintered thereafter and the nation failed to address adequately the economic plight of non whites trapped in decaying urban ghettos the 1960s ended with the structure of legal segregation having been dismantled.
the black movement inspired other aggrieved groups latinos indians homosexuals and women to press their own grievances and claim their own liberation their efforts further enlarged freedoms boundaries and helped to propel the idea of freedom into the most intimate areas of life.
under the leadership of chief justice earl warren the supreme court gave constitutional recognition to the rights revolution by the end of the decade both the meaning and the boundaries of freedom had expanded enormously.
at the same time the country became more and more deeply involved in the vietnam war.
in this cold war conflict american policymakers viewed the nationalist movement in vietnam led by homegrown communists as part of a worldwide conspiracy directed from moscow.
as the united states committed hundreds of thousands of soldiers to vietnam in the mid 1960s the foreign policy consensus disintegrated.
for the first time in american history college students took the lead in radical protest organizing massive protests against the war.
political disaffection helped to spawn the counterculture a youth rebellion against prevailing middleclass mores.
having brought twentieth century liberalism to its high point with his great society programs that sought to uplift the poor encourage the arts and provide medical care to the aged and needy president lyndon b johnson saw his party split over the war and his public support disintegrate.
known as a time of radical protest the 1960s also spawned a conservative backlash against the civil rights movement the sexual revolution public disorder and the expansion of federal power.
during the 1970s and 1980s businessmen antigovernment activists a christian right that sought to restore what it considered to be traditional moral values and cold warriors who desired a reinvigorated anticommunist crusade came together in an increasingly powerful conservative coalition.
their rise to power was hastened by the end of the postwar economic boom in 1973 and the inability of president jimmy carter to address the slump effectively.
in 1980 conservative ronald reagan was elected president ushering in the reagan revolution.
reagan drastically increased military spending cut funding for some social programs reduced taxes and attacked labor unions.
like franklin d roosevelt he consciously sought to redefine the meaning of freedom associating it with anticommunism free enterprise and reduced government intervention in the economy.
although he put into effect conservative economic policies reagan failed to halt the rights revolution that had begun in the 1960s.
throughout the 1980s and 1990s many conservatives lamented the fact that fewer and fewer women were embracing the traditional role of homemaker and that gays were gaining more and more recognition of their rights.
although conservatives launched a furious campaign to overturn the supreme courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion they failed to achieve success.
moreover thanks to a 1965 law that ended the national origins quotas for immigrants newcomers from asia and latin america poured into the united states setting off political battles over the countrys increasingly visible racial and ethnic diversity.
the abrupt end of the cold war between 1989 and 1991 left the united states as the worlds lone superpower.
this reinforced prevailing american understandings of freedom emphasizing political democracy free markets and unrestrained individual choice in personal matters.
during the 1990s americans became increasingly aware of the process of globalization the international flow of people investment goods and information across national boundaries.
some welcomed it as an expansion of economic freedom.
others worried that manufacturing jobs were leaving the united states for low wage areas abroad and that crucial decisions affecting peoples day to day lives were being made by institutions like the world bank and world trade organization over which no democratic control existed.
events at the dawn of the twenty first century revealed the extent and limitations of american power.
the attacks of september 11 2001 which killed some 3 000 persons highlighted the nations vulnerability at a time when terrorists like goods and money seemed able to cross national boundaries with ease.
in response president george w bush committed the united states to a war on terrorism a war without easily definable enemies a predictable timetable or a clear definition of victory.
the federal government claimed the power to arrest persons suspected of involvement with terrorism primarily individuals of middle eastern origin without charge and to hold them indefinitely.
the 2003 iraq war launched by the united states and great britain over the opposition of most members of the united nations suggested that in the post cold war world america no longer needed to build alliances or concern itself with world opinion.
although the invasion successfully overthrew the iraqi dictator sadaam hussein an anti american insurgency soon developed along with strife between iraqs shiite and sunni muslims.
by the end of 2006 the united states was bogged down in a seemingly interminable war which was soon becoming increasingly unpopular at home.
these events raised anew vital questions already debated many times in the countrys history.
what is the balance between civil liberties and security in times of crisis.
what are the economic conditions of freedom.
should the country consider itself a democracy or an empire.
should certain groups have their rights diminished because of their racial or ethnic origins.
the answers to these questions would go a long way toward defining the meaning and boundaries of american freedom in the twentyfirst century.

vice president richard nixon and soviet premier nikita khrushchev during the kitchen debate a discussion among other things of the meaning of freedom which took place at the 1959 american national exposition in moscow.
l i n 1958 during a thaw in the cold war the united states and the soviet union agreed to exchange national exhibitions in order to allow citizens of each superpower to become acquainted with life in the other.
the soviet exhibition unveiled in new york city in june 1959 featured factory machinery scientific advances and other illustrations of how communism had modernized a backward country.
the following month the american national exhibition opened in moscow.
a showcase of consumer goods and leisure equipment complete with stereo sets a movie theater home appliances and twenty two different cars the exhibit newsweek observed hoped to demonstrate the superiority of modern capitalism with its ideology of political and economic freedom yet the exhibits real message was not freedom but consumption or to be more precise the equating of the two.
when vice president richard nixon prepared for his trip to moscow to launch the exhibition a former ambassador to russia urged him to emphasize american values we are idealists they are materialists but the events of the opening day seemed to reverse these roles.
nixon devoted his address entitled what freedom means to us not to freedom of expression or differing forms of government but to the extraordinarily high standard of living in the united states with its 56 million cars and 50 million television sets.
the united states he declared had achieved what soviets could only dream of prosperity for all in a classless society the moscow exhibition became the site of a classic cold war confrontation over the meaning of freedom the kitchen debate between what were the main characteristics of the affluent society of the 1950s.
nixon and soviet premier nikita khrushchev.
twice during the first day nixon and khrushchev engaged in unscripted debate about the merits of capitalism and communism.
the first took place in the kitchen of a model suburban ranch house the second in a futuristic miracle kitchen complete with a mobile robot that swept the floors.
supposedly the home of an average steelworker the ranch house was the exhibitions centerpiece.
it represented nixon declared the mass enjoyment of american freedom within a suburban setting freedom of choice among products colors styles and prices.
it also implied a particular role for women.
throughout his exchanges with khrushchev nixon used the words women and housewives interchangeably.
pointing to the automatic floor sweeper the vice president remarked that in the united states you dont need a wife nixons decision to make a stand for american values in the setting of a suburban kitchen was a brilliant stroke.
nixon recognized that soft power the penetration across the globe of american goods and popular culture was an even more potent form of influence than military might.
indeed his stance reflected the triumph during the 1950s of a conception of freedom centered on economic abundance and consumer choice within the context of traditional family life a vision that seemed to offer far more opportunities for the pursuit of happiness to men than women.
in reply khrushchev ridiculed consumer culture and the american obsession with household gadgets.
dont you have a machine he quipped that puts food in the mouth and pushes it down many of the items on display he continued served no useful purpose yet in a sense the soviet leader conceded the debate when he predicted quite incorrectly that within seven years his country would surpass the united states in the production of consumer goods.
for if material abundance was a battleground in the cold war american victory was certain.
the golden age the end of world war ii was followed by what one scholar has called the golden age of capitalism a period of economic expansion stable prices low unemployment and rising standards of living that continued until 1973.
between 1946 and 1960 the american gross national product more than doubled and much of the benefit flowed to ordinary citizens in rising wages.
in every measurable way diet housing income education recreation most americans lived better than their parents and grandparents had.
by 1960 an estimated 60 percent of americans enjoyed what the government defined as a middle class standard of living.
the official poverty rate 30 percent of all families in 1950 had declined to 22 percent a decade later still to be sure representing more than one in five americans.
24 an af f luent society 1953 1960 the golden age numerous innovations came into widespread use in these years transforming americans daily lives.
they included television home air conditioning automatic dishwashers inexpensive long distance telephone calls and jet air travel.
services like electricity central heating and indoor plumbing that within living memory had been enjoyed only by the rich and solidly middle class now became features of common life.
a changing economy thousand 1996 dollars despite the economic recovery of western europe and japan after world war ii the united states remained the worlds predominant industrial power.
major industries like steel automobiles and aircraft dominated the domestic and world markets for their products.
like other wars the cold war fueled industrial production and promoted a redistribution of the nations population and economic resources.
the west especially the seattle area southern california and the rocky mountain states benefited enormously from government contracts for aircraft guided missiles and radar systems.
the south became the home of numerous military bases and government funded shipyards.
growth in the construction of aircraft engines and submarines counterbalanced the decline of new englands old textile and machinery industries many of which relocated in the south to take advantage of low cost nonunion labor.
in retrospect the 1950s appear as the last decade of the industrial age in the united states.
since then the american economy has shifted rapidly toward services education information finance and entertainment while employment in manufacturing has declined.
even during the 1950s the number of factory laborers fell slightly while clerical workers grew by nearly 25 percent and salaried employees in large corporate enterprises rose by 60 percent.
unions very success in raising wages inspired employers to mechanize more and more elements of manufacturing in order to reduce labor costs.
in 1956 for the first time in american history whitecollar workers outnumbered blue collar factory and manual laborers.
the long term trend toward fewer and larger farms continued.
during the 1950s the farm population fell from 23 million to 15 million yet agricultural production rose by 50 percent thanks to more efficient machinery the application of chemical fertilizers and insecfigure 24 1 real gross domestic product ticides increased use of irrigation to open land to cultivation per capita 1790 2000 in the west and the development of new crop strains.
the decade witnessed an acceleration of the transformation of southern life that had begun during world war ii.
new trac30 tors and harvesting machinery and a continuing shift from cotton production to less labor intensive soybean and poul20 try raising reduced the need for farm workers.
more than 3 million black and white hired hands and sharecroppers migrated out of the region.
the center of gravity of american farming shifted decisively to texas arizona and especially california.
the large corporate farms of california worked by latino and filipino migrant laborers poured forth an end0 1800 1820 1840 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 less supply of fruits and vegetables for the domestic and year world markets.
items like oranges and orange juice once luxuries became an essential part of the american diet.
what were the main characteristics of the affluent society of the 1950s.
levittown new york perhaps the nations most famous suburban community photographed in 1954.
eventually home owners would make individualized changes to their houses so today levittown looks far less uniform than when it was built.
a suburban nation the main engines of economic growth during the 1950s however were residential construction and spending on consumer goods.
the postwar baby boom discussed later and the shift of population from cities to suburbs created an enormous demand for housing television sets home appliances and cars.
by 1960 suburban residents of single family homes outnumbered urban dwellers and those living in rural areas.
today they outnumber both combined.
during the 1950s the number of houses in the united states doubled nearly all of them built in the suburbs that sprang up across the landscape.
the dream of home ownership the physical embodiment of hopes for a better life came within reach of the majority of americans.
william and alfred levitt who shortly after the war built the first levittown on 1 200 acres of potato fields on long island near new york city became the most famous suburban developers.
levittowns more than 10 000 houses were assembled quickly from prefabricated parts and priced well within the reach of most americans.
levittown was soon home to 40 000 people.
at the same time suburbs required a new form of shopping center the mall to which people drove in their cars.
in contrast to traditional mixed use city centers crowded with pedestrians malls existed solely for shopping and had virtually no public space.
the growth of the west but it was california that became the most prominent symbol of the postwar suburban boom.
between world war ii and 1975 more than 30 million americans moved west of the mississippi river.
one fifth of the population growth of the 1950s occurred in california this aerial view of westchester a community in los angeles california in 1949 illustrates how suburban sprawl spread over the landscape in the postwar era.

as cities spread out strips consisting of motels gas stations and nationally franchised businesses became common.
meanwhile older downtown business sections stagnated.
in 1963 it surpassed new york to become the nations most populous state.
most western growth took place in metropolitan areas not on farms.
but centerless western cities like houston phoenix and los angeles differed greatly from traditional urban centers in the east.
rather than consisting of downtown business districts linked to residential neighborhoods by public transportation western cities were decentralized clusters of single family homes and businesses united by a web of highways.
the los angeles basin the largest western suburban region had once had an extensive system of trains trolleys and buses.
but local governments dismantled these lines after world war ii and the state and federal governments replaced them with freeways for cars and trucks.
suburban growth spilled into farm regions like the san fernando and san bernardino valleys.
by one estimate one third of southern californias land area presumably not including mountains and deserts was paved over with roads and parking lots.
life centered around the car people drove to and from work and did their shopping at malls reachable only by driving.
in other sections of the country as well shopping shifted to suburban centers and old downtown business districts stagnated.
the spread of suburban homes created millions of new lawns.
today more land is cultivated in grass than any agricultural crop in the united states.
a consumer c u lt u r e the consumer is the key to our economy declared jack straus chairman of the board of macys new york citys leading department store.
our ability to consume is endless.
the luxuries of today are the necessities of tomorrow the roots of the consumer culture of the 1950s date back to the 1920s and even earlier.
but never before had affluence or consumerism been so widespread.
in a consumer culture the measure of freedom became the ability to gratify market desires.
modern society wrote clark what were the main characteristics of the affluent society of the 1950s.
in this 1950 photograph television sets move through an assembly line.
kerr president of the university of california may well have reduced freedom in the workplace by subjecting workers to stringent discipline on the job but it offered a far greater range of goods and services and therefore a greater scope of freedom in americans personal lives in a sense the 1950s represented the culmination of the long term trend in which consumerism replaced economic independence and democratic participation as central definitions of american freedom.
attitudes toward debt changed as well.
low interest rates and the spread of credit cards encouraged americans to borrow money to purchase consumer goods.
americans became comfortable living in never ending debt once seen as a loss of economic freedom.
consumer culture demonstrated the superiority of the american way of life to communism and virtually redefined the nations historic mission to extend freedom to other countries.
from coca cola to levis jeans american consumer goods once a status symbol for the rich in other countries were now marketed to customers around the globe.
the countrys most powerful weapon in the cold war insisted a reporter for house beautiful magazine was the freedom offered by washing machines and dishwashers vacuum cleaners automobiles and refrigerators the tv world thanks to television images of middle class life and advertisements for consumer goods blanketed the country.
by the end of the 1950s nearly nine of ten american families owned a tv set.
television replaced newspapers as the most common source of information about public events and tv watching became the nations leading leisure activity.
television changed americans eating habits the frozen tv dinner heated and eaten while watching a program went on sale in 1954 and it provided americans of all regions and backgrounds with a common cultural experience.
introduced in 1954 the frozen tv dinner was marketed in a package designed to look like a tv set.
within a year swanson had sold 25 million dinners.

with a few exceptions like the army mccarthy hearings mentioned in the previous chapter tv avoided controversy and projected a bland image of middle class life.
popular shows of the early 1950s such as the goldbergs with jewish immigrants as the central characters and the honeymooners in which jackie gleason played a bus driver featured working class families living in urban apartments.
by the end of the decade they had been replaced as the dominant programs by quiz shows westerns and comedies set in suburban homes like leave it to beaver and the adventures of ozzie and harriet.
television also became the most effective advertising medium ever invented.
to polish their image large corporations sponsored popular programs the general electric theater hosted for several years by ronald reagan alcoa presents and others.
tv ads aimed primarily at middle class suburban viewers conveyed images of the good life based on endless consumption.
a a 1959 cadillac eldorado biarritz an example of the design excesses of 1950s car makers.
behemoths like this which got less than fifteen miles to a gallon of gasoline depended on the availability of cheap fuel.
when gas prices rose in later decades consumers turned to smaller more fuel efficient foreign cars helping to bring about the decline and fall of the american automobile industry.
the golden age new ford the concept of freedom wrote one commentator in 1959 has become as familiar to us as an old hat or a new ford and a new ford or chrysler or chevrolet now seemed essential to the enjoyment of freedoms benefits.
along with a home and television set the car became part of what sociologists called the standard consumer package of the 1950s.
by 1960 80 percent of american families owned at least one car and 14 percent had two or more nearly all manufactured in the united states.
most were designed to go out of style within a year or two promoting further purchases.
auto manufacturers and oil companies vaulted to the top ranks of corporate america.
detroit and its environs were home to immense auto factories.
the river rouge complex had 62 000 employees willow run 42 000.
since the military increasingly needed high technology goods rather than the trucks and tanks that had rolled off assembly lines in world war ii the region around the great lakes lagged in defense contracts.
in the long term the continued funneling of federal dollars from the north and midwest to the sunbelt would prove devastating to the old industrial heartland.
but during the 1950s the booming automobile industry with its demand for steel rubber and other products assured the regions continued prosperity.

the result was an altered american landscape leading to the construction of motels drive in movie theaters and roadside eating establishments.
the first mcdonalds fast food restaurant opened in illinois in 1954.
within ten years having been franchised by california businessman ray kroc approximately 700 mcdonalds stands had been built which had sold over 400 million hamburgers.
the car symbolized the identification of freedom with individual mobility and private choice.
on the road americans were constantly reminded in advertising television shows and popular songs they truly enjoyed freedom.

jack goulds 1946 photograph of a hospital maternity ward captures the first year of the postwar baby boom.
the golden age the industrial jobs they had performed during the war.
as during most of american history women who worked outside the home remained concentrated in low salary nonunion jobs such as clerical sales and service labor rather than better paying manufacturing positions.
after a sharp postwar drop in female employment the number of women at work soon began to rise.
by 1955 it exceeded the level of world war ii.
but the nature and aims of womens work had changed.
the modern woman said look magazine worked part time to help support the familys middle class lifestyle not to help pull it out of poverty or to pursue personal fulfillment or an independent career.
working women in 1960 earned on average only 60 percent of the income of men.
despite the increasing numbers of wage earning women the suburban familys breadwinner was assumed to be male while the wife remained at home.
films tv shows and advertisements portrayed marriage as the most important goal of american women.
and during the 1950s men and women reaffirmed the virtues of family life.
they married younger at an average age of twenty two for men and twenty for women divorced less frequently than in the past and had more children 3 2 per family.
a baby boom that lasted into the mid 1960s followed the end of the war.
at a time of low immigration the american population rose by nearly 30 million almost 20 percent during the 1950s.
the increase arose mostly from the large number of births but it also reflected the fact that americans now lived longer than in the past thanks to the wide availability of miracle drugs like penicillin that had been developed during world war ii to combat bacterial infections.
the family also became a weapon in the cold war.
the ability of women to remain at home declared a government official separates us from the communist world where a high percentage of women worked.
to be sure what were the main characteristics of the affluent society of the 1950s.
the family life exalted during the 1950s differed from the patriarchal household of old.
it was a modernized relationship in which both partners reconciled family obligations with personal fulfillment through shared consumption leisure activities and sexual pleasure.
thanks to modern conveniences the personal freedom once associated with work could now be found at home.
frozen and prepared meals exulted one writer in 1953 offered housewives freedom from tedium space work and their own inexperience quite a change from the four freedoms of world war ii.
like other forms of dissent feminism seemed to have disappeared from american life or was widely dismissed as evidence of mental disorder.
prominent psychologists insisted that the unhappiness of individual women or even the desire to work for wages stemmed from a failure to accept the maternal instinct the independent woman declared the book modern woman the lost sex 1947 is a contradiction in terms the idea of domestic life as a refuge and of fulltime motherhood as a womans sphere had a long history in the united states.
but in the postwar suburbs where family life was physically separated from work relatives and the web of social organizations typical of cities it came close to realization.
a segregated advertisers during the 1950s sought to convey the idea that women would enjoy their roles as suburban homemakers as in this ad for a vacuum cleaner which equates housework with a game of golf.
landscape for millions of city dwellers the suburban utopia fulfilled the dream postponed by depression and war of home ownership and middle class incomes.
for beneficiaries of postwar prosperity in the words of a boston worker who made heroic sacrifices to move his family to the suburbs the home became the center of freedom the move to the suburbs also promoted americanization cutting residents off from urban ethnic communities and bringing them fully into the world of mass consumption.
but if the suburbs offered a new site for the enjoyment of american freedom they retained at least one familiar characteristic rigid racial boundaries.
suburbia has never been as uniform as either its celebrants or its critics claimed.
there are upper class suburbs working class suburbs industrial suburbs and suburban neighborhoods within city limits.
but if the class uniformity of suburbia has been exaggerated its racial uniformity was all too real.
as late as the 1990s nearly 90 percent of suburban whites lived in communities with non white populations of less than 1 percent the legacy of decisions by government real estate developers banks and residents.
during the postwar suburban boom federal agencies continued to insure mortgages that barred resale of houses to non whites thereby financing housing segregation.
even after the supreme court in 1948 declared such provisions legally unenforceable banks and private developers barred non whites from the suburbs and the government refused to subsidize their mortgages except in segregated enclaves.
in 1960 blacks represented less than 3 percent of the population of chicagos suburbs.

in 1990 his long island community with a population of 53 000 included 127 black residents.
public urban suburban builders sometimes openly advertised the fact that their communities excluded minorities.
this photograph was taken in southern california in 1948.
an aerial photograph of boulevard houses a low income housing project in brooklyn illustrates how public housing concentrated poor americans in structures separated from surrounding neighborhoods.
housing and renewal a housing act passed by congress in 1949 authorized the construction of more than 800 000 units of public housing in order to provide a decent home for every american family but the law set an extremely low ceiling on the income of residents a rule demanded by private contractors seeking to avoid competition from the government in building homes for the middle class.
this regulation limited housing projects to the very poor.
since white urban and suburban neighborhoods successfully opposed the construction of public housing it was increasingly confined to segregated neighborhoods in inner cities reinforcing the concentration of poverty in urban non white neighborhoods.
at the same time under programs of urban renewal cities demolished poor neighborhoods in city centers that occupied potentially valuable real estate.
in their place developers constructed what were the main characteristics of the affluent society of the 1950s.
retail centers and all white middle income housing complexes and states built urban public universities like wayne state in detroit and the university of illinois at chicago.
los angeles displaced a neighborhood of mixed ethnic groups in chavez ravine in order to build a stadium for the dodgers whose move in 1958 after sixty eight years in brooklyn seemed to symbolize the growing importance of california on the national scene.
white residents displaced by urban renewal often moved to the suburbs.
non whites unable to do so found housing in run down city neighborhoods.
the divided society suburbanization hardened the racial lines of division in american life.
between 1950 and 1970 about 7 million white americans left cities for the suburbs.
meanwhile nearly 3 million blacks moved from the south to the north greatly increasing the size of existing urban ghettos and creating entirely new ones.
and half a million puerto ricans mostly small coffee and tobacco farmers and agricultural laborers forced off the land when american sugar companies expanded their landholdings on the island moved to the mainland.
most ended up in new york citys east harlem until then an italian american community.
although set in a different part of new york the popular broadway musical west side story dramatized the tensions between puerto rican newcomers and longtime urban residents.
by the late 1960s more puerto ricans lived in new york city than san juan the islands capital.
the process of racial exclusion became self reinforcing.
non whites remained concentrated in manual and unskilled jobs the result of employment discrimination and their virtual exclusion from educational opportunities at public and private universities including those outside the south.
in 1950 only 12 percent of employed blacks held white collar positions compared with 45 percent of whites.
as the white population and industrial jobs fled the old city centers for the suburbs poorer blacks and latinos remained trapped in urban ghettos seen by many whites as places of crime poverty and welfare.
suburbanites for whom the home represented not only an emblem of freedom but the familys major investment became increasingly fearful that any non white presence would lower the quality of life and destroy property values.
life magazine quoted a white suburbanite discussing a prospective black neighbor hes probably a nice guy but every time i see him i see 2 000 drop off the value of my house residential segregation was reinforced by blockbusting a tactic of real estate brokers who circulated exaggerated warnings of an impending influx of non whites to persuade alarmed white residents to sell their homes hastily.
because of this practice some allwhite neighborhoods quickly became all minority enclaves rather than places where members of different races lived side by side.
freedom is equal housing too became a slogan in the campaign for residential integration.
but suburban home ownership long remained a white entitlement with the freedom of non whites to rent or purchase a home where they desired overridden by the claims of private property and freedom of association even as the old divisions between white ethnic americans faded in the suburban melting pot racial barriers in housing and therefore in public education and jobs were reinforced.

24 an af f luent society 1953 1960 the end the golden age of ideology cold war affluence coexisted with urban decay and racism the seeds from which protest would soon flower.
yet to many observers in the 1950s it seemed that the ills of american society had been solved.
in contrast to the turmoil of the 1930s and the immediate postwar years the 1950s was a placid time because of both widespread affluence and the narrowing of the boundaries of permissible political debate.
the boom and bust cycles mass unemployment and economic insecurity of the past seemed largely to have disappeared.
scholars celebrated the end of ideology and the triumph of a democratic capitalist consensus in which all americans except the maladjusted and fanatics shared the same liberal values of individualism respect for private property and belief in equal opportunity.
if problems remained their solutions required technical adjustments not structural change or aggressive political intervention.
as for religious differences the source of persistent tension in american history these were absorbed within a common judeo christian heritage a notion that became central to the cultural and political dialogue of the 1950s.
this newly invented tradition sought to demonstrate that catholics protestants and jews shared the same history and values and had all contributed to the evolution of american society.
in the era of mccarthyism ideological differences may have been un american but group pluralism reigned supreme with the free exercise of religion yet another way of differentiating the american way of life from life under communism.
the idea of a unified judeo christian tradition overlooked the long history of hostility among religious denominations.
but it reflected the decline of anti semitism and anti catholicism in the wake of world war ii as well as the ongoing secularization of american life.
during the 1950s a majority of americans the highest proportion in the nations history were affiliated with a church or synagogue.
evangelists like billy graham used radio and television to spread the message of christianity and anticommunism to millions.
but as will herberg argued in his influential book this postage stamp depicts four chaplains who perished during the sinking of an american ship during world war ii.
its original design listed their denominations catholic protestant and jewish.
when the stamp was issued in 1948 these words were omitted in keeping with the emphasis on the newly invented idea of a judeochristian tradition shared by all americans.
what were the main characteristics of the affluent society of the 1950s.
protestant catholic jew 1955 religion now had less to do with spiritual activities or sacred values than with personal identity group assimilation and the promotion of traditional morality.
in an affluent suburban society herberg argued the common religion was the american way of life a marriage of democratic values and economic prosperity in a phrase free enterprise selling free enterprise the economic content of cold war freedom increasingly came to focus on consumer capitalism or as it was now universally known free enterprise more than political democracy or freedom of speech which many allies of the united states outside western europe lacked an economic system resting on private ownership united the nations of the free world.
a week before his truman doctrine speech in a major address on economic policy the president reduced roosevelts four freedoms to three.
freedom of speech and worship remained but freedom from want and fear had been replaced by freedom of enterprise part and parcel said truman of the american way of life.
even more than during world war ii what one historian calls the selling of free enterprise became a major industry involving corporate advertising school programs newspaper editorials and civic activities.
convinced that ads represented a new weapon in the world wide fight for freedom the advertising council invoked cherished symbols like the statue of liberty and the liberty bell in the service of competitive free enterprise to be sure the free enterprise campaigners did not agree on every issue.
some businessmen believed that defending free enterprise required rolling back much of the power that labor unions had gained in the past decade dismantling new deal regulations and restricting the economic role of government.
representing what might be called businesss more liberal wing the advertising council in its american economic system ad campaign of 1949 reaffirmed labors right to collective bargaining and the importance of government business cooperation.
indeed despite talk of the glories of the free market government policies played a crucial role in the postwar boom.
the rapid expansion of the suburban middle class owed much to federal tax subsidies mortgage guarantees for home purchases dam and highway construction military contracts and benefits under the gi bill.
peoples capitalism free enterprise seemed an odd way of describing an economy in which a few large corporations dominated key sectors.
until well into the twentieth century most ordinary americans had been deeply suspicious of big business associating it with images of robber barons who manipulated politics suppressed economic competition and treated their workers unfairly.
americans wrote david lilienthal chairman of the atomic energy commission must abandon their traditional fear that concentrated economic power endangered our very liberties large scale production was not only necessary to fighting the cold war but it enhanced freedom by multiplying consumer goods.

a sharp jump in the number of individuals investing in wall street inspired talk of a new peoples capitalism in 1953 4 5 million americans only slightly more than in 1928 owned shares of stock.
by the mid 1960s the number had grown to 25 million.
in the face of widespread abundance who could deny that the capitalist marketplace embodied individual freedom or that poverty would soon be a thing of the past.
it was american freedom proclaimed life magazine by which and through which this amazing achievement of wealth and power was fashioned the libertarian conservatives during the 1950s a group of thinkers began the task of reviving conservatism and reclaiming the idea of freedom from liberals.
although largely ignored outside their own immediate circle they developed ideas that would define conservative thought for the next half century.
one was opposition to a strong national government an outlook that had been given new political life in conservatives bitter reaction against the new deal.
to these libertarian conservatives freedom meant individual autonomy limited government and unregulated capitalism.
these ideas had great appeal to conservative entrepreneurs especially in the rapidly growing south and west.
many businessmen who desired to pursue their economic fortunes free of government regulation high taxes and labor unions found intellectual reinforcement in the writings of the what were the main characteristics of the affluent society of the 1950s.
young economist milton friedman.
in 1962 friedman published capitalism and freedom which identified the free market as the necessary foundation for individual liberty.
this was not an uncommon idea during the cold war but friedman pushed it to extreme conclusions.
he called for turning over to the private sector virtually all government functions and the repeal of minimum wage laws the graduated income tax and the social security system.
friedman extended the idea of unrestricted free choice into virtually every realm of life.
government he insisted should seek to regulate neither the economy nor individual conduct.
the new conservatism friedman was indirectly criticizing not only liberalism but also the new conservatism a second strand of thought that became increasingly prominent in the 1950s.
convinced that the free world needed to arm itself morally and intellectually not just militarily for the battle against communism new conservatives like writers russell kirk and richard weaver insisted that toleration of difference a central belief of modern liberalism offered no substitute for the search for absolute truth.
weavers book ideas have consequences 1948 a rambling philosophical treatise that surprisingly became the most influential statement of this new traditionalism warned that the west was suffering from moral decay and called for a return to a civilization based on values grounded in the christian tradition and in timeless notions of good and evil.
the new conservatives understood freedom as first and foremost a moral condition.
it required a decision by independent men and women to lead virtuous lives or governmental action to force them to do so.
although they wanted government expelled from the economy new conservatives trusted it to regulate personal behavior to restore a christian morality they saw as growing weaker and weaker in american society.
here lay the origins of a division in conservative ranks that would persist into the twenty first century.
unrestrained individual choice and moral virtue are radically different starting points from which to discuss freedom.
was the purpose of conservatism one writer wondered to create the free man or the good man.
libertarian conservatives spoke the language of progress and personal autonomy the new conservatives emphasized tradition community and moral commitment.
the former believed that too many barriers existed to the pursuit of individual liberty.
the latter condemned an excess of individualism and a breakdown of common values.
fortunately for conservatives political unity often depends less on intellectual coherence than on the existence of a common foe.
and two powerful enemies became focal points for the conservative revival the soviet union abroad and the federal government at home.
anticommunism however did not clearly distinguish conservatives from liberals who also supported the cold war.
what made conservatism distinct was its antagonism to big government in america at least so long as it was controlled by liberals who conservatives believed tolerated or encouraged immorality.
republican control of the presidency did not lessen conservatives hostility to the federal government partly because they did not consider president eisenhower one of their own.
24 an af f luent society 1953 1960 the eisenhower era the eisenhower era ike dwight d eisenhowers popularity was evident at this appearance in baltimore during the 1952 presidential campaign.
and nixon dwight d eisenhower or ike as he was affectionately called emerged from world war ii as the military leader with the greatest political appeal partly because his public image of fatherly warmth set him apart from other successful generals like the arrogant douglas macarthur.
eisenhowers party affiliation was unknown.
in 1948 he voted for truman and he accepted trumans invitation to return to europe as supreme commander of nato forces.
both parties wanted him as their candidate in 1952.
but eisenhower became convinced that senator robert a taft of ohio a leading contender for the republican nomination would lead the united states back toward isolationism.
eisenhower entered the contest and won the republican nomination.
as his running mate eisenhower chose richard nixon of california a world war ii veteran who had made a name for himself by vigorous anticommunism.
in his first campaign for congress in 1946 nixon attacked his opponent as an advocate of state socialism he gained greater fame by his pursuit of alger hiss while a member of the house un american activities committee.
nixon won election to the u s senate in 1950 in a campaign in which he suggested that the democratic candidate congresswoman helen gahagan douglas had communist sympathies.
these tactics gave nixon a lifelong reputation for opportunism and dishonesty.
but nixon was also a shrewd politician who pioneered efforts to transform the republican partys image from defender of business to champion of the forgotten man the hardworking citizen burdened by heavy taxation and unresponsive government bureaucracies.
freedom for the individual for private enterprise he insisted had made america great.
in using populist language to promote free market economics nixon helped to lay the foundation for the triumph of conservatism a generation later.
the 1952 campaign almost as soon as he won the vice presidential nomination nixon ran into trouble over press reports that wealthy californians had created a private fund for his family.
eisenhower considered dropping him from the ticket.
but in an emotional nationally televised thirty minute address in which he drew attention to his ordinary upbringing war service and close knit family nixon denied the accusations.

his popularity howev10 er did not extend to his party.

during the 1950s voters at home and abroad seemed to find reassurance in selecting familiar elderly leaders to govern them.
at age sixty two eisenhower was one of the oldest men ever elected president.
but he seemed positively youthful compared with winston churchill who returned to office as prime minister of great britain at age seventy seven charles degaulle who assumed the presidency of france at sixty eight and konrad adenauer who served as chancellor of west germany from age seventy three until well into his eighties.
in retrospect eisenhowers presidency seems almost uneventful at least in domestic affairs an interlude between the bitter party battles of the truman administration and the social upheavals of the 1960s.
modern republicanism with a republican serving as president for the first time in twenty years the tone in washington changed.
wealthy businessmen dominated eisenhowers cabinet.
defense secretary charles wilson the former president of general motors made the widely publicized statement what is good for the country is good for general motors and vice versa a champion of the business community and a fiscal conservative ike worked to scale back government spending including the military budget.
but while right wing republicans saw his victory as an invitation to roll back the new deal eisenhower realized that such a course would be disastrous.
should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs he declared you would not hear of that party again in our political history eisenhower called his domestic agenda modern republicanism.
it aimed to sever his partys identification in the minds of many americans with herbert hoover the great depression and indifference to the economic conditions of ordinary citizens.
the core new deal programs not only remained in place but expanded.
in 1955 millions of agricultural workers became eligible for the first time for social security.

the eisenhower era reduce the size and scope of government.
despite the use of free enterprise as a weapon in the cold war the idea of a mixed economy in which the government played a major role in planning economic activity was widely accepted throughout the western world.
americas european allies like britain and france expanded their welfare states and nationalized key industries like steel shipbuilding and transportation that is the government bought them from private owners and operated and subsidized them.
the united states had a more limited welfare state than western europe and left the main pillars of the economy in private hands.
but it too used government spending to promote productivity and boost employment.
eisenhower presided over the largest public works enterprise in american history the building of the 41 000 mile interstate highway system.
as noted in the previous chapter cold war arguments especially the need to provide rapid exit routes from cities in the event of nuclear war justified this multibillion dollar project.
but automobile manufacturers oil companies suburban builders and construction unions had very practical reasons for supporting highway construction regardless of any soviet threat.
when the soviets launched sputnik the first artificial earth satellite in 1957 the administration responded with the national defense education act which for the first time offered direct federal funding to higher education.
all in all rather than dismantling the new deal eisenhowers modern republicanism consolidated and legitimized it.
by accepting its basic premises he ensured that its continuation no longer depended on democratic control of the presidency.
the social contract the 1950s also witnessed an easing of the labor conflict of the two previous decades.
the passage of the taft hartley act in 1947 discussed in the previous chapter had reduced labor militancy.
in 1955 the afl and cio merged to form a single organization representing 35 percent of all nonagricultural workers.
in leading industries labor and management hammered out what has been called a new social contract unions signed long term agreements that left decisions regarding capital investment plant location and output in managements hands and they agreed to try to prevent unauthorized wildcat strikes.
employers stopped trying to eliminate existing unions and granted wage increases and fringe benefits such as private pension plans health insurance and automatic adjustments to pay to reflect rises in the cost of living.
unionized workers shared fully in 1950s prosperity.
although the social contract did not apply to the majority of workers who did not belong to unions it did bring benefits to those who labored in nonunion jobs.
for example trade unions in the 1950s and 1960s were able to use their political power to win a steady increase in the minimum wage which was earned mostly by nonunion workers at the bottom of the employment pyramid.
but these spillover effects were limited.
the majority of workers did not enjoy anything close to the wages benefits and job security of unionized workers in such industries as automobiles and steel.
indeed nonunion employers continued to fight vehemently against labor organization and groups like the national association of manufacturers how were the 1950s a period of consensus in both domestic policies and foreign affairs.
still viewed unions as an unacceptable infringement on the power of employers.
some firms continued to shift jobs to the less unionized suburbs and south.
by the end of the 1950s the social contract was weakening.
in 1959 the steel industry sought to tighten work rules and limit wage increases in an attempt to boost profits battered by a recession that hit two years earlier.
the plan sparked a strike of 500 000 steelworkers which successfully beat back the proposed changes.
massive retaliation soon after he entered office eisenhower approved an armistice that ended fighting in korea.
but this failed to ease international tensions.
ike took office at a time when the cold war had entered an extremely dangerous phase.
in 1952 the united states exploded the first hydrogen bomb a weapon far more powerful than those that had devastated hiroshima and nagasaki.
the following year the soviets matched this achievement.
both sides feverishly developed long range bombers capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction around the world.
a professional soldier ike hated war which he viewed as a tragic waste.
every gun that is made he said in 1953 every warship launched.
signifies a theft from those who hunger and are not fed but his secretary of state john foster dulles was a grim cold warrior.
in 1954 dulles announced an updated version of the doctrine of containment.
massive retaliation as it was called declared that any soviet attack on an american ally would be countered by a nuclear assault on the soviet union itself.
in some ways this reliance on the nuclear threat was a way to enable the budget conscious eisenhower to reduce spending on conventional military forces.
during his presidency the size of the armed services fell by nearly half.
but the number of american nuclear warheads rose from 1 000 in 1953 to 18 000 in 1960.
massive retaliation ran the risk that any small conflict or even a miscalculation could escalate into a war that would destroy both the united states and the soviet union.
critics called the doctrine brinksmanship warning of the danger of dulless apparent willingness to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war.
the reality that all out war would result in mutual assured destruction or mad in military shorthand did succeed in making both great powers cautious in their direct dealings with one another.
but it also inspired widespread fear of impending nuclear war.
government programs encouraging americans to build bomb shelters in their backyards and school drills that trained children to hide under their desks in the event of an atomic attack aimed to convince americans that nuclear war was survivable.
but these measures only increased the atmosphere of fear.
ike and the russians in his inaugural address eisenhower repeated the familiar cold war formula freedom is pitted against slavery lightness against dark but the an advertisement for a government film explaining to children how to survive a nuclear attack by hiding under their desks.
thousands of schools instituted these duck and cover drills.
they were meant to reduce americans fear of nuclear war.

end of the korean war and the death of stalin both of which occurred in 1953 convinced him that rather than being blind zealots the soviets were reasonable and could be dealt with in conventional diplomatic terms.
in 1955 ike met in geneva switzerland with nikita khrushchev the new soviet leader at the first summit conference since potsdam a decade earlier.
the following year khrushchev delivered a speech to the communist party congress in moscow that detailed stalins crimes including purges of political opponents numbering in the millions.
the revelations created a crisis of belief among communists throughout the world.
in the united states three quarters of the remaining communist party members abandoned the organization realizing that they had been blind to the nature of stalins rule.
khrushchevs call in the same 1956 speech for peaceful coexistence with the united states raised the possibility of an easing of the cold war.
the thaw was abruptly shaken that fall however when soviet troops put down an anticommunist uprising in hungary.
many conservative republicans had urged eastern europeans to resist communist rule and secretary of state dulles himself had declared liberation rather than containment to be the goal of american policy.
but eisenhower refused to extend aid to the hungarian rebels an indication that he believed it impossible to roll back soviet domination of eastern europe.
in 1958 the two superpowers agreed to a voluntary halt to the testing of nuclear weapons.
the pause lasted until 1961.
it had been demanded by the national committee for a sane nuclear policy which publicized the danger to public health posed by radioactive fallout from nuclear tests.
in 1959 khrushchev toured the united states and had a friendly meeting with eisenhower at camp david.
but the spirit of cooperation ended abruptly in 1960 when the soviets shot down an american u 2 spy plane how were the 1950s a period of consensus in both domestic policies and foreign affairs.

eisenhower first denied that the plane had been involved in espionage and refused to apologize even after the russians produced the captured pilot.
the incident torpedoed another planned summit meeting.
the emergence of the third world even as europe where the cold war began settled into what appeared to be a permanent division between a communist east and a capitalist west an intense rivalry which sometimes took a military form persisted in what came to be called the third world.
the term was invented to describe developing countries aligned with neither of the two cold war powers and desirous of finding their own model of development between soviet centralized economic planning and free market capitalism.
the bandung conference which brought leaders of twenty nine asian and african nations together in indonesia in 1955 seemed to announce the emergence of a new force in global affairs representing a majority of the worlds population.
but none of these countries could avoid being strongly affected by the political military and economic contest of the cold war.

it created power vacuums in the former colonies into which americans feared communists would move.
the soviet union strongly supported the dissolution of europes overseas empires and communists participated in movements for colonial independence.
many noncommunist leaders like jawaharlal nehru of india and kwame nkrumah of ghana saw socialism of one sort or another as the best route to achieving economic independence and narrowing the social inequalities fostered by imperialism.
most of the new third world nations resisted alignment with either major power bloc hoping to remain neutral in the cold war.
on the other hand many nationalists sincerely admired the united states and indeed saw the american struggle for independence as a model for their own struggles.
ho chi minh the communist leader of the vietnamese movement against rule by france modeled his 1945 proclamation of nationhood on the american declaration of independence.
he even requested that president truman establish a protectorate over vietnam to guarantee its independence.

cold war in the third world by the end of the 1950s the division of europe appeared to be set in stone.
much of the focus of the cold war shifted to the third world.
the policy of containment easily slid over into opposition to any government whether communist or not that seemed to threaten american strategic or economic interests.
jacobo arbenz guzmn in guatemala and mohammed mossadegh in iran were elected homegrown nationalists not agents of moscow.
but they were determined to reduce foreign corporations control over their countries economies.
arbenz embarked on a sweeping landreform policy that threatened the domination of guatemalas economy by the american owned united fruit company.

but the staunchly anticommunist southern leader ngo dinh diem urged on by the united states refused to hold elections which would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for ho chi minhs communists.
diems close ties to wealthy catholic families in predominantly buddhist south vietnam and to landlords in a society dominated by small farmers who had been promised land by ho alienated an increasing number of his subjects.
american aid poured into south vietnam in order to bolster the diem regime.
by the time eisenhower left office diem nevertheless faced a full scale guerrilla revolt by the communist led national liberation front.
events in guatemala iran and vietnam considered great successes at the time by american policymakers cast a long shadow over american foreign relations.
little by little the united states was becoming accustomed to intervention both open and secret in far flung corners of the world.
despite the cold war rhetoric of freedom american leaders seemed more comfortable dealing with reliable military regimes than democratic governments.

social critics of the 1950s claimed that americans had become organization men too conformist to lead independent lives.
society the eisenhower era and its critics the fatherly eisenhower seemed the perfect leader for the placid society of the 1950s.
consensus was the dominant ideal in an era in which mccarthyism had defined criticism of the social and economic order as disloyalty and most americans located the enjoyment of freedom in private pleasures rather than the public sphere.
with the mainstreams of both parties embracing the cold war political debate took place within extremely narrow limits.
even life magazine commented that american freedom might be in greater danger from disuse than from communist subversion.
dissenting voices could be heard.
some intellectuals wondered whether the celebration of affluence and the either or mentality of the cold war obscured the extent to which the united states itself fell short of the ideal of freedom.
in 1957 political scientist hans j morgenthau noted that free enterprise had created new accumulations of power as dangerous to the freedom of the individual as the power of the government had ever been more radical in pointing to the problem of unequal power in american society the sociologist c wright mills challenged the self satisfied vision of democratic pluralism that dominated mainstream social science in the 1950s.
mills wrote of a power elite an interlocking directorate of corporate leaders politicians and military men whose domination of government and society had made political democracy obsolete.
freedom mills insisted meant more than the chance to do as one pleases it rested on the ability to formulate the available choices and this most americans were effectively denied.
even as the government and media portrayed the united states as a beacon of liberty locked in a titanic struggle with its opposite one strand of social analysis in the 1950s contended that americans did not enjoy genuine freedom.
these critics identified as the culprit not the unequal structure of power criticized by mills but the modern age itself with its psychological and cultural discontents.
modern mass society some writers worried inevitably produced loneliness and anxiety causing mankind to yearn for stability and authority not freedom.
in the lonely crowd 1950 the decades most influential work of social analysis the sociologist david riesman described americans as other directed conformists who lacked the inner resources to lead truly independent lives.
other social critics charged that corporate bureaucracies had transformed employees into organization men incapable of independent thought.
some commentators feared that the russians had demonstrated a greater ability to sacrifice for common public goals than americans.

rebels without a cause the social critics did not offer a political alternative or have any real impact on the parties or government.
nor did other stirrings of dissent.
with teenagers a growing part of the population thanks to the baby boom the emergence of a popular culture geared to the emerging youth market suggested that significant generational tensions lay beneath the bland surface of 1950s life.
j d salingers 1951 novel catcher in the rye and the 1955 films blackboard jungle and rebel without a cause the latter starring james dean as an aimlessly rebellious youth highlighted the alienation of at least some young people from the world of adult respectability.
these works helped to spur a mid 1950s panic about juvenile delinquency time magazine devoted a cover story to teenagers on the rampage and a senate committee held hearings in 1954 on whether violent comic books caused criminal behavior among young people.
one witness even criticized superman comics for arousing violent emotions among its readers.
to head off federal regulation publishers like movie producers in the 1920s adopted a code of conduct for their industry that strictly limited the portrayal of crime and violence in comic books.
cultural life during the 1950s seemed far more daring than politics.
indeed many adults found the emergence of a mass marketed teenage culture that rejected middle class norms more alarming than the actual increase in juvenile arrests.
teenagers wore leather jackets and danced to rock androll music that brought the hard driving rhythms and sexually provocative movements of black musicians and dancers to enthusiastic young white audiences.
they made elvis presley a rock and roll singer with an openly sexual performance style an immensely popular entertainment celebrity.
challenges of various kinds also arose to the family centered image of personal fulfillment.

a more immediate challenge to the complacency of the 1950s arose from the twentieth centurys greatest citizens movement the black struggle for equality.
what were the major thrusts of the civil rights movement in this period.
origins of the movement today with the birthday of martin luther king jr a national holiday and the struggles of montgomery little rock birmingham and selma celebrated as heroic episodes in the history of freedom it is easy to forget that at the time the civil rights revolution came as a great surprise.
looking back its causes seem clear the destabilization of the racial system during world war ii the mass migration out of the segregated south that made black voters an increasingly important part of the democratic party coalition and the cold war and rise of independent states in the third world both of which made the gap between americas rhetoric and its racial reality an international embarrassment.
yet few predicted the emergence of the southern mass movement for civil rights.
in an american dilemma 1944 gunnar myrdal had suggested that the challenge to racial inequality would arise in the north where blacks had far greater opportunities for political organization than in the south.
with blacks traditional allies on the left decimated by mccarthyism most union leaders unwilling to challenge racial inequalities within their own ranks and the naacp concentrating on court battles new constituencies and new tactics were sorely needed.
the movement found in the southern black church the organizing power for a militant nonviolent assault on segregation.
the united states in the 1950s was still a segregated unequal society.
half of the nations black families lived in poverty.
because of labor contracts that linked promotions and firings to seniority non white workers who had joined the industrial labor force later than whites lost their jobs first in times of economic downturn.
in the south evidence of jim crow abounded in separate public institutions and the signs white and colored at entrances to buildings train carriages drinking fountains restrooms and the like.
in the north and west the law did not require segregation but custom barred blacks from many colleges hotels and restaurants and from most suburban housing.
las vegas nevada for example was as strictly segregated as any southern city.
hotels and casinos did not admit blacks except in the most menial jobs.
lena horne sammy davis jr louis armstrong and other black entertainers played the hotel casinos on the strip but could not stay as guests where they performed.
in 1950 seventeen southern and border states and washington d c had laws requiring the racial segregation of public schools and several others permitted local districts to impose it.
around 40 percent of the nations 28 million schoolchildren studied in legally segregated schools and millions more attended classes in northern communities where housing patterns and school district lines created de facto segregation separation in fact if not in law.
few white americans felt any urgency about confronting racial inequality.

they won an important victory in 1946 in the case of mendez v westminster when the california supreme court ordered the schools of orange county desegregated.
in response the state legislature repealed all school laws requiring racial segregation.
the governor who signed the measure earl warren had presided over the internment of japanese americans during world war ii as the states attorney general.
after the war he became convinced that racial inequality had no place in american life.
when chief justice fred vinson died in 1953 eisenhower appointed earl warren to replace him.
warren would play the key role in deciding brown v board of education the momentous case that outlawed school segregation.
for years the naacp under the leadership of attorney thurgood marshall had pressed legal challenges to the separate but equal doctrine laid down by the court in 1896 in plessy v ferguson see chapter 17.
at first the naacp sought to gain admission to white institutions of higher learning for which no black equivalent existed.
in 1938 the supreme court ordered the university of missouri law school to admit lloyd gaines a black student because the state had no such school for blacks.
missouri responded by setting up a segregated law school satisfying the courts.
but in 1950 the supreme court unanimously ordered heman sweatt admitted to the university of texas law school even though the state had established a school for him in a basement containing three classrooms and no library.
there was no way the court declared that this hastily constructed law school could be equal to the prestigious all white institution.
the brown case marshall now launched a frontal assault on segregation itself.
he brought the naacps support to local cases that had arisen when black parents challenged unfair school policies.
to do so required remarkable courage.
in clarendon county south carolina levi pearson a black farmer who what were the major thrusts of the civil rights movement in this period.
brought a lawsuit on behalf of his children saw his house burned to the ground.
the clarendon case attacked not segregation itself but the unequal funding of schools.
the local school board spent 179 per white child and 43 per black and unlike white pupils black children attended class in buildings with no running water or indoor toilets and were not provided with buses to transport them to classes.
five such cases from four states and the district of columbia were combined in a single appeal that reached the supreme court late in 1952.
when cases are united they are listed alphabetically and the first case gives the entire decision its name.
in this instance the first case arose from a state outside the old confederacy.
oliver brown went to court because his daughter a third grader was forced to walk across dangerous railroad tracks each morning rather than being allowed to attend a nearby school restricted to whites.
his lawsuit became brown v board of education of topeka kansas.
thurgood marshall decided that the time had come to attack not the unfair applications of the separate but equal principle but the doctrine itself.
even with the same funding and facilities he insisted segregation was inherently unequal since it stigmatized one group of citizens as unfit to associate with others.
drawing on studies by new york psychologists kenneth and mamie clark marshall argued that segregation did lifelong damage to black children undermining their self esteem.
in its legal brief the eisenhower administration did not directly support marshalls position but it urged the justices to consider the problem of racial discrimination.
in the context of the present world struggle between freedom and tyranny other peoples it noted cannot understand how such a practice can exist in a country which professes to be a staunch supporter of freedom justice and democracy the new chief justice earl warren managed to create unanimity on a divided court some of whose members disliked segregation but feared that a decision to outlaw it would spark widespread violence.
on may 17 1954 warren himself read aloud the decision only eleven pages long.
segregation in public education he concluded violated the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.
in the field of education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.
separate educational facilities are inherently unequal the black press hailed the brown decision as a second emancipation proclamation and like its predecessor it was in many ways a limited document.
the decision did not address segregation in institutions other than public schools or ban all racial classifications in the law such as statutes prohibiting interracial marriage.
it did not address the de facto school segregation of the north which rested on housing patterns rather than state law.
it did not order immediate implementation but instead called for hearings as to how segregated schooling should be dismantled.
but brown marked the emergence of the warren court as an active agent of social change.
and it inspired a wave of optimism that discrimination would soon disappear.

but the decision did ensure that when the movement resumed after waning in the early 1950s it would have the backing of the federal courts.
mass action against jim crow soon reappeared.
on december 1 1955 rosa parks a black tailors assistant who had just completed her days work in a montgomery alabama department store refused to surrender her seat on a city bus to a white rider as required by local law.
parkss arrest sparked a year long bus boycott the beginning of the mass phase of the civil rights movement in the south.
within a decade the civil rights revolution had overturned the structure of legal segregation and regained the right to vote for black southerners.
in 2000 time magazine named rosa parks one of the 100 most significant persons of the twentieth century.
parks is widely remembered today as a seamstress with tired feet a symbol of ordinary blacks determination to resist the daily injustices and indignities of the jim crow south.
in fact her life makes clear that the civil rights revolution built on earlier struggles.
parks was a veteran of black politics.
during the 1930s she took part in meetings protesting the conviction of the scottsboro boys.
she served for many years as secretary to e d nixon the local leader of the naacp.
in 1943 she tried to register to vote only to be turned away because she supposedly failed a literacy test.
after two more attempts parks succeeded in becoming one of the few blacks in montgomery able to cast a ballot.
in 1954 she attended a training session for political activists at the highlander school in tennessee a meeting ground for labor and civil rights radicals.
no one knows exactly why parks decided not to give up her seat that day.
perhaps it was because an all white jury in mississippi had just acquitted the murderers of emmett till a black teenager who had allegedly whistled at a white woman.
jo ann robinson a professor at the all black alabama state university had been calling for a boycott of public transportation since 1954.
when news of parkss arrest spread hundreds of blacks gathered in a local church and vowed to refuse to ride the buses until accorded equal treatment.
for 381 days despite legal harassment and occasional violence black maids janitors teachers and students walked to their destinations or rode an informal network of taxis.
finally in november 1956 the supreme court ruled segregation in public transportation unconstitutional.
the boycott ended in triumph.
the daybreak of freedom the montgomery bus boycott marked a turning point in postwar american history.
it launched the movement for racial justice as a nonviolent crusade based in the black churches of the south.
it gained the support of northern liberals and focused unprecedented and unwelcome international attention on the countrys racial policies.
and it marked the emergence of twenty six year old martin luther king jr who had recently arrived in montgomery to become pastor of a baptist church as the movements national symbol.
on the night of the first protest meeting kings call to action electrified the audience we the disinherited of this land we who have been oppressed so long are tired of going through the long night of captivity.
and now we are reaching out for the daybreak of freedom and justice and equality what were the major thrusts of the civil rights movement in this period.
from the beginning the language of freedom pervaded the black movement.
it resonated in the speeches of civil rights leaders and in the hand lettered placards of the struggles foot soldiers.
on the day of rosa parkss court appearance in december 1955 even before the bus boycott had officially been announced a torn piece of cardboard appeared on a bus shelter in montgomerys court square advising passengers dont ride the buses today.
dont ride it for freedom during the summer of 1964 when civil rights activists established freedom schools for black children across mississippi lessons began with students being asked to define the word.
some gave specific answers going to public libraries some more abstract standing up for your rights.
some insisted that freedom meant legal equality others saw it as liberation from years of deference to and fear of whites.
freedom of the mind wrote one was the greatest freedom of all.
for adults as well freedom had many meanings.
it meant enjoying the political rights and economic opportunities taken for granted by whites.
it required eradicating historic wrongs such as segregation disenfranchisement confinement to low wage jobs and the ever present threat of violence.
it meant the right to be served at lunch counters and downtown department stores central locations in the consumer culture and to be addressed as mr miss and mrs rather than boy and auntie the leadership of king in kings soaring oratory the protesters understandings of freedom fused into a coherent whole.
for the title of his first book relating the boycotts history king chose the title stride toward freedom.
his most celebrated oration the i have a dream speech of 1963 began by invoking the unfulfilled promise of emancipation one hundred years later the negro still is not free and closed with a cry borrowed from a black spiritual free at last.
free at last.
thank god almighty we are free at last a master at appealing to the deep sense of injustice among blacks and to the conscience of white america king presented the case for black rights in a vocabulary that merged the black experience with that of the nation.
having studied the writings on peaceful civil disobedience of henry david thoreau and mohandas mahatma gandhi as well as the nonviolent protests the congress of racial equality had organized in the 1940s king outlined a philosophy of struggle in which evil must be met with good hate with christian love and violence with peaceful demands for change.
there will be no white persons pulled out of their homes and taken out to some distant road and lynched he declared in his speech at the launching of the montgomery bus boycott.
echoing christian themes derived from his training in the black church kings speeches resonated deeply in both black communities and the broader culture.
he repeatedly invoked the bible to preach justice and forgiveness even toward those who desire to deprive you of freedom like frederick douglass before him king appealed to white america by stressing the protesters love of country and devotion to national values.
the daybreak of freedom king made clear meant a new dawn for the whole of american society.

resistance buoyed by success in montgomery king in 1956 took the lead in forming the southern christian leadership conference a coalition of black ministers and civil rights activists to press for desegregation.
but despite the movements success in popular mobilization the fact that montgomerys city fathers agreed to the boycotts demands only after a supreme court ruling indicated that without national backing local action might not be enough to overturn jim crow.
the white souths refusal to accept the brown decision reinforced the conviction that black citizens could not gain their constitutional rights without washingtons intervention.
this was not immediately forthcoming.
when the supreme court finally issued its implementation ruling in 1955 the justices declared that desegregation should proceed with all deliberate speed this vague formulation unintentionally encouraged a campaign of massive resistance that paralyzed civil rights progress in much of the south.
in 1956 82 of 106 southern congressmen and every southern senator except lyndon b johnson of texas and albert gore and estes kefauver of tennessee signed a southern manifesto denouncing the brown decision as a clear abuse of judicial power and calling for resistance to forced integration by any lawful means state after state passed laws to block desegregation.

there was a large crowd of people outside the school she later recalled.
they were throwing things and shouting but rockwell intent on focusing on the child presents the mob only through their graffiti and tomatoes thrown against the wall and does not show the faces of the marshals.
because of the decision to send her to the formerly white school bridgess father lost his job and her grandparents who worked as sharecroppers in mississippi were evicted from their land.
in 2001 president bill clinton presented her with the presidential citizens medal.
question 1.
what does the painting suggest about the relationship of federal power and individual freedom.
do you think that rockwells decision to show the mob only indirectly makes the painting more or less powerful.
24 an af f luent society 1953 1960 the freedom movement ordered to desegregate and offering funds to enable white pupils but not black to attend private institutions.
prince edward county virginia shut its schools entirely in 1959 not until 1964 did the supreme court order them reopened.
many states adopted freedom of choice plans that allowed white students to opt out of integrated schools.
as a symbol of defiance georgias legislature incorporated the confederate battle flag into its state flag in 1956 and alabama and south carolina soon began flying the battle flag over their state capitol buildings.
eisenhower and civil rights the federal government tried to remain aloof from the black struggle.
thanks to the efforts of senate majority leader lyndon b johnson who hoped to win liberal support for a run for president in 1960 congress in 1957 passed the first national civil rights law since reconstruction.
it targeted the denial of black voting rights in the south but with weak enforcement provisions it added few voters to the rolls.
president eisenhower failed to provide moral leadership.
he called for americans to abide by the law but he made it clear that he found the whole civil rights issue distasteful.
he privately told aides that he disagreed with the supreme courts reasoning.
ike failed to act in 1956 when a federal court ordered that autherine lucy be admitted to the university of alabama a mob prevented her from registering and the board of trustees expelled her.
the university remained all white into the 1960s.
in 1957 however after governor orval faubus of arkansas used the national guard to prevent the court ordered integration of little rocks central high school eisenhower dispatched federal troops to the city.
in the face of a howling mob soldiers of the 101st airborne division escorted federal troops at little rocks central high school enforcing a court order for integration in 1957.
what were the major thrusts of the civil rights movement in this period.
nine black children into the school.
events in little rock showed that in the last instance the federal government would not allow the flagrant violation of court orders.
but because of massive resistance the pace of the movement slowed in the final years of the 1950s.
when eisenhower left office fewer than 2 percent of black students attended desegregated schools in the states of the old confederacy.
the world views the united states ever since the beginning of the cold war american leaders had worried about the impact of segregation on the countrys international reputation.
president truman had promoted his civil rights initiative in part by reminding americans that they could not afford to ignore what the world thinks of our record the state department filed a brief in the brown case noting the damage segregation was doing to the countrys image overseas.
foreign nations and colonies paid close attention to the unfolding of the american civil rights movement.
the global reaction to the brown decision was overwhelmingly positive.
whites and blacks in the united states on the same school benches proclaimed a newspaper in senegal west africa.
but the slow pace of change led to criticism that embarrassed american diplomats seeking to win the loyalty of people in the non white world.
in a public forum in india the american ambassador was peppered with questions about american race relations.
was it true that the haitian ambassador to the united states had to live in a black ghetto in washington.
why did no black person hold a high public office.
of course the soviet union played up american race relations as part of the global battle for hearts and minds of men that was a key part of the cold war.
the election of 1960 kennedy and nixon the presidential campaign of 1960 turned out to be one of the closest in american history.
republicans chose vice president richard nixon as their candidate to succeed eisenhower.
democrats nominated john f kennedy a senator from massachusetts and a roman catholic whose father a millionaire irish american businessman had served as ambassador to great britain during the 1930s.
kennedys chief rivals for the nomination were hubert humphrey leader of the partys liberal wing and lyndon b johnson of texas the senate majority leader who accepted kennedys offer to run for vice president.
the atmosphere of tolerance promoted by world war ii had weakened traditional anti catholicism.
but as recently as 1949 paul blanshards american freedom and catholic power which accused the church of being antidemocratic morally repressive and essentially un american had become a national best seller.
many protestants remained reluctant to vote for a catholic fearing that kennedy would be required to support church doctrine on controversial public issues or in a more extreme version take orders from the pope.
kennedy addressed the question directly.
i do not speak for my church on public matters he insisted and the church does ch.
24 an af f luent society 1953 1960 the 1960 presidential campaign produced a flood of anti catholic propaganda.
kennedys victory the first for an american catholic was a major step in the decline of this long standing prejudice.
the election of 1960 not speak for me his defeat of humphrey in the democratic primary in overwhelmingly protestant west virginia put the issue of his religion to rest.
at age forty three kennedy became the youngest major party nominee for president in the nations history.
both kennedy and nixon were ardent cold warriors.
but kennedy pointed to soviet success in putting sputnik the first earth satellite into orbit and subsequently testing the first intercontinental ballistic missile icbm as evidence that the united states had lost the sense of national purpose necessary to fight the cold war.
he warned that republicans had allowed a missile gap to develop in which the soviets had achieved technological and military superiority over the united the presidential states.
in fact as both kennedy and nixon well knew election of 1960 american economic and military capacity far exceeded that of the soviets.
but the charge persuaded many americans that the time had come for new leadership.
the 4 5 stylishness of kennedys wife jacqueline which stood in sharp contrast to the more dowdy public appearance of mamie eisenhower and pat nixon reinforced the impres4 sion that kennedy would conduct a more youthful vigor16 27 13 8 12 ous presidency.
in the first televised debate between presidential candi11 7 1 dates judging by viewer response the handsome kennedy 8 6 5 12 bested nixon who was suffering from a cold and appeared tired and nervous.
those who heard the encounter on the radio thought nixon had won but on tv image counted for more than substance.
in november kennedy eked out electoral vote popular vote a narrow victory winning the popular vote by only party candidate share share democrat kennedy 303 56 34 227 096 49 7 120 000 out of 69 million votes cast and republicans republican nixon 219 41 34 107 646 49 6 charged benefiting from a fraudulent vote count by the independent byrd 15 3 501 643 0 7 notoriously corrupt chicago democratic machine.
what was the significance of the presidential election of 1960.
the end of the 1950s in january 1961 shortly before leaving office eisenhower delivered a televised farewell address modeled to some extent on george washingtons address of 1796.
knowing that the missile gap was a myth ike warned against the drumbeat of calls for a new military buildup.
he urged americans to think about the dangerous power of what he called the military industrial complex the conjunction of an immense military establishment with a permanent arms industry with an influence felt in every office in the land.
we must never let the weight of this combination he advised his countrymen endanger our liberties or democratic processes few americans shared ikes concern far more saw the alliance of the defense department and private industry as a source of jobs and national security rather than a threat to democracy.
a few years later however with the united states locked in an increasingly unpopular war eisenhowers warning would come to seem prophetic.
by then other underpinnings of 1950s life were also in disarray.
the tens of millions of cars that made suburban life possible were spewing toxic lead an additive to make gasoline more efficient into the atmosphere.
penned in to the east by mountains that kept automobile emissions from being dispersed by the wind los angeles had become synonymous with smog a type of air pollution produced by cars.
chlorofluorocarbons used in air conditioners deodorants and aerosol hair sprays were releasing chemicals into the atmosphere that damaged the ozone layer producing global warming and an increase in skin cancer.
both leaded gasoline and chlorofluorocarbons had been invented by general motors research scientist thomas midgley.
he had more impact on the atmosphere writes one historian than any other single organism in the history of the world.
the chemical insecticides that enabled agricultural conglomerates to produce the countrys remarkable abundance of food were poisoning farm workers a photograph of john f kennedy and his wife jacqueline strolling along the pier at hyannisport massachusetts illustrates their youthful appeal.
residents of los angeles don gas masks at a 1954 luncheon to protest the governments failure to combat the air pollution or smog that hung over the city.
24 an af f luent society 1953 1960 suggested reading andy warhols 1962 painting green cocacolor bottles uses one of the most famous international symbols of american consumerism both to celebrate abundance and to question the sterile uniformity of 1950s consumer culture.
asked why he painted coke bottles he replied that artists paint what they see.
previous artists painted landscapes and city buildings he painted things present in american life wherever one looked.

l o n the afternoon of february 1 1960 four students from north carolina agricultural and technical state university a black college in greensboro north carolina entered the local woolworths department store.
after making a few purchases they sat down at the lunch counter an area reserved for whites.
told that they could not be served they remained in their seats until the store closed.
they returned the next morning and the next.
as the protest continued other students including a few local whites joined in.
demonstrations spread across the country.
after resisting for five months woolworths in july agreed to serve black customers at its lunch counters.
the sit in reflected mounting frustration at the slow pace of racial change.
white greensboro prided itself on being free of prejudice.
in 1954 the city had been the first in the south to declare its intention of complying with the brown decision.
but by 1960 only a handful of black students had been admitted to all white schools the economic gap between blacks and whites had not narrowed and greensboro was still segregated.
more than any other event the greensboro sit in launched the 1960s a decade of political activism and social change.
sit ins had occurred before but never had they sparked so massive a response.
similar demonstrations soon took place throughout the south demanding the integration not only of lunch counters but of parks pools restaurants bowling alleys libraries and other facilities as well.
by the end of 1960 some 70 000 demonstrators had taken part in sit ins.
angry whites often assaulted them.
but having been trained in nonviolent resistance the protesters did not strike back.
even more than elevating blacks to full citizenship declared the writer james baldwin the civil rights movement challenged the united states to rethink what it really means by freedom including whether freedom applied to all americans or only to part of the population.
with their freedom rides freedom schools freedom marches and the insistent cry freedom now black americans and their white allies made freedom once again the rallying cry of the dispossessed.
thousands of ordinary men and women maids and laborers alongside students teachers businessmen and ministers risked physical and economic retribution to lay claim to freedom.
their courage inspired a host of other challenges to the status quo including a student movement known as the new left the second wave of feminism and activism among other minorities.
by the time the decade ended these movements had challenged the 1950s understanding of freedom linked to the cold war abroad and consumer choice at home.
they exposed the limitations of traditional new deal liberalism.
they forced a reconsideration of the nations foreign policy and extended claims to freedom into the most intimate areas of life.
they made american society confront the fact that certain groups what were the major events in the civil rights movement of the early 1960s.
participants in a sit in in raleigh north carolina in 1960.
the protesters probably students from a local college brought books and newspapers to emphasize the seriousness of their intentions and their commitment to nonviolence.
including students women members of racial minorities and homosexuals felt themselves excluded from full enjoyment of american freedom.
reflecting back years later on the struggles of the 1960s one black organizer in memphis remarked all i wanted to do was to live in a free country of the movements accomplishments he added you had to fight for every inch of it.
nobody gave you anything.
nothing the freedom movement the rising tide of protest with the sit ins college students for the first time stepped onto the stage of american history as the leading force for social change.
in april 1960 ella baker a longtime civil rights organizer called a meeting of young activists in raleigh north carolina.
about 200 black students and a few whites attended.
out of the gathering came the student non violent coordinating committee sncc dedicated to replacing the culture of segregation with a beloved community of racial justice and to empowering ordinary blacks to take control of the decisions that affected their lives.
we cant count on adults declared sncc organizer robert moses.
are not afraid of the tremendous pressure they will face.

but their actions led the interstate commerce commission to order buses and terminals desegregated.
as protests escalated so did the resistance of local authorities.
late in 1961 sncc and other groups launched a campaign of nonviolent protests against racial discrimination in albany georgia.
the protests lasted a year but despite filling the jails with demonstrators a tactic adopted by the movement to gain national sympathy they failed to achieve their goals.
in september 1962 a court ordered the university of mississippi to admit james meredith a black student.
the state police stood aside as a mob encouraged by governor ross barnett rampaged through the streets of oxford where the university is located.
two bystanders lost their lives in the riot.
president kennedy was forced to dispatch the army to restore order.
birmingham the high point of protest came in the spring of 1963 when demonstrations took place in towns and cities across the south dramatizing black discontent over inequality in education employment and housing.
in one week in june there were more than 15 000 arrests in 186 cities.
the dramatic culmination came in birmingham alabama a citadel of segregation.
even for demonstrators in downtown birmingham alabama during the civil rights campaign of 1963.
what were the major events in the civil rights movement of the early 1960s.
the deep south birmingham was a violent city there had been over fifty bombings of black homes and institutions since world war ii.
local blacks had been demonstrating with no result for greater economic opportunities and an end to segregation by local businesses.
with the movement flagging some of its leaders invited martin luther king jr to come to birmingham.
while serving a nine day prison term in april 1963 for violating a ban on demonstrations king composed one of his most eloquent pleas for racial justice the letter from birmingham jail responding to local clergymen who counseled patience king related the litany of abuses faced by black southerners from police brutality to the daily humiliation of having to explain to their children why they could not enter amusement parks or public swimming pools.
the white moderate king declared must put aside fear of disorder and commit himself to racial justice.
in may king made the bold decision to send black schoolchildren into the streets of birmingham.
police chief eugene bull connor unleashed his forces against the thousands of young marchers.
the images broadcast on television of children being assaulted with nightsticks high pressure fire hoses and attack dogs produced a wave of revulsion throughout the world and turned the birmingham campaign into a triumph for the civil rights movement.
it led president kennedy as will be related later to endorse the movements goals.
leading businessmen fearing that the city was becoming an international symbol of brutality brokered an end to the demonstrations that desegregated downtown stores and restaurants and promised that black salespeople would be hired.
but more than these modest gains the events in birmingham forced white americans to decide whether they had more in common with fellow citizens demanding their basic rights or with violent segregationists.
the question became more insistent in the following weeks.
in june 1963 a sniper killed medgar evers field secretary of the naacp in mississippi.
in september a bomb exploded at a black baptist church in birmingham killing four young girls.
not until the year 2002 was the last of those who committed this act of domestic terrorism tried and convicted.
the march on washington on august 28 1963 two weeks before the birmingham church bombing 250 000 black and white americans converged on the nations capital for the march on washington often considered the high point of the nonviolent civil rights movement.
organized by a coalition of civil rights labor and church organizations led by a philip randolph the black unionist who had threatened a similar march in 1941 it was the largest public demonstration in the nations history to that time.
calls for the passage of a civil rights bill pending before congress took center stage.
but the marchs goals also included a public works program to reduce unemployment an increase in a fireman assaulting young africanamerican demonstrators with a highpressure hose during the climactic demonstrations in birmingham.
broadcast on television such pictures proved a serious problem for the united states in its battle for the hearts and minds of people around the world and forced the kennedy administration to confront the contradiction between the rhetoric of freedom and the reality of racism.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 part of the crowd that gathered at the lincoln memorial for the 1963 march on washington to demand jobs and freedom the kennedy years the minimum wage and a law barring discrimination in employment.
these demands and the marchers slogan jobs and freedom revealed how the black movement had for the moment forged an alliance with white liberal groups.
on the steps of the lincoln memorial king delivered his most famous speech including the words i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal see the appendix for the full text.
the march on washington reflected an unprecedented degree of black white cooperation in support of racial and economic justice.
but it also revealed some of the movements limitations and the tensions within it.
even though female activists like jo ann robinson and ella baker had played crucial roles in civil rights organizing every speaker at the lincoln memorial was male.
the organizers ordered sncc leader john lewis later a congressman from georgia to tone down his speech the original text of which called on blacks to free ourselves of the chains of political and economic slavery and march through the heart of dixie the way sherman did.
and burn jim crow to the ground lewiss rhetoric forecast the more militant turn many in the movement would soon be taking.
seek the freedom in 1963 promised in 1863 read one banner at the march on washington.
and civil rights activists resurrected the civil war era vision of national authority as the custodian of american freedom.
despite the fact that the federal government had for many decades promoted segregation blacks historical experience suggested that they had more hope for justice from national power than from local governments or civic institutions home owners associations businesses private clubs still riddled with racism.
it remained unclear whether the federal government would take up this responsibility.
the kennedy years john f kennedy served as president for less than three years and in domestic affairs had few tangible accomplishments.
but his administration is widely viewed today as a moment of youthful glamour soaring hopes and dynamic leadership at home and abroad.
later revelations of the sexual liaisons kennedy obsessively pursued while in the white house have not significantly damaged his reputation among the general public.
kennedys inaugural address of january 1961 announced a watershed in american politics the torch has been passed he declared to a new generation of americans who would pay any price bear any burden to assure the survival and success of liberty the speech seemed to urge w h a t w e r e t h e m a j o r c r i s e s a n d p o l i c y i n i t i a t i v e s o f t h e ke n n e d y p r e s i d e n c y.
americans to move beyond the self centered consumer culture of the 1950s ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country but while the sit ins were by now a year old the speech said nothing about segregation or race.
at the outset of his presidency kennedy regarded civil rights as a distraction from his main concern vigorous conduct of the cold war.
kennedy and the world kennedys agenda envisioned new initiatives aimed at countering communist influence in the world.
one of his administrations first acts was to establish the peace corps which sent young americans abroad to aid in the economic and educational progress of developing countries and to improve the image of the united states there.
by 1966 more than 15 000 young men and women were serving as peace corps volunteers.
when the soviets in april 1961 launched a satellite carrying the first man into orbit around the earth kennedy announced that the united states would mobilize its resources to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade.
the goal seemed almost impossible when announced but it was stunningly accomplished in 1969.
kennedy also formulated a new policy toward latin america the alliance for progress.
a kind of marshall plan for the western hemisphere although involving far smaller sums of money it aimed kennedy said to promote both political and material freedom begun in 1961 with much fanfare about alleviating poverty and counteracting the appeal of communism the alliance for progress failed.
unlike the marshall plan military regimes and local elites controlled alliance for progress aid.
they enriched themselves while the poor saw little benefit.
like his predecessors kennedy viewed the entire world through the lens of the cold war.
this outlook shaped his dealings with fidel castro who had led a revolution that in 1959 ousted cuban dictator fulgencio batista.
until castro took power cuba was an economic dependency of the united states.
when his government began nationalizing american landholdings and other investments and signed an agreement to sell sugar to the soviet union the eisenhower administration suspended trade with the island.
the cia began training anti castro exiles for an invasion of cuba.
in april 1961 kennedy allowed the cia to launch its invasion at a site known as the bay of pigs.
military advisers predicted a popular uprising that would quickly topple the castro government.
but the assault proved to be a total failure.
of 1 400 invaders more than 100 were killed and 1 100 captured.
cuba became ever more closely tied to the soviet union.
the kennedy administration tried other methods including assassination attempts to get rid of castros government.
the missile crisis meanwhile relations between the two superpowers deteriorated.
in august 1961 in order to stem a growing tide of emigrants fleeing from east to west berlin the soviets constructed a wall separating the two parts of the city.
until its demolition in 1989 the berlin wall would stand as a tangible symbol of the cold war and the division of europe.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 new york city train passengers reading the news of president kennedys assassination november 22 1963.
the kennedy years the most dangerous crisis of the kennedy administration and in many ways of the entire cold war came in october 1962 when american spy planes discovered that the soviet union was installing missiles in cuba capable of reaching the united states with nuclear weapons.
the russians motive whether they hoped to alter the world balance of power or simply stave off another american invasion of cuba may never be known.
but the kennedy administration considered the missiles presence intolerable.
rejecting advice from military leaders that he authorize an attack on cuba which would almost certainly have triggered a soviet response in berlin and perhaps a nuclear war kennedy imposed a blockade or quarantine of the island and demanded the missiles removal.
after tense behind thescenes negotiations soviet premier nikita khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles kennedy pledged that the united states would not invade cuba and secretly agreed to remove american jupiter missiles from turkey from which they could reach the soviet union.
for thirteen days the world teetered on the brink of all out nuclear war.
the crisis seems to have lessened kennedys passion for the cold war.
indeed he appears to have been shocked by the casual way military leaders spoke of winning a nuclear exchange in which tens of millions of americans and russians were certain to die.
in 1963 kennedy moved to reduce cold war tensions.
in a speech at american university he called for greater cooperation with the soviets.
he warned against viewing the cold war simply as a battle between the forces of light and those of darkness no government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue that summer the two countries agreed to a treaty banning the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere and in space.
in announcing the agreement kennedy paid tribute to the small movement against nuclear weapons that had been urging such a ban for several years.
he even sent word to castro through a journalist that he desired a more constructive relationship with cuba.
kennedy and civil rights in his first two years in office kennedy was preoccupied with foreign policy.
but in 1963 the crisis over civil rights eclipsed other concerns.
until then kennedy had been reluctant to take a forceful stand on black demands.
he seemed to share fbi director j edgar hoovers fear that the movement was inspired by communism.
attorney general robert f kennedy the presidents brother approved fbi wiretaps on king.
despite promising during the 1960 campaign to ban discrimination in federally assisted housing kennedy waited until the end of 1962 to issue the order.
he used federal force when obstruction of the law became acute as at the university w h a t w e r e t h e m a j o r c r i s e s a n d p o l i c y i n i t i a t i v e s o f t h e ke n n e d y p r e s i d e n c y.
of mississippi.
but he failed to protect civil rights workers from violence insisting that law enforcement was a local matter.
events in birmingham in may 1963 forced kennedys hand.
kennedy realized that the united states simply could not declare itself the champion of freedom throughout the world while maintaining a system of racial inequality at home.
in june he went on national television to call for the passage of a law banning discrimination in all places of public accommodation a major goal of the civil rights movement.
the nation he asserted faced a moral crisis we preach freedom around the world.
but are we to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this is a land of the free except for negroes kennedy did not live to see his civil rights bill enacted.
on november 22 1963 while riding in a motorcade through dallas texas he was shot and killed.
most likely the assassin was lee harvey oswald a troubled former marine.
partly because oswald was murdered two days later by a local nightclub owner while in police custody speculation about a possible conspiracy continues to this day.
in any event kennedys death brought an abrupt and utterly unexpected end to his presidency.
as with pearl harbor or september 11 2001 an entire generation would always recall the moment when they first heard the news of kennedys death.
it fell to his successor lyndon b johnson to secure passage of the civil rights bill and to launch a program of domestic liberalism far more ambitious than anything kennedy had envisioned.
ly n d o n j o h n s o n s p r e s i d e n c y unlike john f kennedy raised in a wealthy and powerful family lyndon johnson grew up in one of the poorest parts of the united states the central texas hill country.
kennedy seemed to view success as his birthright johnson had to struggle ferociously to achieve wealth and power.
by the 1950s he had risen to become majority leader of the u s senate.
but johnson never forgot the poor mexican and white children he had taught in a texas school in the early 1930s.
far more interested than kennedy in domestic reform he continued to hold the new deal view that government had an obligation to assist less fortunate members of society.
the civil rights act of when he became president nobody expected that johnson would make the passage of civil rights legislation his first order of business or that he would come to identify himself with the black movement more passionately than any previous president.
just five days after kennedys assassination however johnson called on congress to enact the civil rights bill as the most fitting memorial to his slain predecessor.
we have talked long enough about equal rights in this country he declared.
it is now time to write the next chapter and write it in the books of law in 1964 congress passed the civil rights act which prohibited racial discrimination in employment institutions like hospitals and schools and privately owned public accommodations such as restaurants hotels and lyndon b johnson being sworn in as president on the plane taking him to washington from dallas.
on the left is lady bird johnson and on the right jacqueline kennedy.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 lyndon johnsons presidency fannie lou hamer testifying at the democratic national convention of 1964 on behalf of the mississippi freedom democratic party.
it also banned discrimination on the grounds of sex a provision added by opponents of civil rights in an effort to derail the entire bill and embraced by liberal and female members of congress as a way to broaden its scope.
johnson knew that many whites opposed the new law.
after signing it he turned to an aide and remarked i think we delivered the south to the republican party freedom summer the 1964 law did not address a major concern of the civil rights movement the right to vote in the south.
that summer a coalition of civil rights groups including sncc core and the naacp launched a voter registration drive in mississippi.
hundreds of white college students from the north traveled to the state to take part in freedom summer.
an outpouring of violence greeted the campaign including thirty five bombings and numerous beatings of civil rights workers.
in june three young activists michael schwerner and andrew goodman white students from the north and james chaney a local black youth were kidnapped by a group headed by a deputy sheriff and murdered near philadelphia mississippi.
between 1961 and 1965 an estimated twenty five black civil rights workers paid with their lives.
but the deaths of the two white students focused unprecedented attention on mississippi and on the apparent inability of the federal government to protect citizens seeking to enjoy their constitutional rights.
in june 2005 forty one years after freedom summer a mississippi jury convicted a member of the ku klux klan of manslaughter in the deaths of the three civil rights workers.
freedom summer led directly to one of the most dramatic confrontations of the civil rights era the campaign by the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp to take the seats of the states all white official party at the 1964 democratic national convention in atlantic city new jersey.
with blacks unable to participate in the activities of the democratic party or register to vote the civil rights movement in mississippi had created the mfdp open to all residents of the state.
at televised hearings before what were the purposes and strategies of johnsons great society programs.
the credentials committee fannie lou hamer of the mfdp held a national audience spellbound with her account of growing up in poverty in the yazoo mississippi delta and of the savage beatings she had endured at the hands of police.
like many other black activists hamer was a deeply religious person who believed that christianity rested on the idea of freedom and that the movement had been divinely inspired.
is this america she asked the land of the free and home of the brave where.
we are threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings johnson feared a southern walkout as had happened at the 1948 party convention if the mfdp were seated.
party liberals including johnsons running mate hubert humphrey pressed for a compromise in which two black delegates would be granted seats.
but the mfdp rejected the proposal.
the 1964 election the events at atlantic city severely weakened black activists faith in the responsiveness of the political system and forecast the impending breakup of the coalition between the civil rights movement and the liberal wing of the democratic party.
for the moment however the movement rallied behind johnsons campaign for reelection.
johnsons opponent senator barry goldwater of arizona had published the conscience of a conservative 1960 which sold more than 3 million copies.
the book demanded a more aggressive conduct of the cold war he even suggested that nuclear war might be the price of freedom.
but goldwater directed most of his critique against internal dangers to freedom especially the new deal welfare state which he believed stifled individual initiative and independence.
he called for the substitution of private charity for public welfare programs and social security and the abolition of the graduated income tax.
goldwater had voted against the civil rights act of 1964.
his acceptance speech at the republican national convention contained the explosive statement extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice stigmatized by the democrats as an extremist who would repeal social security and risk nuclear war the presidential goldwater went down to a disastrous defeat.
johnson election of 1964 received almost 43 million votes to goldwaters 27 million.
democrats swept to two to one majorities in both houses of congress.
although few realized it the 1964 campaign marked a milestone in the resurgence of american conservatism.
goldwaters success in the deep south where he carried five states coupled with the sur9 26 13 prisingly strong showing of segregationist governor george wallace of alabama in democratic primaries in wisconsin indiana and maryland suggested that politi4 7 10 cians could strike electoral gold by appealing to white opposition to the civil rights movement.
one indication of problems for the democrats came in california with the passage by popular referendum of proposition 14 which repealed a 1963 law banning racial electoral vote party candidate share discrimination in the sale of real estate.
backed by the democrat johnson 486 90 states realtors and developers california conservatives republican goldwater 52 10 made the freedom of home owners to control their 7 12 3 17 popular vote share 42 825 463 61 27 146 969 38 4 ch.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 lyndon johnsons presidency property the rallying cry of the campaign against the fair housing law.
although johnson carried california by more than 1 million votes proposition 14 received a considerable majority winning three fourths of the votes cast by whites.
the conservative sixties the 1960s today recalled as a decade of radicalism clearly had a conservative side as well.
with the founding in 1960 of young americans for freedom yaf conservative students emerged as a force in politics.
there were striking parallels between the sharon statement issued by ninety young people who gathered at the estate of conservative intellectual william f buckley in sharon connecticut to establish yaf and the port huron statement of sds of 1962 discussed later in this chapter.
both manifestos portrayed youth as the cutting edge of a new radicalism and both claimed to offer a route to greater freedom.
the sharon statement summarized beliefs that had circulated among conservatives during the past decade the free market underpinned personal freedom government must be strictly limited and international communism the gravest threat to liberty must be destroyed.
yaf aimed initially to take control of the republican party from leaders who had made their peace with the new deal and seemed willing to coexist with communism.
yaf members became barry goldwaters shock troops in 1964.
despite his landslide defeat in the general election goldwaters nomination was a remarkable triumph for a movement widely viewed as composed of fanatics out to repeal the twentieth century goldwater also brought new constituencies to the conservative cause.
his campaign aroused enthusiasm in the rapidly expanding suburbs of southern california and the southwest.
orange county california many of whose residents had recently arrived from the east and midwest and worked in defense related industries became a nationally known center of grassroots conservative activism.
the funds that poured into the goldwater campaign a 1967 rally by members of young americans for freedom a conservative group that flourished in the 1960s.
what were the purposes and strategies of johnsons great society programs.
from the sunbelts oilmen and aerospace entrepreneurs established a new financial base for conservatism.
and by carrying five states of the deep south goldwater showed that the civil rights revolution had redrawn the nations political map opening the door to a southern strategy that would eventually lead the entire region into the republican party.
well before the rise of black power a reaction against civil rights gains offered conservatives new opportunities and threatened the stability of the democratic coalition.
during the 1950s many conservatives had responded favorably to southern whites condemnation of the brown v board of education desegregation decision as an invasion of states rights.
the national review an influential conservative magazine referred to whites as the advanced race and defended black disenfranchisement on the grounds that the claims of civilization supersede those of universal suffrage in 1962 yaf bestowed its freedom award on senator strom thurmond of south carolina one of the countrys most prominent segregationists.
during the 1960s most conservatives abandoned talk of racial superiority and inferiority.
but conservative appeals to law and order freedom of association and the evils of welfare often had strong racial overtones.
racial divisions would prove to be a political gold mine for conservatives.
the voting rights act one last legislative triumph however lay ahead for the civil rights movement.
in january 1965 king launched a voting rights campaign in selma alabama a city where only 355 of 15 000 black residents had been allowed to register to vote.
in march defying a ban by governor wallace king attempted to lead a march from selma to the state capital montgomery.
when the marchers reached the bridge leading out of the city state police assaulted them with cattle prods whips and tear gas.
once again violence against nonviolent demonstrators flashed across television screens throughout the world compelling the federal government to take action.
calling selma a milestone in mans unending search for freedom johnson asked congress to enact a law securing the right to vote.
he closed his speech by quoting the demonstrators song we shall overcome never before had the movement received so powerful an endorsement from the federal government.
congress quickly passed the voting rights act of 1965 which allowed federal officials to register voters.
black southerners finally regained the suffrage that had been stripped from them at the turn of the twentieth century.
in addition the twenty fourth amendment to the constitution outlawed the poll tax which had long prevented poor blacks and some whites from voting in the south.
immigration reform by 1965 with court orders and new federal laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations employment and voting the civil rights movement had succeeded in eradicating the legal bases of second class citizenship.
the belief that racism should no longer serve as a basis of public policy spilled over into other realms.
in 1965 the hart celler act abandoned the national origins quota system of immigration which had excluded asians a white resident of selma offers her support to civil rights demonstrators.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 lyndon johnsons presidency and severely restricted southern and eastern europeans.
the law established new racially neutral criteria for immigration notably family reunification and possession of skills in demand in the united states.
on the other hand because of growing hostility in the southwest to mexican immigration the law established the first limit 120 000 on newcomers from the western hemisphere.
this created for the first time the category of illegal aliens from the americas.
the act set the quota for the rest of the world at 170 000.
the total annual number of immigrants 290 000 represented a lower percentage of the american population than had been admitted when the nationality quotas were established in 1924.
however because of special provisions for refugees from communist countries immigration soon exceeded these caps.
the new law had many unexpected results.
at the time immigrants represented only 5 percent of the american population the lowest proportion since the 1830s.
no one anticipated that the new quotas not only would lead to an explosive rise in immigration but also would spark a dramatic shift in which newcomers from latin america the caribbean and asia came to outnumber those from europe.
taken together the civil rights revolution and immigration reform marked the triumph of a pluralist conception of americanism.
by 1976 85 percent of respondents to a publicopinion survey agreed with the statement the united states was meant to be.
a country made up of many races religions and nationalities the great society after his landslide victory of 1964 johnson outlined the most sweeping proposal for governmental action to promote the general welfare since the new deal.
johnsons initiatives of 1965 1967 known collectively as the great society provided health services to the poor and elderly in the new medicaid and medicare programs and poured federal funds into education and urban development.
new cabinet offices the departments of transportation and of housing and urban development and new agencies such as the equal employment opportunity commission the national endowments for the humanities and for the arts and a national public broadcasting network were created.
these measures greatly expanded the powers of the federal government and they completed and extended the social agenda with the exception of national health insurance that had been stalled in congress since 1938.
unlike the new deal however the great society was a response to prosperity not depression.
the mid 1960s were a time of rapid economic expansion fueled by increased government spending and a tax cut on individuals and businesses initially proposed by kennedy and enacted in 1964.
johnson and democratic liberals believed that economic growth made it possible to fund ambitious new government programs and to improve the quality of life.
as part of his war on poverty president lyndon johnson visited appalachia one of the poorest places in the united states.
the war on poverty the centerpiece of the great society however was the crusade to eradicate poverty launched by johnson early in 1964.
after the talk of universal what were the purposes and strategies of johnsons great society programs.
freedom and equality johnson defended the great society in a vocabulary of freedom derived from the new deal when his own political career began and reinforced by the civil rights movement.
soon after assuming office in 1963 he resurrected the phrase freedom from want all but forgotten during the 1950s.
echoing fdr johnson told the 1964 democratic convention the man who is hungry who cannot find work or educate his children who is bowed by want that man is not fully free recognizing that black poverty was fundamentally different from white since its roots lay in past injustice and present prejudice johnson sought to redefine the relationship between freedom and equality.
economic liberty he insisted meant more than equal opportunity you do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying now you are free to go where you want do as you desire and choose figure 25.
1 percentage of population below poverty level by race 1959 1969 percentage below poverty level affluence during the 1950s economic deprivation had been rediscovered by political leaders thanks in part to michael harringtons 1962 book the other america.
harrington revealed that 40 to 50 million americans lived in poverty often in isolated rural areas or urban slums invisible to the middle class.
he showed that technological improvements like the mechanization of agriculture and the automation of industry which produced a higher standard of living overall eliminated the jobs of farm laborers and unskilled workers locking them in poverty.
the civil rights movement heightened the urgency of the issue even though as harrington made clear whites made up a majority of the nations poor.
during the 1930s democrats had attributed poverty to an imbalance of economic power and flawed economic institutions.
in the 1960s the administration attributed it to an absence of skills and a lack of proper attitudes and work habits.
thus the war on poverty did not consider the most direct ways of eliminating poverty guaranteeing an annual income for all americans creating jobs for the unemployed promoting the spread of unionization or making it more difficult for businesses to shift production to the low wage south or overseas.
nor did it address the economic changes that were reducing the number of well paid manufacturing jobs and leaving poor families in rural areas like appalachia and decaying urban ghettos with little hope of economic advancement.
one of the great societys most popular and successful components food stamps offered direct aid to the poor.
but in general the war on poverty concentrated not on direct economic aid but on equipping the poor with skills and rebuilding their spirit and motivation.
the new office of economic opportunity oversaw a series of initiatives designed to lift the poor into the social and economic mainstream.
it provided head start an early childhood education program job training legal services and scholarships for poor college students.
it also created vista a domestic version of the peace corps for the inner cities.
in an echo of snccs philosophy of empowering ordinary individuals to take control of their lives the war on poverty required that poor people play a leading part in the design and implementation of local policies a recipe for continuing conflict with local political leaders accustomed to controlling the flow of federal dollars.
black latino asian and native american total white 1963 1965 year the poverty threshold for a non farm family of four was 3 743 in 1969 and 2 973 in 1959.
during the 1960s an expanding economy and government programs assisting the poor produced a steady decrease in the percentage of americans living in poverty.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 the changing black movement the leaders you please.
not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and as a result johnsons great society may not have achieved equality as a fact but it represented a remarkable reaffirmation of the idea of social citizenship.
it was the most expansive effort in the nations history to mobilize the powers of the national government to address the needs of the least advantaged americans especially those like blacks largely excluded from the original new deal entitlements such as social security.
coupled with the decades high rate of economic growth the war on poverty succeeded in reducing the incidence of poverty from 22 percent to 13 percent of american families during the 1960s.
it has fluctuated around the latter figure ever since.
the sum spent however was too low to end poverty altogether or to transform conditions of life in poor urban neighborhoods.
by the 1990s thanks to the civil rights movement and the great society the historic gap between whites and blacks in education income and access to skilled employment narrowed considerably.
but with deindustrialization and urban decay affecting numerous families and most suburbs still being off limits to non whites the median wealth of white households remained ten times greater than that of blacks and nearly a quarter of all black children still lived in poverty.
the changing black movement even at its moment of triumph the civil rights movement confronted a crisis as it sought to move from access to schools public accommodations and the voting booth to the economic divide separating blacks from other americans.
in the mid 1960s economic issues rose to the forefront of the civil rights agenda.
violent outbreaks in black ghettos outside the south a burned store mannequin lies on the street and smoke rises in the background as a policeman patrols los angeles during the watts riot of 1965.
how did the civil rights movement change in the mid 1960s.
drew attention to the national scope of racial injustice and to inequalities in jobs education and housing that the dismantling of legal segregation left intact.
much of the animosity that came to characterize race relations arose from the belief of many whites that the legislation of 1964 and 1965 had fulfilled the nations obligation to assure blacks equality before the law while blacks aware of the discrimination they still faced in jobs education housing and the criminal justice system pushed for more government action sparking fears of reverse discrimination the ghetto uprisings the first riots really battles between angry blacks and the predominantly white police widely seen by many ghetto residents as an occupying army erupted in harlem in 1964.
far larger was the watts uprising of 1965 which took place in the black ghetto of los angeles only days after johnson signed the voting rights act.
an estimated 50 000 persons took part in this rebellion attacking police and firemen looting white owned businesses and burning buildings.
it required 15 000 police and national guardsmen to restore order by which time thirty five people lay dead 900 were injured and 30 million worth of property had been destroyed.
by the summer of 1967 violence had become so widespread that some feared racial civil war.
urban uprisings in that year left twenty three dead in newark and forty three in detroit where entire blocks went up in flames and property damage ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
the violence led johnson to appoint a commission headed by illinois governor otto kerner to study the causes of urban rioting.
released in 1968 the kerner report blamed the violence on segregation and poverty and offered a powerful indictment of white racism it depicted a country in danger of being torn apart by racial antagonism our nation is moving toward two societies one black one white separate and unequal but the report failed to offer any clear proposals for change.
with black unemployment twice that of whites and the average black family income little more than half the white norm the movement looked for ways to make freedom real for black americans.
in 1964 king called for a bill of rights for the disadvantaged to mobilize the nations resources to abolish economic deprivation.
his proposal was directed against poverty in general but king also insisted that after doing something special against the negro for hundreds of years the united states had an obligation to do something special for him now an early call for what would come to be known as affirmative action a philip randolph and civil rights veteran bayard rustin proposed a freedom budget which envisioned spending 100 billion over ten years on a federal program of job creation and urban redevelopment.
in 1966 king launched the chicago freedom movement with demands quite different from its predecessors in the south an end to discrimination by employers and unions equal access to mortgages the integration of public housing and the construction of low income housing scattered throughout the region.
confronting the entrenched power of mayor richard j daleys political machine and the ferocious opposition of white home owners the movement failed.
kings tactics marches sit ins mass arrests proved ineffective in the face of the norths less pervasive but in 1965 martin luther king jr and the black labor leader a philip randolph called for a freedom budget which they claimed would eliminate poverty by 1975.
the proposal illustrated how the focus of the civil rights movement was shifting from desegregation to economic inequality.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 the changing black movement still powerful system of racial inequality.
as he came to realize the difficulty of combating the economic plight of black america kings language became more and more radical.
he called for nothing less than a revolution in values that would create a better distribution of wealth for all gods children malcolm female students on the campus of howard university in washington d c sport the afro a hairstyle representative of the black is beautiful campaign of the 1960s.
x the civil rights movements first phase had produced a clear set of objectives far reaching accomplishments and a series of coherent if sometimes competitive organizations.
the second witnessed political fragmentation and few significant victories.
even during the heyday of the integration struggle the fiery orator malcolm x had insisted that blacks must control the political and economic resources of their communities and rely on their own efforts rather than working with whites.
having committed a string of crimes as a youth malcolm little was converted in jail to the teachings of the nation of islam or black muslims who preached a message of white evil and black self discipline.
malcolm dropped his slave surname in favor of x symbolizing blacks separation from their african ancestry.
on his release from prison he became a spokesman for the muslims and a sharp critic of the ideas of integration and nonviolence and of kings practice of appealing to american values.
i dont see any american dream he proclaimed.
i see an american nightmare on a 1964 trip to mecca saudi arabia islams spiritual home malcolm x witnessed harmony among muslims of all races.
he now began to speak of the possibility of interracial cooperation for radical change in the united states.
but when members of the nation of islam assassinated him in february 1965 after he had formed his own organization of afro american unity malcolm x left neither a consistent ideology nor a coherent movement.
most whites considered him an apostle of racial violence.
however his call for blacks to rely on their own resources struck a chord among the urban poor and younger civil rights activists.
his autobiography published in 1966 became a great bestseller.
today streets parks and schools are named after him.
the rise of black power malcolm x was the intellectual father of black power a slogan that came to national attention in 1966 when sncc leader stokely carmichael used it during a civil rights march in mississippi.
black power immediately became a rallying cry for those bitter over the federal governments failure to stop violence against civil rights workers white attempts to determine movement strategy as at the democratic convention of 1964 and the civil rights movements failure to have any impact on the economic problems of black ghettos.
how did the civil rights movement change in the mid 1960s.
one who embraced the idea proclaimed black power means black freedom freedom especially from whites who tried to dictate the movements goals.
a highly imprecise idea black power suggested everything from the election of more black officials hardly a radical notion to the belief that black americans were a colonized people whose freedom could only be won through a revolutionary struggle for self determination.
but however employed the idea reflected the radicalization of young civil rights activists and sparked an explosion of racial self assertion reflected in the slogan black is beautiful the abandonment of the word negro in favor of afro american as well as the popularity of black beauty pageants african styles of dress and the natural or afro hairdo among both men and women signified much more than a change in language and fashion.
they reflected a new sense of racial pride and a rejection of white norms.
inspired by the idea of black self determination sncc and core repudiated their previous interracialism and new militant groups sprang into existence.
many of these groups proved short lived.
but both traditional civil rights organizations and black politicians adopted some of their ideas.
most prominent of the new groups in terms of publicity if not numbers was the black panther party.
founded in oakland california in 1966 it became notorious for advocating armed self defense in response to police brutality.
it demanded the release of black prisoners because of racism in the criminal justice system.
the partys youthful members alarmed whites by wearing military garb although they also ran health clinics schools and childrens breakfast programs.
but internal disputes and a campaign against the black panthers by police and the fbi which left several leaders dead in shootouts destroyed the organization.
black unemployment declined throughout the second half of the 1960s.
but by 1967 with the escalation of u s military involvement in vietnam the war on poverty had ground to a halt.
by then with ghetto uprisings punctuating the urban landscape the antiwar movement assuming massive proportions and millions of young people ostentatiously rejecting mainstream values american society faced its greatest crisis since the depression.
vietnam and the new left old and new lefts to most americans the rise of a protest movement among white youth came as a complete surprise.
for most of the century colleges had been conservative institutions that drew their students from a privileged segment of the population.
during the 1950s young people had been called a silent generation if blacks grievances appeared self evident those of white college students were difficult to understand.
what persuaded large numbers of children of affluence to reject the values and institutions of their society.
in part the answer lay in a redefinition of the meaning of freedom by what came to be called the new left.
what made the new left new was its rejection of the intellectual and political categories that had shaped radicalism and liberalism for most of the twentieth century.
it challenged not only mainstream america betye saars 1972 installation the liberation of aunt jemima illustrates modes of thought associated with black power.
quaker oats company has long used an image of a black woman reminiscent of the stereotypical slave mammy as a symbol for its brand of pancake mix.
saar gives aunt jemima a rifle to go along with her broom.
in front of her is another aunt jemima holding a light skinned baby a symbol according to the artist of the sexual exploitation of black women by white men.
images in the background reveal how quaker oats had already modified its advertising image giving her a smaller kerchief and an afro hairdo.
by the end of the twentieth century the kerchief had disappeared entirely and aunt jemima had become slimmer and younger and was not smiling quite so broadly.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 vietnam and the new left but also what it dismissively called the old left.
unlike the communist party it did not take the soviet union as a model or see the working class as the main agent of social change.
instead of economic equality and social citizenship the language of new deal liberals the new left spoke of loneliness isolation and alienation of powerlessness in the face of bureaucratic institutions and a hunger for authenticity that affluence could not provide.
these discontents galvanized a mass movement among what was rapidly becoming a major sector of the american population.
by 1968 thanks to the coming of age of the baby boom generation and the growing number of jobs that required post high school skills more than 7 million students attended college more than the number of farmers or steelworkers.
the new left was not as new as it claimed.
its call for a democracy of citizen participation harked back to the american revolution and its critique of the contrast between american values and american reality to the abolitionists.
its emphasis on authenticity in the face of conformity recalled the bohemians of the years before world war i and its critique of consumer culture drew inspiration from 1950s writers on mass society.
but the new lefts greatest inspiration was the black freedom movement.
more than any other event the sit ins catalyzed white student activism.
here was the unlikely combination that created the upheaval known as the sixties the convergence of societys most excluded members demanding full access to all its benefits with the children of the middle class rejecting the social mainstream.
the black movement and white new left shared basic assumptions that the evils to be corrected were deeply embedded in social institutions and that only direct confrontation could persuade americans of the urgency of far reaching change.
the fa d i n g consensus the years 1962 and 1963 witnessed the appearance of several path breaking books that challenged one or another aspect of the 1950s consensus.
james baldwins the fire next time gave angry voice to the black revolution.
rachel carsons silent spring exposed the environmental costs of economic growth.
michael harringtons the other america revealed the persistence of poverty amid plenty.
the death and life of great american cities by jane jacobs criticized urban renewal the removal of the poor from city centers and the destruction of neighborhoods to build highways accommodating cities to the needs of drivers rather than pedestrians.
what made cities alive she insisted was density and diversity the social interaction of people of different backgrounds encountering each other on urban streets.
yet in some ways the most influential critique of all arose in 1962 from students for a democratic society sds an offshoot of the socialist league for industrial democracy.
meeting at port huron michigan some sixty college students adopted a document that captured the mood and summarized the beliefs of this generation of student protesters.
the port huron statement devoted four fifths of its text to criticism of institutions ranging from political parties to corporations unions and the h o w d i d t h e v i e t n a m wa r t r a n s f o r m a m e r i c a n p o l i t i c s a n d c u l t u r e.
military industrial complex.
but what made the document the guiding spirit of a new radicalism was the remainder which offered a new vision of social change.
we seek the establishment it proclaimed of a democracy of individual participation in which the individual shares in those social decisions determining the quality and direction of his life freedom for the new left meant participatory democracy although rarely defined with precision this became a standard by which students judged existing social arrangements workplaces schools government and found them wanting.
the idea suggested a rejection of the elitist strain that had marked liberal thinkers from the progressives to postwar advocates of economic planning in which government experts would establish national priorities in the name of the people.
the rise of sds by the end of 1962 sds had grown to 8 000 members.
then in 1964 events at the university of california at berkeley revealed the possibility for a far broader mobilization of students in the name of participatory democracy.
a cold war multiversity berkeley was an immense impersonal institution where enrollments in many classes approached 1 000 students.
the spark that set student protests alight was a new rule prohibiting political groups from using a central area of the campus to spread their ideas.
students including conservatives outraged at being barred from distributing their own literature responded by creating the free speech movement.
freedom of expression declared mario savio a student leader represents the very dignity of what a human being is.
thats what members of students for a democratic society sds at a 1963 national council meeting in indiana.
despite their raised fists they appear eminently respectable compared to radicals who emerged later in the decade.
the group is entirely white.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 vietnam and the new left marks us off from the stones and the stars.
you can speak freely likening the university to a factory savio called on students to throw our body against the machines thousands of berkeley students became involved in the protests in the months that followed.
their program moved from demanding a repeal of the new rule to a critique of the entire structure of the university and of an education geared toward preparing graduates for corporate jobs.
when the university gave in on the speech ban early in 1965 one activist exulted that the students had succeeded in reversing the worldwide drift from freedom police arresting mario savio a leader of the free speech movement as he addresses a crowd on the campus of the university of california at berkeley in 1966.
america and vietnam by 1965 the black movement and the emergence of the new left had shattered the climate of consensus of the 1950s.
but what transformed protest into a full fledged generational rebellion was the war in vietnam.
what one historian has called the greatest miscalculation in the history of american foreign relations was a logical extension of cold war policies and assumptions.
the war tragically revealed the danger that walter lippmann had warned of at the outset of the cold war viewing the entire world and every local situation within it through the either or lens of an anticommunist crusade.
a vietnam specialist in the state department who attended a policy meeting in august 1963 later recalled the abysmal ignorance around the table of the particular facts of vietnam.
they made absolutely no distinctions between countries with completely different historical experiences.
they believed that we could manipulate other states and build nations that we knew all the answers few americans had any knowledge of vietnams history and culture.
successive administrations reduced a complex struggle for national independence led by homegrown communists who enjoyed widespread support throughout their country in addition to soviet backing to a test of containment as noted in the previous chapter the truman and eisenhower administrations had cast their lot with french colonialism in the region.
after the french defeat they financed the creation of a proamerican south vietnamese government in violation of the geneva accords of 1954 that had promised elections to unify vietnam.
by the 1960s the united states was committed to the survival of this corrupt regime.
fear that the public would not forgive them for losing vietnam made it impossible for presidents kennedy and johnson to remove the united states from an increasingly untenable situation.
kennedys foreign policy advisers saw vietnam as a test of whether the united states could through counterinsurgency intervention to counter internal uprisings in noncommunist countries halt the spread of third world revolutions.
despite the dispatch of increased american aid and numerous military advisers h o w d i d t h e v i e t n a m wa r t r a n s f o r m a m e r i c a n p o l i t i c s a n d c u l t u r e.
south vietnamese leader ngo dinh diem lost control of the countryside to the communist led viet cong.
diem resisted american advice to broaden his governments base of support.
in october 1963 after large buddhist demonstrations against his regime the united states approved a military coup that led to diems death.
when kennedy was assassinated the following month there were 17 000 american military advisers in south vietnam.
shortly before his death according to the notes of a white house meeting kennedy questioned the wisdom of involvement in vietnam but he took no action to end the american presence.
ly n d o n johnsons war lyndon b johnson came to the presidency with little experience in foreign relations.
johnson had misgivings about sending american troops to vietnam.
i dont see that we can ever hope to get out of there once we are committed he remarked to one senator in 1964.
but he knew that republicans had used the loss of china as a weapon against truman.
i am not going to be the president he vowed who saw southeast asia go the way china went in august 1964 north vietnamese vessels encountered an american ship on a spy mission off its coast.
when north vietnamese patrol boats fired on the american vessel johnson proclaimed that the united states was a victim of aggression in response congress passed the gulf of tonkin resolution authorizing the president to take all necessary measures to repel armed attack in vietnam.
only two members senators ernest gruening of alaska and wayne morse of oregon voted against giving johnson this blank check.
the nearest the united states ever came to a formal declaration of war the resolution passed without any discussion of american goals and strategy in vietnam.
over forty years later in december 2005 the national security agency finally released hundreds of pages of secret documents that made it clear that no north vietnamese attack had actually taken place.
during the 1964 campaign johnson insisted that he had no intention of sending american troops to vietnam.
but immediately after johnsons reelection the national security council recommended that the united states begin air strikes against north vietnam and introduce american ground troops in the south.
when the viet cong in february 1965 attacked an american air base in south vietnam johnson put the plan into effect.
at almost the same time he intervened in the dominican republic.
here military leaders in 1963 had overthrown the left wing but noncommunist juan bosch the countrys first elected president since 1924.
in april 1965 another group of military men attempted to restore bosch to power but were defeated by the ruling junta.
fearing the unrest would lead to another cuba johnson dispatched 22 000 american troops.

recent h1 voices of freedom from young americans for freedom the sharon statement september 1960 although the 1960s is usually thought of as a decade of youthful radicalism it also witnessed the growth of conservative movements.
the sharon statement marked the emergence of young americans for freedom as a force for conservatism in american politics.
that the purposes of government are to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order the provision of national defense and the administration of justice that when government ventures beyond these lawful functions it accumulates power which tends to diminish order and liberty.
that the market economy allocating resources by in this time of moral and political crisis it is the responsibility of the youth of america to affirm certain eternal truths.
we as young conservatives believe that foremost among the transcendent values is the individuals use of his god given free will whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force that liberty is indivisible and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom the free play of supply and demand is the single economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government and that it is at the same time the most productive supplier of human needs.
that the forces of international communism are at present the greatest single threat to these liberties that the united states should stress victory over rather than coexistence with this menace.

we oppose the depersonalization that reduces human beings to the status of things if anything the brutalities of the twentieth century teach that means and ends are intimately institutions ranging from the government to related that vague appeals to posterity cannot students for a democratic society in port huron michigan.
its call for a democracy of individual participation inspired many of the social universities that failed to live up to this standard.
we are the people of this generation bred in at least modest comfort housed now in universities looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.
freedom and equality for each individual government of by and for the people these american values we found good principles by which we could live as men.
as we grew however our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss.
southern struggle against racial bigotry compelled most of us from silence to activism.
the proclaimed peaceful intentions of the united states contradicted its economic and military investments in the cold war.
the conventional moral terms of the age the politician moralities free world peoples democracies reflect realities poorly if at all and seem to function more as ruling myths than as descriptive principles.
but neither has our experience in the universities brought us moral enlightenment.
our professors and administrators sacrifice controversy to public relations.
their skills and silence are purchased by investors in the arms race.
we regard men as infinitely precious and possessed of unfulfilled capacities for reason freedom and love.
in affirming these principles we are aware justify the mutilations of the present.
we see little reason why men cannot meet with increasing skill the complexities and responsibilities of their situation if society is organized not for minority but for majority participation in decision making.
we would replace power rooted in possession privilege or circumstance by power and uniqueness rooted in love reflectiveness reason and creativity.
as a social system we seek the establishment of a democracy of individual participation so that the individual can share in those social decisions determining the quality and direction of his life.
a new left must consist of younger people.
it must start controversy throughout the land if national policies and national apathy are to be reversed.
questions 1.
how do the young conservatives who wrote the sharon statement understand freedom.
what do the authors of the port huron statement appear to mean by participatory democracy.
what are the main differences and are there any similarities between the outlooks of the young conservatives and the young radicals.

they spread chemicals that destroyed forests to deprive the viet cong of hiding places and dropped bombs filled with napalm a gelatinous form of gasoline that burns the skin of anyone exposed to it.
the army pursued viet cong and north vietnamese forces in search and destroy missions that often did not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
weekly reports of enemy losses or body counts became a fixation of the administration.
but the united states could not break its opponents ability to fight or make the south vietnamese government any more able to survive on its own.

by 1968 the war had sidetracked much of the great society and had torn families universities and the democratic party apart.
with the entire political leadership liberal no less than conservative committed to the war for most of the 1960s young activists lost all confidence in the system a massive 1969 antiwar demonstration on the mall in washington.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 vietnam and the new left opposition to the war became the organizing theme that united people with all kinds of doubts and discontents.
we recoil with horror said a sncc position paper at the inconsistency of a supposedly free society where responsibility to freedom is equated with the responsibility to lend oneself to military aggression with college students exempted from the draft the burden of fighting fell on the working class and the poor.
in 1967 martin luther king jr condemned the administrations vietnam policy as an unconscionable use of violence and for draining resources from needs at home.
at this point king was the most prominent american to speak out against the war.
as for sds the war seemed the opposite of participatory democracy since american involvement had come through secret commitments and decisions made by political elites with no real public debate.
in april 1965 sds invited opponents of american policy in vietnam to assemble in washington d c.
the turnout of 25 000 amazed the organizers offering the first hint that the antiwar movement would soon enjoy a mass constituency.
at the next antiwar rally in november 1965 sds leader carl ogelsby openly challenged the foundations of cold war thinking.
he linked vietnam to a critique of american interventions in guatemala and iran support for south african apartheid and johnsons dispatch of troops to the dominican republic all rooted in obsessive anticommunism.
some might feel ogelsby concluded that i sound mighty anti american.
to these i say dont blame me for that.
blame those who mouthed my liberal values and broke my american heart the speech observed one reporter marked a declaration of independence for the new left.
by 1967 young men were burning their draft cards or fleeing to canada to avoid fighting in what they considered an unjust war.
in october of that year 100 000 antiwar protestors assembled at the lincoln memorial in washington d c.
many marched across the potomac river to the pentagon where photographers captured them placing flowers in the rifle barrels of soldiers guarding the nerve center of the american military.
the two young members of the counterculture at their wedding in new mexico.
c o u n t e r c u lt u r e the new lefts definition of freedom initially centered on participatory democracy a political concept.
but as the 1960s progressed young americans understanding of freedom increasingly expanded to include cultural freedom as well.
although many streams flowed into the generational rebellion known as the counterculture the youth revolt was inconceivable without the wars destruction of young americans belief in authority.
by the late 1960s millions of young people openly rejected the values and behavior of their elders.
their ranks included not only college students but also numerous young workers even though most unions strongly opposed antiwar demonstrations and countercultural displays a reaction that further separated young radicals from former allies on the traditional left.
for the first time in american history the flamboyant rejection of respectable norms in clothing language sexual behavior and drug use previously confined to artists and bohemians became the basis of a mass movement.
its rallying cry was liberation here was john winthrops nightmare of three centuries earlier come to pass a massive redefinition of freedom as a rejection of all authority.
visions of freedom antiwar protest.
the first amendment guarantees americans the right of free speech and to assemble to protest government policies.
rarely in american history have these rights been used on so massive a scale as during the 1960s.
this photograph of an antiwar demonstrator placing flowers in the rifles of u s soldiers outside the pentagon the headquarters of the american military in the nations capital at a 1967 rally against the vietnam war was reproduced around the world.
some 100 000 protesters took part in this demonstration.
questions 1.
do you think that the photographer intended to suggest that peaceful protest is an effective way of spreading the antiwar message.
what elements of life in the 1960s seem to clash in this image.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 timothy leary promoter of the hallucinogenic drug lsd listening to the band quicksilver messenger service at the human be in in san francisco in 1967.
vietnam and the new left your sons and your daughters are beyond your command bob dylans song the times they are a changin bluntly informed mainstream america.
to be sure the counterculture in some ways represented not rebellion but the fulfillment of the consumer marketplace.
it extended into every realm of life the definition of freedom as the right to individual choice.
given the purchasing power of students and young adults countercultural emblems colorful clothing rock music images of sexual freedom even symbols of black revolution and native american resistance were soon being mass marketed as fashions of the day.
self indulgence and selfdestructive behavior were built into the counterculture.
to followers of timothy leary the harvard scientist turned prophet of mind expansion the psychedelic drug lsd embodied a new freedom the freedom to expand your own consciousness in 1967 leary organized a human be in in san francisco where he urged a crowd of 20 000 to turn on tune in drop out personal liberation and the free individual but there was far more to the counterculture than new consumer styles or the famed trio of sex drugs and rock and roll.
to young dissenters personal liberation represented a spirit of creative experimentation a search for a way of life in which friendship and pleasure eclipsed the single minded pursuit of wealth.
it meant a release from bureaucratized education and work repressive rules of personal behavior and above all a militarized state that in the name of freedom rained destruction on a faraway people.
it also encouraged new forms of radical action.
underground newspapers pioneered a personal and politically committed style of journalism.
the youth international party or yippies introduced humor and theatricality as elements of protest.
from the visitors gallery of the new york stock exchange yippie founder abbie hoffman showered dollar bills onto the floor bringing trading to a halt as brokers scrambled to retrieve the money.
the counterculture emphasized the ideal of community establishing quasi independent neighborhoods in new york citys east village and san franciscos haight ashbury district and in an echo of nineteenth century utopian communities like new harmony some 2 000 communes nationwide.
rock festivals like woodstock in upstate new york in 1969 brought together hundreds of thousands of young people to celebrate their alternative lifestyle and independence from adult authority.
the opening song at woodstock performed by richie havens began with eight repetitions of the single word freedom the countercultures notion of liberation centered on the free individual.
nowhere was this more evident than in the place occupied by sexual h o w d i d t h e v i e t n a m wa r t r a n s f o r m a m e r i c a n p o l i t i c s a n d c u l t u r e.
freedom in the generational rebellion.
starting in 1960 the mass marketing of birth control pills made possible what free lovers had long demanded the separation of sex from procreation.
by the late 1960s sexual freedom had become as much an element of the youth rebellion as long hair and drugs.
rock music celebrated the free expression of sexuality.
the musical hair which gave voice to the youth rebellion flaunted nudity on broadway.
the sexual revolution was central to another mass movement that emerged in the 1960s the second wave of feminism.
the new movements and the rights revolution the civil rights revolution soon followed by the rise of the new left inspired other americans to voice their grievances and claim their rights.
many borrowed the confrontational tactics of the black movement and activist students adopting their language of power and liberation and their rejection of traditional organizations and approaches.
by the late 1960s new social movements dotted the political landscape.
the feminine mystique the achievement of the vote had not seemed to affect womens lack of power and opportunity.
when the 1960s began only a handful of women held political office newspapers divided job ads into male and female sections with the latter limited to low wage clerical positions and major universities limited the number of female students they accepted.
in many states husbands still controlled their wives earnings.
as late as 1970 the ohio supreme court held that a wife was at most a superior servant to her husband without legally recognized feelings or rights during the 1950s some commentators had worried that the country was wasting its woman power a potential weapon in the cold war.
but the public reawakening of feminist consciousness did not get its start until the publication in 1963 of betty friedans the feminine mystique.
friedan had written pioneering articles during the 1940s on pay discrimination against women workers and racism in the workplace for the newspaper of the united electrical workers union.
but like other social critics of the 1950s she now took as her themes the emptiness of consumer culture and the discontents of the middle class.
her opening chapter the problem that has no name painted a devastating picture of talented educated women trapped in a world that viewed marriage and motherhood as their primary goals.
somehow after more than a century of agitation for access to the public sphere womens lives still centered on the home.
in moscow in 1959 richard nixon had made the suburban home an emblem of american freedom.
for friedan invoking the eras most powerful symbol of evil it was a comfortable concentration camp few books have had the impact of the feminine mystique.
friedan was deluged by desperate letters from female readers relating how the suburban dream had become a nightmare.
freedom wrote an atlanta woman was a word i had always taken for granted.
i now realized that i had voluntarily enslaved myself to be sure a few of friedans correspondents insisted a poster listing some of the performers who took part in the woodstock festival in 1969.
a dove of peace sits on the guitar symbolizing the overlap between the antiwar movement and counterculture.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 the new movements and the rights revolution in 1967 in a celebrated incident arising from the new feminism a race official tried to eject kathrine switzer from the boston marathon only to be pushed aside by other runners.
considered too fragile for the marathon whose course covers more than twenty six miles women were prohibited from running.
switzer completed the race and today hundreds of thousands of women around the world compete in marathons each year.
that for a woman to create a comfortable happy home for her family was what god intended but the immediate result of the feminine mystique was to focus attention on yet another gap between american rhetoric and american reality.
the law slowly began to address feminist concerns.
in 1963 congress passed the equal pay act barring sex discrimination among holders of the same jobs.
the civil rights act of 1964 as noted earlier prohibited inequalities based on sex as well as race.
deluged with complaints of discrimination by working women the equal employment opportunity commission established by the law became a major force in breaking down barriers to female employment.
the year 1966 saw the formation of the national organization for women now with friedan as president.
modeled on civil rights organizations it demanded equal opportunity in jobs education and political participation and attacked the false image of women spread by the mass media.
womens liberation if now grew out of a resurgence of middle class feminism a different female revolt was brewing within the civil rights and student movements.
as in the days of abolitionism young women who had embraced an ideology of social equality and personal freedom and learned methods of political organizing encountered inequality and sexual exploitation.
women like ella baker and fannie lou hamer had played major roles in grassroots civil rights organizing.
but many women in the movement found themselves relegated to typing cooking and cleaning for male coworkers.
some were pressured to engage in sexual liaisons.
echoing the words of abby kelley a century earlier a group of female sncc activists concluded in a what were the sources and significance of the rights revolution of the late 1960s.
1965 memorandum that there seem to be many parallels that can be drawn between the treatment of negroes and the treatment of women in our society as a whole what bothered them most was the status of women within the movement where assumptions of male supremacy seemed as deeply rooted as in society at large.
the same complaints arose in sds.
the movement is supposed to be for human liberation wrote one student leader.
how come the condition of women inside it is no better than outside the rapidly growing number of women in college provided a ready made constituency for the new feminism.
by 1967 women throughout the country were establishing consciousness raising groups to discuss the sources of their discontent.
the time many concluded had come to establish a movement of their own more radical than now.
the new feminism burst onto the national scene at the miss america beauty pageant of 1968 when protesters filled a freedom trash can with objects of oppression girdles brassieres high heeled shoes and copies of playboy and cosmopolitan.
contrary to legend they did not set the contents on fire which would have been highly dangerous on the wooden boardwalk.
but the media quickly invented a new label for radical women bra burners inside the hall demonstrators unfurled banners carrying the slogans freedom for women and womens liberation personal freedom the womens liberation movement inspired a major expansion of the idea of freedom by insisting that it should be applied to the most intimate realms of life.
introducing the terms sexism and sexual politics and the phrase the personal is political into public debate they insisted that sexual relations conditions of marriage and standards of beauty were as much political questions as the war civil rights and the class tensions that had traditionally inspired the left to action.
the idea that family life is not offlimits to considerations of power and justice repudiated the family oriented public culture of the 1950s and it permanently changed americans definition of freedom.
radical feminists first public campaign demanded the repeal of state laws that underscored womens lack of self determination by banning abortions or leaving it up to physicians to decide whether a pregnancy could be terminated.
without the right to control her own reproduction wrote one activist womans other freedoms are tantalizing mockeries that cannot be exercised in 1969 a group of feminists disrupted legislative hearings on new yorks law banning abortions where the experts scheduled to testify consisted of fourteen men and a roman catholic nun.
the call for legalized abortions merged the nineteenth century demand that a woman control her own body with the sixties emphasis on sexual freedom.
but the concerns of womens liberation went far beyond sexuality.
sisterhood is powerful an influential collection of essays manifestos and personal accounts published in 1970 touched on a remarkable array of issues from violence against women to inequalities in the law churches workplaces and family life.
by this time feminist ideas had entered the mainstream.
in 1962 a poll showed that two thirds of american women did not feel themselves to be victims of discrimination.
by 1974 two thirds did.
a 1970 womens liberation demonstration at the statue of liberty.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 the new movements and the rights revolution gay part of the gay liberation day demonstration in new york city in june 1970.
in a decade full of surprises perhaps the greatest of all was the emergence of the movement for gay liberation.
efforts of one kind or another for greater rights for racial minorities and women had a long history.
homosexuals wrote harry hay who in 1951 founded the mattachine society the first gay rights organization were the one group of disadvantaged people who didnt even think of themselves as a group gay men and lesbians had long been stigmatized as sinful or mentally disordered.
most states made homosexual acts illegal and police regularly harassed the gay subcultures that existed in major cities like san francisco and new york.
mccarthyism which viewed homosexuality as a source of national weakness made the discrimination to which gays were subjected even worse.
although homosexuals had achieved considerable success in the arts and fashion most kept their sexual orientation secret or in the closet the mattachine society had worked to persuade the public that apart from their sexual orientation gays were average americans who ought not to be persecuted.
but as with other groups the sixties transformed the gay movement.
if one moment marked the advent of gay liberation it was a 1969 police raid on the stonewall bar in new yorks greenwich village a gathering place for homosexuals.
rather than bowing to police harassment as in the past gays fought back.
five days of rioting followed and a militant movement was born.
gay men and lesbians stepped out of the closet to insist that sexual orientation is a matter of rights power and identity.
prejudice against homosexuals persisted.
but within a few years gay pride marches were being held in numerous cities.
latino csar chavez speaking at a 1965 rally to support the national grape boycott.
huelga on the banner behind him means strike in spanish.
on the front of the platform is an image of our lady of guadalupe the patron saint of mexico.
like the civil rights movement the united farm workers merged religious and political language and imagery.
liberation activism as in the case of blacks a movement for legal rights had long flourished among mexican americans.
but the mid 1960s saw the flowering of a new militancy challenging the groups second class economic status.
like black power advocates the movement emphasized pride in both the mexican past and the new chicano culture that had arisen in the united states.
unlike the black power movement and sds it was closely linked to labor struggles.
beginning in 1965 csar chavez the son of migrant farm workers and a disciple of king led a series of nonviolent protests including marches fasts and a national boycott of california grapes to pressure growers to agree to labor contracts with the united farm workers union ufw.
the ufw was as much a mass movement for civil rights as a campaign for economic betterment.
the boycott mobilized latino communities throughout the southwest and drew national attention to the pitifully low wages and oppressive working conditions of migrant laborers.
in 1970 the major growers agreed to contracts with the ufw.
what were the sources and significance of the rights revolution of the late 1960s.
in new york city the young lords organization modeled on the black panthers staged street demonstrations to protest the high unemployment rate among the citys puerto ricans and the lack of city services in latino neighborhoods.
in one protest they dumped garbage on city streets to draw attention to the citys failure to collect refuse in poor areas.
like sncc and sds the latino movement gave rise to feminist dissent.
many chicano and puerto rican men regarded feminist demands as incompatible with the latino heritage of machismo an exaggerated sense of manliness including the right to dominate women.
young female activists however viewed the sexual double standard and the inequality of women as incompatible with freedom for all members of la raza the race or people.
red power the 1960s also witnessed an upsurge of indian militancy.
the truman and eisenhower administrations had sought to dismantle the reservation system and integrate indians into the american mainstream a policy known as termination since it meant ending recognition of the remaining elements of indian sovereignty.
many indian leaders protested vigorously against this policy and it was abandoned by president kennedy.
johnsons war on poverty channeled increased federal funds to reservations.
but like other minority groups indian activists compared their own status to that of underdeveloped countries overseas.
they demanded not simply economic aid but selfdetermination like the emerging nations of the third world.
using language typical of the late 1960s clyde warrior president of the national indian youth council declared we are not free in the most basic sense of the word.
we are not allowed to make those basic human choices about our personal life and the destiny of our communities founded in 1968 the american indian movement staged protests demanding greater tribal self government and the restoration of economic resources guaranteed in treaties.
in 1969 a group calling itself indians of all nations occupied or from their point of view re occupied alcatraz island in san francisco bay claiming that it had been illegally seized from its original inhabitants.
the protest which lasted into 1971 launched the red power movement.
in the years that followed many indian tribes would win greater control over education and economic development on the reservations.
indian activists would bring land claims suits demanding and receiving monetary settlements for past dispossession.
as a result of a rising sense of self respect the number of americans identifying themselves as indians doubled between 1970 and 1990.
silent spring liberation movements among racial minorities women and gays challenged long standing social inequalities.
another movement environmentalism called into question different pillars of american life the equation of progress with endless increases in consumption and the faith that science technology and economic growth would advance the social welfare.
the occupation of alcatraz island in san francisco bay in 1969 by indians of all tribes symbolized the emergence of a new militancy among native americans.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 the new movements and the rights revolution concern for preserving the natural environment dated back to the creation of national parks and other conservation efforts during the progressive era.
but in keeping with the spirit of the sixties the new environmentalism was more activist and youth oriented and it spoke the language of empowering citizens to participate in decisions that affected their lives.
its emergence reflected the very affluence celebrated by proponents of the american way.
as the quality of life including physical fitness health and opportunities to enjoy leisure activities occupied a greater role in the lives of middle class americans the environmental consequences of economic growth received increased attention.
when the 1960s began complaints were already being heard about the bulldozing of forests for suburban development and the contamination produced by laundry detergents and chemical lawn fertilizers seeping into drinking supplies.
the publication in 1962 of silent spring by the marine biologist rachel carson brought home to millions of readers the effects of ddt an insecticide widely used by home owners and farmers against mosquitoes gypsy moths and other insects.
in chilling detail carson related how ddt killed birds and animals and caused sickness among humans.
chemical and pesticide companies launched a campaign to discredit her some critics called the book part of a communist plot.
time magazine even condemned carson as hysterical and emotional words typically used by men to discredit women.
the new environmentalism carsons work launched the modern environmental movement.
the sierra club founded in the 1890s to preserve forests saw its membership more than triple and other groups sprang into existence to alert the country to the dangers of water contamination air pollution lead in paint and the extinction of animal species.
nearly every state quickly banned the use of ddt.
in 1969 television brought home to a national audience the death of birds and fish and the despoiling of beaches caused by a major oil spill off the coast of california exposing the environmental dangers of oil transportation and ocean drilling for oil.
despite vigorous opposition from business groups that considered its proposals a violation of property rights environmentalism attracted the broadest bipartisan support of any of the new social movements.
under republican president richard nixon congress during the late 1960s and early 1970s passed a series of measures to protect the environment including the clean air and clean water acts and the endangered species act.
on april 22 1970 the first earth day some 20 million people most of them under the age of thirty participated in rallies concerts and teach ins.
closely related to environmentalism was the consumer movement spearheaded by the lawyer ralph nader.
his book unsafe at any speed 1965 exposed how auto manufacturers produced highly dangerous vehicles.
general motors whose chevrolet corvair nader singled out for its tendency to roll over in certain driving situations hired private investigators to discredit him.
when their campaign was exposed general motors paid nader a handsome settlement which he used to fund investigations of other dangerous products and of misleading advertising.
naders campaigns laid the groundwork for the numerous new consumer protection laws and regulations of the 1970s.
unlike 1960s movements that what were the sources and significance of the rights revolution of the late 1960s.
emphasized personal liberation environmentalism and the consumer movement called for limiting some kinds of freedom especially the right to use private property in any way the owner desired in the name of a greater common good.
the rights revolution it is one of the more striking ironies of the 1960s that although the rights revolution began in the streets it achieved constitutional legitimacy through the supreme court historically the most conservative branch of government.
under the guidance of chief justice earl warren the court vastly expanded the rights enjoyed by all americans and placed them beyond the reach of legislative and local majorities.
as noted in chapter 21 the courts emergence as a vigorous guardian of civil liberties had been foreshadowed in 1937 when it abandoned its commitment to freedom of contract while declaring that the right of free expression deserved added protection.
the mccarthy era halted progress toward a broader conception of civil liberties.
it resumed on june 17 1957 known as red monday by conservatives when the court moved to rein in the anticommunist crusade.
the justices overturned convictions of individuals for advocating the overthrow of the government failing to answer questions before the house un american activities committee and refusing to disclose their political beliefs to state officials.
the government warren declared could prosecute illegal actions but not unorthodoxy or dissent by the time warren retired in 1969 the court had reaffirmed the right of even the most unpopular viewpoints to first amendment protection and had dismantled the cold war loyalty security system.
civil liberties had gained strength in the 1930s because of association with the rights of labor in the 1950s and 1960s they became intertwined with civil rights.
beginning with naacp v alabama in 1958 the court struck down southern laws that sought to destroy civil rights organizations by forcing them to make public their membership lists.
in addition in the landmark ruling in new york times v sullivan 1964 it overturned a libel judgment by an alabama jury against the nations leading newspaper for carrying an advertisement critical of how local officials treated civil rights demonstrators.
the central meaning of the first amendment the justices declared lay in the right of citizens to criticize their government.
for good measure they declared the sedition act of 1798 unconstitutional over a century and a half after it had expired.
before the 1960s few supreme court cases had dealt with newspaper publishing.
sullivan created the modern constitutional law of freedom of the press.
the court in the 1960s continued the push toward racial equality overturning numerous local jim crow laws.
in loving v virginia 1967 it declared unconstitutional the laws still on the books in sixteen states that prohibited interracial marriage.
this aptly named case arose from the interracial marriage of richard and mildred loving.
barred by virginia law from marrying they did so in washington d c and later returned to their home state.
two weeks after their arrival the local sheriff entered their home in the middle of the night roused the couple from bed and arrested them.
the lovings were sentenced to five years in prison although the judge gave them the option of leaving virginia instead.
they departed for washington but five years later wishing to return they sued karl hubenthals december 8 1976 cartoon for the los angeles heraldexaminer celebrates the rights revolution as an expansion of american liberty.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 the new movements and the rights revolution in federal court claiming that their rights had been violated.
in 1968 in jones v alfred h mayer co the court forbade discrimination in the rental or sale of housing.
eliminating badges of slavery such as unequal access to housing the ruling suggested was essential to fulfilling at long last the promise of emancipation.
policing the states the court simultaneously pushed forward the process of imposing upon the states the obligation to respect the liberties outlined in the bill of rights.
it required states to abide by protections against illegal search and seizure the right of a defendant to a speedy trial the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the right of poor persons accused of a crime to receive counsel from publicly supplied attorneys.
among the most important of these decisions was the 5 4 ruling in miranda v arizona 1966.
this held that an individual in police custody must be informed of the rights to remain silent and to confer with a lawyer before answering questions and must be told that any statements might be used in court.
the decision made miranda warnings standard police practice.
the court also assumed the power to oversee the fairness of democratic procedures at the state and local levels.
baker v carr 1962 established the principle that districts electing members of state legislatures must be equal in population.
this one man one vote principle overturned apportionment systems in numerous states that had allowed individuals in sparsely inhabited rural areas to enjoy the same representation as residents of populous city districts.
the justices also moved to reinforce the wall of separation between church and state.
in 1961 they unanimously declared unconstitutional a clause in marylands constitution requiring that public officials declare their belief in the existence of god in the following two years they decreed that prayers and bible readings in public schools also violated the first amendment.
president kennedy pointed out that americans remained perfectly free to pray at home or in church but these rulings proved to be the most unpopular of all the warren courts decisions.
polls showed that 80 percent of americans favored allowing prayer in public schools.
the right to privacy the warren court not only expanded existing liberties but also outlined entirely new rights in response to the rapidly changing contours of american society.
most dramatic was its assertion of a constitutional right to privacy in griswold v connecticut 1965 which overturned a state law prohibiting the use of contraceptives.
justice william o douglas who wrote the decision had once declared the right to be let alone is the beginning of all freedom apart from decisions of the 1920s that affirmed the right to marry and raise children without government interference however few legal precedents existed regarding privacy.
the constitution does not mention the word.
nonetheless douglas argued that a constitutionally protected zone of privacy within marriage could be inferred from the penumbras shadows of the bill of rights.
what were the sources and significance of the rights revolution of the late 1960s.
griswold linked privacy to the sanctity of marriage.
but the court soon transformed it into a right of individuals.
it extended access to birth control to unmarried adults and ultimately to minors an admission by the court that law could not reverse the sexual revolution.
these decisions led directly to the most controversial decision that built on the rulings of the warren court even though it occurred in 1973 four years after warrens retirement.
this was roe v wade which created a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.
the court declared access to abortion a fundamental freedom protected by the constitution a fulfillment of radical feminists earliest demand.
roe provoked vigorous opposition which has continued to this day.
only two states banned contraception when griswold was decided roe invalidated the laws of no fewer than forty six.
griswold and roe unleashed a flood of rulings and laws that seemed to accept the feminist view of the family as a collection of sovereign individuals rather than a unit with a single head.
the legal rights of women within the domestic sphere expanded dramatically.
law enforcement authorities for the first time began to prosecute crimes like rape and assault by husbands against their wives.
today some notion of privacy is central to most americans conception of freedom.
the rights revolution completed the transformation of american freedom from a set of entitlements enjoyed mainly by white men into an openended claim to equality recognition and self determination.
for the rest of the century the government and legal system would be inundated by demands by aggrieved groups of all kinds and the supreme court would devote much of its time to defining the rights of americans.
a year of turmoil the sixties reached their climax in 1968 a year when momentous events succeeded each other so rapidly that the foundations of society seemed to be dissolving.
late january 1968 saw the tet offensive in which viet cong and north vietnamese troops launched well organized uprisings in cities throughout south vietnam completely surprising american military leaders.
the united states drove back the offensive and inflicted heavy losses.
but the intensity of the fighting brought into americas homes on television shattered public confidence in the johnson administration which had repeatedly proclaimed victory to be just around the corner leading members of the press and political establishment joined the chorus criticizing american involvement.
eugene mccarthy an antiwar senator from minnesota announced that he would seek the democratic nomination.
in march aided by a small army television brought the vietnam war into americans living rooms helping to spur antiwar sentiment.
the woman seems to have taken a break from washing dishes to watch the news.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 striking sanitation workers in memphis tennessee.

with public support dissolving johnson rejected the militarys request to send 200 000 more troops to vietnam.
in march he stunned the nation by announcing that he had decided not to seek reelection.
peace talks soon opened in paris.
meanwhile martin luther king jr was organizing a poor peoples march hoping to bring thousands of demonstrators to washington to demand increased antipoverty efforts.
on april 4 having traveled to memphis to support a strike of the citys grossly underpaid black garbage collectors king was killed by a white assassin.
the greatest outbreak of urban violence in the nations history followed in ghettos across the country.
washington d c had to be occupied by soldiers before order was restored.
as a gesture to kings memory congress passed its last major civil rights law the open housing act which prohibited discrimination in the sale and rental of homes and apartments although with weak enforcement mechanisms.
at the end of april students protesting columbia universitys involvement in defense research and its plan to build a gymnasium in a public park occupied seven campus buildings.
new york police removed them in an assault that left hundreds of protesters and bystanders injured and led to a strike that closed the campus.
in june a young palestinian nationalist assassinated robert f kennedy who was seeking the democratic nomination as an opponent of the war.
in august tens of thousands of antiwar activists descended on chicago for protests at the democratic national convention where the delegates nominated vice president hubert humphrey as their presidential candidate.
the citys police never known for restraint assaulted the marchers with nightsticks producing hundreds of injuries outside the convention hall and pandemonium inside it.
a later investigation called the event a police riot nonetheless the government indicted eight political radicals for conspiring to incite the violence.
they included tom hayden of sds yippie leader abbie hoffman and bobby seale of the black panthers.
five were found guilty after a tumultuous trial.
but an appeals court overturned the convictions because judge julius hoffman no relation to abbie hoffman had been flagrantly biased against the defendants.
the global like 1848 and 1919 1968 was a year of worldwide upheaval.
in many countries young radicals challenged existing power structures often borrowing language and strategies from the decades social movements in the united states and adapting them to their own circumstances.
television carried events in one country instantaneously across the globe.
massive antiwar demonstrations took place in london rome paris munich and tokyo leading to clashes with police and scores of injuries.
in in what ways was 1968 a climactic year for the sixties.
italy students occupied university buildings bringing education to a halt.
in paris a nationwide student uprising began in may 1968 that echoed american demands for educational reform and personal liberation.
unlike in the united states millions of french workers soon joined the protest adding their own demands for higher wages and greater democracy in the workplace.
the result was a general strike that paralyzed the country and nearly led to the collapse of the government before it ended.
in communist czechoslovakia leaders bent on reform came to power by promising to institute socialism with a human face only to be ousted by a soviet invasion.
soldiers fired on students demonstrating for greater democracy on the eve of the opening of the olympic games in mexico city leading to more than 500 deaths.

as in the united states personal liberation including a womans right to control her own body became a rallying cry.
in catholic european countries like france and italy womens movements won significant legal changes making it easier to obtain divorces and decriminalizing abortion.
our bodies ourselves a book the presidential originally published in 1973 by a group of boston women election of 1968 dealt frankly with widely misunderstood aspects of womens health including pregnancy and childbirth menopause birth control and sexually transmitted dis9 34 4 eases.
it was quickly translated into twenty languages.
nixons comeback in the united states instead of radical change the years events opened the door for a conservative reaction.
turmoil in the streets produced a demand for public order.
black militancy produced white backlash which played an increasing role in politics.
the fact that the unelected supreme court was inventing and protecting rights fed the argument that faraway bureaucrats rode roughshod over local traditions.
in august richard nixon capped a remarkable political comeback by winning the republican nomination.
he campaigned as the champion of the silent majority ordinary party republican democrat american independent 26 13 7 12 11 1 7 10 12 3 17 candidate nixon humphrey wallace popular vote electoral vote share share 301 56 31 710 470 43 2 191 36 30 898 055 42 6 9 906 473 12 9 46 8 ch.
25 the sixties 1960 1968 suggested reading americans who believed that change had gone too far and called for a renewed commitment to law and order humphrey could not overcome the deep divide in his party.
with 43 percent of the vote nixon had only a razor thin margin over his democratic rival.
but george wallace running as an independent and appealing to resentments against blacks gains great society programs and the warren court received an additional 13 percent.
taken together the nixon and wallace totals which included a considerable number of former democratic voters indicated that four years after johnsons landslide election ushered in the great society liberalism was on the defensive.
the year 1968 did not mark the end of the 1960s.
the great society would achieve an unlikely culmination during the nixon administration.
the second wave of feminism achieved its largest following during the 1970s.
nixons election did however inaugurate a period of growing conservatism in american politics.
the conservative ascendancy would usher in yet another chapter in the story of american freedom.
the legacy of the sixties the 1960s transformed american life in ways unimaginable when the decade began.
it produced new rights and new understandings of freedom.
it made possible the entrance of numerous members of racial minorities into the mainstream of american life while leaving unsolved the problem of urban poverty.
it set in motion a transformation of the status of women.
it changed what americans expected from government from clean air and water to medical coverage in old age.
at the same time it undermined public confidence in national leaders.
relations between young and old men and women and white and non white along with every institution in society changed as a result.
just as the civil war and new deal established the framework for future political debates so it seemed americans were condemned to refight the battles of the 1960s long after the decade had ended.
race relations feminism social policy the nations proper role in world affairs these issues hardly originated in the 1960s.
but the events of those years made them more pressing and more divisive.
as the country became more conservative the sixties would be blamed for every imaginable social ill from crime and drug abuse to a decline of respect for authority.
yet during the 1960s the united states had become a more open more tolerant in a word a freer country.

l b eginning with the dramatic 1960 contest between john f kennedy and richard m nixon the journalist theodore white published bestselling accounts of four successive races for the presidency.
covering the 1964 election white attended civil rights demonstrations and rallies for barry goldwater the republican nominee.
white noticed something that struck him as odd the dominant word of these two groups which loathe each other is freedom both demand either freedom now or freedom for all.
the word has such emotive power behind it that.
a reporter is instantly denounced for questioning what they mean by the word freedom the united states white concluded sorely needed a commonly agreed on concept of freedom white had observed firsthand the struggle over the meaning of freedom set in motion by the 1960s as well as the revival of conservatism in the midst of an era known for radicalism.
goldwaters campaign helped to crystalize and popularize ideas that would remain the bedrock of conservatism for years to come.
to intense anticommunism goldwater added a critique of the welfare state for destroying the dignity of the individual he demanded a reduction in taxes and governmental regulations.
goldwater showed that with liberals in control in washington conservatives could claim for themselves the tradition of antigovernment populism thus broadening their electoral base and countering their image as upper crust elitists.
the second half of the 1960s and the 1970s would witness pivotal developments that reshaped american politics the breakup of the political coalition forged by franklin d roosevelt an economic crisis that traditional liberal remedies seemed unable to solve a shift of population and economic resources to conservative strongholds in the sunbelt of the south and west the growth of an activist conservative christianity increasingly aligned with the republican party and a series of setbacks for the united states overseas.
together they led to growing popularity for conservatives ideas including their understanding of freedom.
president nixon from the vantage point of the early twenty first century it is difficult to recall how marginal conservatism seemed at the end of world war ii.
associated in many minds with conspiracy theories anti semitism and preference for social hierarchy over democracy and equality conservatism seemed a relic of a discredited past.
in the united states at this time wrote the social critic lionel trilling in 1949 liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition.
for it is the plain fact that nowadays what were the major policies of the nixon administration on social and economic issues.

nonetheless as noted in the previous two chapters the 1950s and 1960s witnessed a conservative rebirth.
and in 1968 a backlash among formerly democratic voters against both black assertiveness and antiwar demonstrations helped to propel richard nixon into the white house.
but conservatives found nixon no more to their liking than his predecessors.
nixon echoed conservative language especially in his condemnation of student protesters and his calls for law and order but in office he expanded the welfare state and moved to improve american relations with the soviet union and china.
during his presidency the social changes set in motion by the 1960s seen by conservatives as forces of moral decay continued apace.
nixons domestic policies having won the presidency by a very narrow margin nixon moved toward the political center on many issues.
a shrewd politician he worked to population growth 1940 1990 200 100 199 50 99 25 49 11 24 1 10 center of population 1790 2000 ch.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 president nixon solidify his support among republicans while reaching out to disaffected elements of the democratic coalition.
it is difficult to characterize nixons domestic agenda according to the traditional categories of liberal and conservative.
mostly interested in foreign policy he had no desire to battle congress still under democratic control on domestic issues.
just as eisenhower had helped to institutionalize the new deal nixon accepted and even expanded many elements of the great society.
conservatives applauded nixons new federalism which offered federal block grants to the states to spend as they saw fit rather than for specific purposes dictated by washington.
on the other hand the nixon administration created a host of new federal agencies.
the environmental protection agency oversaw programs to combat water and air pollution cleaned up hazardous wastes and required environmental impact statements from any project that received federal funding.
the occupational safety and health administration sent inspectors into the nations workplaces.
the national transportation safety board instructed automobile makers on how to make their cars safer.
nixon spent lavishly on social services and environmental initiatives.
he abolished the office of economic opportunity which had coordinated johnsons war on poverty.
but he signed congressional measures that expanded the food stamp program and indexed social security benefits to inflation meaning that they would rise automatically as the cost of living increased.
the endangered species act prohibited spending federal funds on any project that might extinguish an animal species.
the clean air act set air quality standards for carbon monoxide and other chemicals released by cars and factories and led to a dramatic decline in air pollution.
nixon and w e l fa r e perhaps nixons most startling initiative was his proposal for a family assistance plan or negative income tax that would replace aid to families with dependent children afdc by having the federal government guarantee a minimum income for all americans.
universally known as welfare afdc provided assistance often quite limited to poor families who met local eligibility requirements.
originally a new deal program that mainly served the white poor welfare had come to be associated with blacks who by 1970 accounted for nearly half the recipients.
the afdc rolls expanded rapidly during the 1960s partly because the federal government relaxed eligibility standards.
this arose from an increase in births to unmarried women which produced a sharp rise in the number of poor female headed households and from an aggressive campaign by welfare rights groups to encourage people to apply for benefits.
conservative politicians now attacked recipients of welfare as people who preferred to live at the expense of honest taxpayers rather than by working.
a striking example of nixons willingness to break the political mold his plan to replace welfare with a guaranteed annual income failed to win approval by congress.
it proved too radical for conservatives who saw it as a reward for laziness while liberals denounced the proposed level of 1 600 per year for a needy family of four as inadequate.
what were the major policies of the nixon administration on social and economic issues.
nixon and race nixons racial policies offer a similarly mixed picture.
to consolidate support in the white south he nominated to the supreme court clement haynsworth and g harold carswell conservative southern jurists with records of support for segregation.
both were rejected by the senate.
on the other hand because the courts finally lost patience with southern delaying tactics extensive racial integration at last came to public schools in the south.
in nixons first three years in office the proportion of southern black students attending integrated schools rose from 32 percent to 77 percent.
for a time the nixon administration also pursued affirmative action programs to upgrade minority employment.
under johnson the department of labor had required contractors receiving federal money to establish specific goals and timetables that is to establish what number of minorities should be hired and by when to implement equal employment opportunity.
soon after taking office the nixon administration expanded this initiative with the philadelphia plan which required that construction contractors on federal projects hire specific numbers of minority workers.
secretary of labor george shultz who initiated the idea sincerely hoped to open more jobs for black workers.
nixon seems to have viewed the plan mainly as a way of fighting inflation by weakening the power of the building trades unions.
their control over the labor market he believed pushed wages to unreasonably high levels raising the cost of construction.
and he calculated if the plan caused dissension between blacks and labor unions two pillars of the democratic coalition republicans could only benefit.
trade unions of skilled workers like plumbers and electrical workers which had virtually no black members strongly opposed the philadelphia plan.
after a widely publicized incident in may 1970 when a group of construction workers assaulted antiwar demonstrators in new york city nixon suddenly decided that he might be able to woo blue collar workers in preparation for his 1972 reelection campaign.
he soon attacked the very affirmative action goals his administration had initiated.
he abandoned the philadelphia plan in favor of an ineffective one that stressed voluntary local efforts toward minority hiring instead of federal requirements.
the burger court when earl warren retired as chief justice in 1969 nixon appointed warren burger a federal court of appeals judge to succeed him.
an outspoken critic of the judicial activism of the warren court its willingness to expand old rights and create new ones by overturning acts of congress and the states burger was expected to lead the justices in a conservative direction.
but like nixon he surprised many of his supporters.
while the pace of change slowed the burger court at least initially consolidated and expanded many of the judicial innovations of the 1960s.
in 1971 in swann v charlotte mecklenburg board of education which arose from north carolina the justices unanimously approved a lower courts plan that required the extensive transportation of students to achieve richard nixon on the right and former alabama governor george wallace at an honor america celebration in february 1974.
nixons southern strategy sought to woo wallaces supporters into the republican party.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 president nixon school integration.
the decision led to hundreds of cases in which judges throughout the country ordered the use of busing as a tool to achieve integration.
with many white parents determined to keep their children in neighborhood schools and others willing to move to the suburbs or enroll them in private academies to avoid integration busing became a lightning rod for protests.
one of the most bitter fights took place in boston in the mid 1970s.
residents of the tightly knit irish american community of south boston demonstrated vociferously and sometimes violently against a busing plan decreed by a local judge.
the supreme court soon abandoned the idea of overturning local control of schools or moving students great distances to achieve integration.
in 1973 it rebuffed a group of texas latinos who sued to overturn the use of property taxes to finance public education.
because of the great disparity in wealth between districts spending on predominantly mexican american schools stood far below that for white ones.
but in san antonio independent school district v rodriguez a 5 4 court majority ruled that the constitution did not require equality of school funding.
in the following year in milliken v bradley 1974 the justices overturned a lower court order that required detroits predominantly white suburbs to enter into a regional desegregation plan with the citys heavily minority school system.
by absolving suburban districts of responsibility for assisting in integrating urban schools the decision guaranteed that housing segregation would be mirrored in public education.
indeed by the 1990s public schools in the north were considerably more segregated than those in the south.
the court and affirmative action efforts to promote greater employment opportunities for minorities also spawned politically divisive legal issues.
many whites came to view affirmative action programs as a form of reverse discrimination claiming that in violation of the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause they granted minorities special advantages over whites.
even as affirmative action programs quickly spread from blacks to encompass women latinos asian americans and native americans conservatives demanded that the supreme court invalidate all such policies.
the justices refused but they found it difficult to devise a consistent approach to this politically charged issue.
in griggs v duke power company 1971 the court ruled that even racially neutral job requirements such as a written examination were illegal if they operated to exclude a disproportionate number of non white applicants and were not directly related to job performance.
later in the decade in united steelworkers of america v weber 1979 it upheld a program devised by the kaiser aluminum chemical corporation and its union that set quotas for training and hiring non white workers in skilled jobs.
since this private voluntary agreement did not involve government action the court ruled it did not violate the fourteenth amendments ban on state policies that discriminated among citizens.
the justices however proved increasingly hostile to governmental affirmative action policies.
in regents of the university of california v bakke 1978 the court overturned an admissions program of the university of california at davis a public university which set aside 16 of 100 places in the what were the major policies of the nixon administration on social and economic issues.
entering medical school class for minority students.
justice lewis f powell a nixon appointee who cast the deciding vote in the 5 4 decision rejected the idea of fixed affirmative action quotas.
he added however that race could be used as one factor among many in admissions decisions so affirmative action continued at most colleges and universities.
during the 1990s as courts in different parts of the country interpreted bakke in different ways the legal status of affirmative action would remain ambiguous.
in 2003 a 5 4 majority reaffirmed the bakke principle that institutions of higher learning may use race as a consideration in admissions decisions.
the continuing sexual revolution to the alarm of conservatives during the 1970s the sexual revolution passed from the counterculture into the social mainstream.
the number of americans who told public opinion polls that premarital sex was wrong plummeted.
the number of divorces soared reaching more than 1 million in 1975 double the number ten years earlier.
the age at which both men and women married rose dramatically.
the figure for divorces in 1975 exceeded the number of first time marriages.
a popular 1978 film an unmarried woman portrayed the dissolution of a marriage as a triumph for the wife who discovered her potential for individual growth only after being abandoned by her husband.
as a result of womens changing aspirations and the availability of birth control and legal abortions the american birthrate declined dramatically.
by 1976 the average woman was bearing 1 7 children during her lifetime less than half the figure of 1957 and below the level at which a population reproduces itself.
like all averages these figures conceal significant variations.
poorer americans especially in the south and rural heartland had more children than educated urbanites.
a 1971 survey of the last five graduating classes at bryn mawr an elite womens college reported the birth of more than seventy children.
a similar survey covering the classes of 1971 through 1975 found that only three had been born.
during the nixon years women made inroads into areas from which they had long been excluded.
in 1972 congress approved title ix which banned gender discrimination in higher education and the equal credit opportunity act which required that married women be given access to credit in their own name.
the giant corporation american telephone and telegraph at t entered into a landmark agreement in which it agreed to pay millions of dollars to workers who had suffered gender discrimination and to upgrade employment opportunities for women.
the number of women at work continued its upward climb.
in 1960 only 20 percent of women with young children had been in the workforce.
the figure reached 40 percent in 1980 and 55 percent in 1990.
working women were motivated by varied aims.
some sought careers in professions and skilled jobs previously open only to men.
others spurred by the need to bolster family income as the economy faltered flooded into the table 26 1 rate of divorce divorces of existing marriages per 1 000 new marriages 1950 1980 year divorces 1 036 1 189 one result of the sexual revolution was a sharp rise in the age at which americans chose to marry and an increase in the number of divorces.

in addition the gay and lesbian movement born at the end of the 1960s expanded greatly during the 1970s and became a major concern of the right.
in 1969 there had been about fifty local gay rights groups in the united states ten years later their numbers reached into the thousands.
they began to elect local officials persuaded many states to decriminalize homosexual relations and succeeded in convincing cities with large gay populations to pass antidiscrimination laws.
they actively encouraged gay men and lesbians to come out of the closet that is to reveal their sexual orientation.
during the 1970s the american psychiatric association removed homosexuality from its list of mental diseases.

nixon and dtente just as domestic policies and social trends under nixon disappointed conservatives they viewed his foreign policy as dangerously soft on communism.
to be sure in the third world nixon and henry kissinger his national security adviser and secretary of state continued their predecessors policy of attempting to undermine governments deemed dangerous to american strategic or economic interests.
nixon funneled arms to dictatorial pro american regimes in iran the philippines and south africa.
after chile in 1970 elected socialist salvador allende as president the cia worked with his domestic opponents to destabilize the regime.
on september 11 1973 allende was overthrown and killed in a military coup which installed a bloody dictatorship under general augusto pinochet.
thousands of allende backers including a few americans then in chile were tortured and murdered and many others fled the country.
the nixon administration knew of the coup plans in advance but failed to warn allende and it continued to back pinochet despite his brutal policies.
democracy did not return to chile until the end of the 1980s.
in his relations with the major communist powers however nixon fundamentally altered cold war policies.
nixon had launched his political career as a fierce and critics charged unscrupulous anticommunist.
but in the language of foreign relations he and kissinger were realists they had more interest in power than ideology and preferred international stability to relentless conflict.
nixon also hoped that if relations with the soviet union improved the russians would influence north vietnam to agree to an end to the vietnam war on terms acceptable to the united states.
nixon realized that far from being part of a unified communist bloc china had its own interests different from those of the soviet union and was destined to play a major role on the world stage.
the policy of refusing to what were the major policies of the nixon administration on social and economic issues.
recognize chinas communist government had reached a dead end.
in 1971 kissinger flew secretly to china paving the way for nixons own astonishing public visit of february 1972.
the trip led to the beijing governments taking up chinas seat at the united nations previously occupied by the exiled regime on taiwan.
full diplomatic relations between the united states and the peoples republic of china were not established until 1979.
but nixons visit sparked a dramatic increase in trade between the two countries.
three months after his trip to beijing nixon became the first american president to visit the soviet union where he engaged in intense negotiations with his soviet counterpart leonid brezhnev.
out of this summit meeting came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties.
salt named for the strategic arms limitation talks under way since 1969 froze each countrys arsenal of intercontinental missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
the anti ballistic missile treaty banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles so that neither side would be tempted to attack the other without fearing devastating retaliation.
nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence in which dtente cooperation would replace the hostility of the cold war.
v i e t n a m a n d wat e r g at e nixon and vietnam despite nixons foreign policy triumphs one issue would not go away vietnam.
nixon ran for president in 1968 declaring that he had a secret plan to end the war.
on taking office he announced a new policy vietnamization.
under this plan american troops would gradually be withdrawn while south vietnamese soldiers backed by continued american bombing did more and more of the fighting.
but vietnamization neither limited the war nor ended the antiwar movement.
hoping to cut north vietnamese supply lines nixon in 1970 ordered american troops into neutral cambodia.
the invasion did not achieve its military goals but it destabilized the cambodian government and set in motion a chain of events that eventually brought to power the khmer rouge.
before being ousted by a vietnamese invasion in 1979 this local communist movement attempted to force virtually all cambodians into rural communes and committed widespread massacres in that unfortunate country.
as the war escalated protests again spread on college campuses.

in 1971 in one of the most dramatic demonstrations of the entire era hundreds of veterans deposited on the steps of the capitol medals they had received while fighting in vietnam.
vietnam and watergate mississippi the student movement reached its high water mark.
in the spring of 1970 more than 350 colleges and universities experienced strikes and troops occupied 21 campuses.
the protests at kent state a public university with a largely working class student body and jackson state a black institution demonstrated how antiwar sentiment had spread far beyond elite campuses like berkeley and columbia.
at the same time troop morale in vietnam plummeted.
although all young men were subject to the draft for most of the war college students received exemptions.
as a result the army was predominantly composed of working class whites and members of racial minorities.
unlike in previous wars blacks complained not about exclusion from the army but about the high number of black soldiers among the casualties.
in 1965 and 1966 blacks accounted for more than 20 percent of american casualties double their proportion in the army as a whole.
after protests from black leaders president johnson ordered the number of black soldiers in combat units reduced.
for the war as a whole blacks made up 14 percent of deaths among enlisted men.
the same social changes sweeping the home front were evident among troops in vietnam.
soldiers experimented with drugs openly wore peace and black power symbols refused orders and even assaulted unpopular officers.
in 1971 thousands deserted the army while at home vietnam veterans held antiwar demonstrations.
the decline of discipline within the army convinced increasing numbers of high ranking officers that the united states must extricate itself from vietnam.
public support for the war was rapidly waning.
in 1969 the new york times published details of the my lai massacre of 1968 in which a company h o w d i d v i e t n a m a n d t h e wa t e r g a t e s c a n d a l a f f e c t p o p u l a r t r u s t i n t h e g o v e r n m e n t.

in 1971 the times began publishing the pentagon papers a classified report prepared by the defense department that traced american involvement in vietnam back to world war ii and revealed how successive presidents had misled the american people about it.
in a landmark freedom ofthe press decision the supreme court rejected nixons request for an injunction to halt publication.
in 1973 congress passed the war powers act.
the most vigorous assertion of congressional control over foreign policy in the nations history it required the president to seek congressional approval for the commitment of american troops overseas.
the end of the vietnam war early in 1973 nixon achieved what had eluded his predecessors a negotiated settlement in vietnam.
the paris peace agreement the result of five years of talks made possible the final withdrawal of american troops.
the compromise left in place the government of south vietnam but it also left north vietnamese and viet cong soldiers in control of parts of the south.
american bombing ceased and the military draft came to an end.
henceforth volunteers would make up the armed forces.
but the agreement did not solve the basic issue of the war whether vietnam would be one country or two.
that question was answered in the spring of 1975 when the north vietnamese launched a final military offensive.
the government of south vietnam collapsed the united states did not intervene except to evacuate the american embassy and vietnam was reunified under communist rule.
the only war the united states has ever lost vietnam was a military political and social disaster.
by the time it ended 58 000 americans had been killed along with 3 million to 4 million vietnamese.
the war cost the united states an estimated 100 billion.
but the nonmonetary price was far higher.
vietnam undermined americans confidence in their own institutions and challenged long standing beliefs about the country and its purposes.
two decades after the war ended former secretary of defense robert mcnamara published a memoir in which he admitted that the policy he had helped to shape had been terribly wrong ignorance of the history and culture of vietnam and a misguided belief that every communist movement in the world was a puppet of moscow he wrote had led the country into a war that he now profoundly regretted.
the new york times rejected mcnamaras apology.
the ghosts of those unlived lives the young men sent to their death for no purpose it declared could not so easily be wished away.
but the times itself like the rest of the political establishment had supported the war for most of its duration.
for far too long they had accepted its basic premise that the united states had the right to decide the fate of a faraway people about whom it knew almost nothing.
buttons and flags for sale at a rally in the early 1970s illustrate the linkage of support for the vietnam war and strong feelings of patriotism building blocks of the new conservatism.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 vietnam and watergate watergate by the time the war ended richard nixon was no longer president.
his domestic policies and foreign policy successes had contributed greatly to his reelection in 1972.
he won a landslide victory over liberal democrat george mcgovern receiving 60 percent of the popular vote.
nixon made deep inroads into former democratic strongholds in the south and among working class white northerners.
he carried every state but massachusetts.
but his triumph soon turned into disaster.
nixon was obsessed with secrecy and could not accept honest difference of opinion.
he viewed every critic as a threat to national security and developed an enemies list that included reporters politicians and celebrities unfriendly to the administration.
when the pentagon papers were published nixon created a special investigative unit known as the plumbers to gather information about daniel ellsberg the former government official who had leaked them to the press.
the plumbers raided the office of ellsbergs psychiatrist in search of incriminating records.
in june 1972 five former employees of nixons reelection committee took part in a break in at democratic party headquarters in the watergate apartment complex in washington d c a security guard called police who arrested the intruders.
no one knows precisely what the watergate burglars were looking for perhaps they intended to install listening devices and the botched robbery played little role in the 1972 presidential campaign.
but in 1973 judge john j sirica before whom the burglars were tried determined to find out who had sponsored the break in.
a pair of washington post journalists began publishing investigative stories that made it clear that persons close to the president had ordered the burglary and then tried to cover up white house involvement.
congressional hearings followed that revealed a wider pattern of wiretapping break ins and attempts to sabotage political opposition.
when it became known that nixon had made tape recordings of conversations in his office a special prosecutor the president had reluctantly appointed to investigate the watergate affair demanded copies.
the supreme court unanimously ordered nixon to provide them a decision that reaffirmed the principle that the president is not above the law.
nixons herbert blocks 1973 cartoon depicts americans disbelief as revelations related to the watergate scandal unfolded in washington.
fa l l week after week revelations about the scandal unfolded.
by mid 1974 it had become clear that whether or not nixon knew in advance of the watergate break in he had become involved immediately afterward in authorizing payments to the burglars to remain silent or commit perjury and he had ordered the fbi to halt its investigation of the crime.
in august 1974 the house judiciary committee voted to recommend that nixon be impeached for conspiracy to obstruct justice.
his political support having evaporated nixon became the only president in history to resign.
nixons presidency remains a classic example of the abuse of political power.
in 1973 his vice president spiro t agnew resigned after revelations that he had accepted bribes from construction firms while serving as governor of maryland.
nixons attorney general john mitchell and white house aides h r haldeman and john ehrlichman were convicted of obstruction of justice in the watergate affair and went to jail.
as for the h o w d i d v i e t n a m a n d t h e wa t e r g a t e s c a n d a l a f f e c t p o p u l a r t r u s t i n t h e g o v e r n m e n t.
president he insisted that he had done nothing wrong or at any rate that previous presidents had also been guilty of lying and illegality.
although it hardly excused his behavior nixon had a point.
his departure from office was followed by senate hearings headed by frank church of idaho that laid bare a history of abusive actions that involved every administration since the beginning of the cold war.
in violation of the law the fbi had spied on millions of americans and had tried to disrupt the civil rights movement.
the cia had conducted secret operations to overthrow foreign governments and had tried to assassinate foreign leaders.
it had even recruited a secret army to fight in laos a neighbor of vietnam.
abuses of power in other words went far beyond the misdeeds of a single president.
along with watergate the pentagon papers and the vietnam war itself the church committee revelations seriously undermined americans confidence in their own government.
they led congress to enact new restrictions on the power of the fbi and cia to spy on american citizens or conduct operations abroad without the knowledge of lawmakers.
congress also strengthened the freedom of information act foia initially enacted in 1966.
since 1974 the foia has allowed scholars journalists and ordinary citizens to gain access to millions of pages of records of federal agencies.
liberals who had despised nixon throughout his career celebrated his downfall.
they did not realize that the revulsion against watergate undermined the foundations of liberalism itself already weakened by the divisions of the 1960s.
for liberalism rests in part on belief in the ability of government especially the federal government to solve social problems and promote both the public good and individual freedom.
nixons fall and the revelations of years of governmental misconduct helped to convince many americans that conservatives were correct when they argued that to protect liberty it was necessary to limit washingtons power over americans lives.
the watergate crisis also distracted attention from the economic crisis that began in the fall of 1973.
its inability to fashion a response to this crisis which gripped the united states for much of the 1970s dealt liberalism yet another blow.
the end of the golden age the decline of m a n u fac t u r i n g during the 1970s the long period of postwar economic expansion and consumer prosperity came to an end succeeded by slow growth and high inflation.
there were many reasons for the end of capitalisms golden age with american prosperity seemingly unassailable and the military industrial complex thriving successive administrations had devoted little attention to the less positive economic consequences of the cold war.
to strengthen its anticommunist allies the united states promoted the industrial reconstruction of japan and germany and the emergence of new centers of manufacturing in places like south korea and taiwan.
it encouraged american companies to invest in overseas plants and did not complain when allies protected their own industries while seeking unrestricted access to the american market.
imports of foreign steel for example led to growing problems for this key industry at home.

26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 the end of the golden age to gold by the bretton woods agreement of 1944 made it harder to sell american goods overseas discussed in chapter 22.
in 1971 for the first time in the twentieth century the united states experienced a merchandise trade deficit that is it imported more goods than it exported.
by 1980 nearly three quarters of goods produced in the united states were competing with foreign made products and the number of manufacturing workers 38 percent of the american workforce in 1960 had fallen to 28 percent.
moreover the war in vietnam produced ever higher federal deficits and rising inflation.
in 1971 nixon announced the most radical change in economic policy since the great depression.
he took the united states off the gold standard ending the bretton woods agreement that fixed the value of the dollar and other currencies in terms of gold.
henceforth the worlds currencies would float in relation to one another their worth determined not by treaty but by international currency markets.
nixon hoped that lowering the dollars value in terms of the german mark and japanese yen would promote exports by making american goods cheaper overseas and reduce imports since foreign products would be more expensive in the united states.
but the end of fixed currency rates injected a new element of instability into the world economy.
nixon also ordered wages and prices frozen for ninety days.
stagflation during the oil crisis of 1973 americans confronted rising gasoline prices and widespread shortages.
some gas stations closed and were turned to other uses like this one in potlatch washington which became a religious meeting hall the pumps now offering salvation rather than gasoline.
these policies temporarily curtailed inflation and reduced imports.
but in 1973 a brief war broke out between israel and its neighbors egypt and syria.
middle eastern arab states retaliated for western support of israel by quadrupling the price of oil and suspending the export of oil to the united states for several months.
long lines of cars appeared at american gas stations which either ran out of fuel or limited how much a customer could buy.
a second oil shock occurred in 1979 as a result of the revolution that overthrew the shah of iran discussed later.
because the rapidly growing demand for fuel by cars and factories outstripped domestic supplies by 1973 the united states imported one third of its oil.
europe and japan depended even more heavily on oil imports.
to promote energy conservation congress lowered the speed limit on interstate highways to fiftyfive miles per hour and many public buildings reduced heat and lighting.
the energy crisis of the 1970s drew increased attention to domestic energy resources like oil coal and natural gas.
while the rest of the economy stagnated western energy production grew apace.
oil was discovered in alaska in 1968 and in 1977 a pipeline opened to facilitate its shipment to the rest of the country.
coal production in wyoming boomed.
western energy companies benefited from the high oil prices set by opec the organization of petroleum exporting countries.
in what ways did the opportunities of most americans diminish in the 1970s.
but rising oil prices rippled through the world economy contributing to the combination of stagnant economic growth and high inflation known as stagflation between 1973 and 1981 the rate of inflation in developed countries was 10 percent per year and the rate of economic growth only 2 4 percent a sharp deterioration from the economic conditions of the 1960s.
the so called misery index the sum of the unemployment and inflation rates stood at 10 8 when the decade began.
by 1980 it had almost doubled.
as oil prices rose many americans shifted from large domestically produced cars known for high gasoline consumption to smaller more fuel efficient imports.
by the end of the decade japan had become the worlds leading automobile producer and imports accounted for nearly 25 percent of car sales in the united states.
the beleaguered social compact the economic crisis contributed to a breakdown of the postwar social compact.
faced with declining profits and rising overseas competition corporations stepped up the trend already under way before 1970 toward eliminating well paid manufacturing jobs through automation and shifting production to low wage areas of the united states and overseas.
the effects on older industrial cities were devastating.
by 1980 detroit and chicago had lost more than half the manufacturing jobs that had existed three decades earlier.
smaller industrial cities suffered even sharper declines.
as their tax bases shriveled many found themselves unable to maintain public services.
in paterson new jersey where great silk factories had arisen in the early twentieth century deindustrialization left a landscape of abandoned manufacturing plants.
the poverty rate reached 20 percent the city sold off public library buildings to raise cash and the schools became so run down and overcrowded that the state government took control.
the accelerating flow of jobs investment and population to the nonunion low wage states of the sunbelt increased the political influence of this conservative region.

in some manufacturing centers political and economic leaders welcomed the opportunity to remake their cities as finance information and entertainment hubs.
in new york the construction of the world trade center completed in 1977 symbolized this shift in the economy.

the defensive always a junior partner in the democratic coalition the labor movement found itself forced onto the defensive.
it has remained there ever since.
one example of the weakening of unions power came in 1975 with the new york city fiscal crisis.
deeply in debt and unable to market its bonds the city faced the prospect of bankruptcy.
the solution to the crisis required a reduction of the citys workforce severe cuts in the budgets of schools parks and the subway system and an end to the century old policy of free tuition at the city university.
even in this center of unionism workingclass new yorkers had no choice but to absorb job losses and a drastic decline in public services.
the weakening of unions and the continuation of the economys longterm shift from manufacturing to service employment had an adverse impact on ordinary americans.
between 1953 and 1973 median family income had doubled.
but beginning in 1973 real wages essentially did not rise for twenty years.
the 1970s was one of only two decades in the twentieth century the other being the 1930s that ended with americans on average poorer than when it began.
the popular song the river by bruce springsteen captured the woes of blue collar workers is a dream a lie if it dont come true or is it something worse ford on as president economic problems dogged the presidencies of nixons successors.
gerald ford who had been appointed to replace vice president agnew succeeded to the white house when nixon resigned.
ford named nelson rockefeller of new york as his own vice president.
thus for the only time in american history both offices were occupied by persons for whom no one had actually voted.
among his first acts as president ford pardoned nixon shielding him from prosecution for obstruction of justice.
ford claimed that he wanted the country to put the watergate scandal behind it.
but the pardon proved to be widely unpopular.
in domestic policy fords presidency lacked significant accomplishment.
ford and his chief economic adviser alan greenspan believed that americans spent too much on consumption and saved too little leaving business with insufficient money for investment.
they called for cutting taxes on business and lessening government regulation of the economy.
but the democratic majority in congress was in no mood to accept these in what ways did the opportunities of most americans diminish in the 1970s.

to combat inflation ford urged americans to shop wisely reduce expenditures and wear win buttons for whip inflation now.
although inflation fell joblessness continued to rise.
during the steep recession of 1974 1975 unemployment exceeded 9 percent the highest level since the depression.
in the international arena 1975 witnessed the major achievement of fords presidency.
in a continuation of nixons policy of dtente the united states and soviet union signed an agreement at helsinki finland that recognized the permanence of europes post world war ii boundaries including the division of germany.
in addition both superpowers agreed to respect the basic liberties of their citizens.
secretary of state kissinger and his soviet counterpart andrey gromyko assumed that this latter pledge would have little practical effect.
but over time the helsinki accords inspired movements for greater freedom within the communist countries of eastern europe.
the carter administration in the presidential election of 1976 jimmy carter a former governor of georgia narrowly defeated ford.
a graduate of the u s.
naval academy who president gerald ford tried to enlist later became a peanut farmer carter was virtually unknown outside his state americans in his whip inflation now when he launched his campaign for the democratic nomination.
but realizprogram.
it did not succeed.
ing that watergate and vietnam had produced a crisis in confidence in the federal government he turned his obscurity into an advantage.
carter ran for president as an outsider making a virtue of the fact that he had never held federal office.
a devout born again baptist he spoke openly of his religious convictions.
his promise ill never lie to you resonated with an electorate tired of official dishonesty.
carter had much in common with progressives of the early twentieth century.
his passions were making government more efficient protecting the environment and raising the moral tone of politics.
unlike the progressives however he embraced the aspirations of the presidential black americans.
his inaugural address as governor of election of 1976 georgia in 1971 had apologized for past mistreatment of the states black population.
as president carter appointed an unprecedented number of blacks to important positions including andrew young a former lieutenant of martin luther king jr as ambassador to the united nations.
and the economic crisis although his party controlled both houses carter often found himself at odds with congress.
he viewed inflation not unemployment as the countrys main economic problem and to combat it he promoted cuts in spending on domestic programs.
in the hope that increased competition would reduce prices his administration deregulated the trucking and airline industries.
carter supported the federal reserve banks decision to raise interest rates to curtail economic activity until both wages and prices fell traditionally a republican policy.

26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 the deregulation of the airline industry produced lower fares but also a drastic decline in service.
before deregulation with prices fixed airlines sought to attract customers by providing good service.
today fares are low but passengers are jammed in like sardines and have to pay for checked baggage onboard meals and other amenities.
the end of the golden age thanks to the overthrow of the shah of iran discussed later and inflation did not decline.
carter also believed that expanded use of nuclear energy could help reduce dependence on imported oil.
for years proponents of nuclear power had hailed it as an inexpensive way of meeting the countrys energy needs.
by the time carter took office more than 200 nuclear plants were operating or on order.
but in 1979 the industry suffered a near fatal blow when an accident at the three mile island plant in pennsylvania released a large amount of radioactive steam into the atmosphere.
the rise of the environmental movement had promoted public skepticism about scientific experts who touted the miraculous promise of technological innovations without concern for their social consequences.
the three mile island mishap reinforced fears about the environmental hazards associated with nuclear energy and put a halt to the industrys expansion.
since the new deal democrats had presented themselves as the party of affluence and economic growth.
but carter seemed to be presiding over a period of national decline.
it did not help his popularity when in a speech in 1979 he spoke of a national crisis of confidence and seemed to blame it on the american people themselves and their mistaken idea of freedom as self indulgence and consumption the emergence of human rights politics under carter a commitment to promoting human rights became a centerpiece of american foreign policy for the first time.
he was influenced by the proliferation of information about global denials of human rights spread by nongovernmental agencies like amnesty international and the international league for human rights.
the american membership of amnesty international a london based organization grew from 6 000 to the 1979 accident at the three mile island nuclear plant in pennsylvania brought a halt to the industrys expansion.
in what ways did the opportunities of most americans diminish in the 1970s.
35 000 between 1970 and 1976.
its reports marked a significant break with dominant ideas about international affairs since world war ii which had viewed the basic division in the world as between communist and noncommunist countries.
such reports along with congressional hearings factfinding missions and academic studies of human rights exposed misdeeds not only by communist countries but also by american allies especially the death squads of latin american dictatorships.
information is the core work of the movement amnesty international declared.
its findings aroused widespread indignation and pressured elected officials in the united states to try to do something to promote human rights abroad.
in 1978 carter cut off aid to the brutal military dictatorship governing argentina which in the name of anticommunism had launched a dirty war against its own citizens kidnapping off the streets and secretly murdering an estimated 10 000 to 30 000 persons.
carters action was a dramatic gesture as argentina was one of the most important powers in latin america and previous american administrations had turned a blind eye to human rights abuses by cold war allies.
by the end of his presidency the phrase human rights had acquired political potency.
its very vagueness was both a weakness and a strength.
it was difficult to define exactly what rights should and should not be considered universally applicable but various groups could and did unite under the umbrella of global human rights.
carter believed that in the post vietnam era american foreign policy should de emphasize cold war thinking.
combating poverty in the third world preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting human rights should take priority over what he called the inordinate fear of communism that once led us to embrace any dictator who joined us in that fear in one of his first acts as president he offered an unconditional pardon to vietnam era draft resisters.
in a 1977 address he insisted that foreign policy could not be separated from questions of justice equity and human rights carters emphasis on pursuing peaceful solutions to international problems and his willingness to think outside the cold war framework yielded important results.
in 1979 he brought the leaders of egypt and israel to the presidential retreat at camp david and brokered a historic peace agreement between the two countries.
he improved american relations with latin america by agreeing to a treaty ratified by the senate in 1978 that provided for the transfer of the panama canal to local control by the year 2000.
in 1979 he resisted calls for intervention when a popular revolution led by the left wing sandinista movement overthrew nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza a longtime ally of the united states.
carter attempted to curb the murderous violence of death squads allied to the right wing government of el salvador and in 1980 he suspended military aid after the murder of four american nuns by members of the countrys army.
he signed the salt ii agreement with the president jimmy carter center egyptian president anwar sadat left and israeli prime minister menachem begin right celebrating the signing of the 1979 peace treaty between israel and egypt.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 the end of the golden age soviets which reduced the number of missiles bombers and nuclear warheads.
both conservative cold warriors and foreign policy realists severely criticized carters emphasis on human rights.
he himself found it impossible to translate rhetoric into action.
he criticized american arms sales to the rest of the world.
but with thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in corporate profits at stake he did nothing to curtail them.
the united states continued its support of allies with records of serious human rights violations such as the governments of guatemala the philippines south korea and iran.
indeed the american connection with the shah of iran whose secret police regularly jailed and tortured political opponents proved to be carters undoing.
the television gave extensive coverage to the plight of american hostages in iran in 1979 1980 leading many americans to view the carter administration as weak and inept.
iran crisis and afghanistan occupying a strategic location on the southern border of the soviet union iran was a major supplier of oil and an importer of american military equipment.
at the end of 1977 carter traveled there to help celebrate the shahs rule causing the internal opposition to become more and more antiamerican.
early in 1979 a popular revolution inspired by the exiled muslim cleric ayatollah khomeini overthrew the shah and declared iran an islamic republic.
the iranian revolution marked an ideological shift in opposition movements in the middle east from socialism and arab nationalism to religious fundamentalism.
this would have important long term consequences for the united states.
more immediately when carter in november 1979 allowed the deposed shah to seek medical treatment in the united states khomeinis followers invaded the american embassy in tehran and seized fifty three hostages.
they did not regain their freedom until january 1981 on the day carters term as president ended.
events in iran made carter seem helpless and inept and led to a rapid fall in his popularity.
another crisis that began in 1979 undermined american relations with moscow.
at the end of that year the soviet union sent thousands of troops into afghanistan to support a friendly government threatened by an islamic rebellion.
in the long run afghanistan became the soviet vietnam an unwinnable conflict whose mounting casualties seriously weakened the government at home.
initially however it seemed another example of declining american power.
declaring the invasion the greatest crisis since world war ii a considerable exaggeration the president announced the carter doctrine declaring that the united states would use military force if necessary to protect its interests in the persian gulf.
he placed an embargo on grain exports to the soviet union and organized a western boycott of the 1980 olympics which took place in moscow.
he withdrew the salt ii treaty from consideration by the senate and dramatically increased american military spending.
in a reversion to the cold war principle that any opponent of the soviet union deserved american support the united states funneled aid to fundamentalist muslims in afghanistan who fought a decade long guerrilla war against the soviets.
the alliance had unforeseen consequences.
a faction of islamic fundamentalists known as the taliban eventually came to power in afghanistan.
tragically they would prove as hostile to the united states as to moscow.
in what ways did the opportunities of most americans diminish in the 1970s.
in an unsuccessful attempt to bring down inflation carter had abandoned the keynesian economic policy of increased government spending to combat recession in favor of high interest rates.
he had cut back on social spending and the federal governments economic regulations while projecting a major increase in the military budget.
by 1980 dtente had been eclipsed and the cold war reinvigorated.
thus many of the conservative policies associated with his successor ronald reagan were already in place when carters presidency ended.
t h e r i s i n g t i d e o f c o n s e r vat i s m the combination of domestic and international dislocations during the 1970s created a widespread sense of anxiety among americans and offered conservatives new political opportunities.
economic problems heightened the appeal of lower taxes reduced government regulation and cuts in social spending to spur business investment.
fears about a decline of american power in the world led to calls for a renewal of the cold war.
the civil rights and sexual revolutions produced resentments that undermined the democratic coalition.
rising urban crime rates reinforced demands for law and order and attacks on courts considered too lenient toward criminals.
these issues brought new converts to the conservative cause.
as the 1970s went on conservatives abandoned overt opposition to the black struggle for racial justice.
the fiery rhetoric and direct confrontation tactics of bull connor george wallace and other proponents of massive resistance were succeeded by appeals to freedom of association local control and resistance to the power of the federal government.
this language of individual freedom resonated throughout the country appealing especially to the growing predominantly white suburban population that was fleeing the cities and their urban problems.
the suburbs would become one of the bastions of modern conservatism.
but it was not just a reaction to the 1960s and the spread of conservative ideas that nourished the movement.
like predecessors as diverse as the civil rights and labor movements conservatives organized at the grass roots.
in order to spread conservative doctrines they ran candidates for office even when they had little chance of winning and worked to change the policies of local institutions like school boards town councils and planning commissions.
one set of recruits was the neoconservatives a group of intellectuals who charged that the 1960s had produced a decline in moral standards and respect for authority.
once supporters of liberalism they had come to believe that even well intentioned government social programs did more harm than good.
welfare for example not only failed to alleviate poverty but also encouraged single motherhood and undermined the work ethic.
high taxes and expensive government regulations drained resources from productive enterprises stifling economic growth.
neoconservatives repudiated the attempts by nixon ford and carter to reorient foreign policy away from the cold war.
carters focus on human rights and alleged blindness to the soviet threat they argued endangered the survival of freedom conservative think tanks created during the 1970s like the heritage foundation and the american enterprise institute refined and spread these ideas.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 the rising tide of conservatism the the reverend jerry falwell leader of the moral majority with some of his followers.
religious right the rise of religious fundamentalism during the 1970s expanded conservatisms popular base.
challenged by the secular and material concerns of american society some denominations tried to bring religion into harmony with these interests others reasserted more traditional religious values.
the latter approach seemed to appeal to growing numbers of americans.
even as membership in mainstream denominations like episcopalianism and presbyterianism declined evangelical protestantism flourished.
some observers spoke of a third great awakening like those of the 1740s and early nineteenth century.
the election of carter the first born again christian to become president highlighted the growing influence of evangelical religion.
but unlike carter most fundamentalists who entered politics did so as conservatives.
evangelical christians had become more and more alienated from a culture that seemed to them to trivialize religion and promote immorality.
they demanded the reversal of supreme court decisions banning prayer in public schools protecting pornography as free speech and legalizing abortion.
although it spoke of restoring traditional values the religious right proved remarkably adept at using modern technology including mass mailings and televised religious programming to raise funds for their crusade and spread their message.
in 1979 jerry falwell a virginia minister created the self styled moral majority devoted to waging a war against sin and electing pro life pro family pro america candidates to office.
falwell identified supporters of abortion rights easy divorce and military unpreparedness as the forces of satan who sought to undermine gods special plans for this great free country of ours christian conservatives seemed most agitated by the ongoing sexual revolution which they saw as undermining the traditional family and promoting immorality.
as a result of the 1960s they believed american freedom was out of control.
the growing assertiveness of the new gay movement spurred an especially fierce reaction.
in 1977 after a campaign led by the popular singer anita bryant a familiar fixture in televised orange juice commercials dade county florida passed an anti gay ordinance under the banner save our children the battle over the equal rights amendment during the 1970s family values moved to the center of conservative politics nowhere more so than in the battle over the equal rights amendment era.
originally proposed during the 1920s by alice paul and the womens party the era had been revived by second wave feminists.
in the wake of the rights revolution the amendments affirmation that what were the roots of the rise of conservatism in the 1970s.
doug marlettes cartoon comments on the continuing gap in pay between men and women the kind of inequality that inspired support for the proposed equal rights amendment.
equality of rights under the law could not be abridged on account of sex hardly seemed controversial.
in 1972 with little opposition congress approved the era and sent it to the states for ratification.
designed to eliminate obstacles to the full participation of women in public life it aroused unexpected protest from those who claimed it would discredit the role of wife and homemaker.
the era debate reflected a division among women as much as a battle of the sexes.
to its supporters the amendment offered a guarantee of womens freedom in the public sphere.
to its foes freedom for women still resided in the divinely appointed roles of wife and mother.
phyllis schlafly who helped to organize opposition to the era insisted that the free enterprise system was the real liberator of women since labor saving home appliances offered more genuine freedom than whining about past injustices or seeking fulfillment outside the home.
opponents claimed that the era would let men off the hook by denying their responsibility to provide for their wives and children.
polls consistently showed that a majority of americans male and female favored the era.
but thanks to the mobilization of conservative women the amendment failed to achieve ratification by the required thirty eight states.
the abortion controversy an even more bitter battle emerged in the 1970s over abortion rights another example to conservatives of how liberals in office promoted sexual immorality at the expense of moral values.
the movement to reverse the 1973 roe v wade decision began among roman catholics whose church condemned abortion under any circumstances.
but it soon enlisted evangelical protestants and social conservatives more generally.
life the movement insisted begins at conception and abortion is nothing less than murder.
between this position and the feminist insistence that a womans right to control her body includes the right to a safe legal abortion compromise was impossible.
ironically both sides showed how the rights revolution had reshaped the language of politics.
defenders of abortion exalted the right to ch.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 the rising tide of conservatism a 1979 anti abortion rally in washington d c on the sixth anniversary of the supreme courts decision in roe v wade which barred states from limiting a womans right to terminate a pregnancy.
choose as the essence of freedom.
opponents called themselves the right to life movement and claimed to represent the rights of the unborn child the abortion issue drew a bitter sometimes violent line through american politics.
it affected battles over nominees to judicial positions and led to demonstrations at family planning and abortion clinics.
the anti abortion movement won its first victory in 1976 when congress over president fords veto ended federal funding for abortions for poor women through the medicaid program.
by the 1990s a few fringe anti abortion activists were placing bombs at medical clinics and murdering doctors who terminated pregnancies.
to the end of the century most women would continue to have the legal right of access to abortion.
but in many areas the procedure became more and more difficult to obtain as hospitals and doctors stopped providing it.
the women demonstrating in support for abortion rights.
tax r e v o lt with liberals unable to devise an effective policy to counteract deindustrialization and declining real wages economic anxieties also created a growing constituency for conservative economics.
unlike during the great depression economic distress inspired a critique of government rather than of business.
new environmental regulations led to calls for less government intervention in the economy.
these were most strident in the west where measures to protect the environment threatened irrigation projects and private access to public lands.
but everywhere the economys descent from affluence to stagflation increased the appeal of the conservative argument that government regulation raised business costs and eliminated jobs.
economic decline also broadened the constituency receptive to demands for lower taxes.
to conservatives tax reductions served the dual purpose of enhancing business profits and reducing the resources available to visions of freedom phyllis schlafly campaigning against the equal rights amendment.
the activist phyllis schlafly pictured here leading a rally at the illinois state capitol in 1978 was instrumental in grassroots organization of conservative men and women in opposition to the proposed equal rights amendment to the constitution which would have barred all legal inequalities based on sex.
she claimed that the amendment would take away the right to be a housewife the amendments defeat was a major victory for the conservative movement.
questions 1.
what does the image suggest about conflicting ideas of the role of women in american society in the wake of the social and political divisions created by the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s.
why do opponents claim that the proposed amendment was a blow against american families.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 the rising tide of conservatism government thus making new social programs financially impossible.
many americans found taxes increasingly burdensome.
on paper their incomes were rising although the gains were nullified by inflation.
rising wages pushed families into higher tax brackets increasing the percentage of their income they had to pay the government.
in 1978 conservatives sponsored and california voters approved proposition 13 a ban on further increases in property taxes.
the vote demonstrated that the level of taxation could be a powerful political issue.
proposition 13 proved to be a windfall for businesses and home owners while reducing funds available for schools libraries and other public services.
many voters however proved willing to accept this result of lower taxes.
as anti tax sentiment flourished throughout the country many states followed californias lead.
a parallel upsurge of grassroots conservatism was reflected in the sagebrush rebellion the name given to a bill passed by the nevada legislature in 1979.
using the language of freedom from government tyranny leaders in western states denounced control of large areas of land by the bureau of land management in washington d c and insisted that the states themselves be given decision making power over issues like grazing rights mining development and whether public lands should be closed to fishing and hunting.
with the federal government reluctant to give up control over public lands in the west the sagebrush rebellion had few concrete accomplishments but it underscored the rising tide of antigovernment sentiment.
the election of by 1980 carters approval rating had fallen to 21 percent lower than nixons at the time of his resignation.
a conservative tide seemed to be rising throughout the western world.
in 1979 margaret thatcher became prime minister of great britain.
she promised to restore economic competitiveness by curtailing the power of unions reducing taxes selling state owned industries to the presidential private owners and cutting back the welfare state.
in the election of 1980 united states ronald reagans 1980 campaign for the presidency brought together the many strands of 1970s conser9 vatism.
he pledged to end stagflation and restore the coun4 trys dominant role in the world and its confidence in itself.
lets make america great again he proclaimed.
the era of self doubt is over 3 17 26 13 6 12 reagan also appealed skillfully to white backlash he kicked off his campaign in philadelphia mississippi where three civil rights workers had been murdered in 7 9 12 1964 with a speech emphasizing his belief in states rights.

reagan won the support of the religious right and conservative upholders of family values riding a wave of dissatisfaction with the countrys condition reagan swept into the white house.
he carried such democratic strongholds as illinois texas and new york.
because moderate republican john anderson running for president as an independent received about 7 percent of the popular vote reagan won only a bare majority although he commanded a substantial margin in the electoral college.
carter received 41 percent a humiliating defeat for a sitting president.
jimmy carters reputation improved after he left the white house.
he went to work for habitat for humanity an organization that constructs homes for poor families.
in the 1990s he negotiated a cease fire between warring muslim and serb forces in bosnia and arranged a peaceful transfer of power from the military to an elected government in haiti.
in 2002 carter was awarded the nobel peace prize.
his presidency however is almost universally considered a failure.
and his defeat in 1980 launched the reagan revolution which completed the transformation of freedom from the rallying cry of the left to a possession of the right.
the reagan revolution ronald reagan followed a most unusual path to the presidency.
originally a new deal democrat and head of the screen actors guild the only union leader ever to reach the white house he emerged in the 1950s as a spokesman for the general electric corporation preaching the virtues of unregulated capitalism.
his nominating speech for barry goldwater at the 1964 republican convention brought reagan to national attention.
two years later california voters elected reagan as governor establishing him as conservatives best hope of capturing the presidency.
in 1976 he challenged president ford for the republican nomination and came close to winning it.
his victory in 1980 brought to power a diverse coalition of old and new conservatives sunbelt suburbanites and urban working class ethnics antigovernment crusaders and advocates of a more aggressive foreign policy libertarians who believed in freeing the individual from restraint and the christian right which sought to restore what they considered traditional moral values to american life.
reagan and american freedom reagans opponents often underestimated him.
by the time he left office at the age of seventy seven he had become the oldest man ever to serve as president.
he rose at the crack of noon as one reporter put it and relied on his wife to arrange his official schedule.
unlike most modern presidents he was content to outline broad policy themes and leave their implementation to others.
reagan however was hardly a political novice having governed california during the turbulent 1960s.
an excellent public speaker his optimism and affability appealed to large numbers of americans.
reagan made conservatism seem progressive rather than an attempt to turn back the tide of progress.
he frequently quoted thomas paine we have it in our voices of freedom from redstockings manifesto 1969 redstockings was one of the radical feminist movements that arose in the late 1960s.
based in new york it issued this manifesto which in language typical of the era illustrates how at its most radical edge feminism had evolved from demands for equal treatment for women to a total critique of male power and a call for womens liberation after centuries of individual and preliminary political struggle women are uniting to achieve their final liberation from male supremacy.
redstockings is dedicated to building this unity and winning our freedom.
women are an oppressed class.
our oppression is total affecting every facet of our lives.
we are exploited as sex objects breeders domestic servants and cheap labor.
we are considered inferior beings whose only purpose is to enhance mens lives.
our humanity is denied.
our prescribed behavior is enforced by the threat of physical violence.
because we have lived so intimately with our oppressors in isolation from each other we have been kept from seeing our personal suffering as a political condition.
we identify the agents of our oppression as men.
male supremacy is the oldest most basic form of domination.
men have controlled all political economic and cultural institutions and backed up this control with physical force.
our chief task at present is to develop female class consciousness through sharing experience and publicly exposing the sexist foundation of all our institutions.
consciousness raising is not therapy which implies the existence of individual solutions and falsely assumes that the male female relationship is purely personal but the only method by which we can ensure that our program for liberation is based on the concrete realities of our lives.
the first requirement for raising class consciousness is honesty in private and in public with ourselves and other women.
we identify with all women.
we define our best interest as that of the poorest most brutally exploited women.
we call on all our sisters to unite with us in struggle.
we call on all men to give up their male privileges and support womens liberation in the interest of our humanity and their own.

i believe that americans want to see this country come back to basics back to values back to biblical morality back to sensibility and back to mobilize evangelical christians to ally with the patriotism.
activists of the 1970s and 1980s.
in language reminiscent of puritan jeremiads about the republican party.
we must reverse the trend america finds herself in today.
young people between the ages of twenty five and forty have been born and reared in a different world than americans of years past.
the television set has been their primary baby sitter.
from the television set they have learned situation ethics and immorality they have learned a loss of respect for human life.
they have learned to disrespect the family as god has established it.
they have been educated in a public school system that is permeated with secular humanism.
they have been taught that the bible is just another book of literature.
they have been taught that there are no absolutes in our world today.
they have been introduced to the drug culture.
they have been reared by the family and the public school in a society that is greatly void of discipline and character building.
every american who looks at the facts must share a deep concern and burden for our country.
if americans will face the truth our nation can be turned around and can be saved from the evils and the destruction that have fallen upon every other nation that has turned its back on god.
i personally feel that the home and the family it is now time to take a stand on certain moral issues and we can only stand if we have leaders.
we must stand against the equal rights amendment the feminist revolution and the homosexual revolution.
the hope of reversing the trends of decay in our republic now lies with the christian public in america.
we cannot expect help from the liberals.
they certainly are not going to call our nation back to righteousness and neither are the pornographers the smut peddlers and those who are corrupting our youth.
moral americans must be willing to put their reputations their fortunes and their very lives on the line for this great nation of ours.
would that we had the courage of our forefathers who knew the great responsibility that freedom carries with it.
questions 1.
how do the authors of the redstockings manifesto seem to define womens freedom.
what does falwell see as the main threats to moral values.
how do the two documents differ in their views about the role of women in american society.
26 the triumph of conservatism 1969 1988 a delegate to the republican national convention of 1980 wears a hat festooned with the flags of the united states and texas and a button with a picture of her hero ronald reagan.
the reagan revolution power to begin the world over again reagan repeatedly invoked the idea that america has a divinely appointed mission as a beacon of liberty and freedom freedom indeed became the watchword of the reagan revolution.
in his public appearances and state papers reagan used the word more often than any president before him.
reagan reshaped the nations agenda and political language more effectively than any president since franklin d roosevelt.
like fdr he seized on the vocabulary of his opponents and gave it new meaning.
reagan promised to free government from control by special interests but these were racial minorities unionists and others hoping to use washingtons power to attack social inequalities not businessmen seeking political favors the traditional target of liberals.
his justice department made the principle that the constitution must be color blind a remark hurled at the supreme court majority by justice john marshall harlan in 1896 to challenge a system of legal segregation a justification for gutting civil rights enforcement.
overall reagan proved remarkably successful at seizing control of the terms of public debate.
on issues ranging from taxes to government spending national security crime welfare and traditional values he put democrats on the defensive.
but he also proved to be a pragmatist recognizing when to compromise so as not to fragment his diverse coalition of supporters.
reaganomics like roosevelt and johnson before him reagan spoke of economic freedom and proposed an economic bill of rights but in contrast to his predecessors who used these phrases to support combating poverty and strengthening economic security economic freedom for reagan meant curtailing the power of unions dismantling regulations and radically reducing taxes.
taxation he declared violated the principle that the right to earn your own keep and keep what you earn was what it means to be free in 1981 reagan persuaded congress to reduce the top tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent and to index tax brackets to take inflation into account.
five years later the tax reform act reduced the rate on the wealthiest americans to 28 percent.
these measures marked a sharp retreat from the principle of progressivity the idea that the wealthy should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than other citizens one of the ways twentieth century societies tried to address the unequal distribution of wealth.
reagan also appointed conservative heads of regulatory agencies who cut back on environmental protection and workplace safety rules about which business had complained for years.
since the new deal liberals had tried to promote economic growth by using the power of the government to bolster ordinary americans purchasing power.
reagans economic program known as supply side economics by proponents and trickle down economics by critics relied on high interest rates to curb inflation and lower tax rates especially for businesses and high income americans to stimulate private investment.
the policy assumed that cutting taxes would inspire americans at all income levels to work harder since they would keep more of the money they earned.
everyone would benefit from increased business profits and because of a growing economy government receipts would rise despite lower tax rates.
how did the reagan presidency affect americans both at home and abroad.
reagan and labor reagan inaugurated an era of hostility between the federal government and organized labor.
in august 1981 when 13 000 members of patco the union of air traffic controllers began a strike in violation of federal law reagan fired them all.
he used the military to oversee the nations air traffic system until new controllers could be trained.
reagans action inspired many private employers to launch anti union offensives.
the hiring of workers to replace permanently those who had gone on strike a rare occurrence before 1980 became widespread.
manufacturing employment where union membership was concentrated meanwhile continued its long term decline.
by the mid1990s the steel industry employed only 170 000 persons down from 600 000 in 1973.
when reagan left office both the service and retail sectors employed more americans than manufacturing and only 11 percent of workers with non government jobs were union members.
reaganomics as critics dubbed the administrations policies initially produced the most severe recession since the 1930s.
a long period of economic expansion however followed the downturn of 1981 1982.
as companies downsized their workforces shifted production overseas and took advantage of new technologies such as satellite communications they became more profitable.
at the same time the rate of inflation 13 5 percent at the beginning of 1981 declined to 3 5 percent in 1988 partly because a period of expanded oil production that drove down prices succeeded the shortages of the 1970s.
the stock market rose substantially.
in october 1987 the market suffered its sharpest drop since 1929 but stocks soon resumed their upward climb.
the problem of inequality together reagans policies rising stock prices and deindustrialization resulted in a considerable rise in economic inequality.
by the mid 1990s the richest 1 percent of americans owned 40 percent of the nations wealth twice their share twenty years earlier.
most spent their income not on productive investments and charity as supply side economists had promised but on luxury goods real estate speculation and corporate buyouts that often led to plant closings as operations were consolidated.
the income of middle class families especially those with a wife who did not work outside the home stagnated while that of the poorest one fifth of the population declined.
because of falling investment in public housing the release of mental patients from state hospitals and cuts in welfare homeless persons became a visible fixture on the streets of cities from new york to los angeles.
deindustrialization and the decline of the labor movement had a particularly devastating impact on minority workers who had only recently this photograph of the remains of the sprague electric company in north adams massachusetts which closed in 1985 depicts the aftermath of deindustrialization.

the reagan revolution gained a foothold in better paying manufacturing jobs.
thanks to the opening of colleges and professional schools to minority students as a result of the civil rights movement and affirmative action programs the black middle class expanded considerably.
but black workers traditionally the last hired and first fired were hard hit by economic changes.
during the 1970s jim crow had finally ended in many workplaces and unions.
but just as decades of painful efforts to obtain better jobs bore fruit hundreds of thousands of black workers lost their jobs when factories closed their doors.
in south gate a working class suburb of los angeles for example the giant firestone tire factory shut down in 1980 only a few years after black and latino workers had made their first breakthroughs in employment.
when the national unemployment rate reached 8 9 percent at the end of 1981 the figure for blacks exceeded 20 percent.
nor did black workers share fully in the recovery that followed.
few had the education to take advantage of job openings in growing knowledge based industries like technology and information services.
overall during the 1980s black males fell farther than any other group in the population in terms of wages and jobs.
the second gilded age in retrospect the 1980s like the 1890s would be widely remembered as a decade of misplaced values.

how did the reagan presidency affect americans both at home and abroad.
conservatives and reagan while he implemented their economic policies reagan in some ways disappointed ardent conservatives.
the administration sharply reduced funding for great society antipoverty programs such as food stamps school lunches and federal financing of low income housing.
but it left intact core elements of the welfare state such as social security medicare and medicaid which many conservatives wished to curtail significantly or repeal.
the reagan era did little to advance the social agenda of the christian right.
abortion remained legal women continued to enter the labor force in unprecedented numbers and reagan even appointed the first female member of the supreme court sandra day oconnor.
in 1986 in bowers v hardwick in a rare victory for cultural conservatives the supreme court did uphold the constitutionality of state laws outlawing homosexual acts.
in 2003 the justices would reverse the bowers decision declaring laws that criminalized homosexuality unconstitutional.
reagan gave verbal support to a proposed constitutional amendment restoring prayer in public schools but did little to promote its passage.
the administration launched a just say no campaign against illegal drug use.
but this failed to halt the spread in urban areas of crack a potent inexpensive form of cocaine that produced an upsurge of street crime and family breakdown.
reagans justice department cut back on civil rights enforcement and worked to curtail affirmative action programs.
but to the end of reagans presidency the supreme court continued to approve plans by private employers and city and state governments to upgrade minority employment.
figure 26 3 changes in families real income 1980 1990 15 6 percentage change in real income urban professional who earned a high income working in a bank or stock brokerage firm and spent lavishly on designer clothing and other trappings of the good life became a household word.
television shows like dallas and dynasty chronicled the activities of the very rich for a mass audience.
taxpayers footed the bill for some of the consequences.
the deregulation of savings and loan associations banks that had generally confined themselves to financing home mortgages allowed these institutions to invest in unsound real estate ventures and corporate mergers.
losses piled up and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation which insured depositors accounts faced bankruptcy.
after reagan left office the federal government bailed out the savings and loan institutions at a cost to taxpayers estimated at 250 billion.
supply side advocates insisted that lowering taxes would enlarge government revenue by stimulating economic activity.
but spurred by large increases in funds for the military federal spending far outstripped income producing large budget deficits despite assurances by supply siders that this would not happen.
during reagans presidency the national debt tripled to 2 7 trillion.
nonetheless reagan remained immensely popular.
he took credit for economic expansion while blaming congressional leaders for the ballooning federal deficit.
he won a triumphant reelection in 1984.

reagan and the cold war in foreign policy reagan breathed new life into the rhetorical division of the world into a free west and unfree east.
he resumed vigorous denunciation of the soviet union calling it an evil empire and sponsored the largest military buildup in american history including new long range bombers and missiles.
in 1983 he proposed an entirely new strategy the strategic defense initiative based on developing a space based system to intercept and destroy enemy missiles.
the idea was not remotely feasible technologically and if deployed it would violate the anti ballistic missile treaty of 1972.
but it appealed to reagans desire to reassert americas worldwide power.
he persuaded nato over much opposition to introduce short range nuclear weapons into europe to counter soviet forces.
but the renewed arms race and reagans casual talk of winning a nuclear war caused widespread alarm at home and abroad.
in the early 1980s a movement for a nuclear freeze a halt to the development of nuclear weapons attracted millions of supporters in the united states and europe.
in 1983 half of the american population watched the day after a television program that unflinchingly depicted the devastation that would be caused by a nuclear war.
reagan came into office determined to overturn the vietnam syndrome as widespread public reluctance to commit american forces overseas was called.
he sent american troops to the caribbean island of grenada to oust a pro cuban government and he ordered the bombing of libya in retaliation for the countrys alleged involvement in a terrorist attack on a west berlin nightclub in which an american died.
in 1982 reagan dispatched marines as a peacekeeping force to lebanon where a civil war raged between the christian government supported by israeli forces and muslim insurgents.
but he quickly withdrew them after a bomb exploded at their barracks killing 241 americans.
the public reagan realized would support minor operations like grenada but remained unwilling to sustain heavy casualties abroad.
how did the reagan presidency affect americans both at home and abroad.
reagan generally relied on military aid rather than american troops to pursue his foreign policy objectives.
abandoning the carter administrations emphasis on human rights reagan embraced the idea advanced in 1979 by neoconservative writer jeane kirkpatrick that the united states should oppose totalitarian communists but assist authoritarian noncommunist regimes.
kirkpatrick became the american ambassador to the united nations and the united states stepped up its alliances with third world anticommunist dictatorships like the governments of chile and south africa.
the administration poured in funds to combat insurgencies against the governments of el salvador and guatemala whose armies and associated death squads committed flagrant abuses against their own citizens.
when el salvadors army massacred hundreds of civilians in the town of el mozote in 1981 the state department denied that the event widely reported in the press had taken place.
the iran contra a f fa i r american involvement in central america produced the greatest scandal of reagans presidency the iran contra affair.
in 1984 congress banned military aid to the contras derived from the spanish word for against fighting the sandinista government of nicaragua which as noted earlier had ousted the american backed dictator anastasio somoza in 1979.
in 1985 reagan secretly authorized the sale of arms to iran now involved in a war with its neighbor iraq in order to secure the release of a number of american hostages held by islamic groups in the middle east.
cia director william casey and lieutenant colonel oliver north of the national security council set up a system that diverted some of the proceeds to buy military supplies for the contras in defiance of the congressional ban.
the scheme continued for nearly two years.

trinidad tobago guyana brazil in 1987 after a middle eastern newspaper leaked the story congress held televised hearings that revealed a pattern of official duplicity and violation of the law reminiscent of the nixon era.
eleven members of the administration eventually were convicted of perjury or destroying documents or pleaded guilty before being tried.
reagan denied knowledge of the illegal proceedings but the iran contra affair undermined confidence that he controlled his own administration.
reagan and gorbachev in his second term to the surprise of both his foes and supporters reagan softened his anticommunist rhetoric and established good relations with soviet premier mikhail gorbachev.
gorbachev had come to power in 1985 bent on reforming the soviet unions repressive political system and reinvigorating its economy.
the country had fallen farther and farther how did the reagan presidency affect americans both at home and abroad.
behind the united states in the production and distribution of consumer goods and it relied increasingly on agricultural imports to feed itself.
gorbachev inaugurated policies known as glasnost political openness and perestroika economic reform.
gorbachev realized that significant change would be impossible without reducing his countrys military budget.
reagan was ready to negotiate.
a series of talks between 1985 and 1987 yielded more progress on arms control than in the entire postwar period to that point including an agreement to eliminate intermediate and short range nuclear missiles in europe.
in 1988 gorbachev began pulling soviet troops out of afghanistan.
having entered office as an ardent cold warrior reagan left with hostilities between the superpowers much diminished.
he even repudiated his earlier comment that the soviet union was an evil empire saying that it referred to another era reagans legacy reagans presidency revealed the contradictions at the heart of modern conservatism.
rhetorically he sought to address the concerns of the religious right advocating a return to spiritual values as a way to strengthen traditional families and local communities.
but in some ways the reagan revolution undermined the very values and institutions conservatives held dear.
intended to discourage reliance on government handouts by rewarding honest work and business initiative reagans policies inspired a speculative frenzy that enriched architects of corporate takeovers and investors in the stock market while leaving in their wake plant closings job losses and devastated communities.
nothing proved more threatening to local traditions or family stability than deindustrialization insecurity about employment and the relentless downward pressure on wages.
nothing did more to undermine a sense of common national purpose than the widening gap between rich and poor.
because of the iran contra scandal and the enormous deficits the government had accumulated reagan left the presidency with his reputation somewhat tarnished.
nonetheless few figures have so successfully changed the landscape and language of politics.
reagans vice president george h w bush defeated michael dukakis the governor of massachusetts in the 1988 election partly because dukakis could not respond effectively to the charge that he was a liberal now a term of political abuse.
conservative assumptions about the virtues of the free market and the evils of big government dominated the mass media and political debates.
those receiving public assistance had come to be seen not as citizens entitled to help in coping with economic misfortune but as a drain on taxes.
during the 1990s these and other conservative ideas would be embraced almost as fully by president bill clinton a democrat as by reagan and the republicans.
the election of the 1988 election seemed to show politics sinking to new lows.
television advertisements and media exposs now dominated political campaigns.
the race for the democratic nomination had hardly begun before the president reagan visited moscow in 1988 cementing his close relationship with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev.
they were photographed in red square.

suggested reading front runner senator gary hart of colorado withdrew after a newspaper reported that he had spent the night at his washington town house with a woman other than his wife.
both parties ran negative campaigns.
democrats ridiculed the republican vice presidential nominee senator dan quayle of indiana for factual and linguistic mistakes.
republicans spread unfounded rumors that michael dukakiss wife had burned an american flag during the 1960s.
the low point of the campaign came in a republican television ad depicting the threatening image of willie horton a black murderer and rapist who had been furloughed from prison during dukakiss term as governor of massachusetts.
rarely in the modern era had a major party appealed so blatantly to racial fears.
before his death in 1991 lee atwater who masterminded bushs campaign apologized for the horton ad.
although he did not match reagans landslide victory of 1984 bush achieved a substantial majority winning 54 percent of the popular vote.
democratic success in retaining control of congress suggested that an electoral base existed for a comeback.
but this would only occur if the party fashioned a new appeal to replace traditional liberalism which had been eclipsed by the triumph of conservatism.

to the astonishment of residents of the city more than 30 000 persons gathered to protest the meeting.
their marches and rallies brought together factory workers who claimed that global free trade encouraged corporations to shift production to low wage centers overseas and tree huggers as some reporters called environmentalists who complained about the impact on the earths ecology of unregulated economic development.

boundaries.
globalization has been called the concept of the 1990s during that decade the media resounded with announcements that a new era in human history had opened with a borderless economy and a global civilization that would soon replace traditional cultures.
some commentators claimed that the nation state itself had become obsolete in the globalized world.
globalization of course was hardly a new phenomenon.
the internationalization of commerce and culture and the reshuffling of the worlds peoples had been going on since the explorations of the fifteenth century.
but the scale and scope of late twentieth century globalization was unprecedented.
thanks to satellites and the internet information and popular culture flowed instantaneously to every corner of the world.
manufacturers and financial institutions scoured the world for profitable investment opportunities.
perhaps most important the collapse of communism between 1989 and 1991 opened the entire world to the spread of market capitalism and to the idea that government should interfere as little as possible with economic activity.
the free world triumphed over its communist rival the free market over the idea of a planned economy and the free individual over ideas of shared community and social citizenship.
american politicians and social commentators increasingly criticized the regulation of wages and working conditions assistance to the less fortunate and environmental protections as burdens on international competitiveness.
during the 1990s presidents george h w bush a republican and bill clinton a democrat both spoke of an american mission to create a single global free market as the path to rising living standards the spread of democracy and greater worldwide freedom.
similar demonstrations at economic summits overseas followed the seattle protests.
the media called the loose coalition of groups who organized the protests the antiglobalization movement.
in fact they challenged not globalization itself but its social consequences.
globalization the demonstrators claimed accelerated the worldwide creation of wealth but widened gaps between rich and poor countries and between haves and have nots within societies.
decisions affecting the day to day lives of millions of people were made by institutions the world trade organization international monetary fund world bank and multinational corporations that operated without any democratic input.
these international organizations required developing countries seeking financial aid to open their economies to penetration from abroad while reducing spending on domestic social concerns.
demonstrators demanded not an end to global trade and capital flows but the establishment of international standards for wages labor conditions and the environment and greater investment in health and education in poor countries.

workers teachers and even some government officials joined them until their numbers swelled to nearly 1 million.
both the reforms mikhail gorbachev had introduced in the soviet union and the example of american institutions inspired the protesters.
the students erected a figure reminiscent of the statue of liberty calling it the goddess of democracy and freedom in june chinese troops crushed the protest killing an unknown number of people possibly thousands.
in the fall of 1989 pro democracy demonstrations spread across eastern europe.
gorbachev made it clear that unlike in the past the soviet union would not intervene.

crowds breached the berlin wall which since 1961 had stood as the cold wars most prominent symbol.
one by one the regions communist governments agreed to give up power.
in 1990 a reunified german nation absorbed east germany.
the remarkably swift and almost entirely peaceful collapse of communism in eastern europe became known as the velvet revolution meanwhile the soviet union itself slipped deeper and deeper into crisis.
gorbachevs attempts at economic reform produced only chaos and his policy of political openness allowed long suppressed national and ethnic tensions to rise to the surface.
in 1990 the baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania which had been absorbed into the soviet union in 1940 declared their independence.
in august 1991 a group of military leaders attempted to seize power to overturn the governments plan to give greater autonomy to the various parts of the soviet union.
russian president boris yeltsin mobilized crowds in moscow that restored gorbachev to office.
gorbachev then resigned from the communist party ending its eighty four year rule.
one after another the republics of the soviet union declared themselves sovereign states.
at the end of 1991 the soviet union ceased to exist in its place were fifteen new independent nations.
the sudden and unexpected collapse of communism marked the end of the cold war and a stunning victory for the united states and its allies.
for the first time since 1917 there existed a truly worldwide capitalist system.
even china while remaining under communist party rule had already embarked on market reforms and rushed to attract foreign investment.

although the invasion cost the lives of over 3 000 panamanians and was condemned by the united nations general assembly as a violation of international law the administration deemed it a great success.

turkey spi georgia tbilisi greece athens ca black sea turkmenistan ashgabat war a far more serious crisis arose in 1990 when iraq invaded and annexed kuwait an oil rich sheikdom on the persian gulf.
fearing that iraqi dictator saddam hussein might next attack saudi arabia a longtime ally that supplied more oil to the united states than any other country bush rushed troops to defend the kingdom and warned iraq to withdraw from kuwait or face war.
his policy aroused intense debate in the united states.
critics insisted that diplomacy be given a chance to resolve the crisis.
bush spoke of defending the freedom of saudi arabia and restoring that of kuwait.
antiwar activists pointed out that neither qualified as a free country both for example denied women the right to vote.
but the iraqi invasion so flagrantly violated international law that bush succeeded in building a forty nation coalition committed to restoring kuwaits independence secured the support of the united nations and sent half a million american troops along with a naval armada to the region.
in february 1991 the united states launched operation desert storm which quickly drove the iraqi army from kuwait.
tens of thousands of iraqis and 184 americans died in the conflict.
the united nations ordered iraq to disarm and imposed economic sanctions that produced widespread civilian suffering for the rest of the decade.
but hussein remained in place.
so did a large american military establishment in saudi arabia to the outrage of islamic fundamentalists who deemed its presence an affront to their faith.

27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 the post cold war world president bush with defense secretary dick cheney left and general colin powell right chair of the joint chiefs of staff at a meeting in january 1991 shortly before the beginning of the gulf war.
cheney and powell would play major roles in the administration of bushs son president george w bush.
the gulf war was the first post cold war international crisis.
despite assembling a broad coalition the united states did nearly all of the fighting itself.
relying on high tech weaponry like cruise missiles that reached iraq from bases and aircraft carriers hundreds of miles away the united states was able to prevail quickly and avoid the prolonged involvement and high casualties of vietnam.
the soviet union in the process of disintegration remained on the sidelines.
in the wars immediate aftermath bushs public approval rating rose to an unprecedented 89 percent.
visions of a m e r i c a s role in a speech to congress president bush identified the gulf war as the first step in the struggle to create a world rooted in democracy and global free trade.
but it remained unclear how this broad vision would be translated into policy.
soon after the end of the war general colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and dick cheney the secretary of defense outlined different visions of the future.
powell predicted that the post cold war world would be a dangerous environment with conflicts popping up in unexpected places.
to avoid being drawn into an unending role as global policeman he insisted the united states should not commit its troops abroad without clear objectives and a timetable for withdrawal.
cheney argued that with the demise of the soviet union the united states possessed the power to reshape the world and prevent hostile states from achieving regional power.
it must be willing to use force independently if necessary to maintain its strategic dominance.
for the rest of the 1990s it was not certain which definition of the american role in the post cold war world would predominate.
the election of clinton had a presidential election been held in 1991 bush would undoubtedly have been victorious.
but in that year the economy slipped into recession.
in a kind of hangover from the speculative excesses of the reagan years unemployment rose and family income stagnated.
despite victory in the what were the major international initiatives of the clinton administration i n t h e a f t e r m a t h o f t h e c o l d wa r.
cold war and the gulf public opinion polls showed that the presidential more and more americans believed the country was on the election of 1992 wrong track.
no one seized more effectively on the widespread sense of unease than bill clinton a former governor of arkansas.
in 1992 clinton won the democratic nomina11 tion by combining social liberalism he supported abor3 tion rights gay rights and affirmative action for racial minorities with elements of conservatism he pledged to reduce government bureaucracy and borrowing a page 22 12 from republicans promised to end welfare as we know it.
a charismatic campaigner clinton conveyed sincere con7 9 cern for voters economic anxieties.
to counter republican rhetoric urging voters to blame their woes on welfare queens and others who cheated honest taxpayers clinton argued that deindustrialization caused rising inequality and electoral vote candidate share party the loss of good jobs.
in his speech accepting the nomina370 69 clinton democrat tion he spoke of people working harder than ever spend168 31 bush republican ing less time with their children working nights and weekperot independent ends while those who cut corners and cut deals have been rewarded bush by contrast seemed out of touch with the day to day lives of ordinary americans.
on the wall of democratic headquarters clintons campaign director posted the slogan its the economy stupid a reminder that the economic downturn was the democrats strongest card.
bush was further weakened when conservative leader pat buchanan delivered a fiery televised speech at the republican national convention that declared cultural war against gays feminists and supporters of abortion rights.
this seemed to confirm the democratic portrait of republicans as intolerant and divisive.
from a peak of 89 percent in 1991 bushs popularity slumped to 29 percent during the 1992 campaign.
a third candidate the eccentric texas billionaire ross perot also entered the fray.
he attacked bush and clinton as lacking the economic know how to deal with the recession and the ever increasing national debt.
that millions of americans considered perot a credible candidate at one point polls showed him leading both clinton and bush testified to widespread dissatisfaction with the major parties.
perots support faded as election day approached but he still received 19 percent of the popular vote the best result for a third party candidate since theodore roosevelt in 1912.
clinton won by a substantial margin a humiliating outcome for bush given his earlier popularity.
clinton in 3 15 popular vote share 44 908 254 43 39 102 343 38 19 741 065 19 office in his first two years in office clinton turned away from some of the social and economic policies of the reagan and bush years.
he appointed several blacks and women to his cabinet including janet reno the first female attorney general and named two supporters of abortion rights ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer to the supreme court.
he modified the militarys strict ban on gay soldiers instituting a dont ask dont tell policy by which officers would not seek out gays for dismissal from the armed edward sorels illustration for the cover of the new yorker depicts bill clinton at his 1993 inauguration flanked by some of his predecessors as president.
27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 the post cold war world forces.
his first budget raised taxes on the wealthy and significantly expanded the earned income tax credit eitc a cash payment for lowincome workers begun during the ford administration.
the most effective antipoverty policy since the great society the eitc raised more than 4 million americans half of them children above the poverty line during clintons presidency.
clinton shared his predecessors passion for free trade.
despite strong opposition from unions and environmentalists he obtained congressional approval in 1993 of the north american free trade agreement nafta a treaty negotiated by bush that created a free trade zone consisting of canada mexico and the united states.
the major policy initiative of clintons first term was a plan devised by a panel headed by his wife hillary a lawyer who had pursued an independent career after their marriage to address the rising cost of health care and the increasing number of americans who lacked health insurance.
in canada and western europe governments provided universal medical coverage.
the united states had the worlds most advanced medical technology and a woefully incomplete system of health insurance.
the great society had provided coverage for the elderly and poor through the medicare and medicaid programs.
many employers offered health insurance to their workers.
but tens of millions of americans lacked any coverage at all.
beginning in the 1980s moreover businesses shifted their employees from individual doctors to health maintenance organizations hmos which reduced costs by limiting physicians fees and critics charged denying patients needed medical procedures.
announced with great fanfare by hillary rodham clinton at congressional hearings in 1993 clintons plan would have provided universal coverage through large groupings of organizations like the hmos.
doctors and health insurance and drug companies attacked it vehemently fearing government regulations that would limit reimbursement for medical procedures insurance rates and the price of drugs.
too complex to be easily understood by most voters and vulnerable to criticism for further expanding the unpopular federal bureaucracy the plan died in 1994.
nothing took its place.
by 2008 some 50 million americans most of them persons who held full time jobs still lacked health insurance meaning that illness could quickly become a financial disaster.
the freedom revolution with the economy recovering slowly from the recession and clintons first two years in office seemingly lacking in significant accomplishments voters in 1994 turned against the administration.
for the first time since the 1950s republicans won control of both houses of congress.
they proclaimed their triumph the freedom revolution newt gingrich a conservative congressman from georgia who became the new speaker of the house masterminded their campaign.
gingrich had devised a platform called the contract with america which promised to curtail the scope of government cut back on taxes and economic and environmental regulations overhaul the welfare system and end affirmative action.
viewing their electoral triumph as an endorsement of the contract republicans moved swiftly to implement its provisions.

approved deep cuts in social educational and environmental programs including the popular medicare system.
with the president and congress unable to reach agreement on a budget the government in december 1995 shut down all nonessential operations including washington d c museums and national parks.
gingrich had assumed that the public shared his intense ideological convictions.
he discovered that in 1994 they had voted against clinton not for the full implementation of the contract with america.
most americans blamed congress for the impasse and gingrichs popularity plummeted.
clintons political strategy like truman after the republican sweep of 1946 clinton rebuilt his popularity by campaigning against a radical congress.
he opposed the most extreme parts of his opponents program while adopting others.
in his state of the union address of january 1996 he announced that the era of big government is over in effect turning his back on the tradition of democratic party liberalism and embracing the antigovernment outlook associated with republicans since the days of barry goldwater.
he also approved the telecommunications act of 1996 which deregulated broadcasting and telephone companies and gave billions of dollars worth of digital frequencies to existing broadcasters without charge.
also in 1996 ignoring the protests of most democrats clinton signed into law a republican bill that abolished the program of aid to families with dependent children afdc commonly known as welfare grants of money to the states with strict limits on how long recipients could receive payments replaced it.
at the time of its abolition afdc assisted 14 million individuals 9 million of them children.
thanks to stringent new eligibility requirements imposed by the states and the economic boom of the late 1990s welfare rolls plummeted.
but the number of children living in poverty remained essentially unchanged.
nonetheless clinton had succeeded in one of his primary goals by the late 1990s welfare a hotly contested issue for twenty years or more had disappeared from political debate.
27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 the post cold war world commentators called clintons political strategy triangulation this meant embracing the most popular republican policies like welfare reform while leaving his opponents with extreme positions unpopular among suburban middle class voters such as hostility to abortion rights and environmental protection.
clintons strategy enabled him to neutralize republican claims that democrats were the party of high taxes and lavish spending on persons who preferred dependency to honest labor.
clintons passion for free trade alienated many working class democrats but convinced middle class voters that the party was not beholden to the unions.
clinton easily defeated republican bob dole in the presidential contest of 1996 becoming the first democrat elected to two terms since fdr.
clinton had accomplished for reaganism what eisenhower had done for the new deal and nixon for the great society consolidating a basic shift in american politics by accepting many of the premises of his opponents.
clinton and world a f fa i r s like jimmy carter before him clintons primary political interests concerned domestic not international affairs.
but with the united states now indisputably the worlds dominant power clinton like carter took steps to encourage the settlement of long standing international conflicts and tried to elevate support for human rights to a central place in international relations.
he met only mixed success.
clinton strongly supported a 1993 agreement negotiated at oslo norway in which israel for the first time recognized the legitimacy of the palestine liberation organization.
the oslo accords seemed to outline a road to mideast peace.
but neither side proved willing to implement them fully.
israeli governments continued to build jewish settlements on palestinian land in the west bank a part of jordan that israel had occupied during the 1967 six day war.
the new palestinian authority which shared in governing parts of the west bank as a stepping stone to full statehood proved to be corrupt powerless and unable to curb the growth of groups bent on violence against israel.
at the end of his presidency clinton brought israeli and palestinian leaders to camp david to try to work out a final peace treaty.
but the meeting failed and violence soon resumed.
like carter clinton found it difficult to balance concern for human rights with strategic and economic interests and to formulate clear guidelines for humanitarian interventions overseas.
for example the united states did nothing in 1994 when tribal massacres racked rwanda in central africa.
more than 800 000 people were slaughtered and 2 million refugees fled the country.
the balkan crisis the most complex foreign policy crisis of the clinton years arose from the disintegration of yugoslavia a multi ethnic state in southeastern europe that had been carved from the old austro hungarian empire after world war i.
as in the rest of eastern europe the communist government that had ruled yugoslavia since the 1940s collapsed in 1989.
within a few years the countrys six provinces dissolved into five new states.
ethnic conflict plagued several of these new nations.

ethnic cleansing a terrible new term meaning the forcible expulsion from an area of a particular ethnic group now entered the international vocabulary.
by the end of 1993 more than 100 000 bosnians nearly all of them civilians had perished.
with the cold war over protection of human rights in the balkans gave nato a new purpose.
after considerable indecision nato launched air strikes against bosnian serb forces with american planes contributing.
un troops including 20 000 americans arrived as peacekeepers.
in 1998 ethnic cleansing again surfaced this time by yugoslavian troops and local serbs against the albanian population of kosovo a province of serbia.
more than 800 000 albanians fled the region.
to halt the bloodshed nato launched a two month war in 1999 against yugoslavia that led to the deployment of american and un forces in kosovo.
human rights during clintons presidency human rights played an increasingly important role in international affairs.
hundreds of nongovernmental agencies throughout the world defined themselves as protectors of human rights.
during the 1990s the agenda of international human rights organizations expanded to include access to health care womens rights and the rights of indigenous peoples like the aborigines of australia and the descendants of the original inhabitants of the americas.
human rights emerged as a justification for interventions in matters once considered to be the internal affairs of sovereign nations.
the united states dispatched the military to distant parts of the world to assist in international missions to protect civilians.
27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 a new economy.
new institutions emerged that sought to punish violations of human rights.
the rwandan genocide produced a un sponsored war crimes court that sentenced the countrys former prime minister to life in prison.
an international tribunal put yugoslav president slobodan milo sevic on trial for sponsoring the massacre of civilians.
the european court of human rights overruled legal decisions by national courts that violated individual rights.
spanish and british courts considered charging former chilean dictator augusto pinochet with murder although he proved to be too ill to stand trial.
it remained to be seen whether these initiatives would grow into an effective international system of protecting human rights across national boundaries.
despite adopting human rights as a slogan many governments continued to violate them in practice.
a new economy.
clintons popularity rested in part on the american economys remarkable performance in the mid and late 1990s.
after recovery from the recession of 1990 1991 economic expansion continued for the rest of the decade.
by 2000 unemployment stood below 4 percent a figure not seen since the 1960s.
many economists had insisted that if unemployment fell that low inflation would inevitably increase.
yet prices barely rose during the boom because rising worldwide oil production kept the cost of energy low and weak unions and increased global competition made it difficult for workers to achieve significant wage increases and for corporations to raise prices.
the boom became the longest uninterrupted period of economic expansion in the nations history.
because reagan and bush had left behind massive budget deficits clinton worked hard to balance the federal budget a goal traditionally associated with fiscal conservatives.
since economic growth produced rising tax revenues clinton during his second term not only balanced the budget but actually produced budget surpluses.

by the early twenty first century starbucks had more than 7 000 such establishments in countries around the globe.
what forces drove the economic resurgence of the 1990s.
two architects of the computer revolution steve jobs standing the head of apple computer and bill gates via the internet founder of microsoft at a 1997 convention.
the computer revolution many commentators spoke of the 1990s as the dawn of a new economy in which computers and the internet would produce vast new efficiencies and the production and sale of information would occupy the central place once held by the manufacture of goods.
computers had first been developed during and after world war ii to solve scientific problems and do calculations involving enormous amounts of data.
the early ones were extremely large expensive and by modern standards slow.
research for the space program of the 1960s spurred the development of improved computer technology notably the miniaturization of parts thanks to the development of the microchip on which circuits could be imprinted.
microchips made possible the development of entirely new consumer products.
video cassette recorders handheld video games cellular phones and digital cameras were mass produced at affordable prices during the 1990s mostly in asia and latin america rather than the united states.
but it was the computer that transformed american life.
beginning in the 1980s companies like apple and ibm marketed computers for business and home use.
as computers became smaller faster and less expensive they found a place in businesses of every kind.
in occupations as diverse as clerical work banking architectural design medical diagnosis and even factory production they transformed the american workplace.
they also changed private life.
by the year 2000 nearly half of all american households owned a personal computer used for entertainment shopping and sending and receiving electronic mail.
centers of computer technology such as silicon valley south of san francisco the seattle and austin metropolitan areas and lower manhattan boomed during the 1990s.

in independence day one of the most successful movies of the 1990s a similar invasion is thwarted in part by the introduction of a different kind of virus a program that disables computers into the control mechanism of the alien spaceship.
the internet first developed as a high speed military communications network was simplified and opened to commercial and individual use through personal computers.
the internet expanded the flow of information and communications more radically than any invention since the printing press.
at a time when the ownership of newspapers television stations and publishing houses was becoming concentrated in the hands of a few giant media conglomerates the fact that anyone with a computer could post his or her ideas for worldwide circulation led netizens citizens of the internet to hail the advent of a new democratic public sphere in cyberspace.
global economic problems american economic expansion in the 1990s seemed all the more remarkable since other advanced countries found themselves bogged down in difficulty.
in western europe unemployment remained far higher than in the united states.
japan which some commentators of the 1980s had expected to surpass the united states as the worlds leading economic power was locked in a long term recession.
despite an influx of western loans and investment russia moved from one economic crisis to another.
relying strongly on advice from american free market economists and the clinton administration russian president boris yeltsin presided over a policy of shock therapy that privatized state owned enterprises and imposed severe cuts in wages and in the guaranteed jobs health care and housing russians had become used to under communism.
foreign investors and a new russian business class many of them yeltsins relatives and cronies and former party officials reaped a windfall while most of the population plunged into poverty.
many third world countries faced large trade deficits and problems repaying loans from foreign banks and other institutions.
a sharp decline in the value of the thai currency in 1997 sparked a fiscal crisis throughout asia only resolved by massive loans from the international monetary fund.
these bailouts inspired criticisms echoed at the seattle protests of 1999 that globalization increased social inequality.
foreign investors had their loans repaid but receiving nations were required to balance their budgets by stringent cutbacks in public spending so that the burden fell disproportionately on the poor.

fruits of deregulation at the height of the 1990s boom with globalization in full swing stocks rising and the economy expanding the economic model of free trade and deregulation appeared unassailable.
but the retreat from government economic regulation a policy embraced by both the republican congress and president clinton left no one to represent the public interest.
the sectors of the economy most affected by the scandals energy telecommunications and stock trading had all been subjects of deregulation.
what forces drove the economic resurgence of the 1990s.
enron could manipulate energy prices because congress had granted it an exemption from laws regulating the price of natural gas and electricity.
worldcom a communications giant that like enron issued fraudulent earnings statements had benefited from the telecommunications act of 1996 mentioned earlier that privatized the airwaves.
many stock frauds stemmed from the repeal in 1999 of the glasssteagall act a new deal measure that had separated commercial banks which accept deposits and make loans from investment banks which invest in stocks and real estate and take larger risks.
the repeal made possible the emergence of superbanks that combined these two functions.
phil gramm the texas congressman who wrote the repeal bill which clinton signed explained his thinking in this way glass steagall came at a time when the thinking was that government was the answer.
in this era of economic prosperity we have decided that freedom is the answer but banks took their new freedom as an invitation to engage in all sorts of misdeeds knowing that they had become so big that if anything happened the federal government would have no choice but to rescue them.
conflicts of interest proliferated.
banks financed risky new stock offerings by fledgling internet companies while their investment arms peddled the shares to an unsuspecting public.
worse these banks poured money into risky mortgages.
when the housing bubble collapsed in 2007 2008 the banks suffered losses that threatened to bring down the entire financial system.
the bush and obama administrations felt they had no choice but to expend hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money to save the banks from their own misconduct.
inequality the boom that began in 1995 benefited nearly all americans.
for the first time since the early 1970s average real wages and family incomes began to grow significantly.
economic expansion at a time of low unemployment brought rapid increases in wages for families at all income levels.
it aided low skilled workers especially non whites who had been left out of previous periods of growth.
by 2000 the number of long term unemployed 2 million in 1993 had declined to around 700 000.
yet despite these gains average wages for nonsupervisory workers adjusted for inflation remained below the level of the 1970s.
overall in the last two decades of the twentieth century the poor and the middle class became worse off while the rich became significantly richer.
between 1977 and 1999 the average after tax income of the poorest onefifth of americans fell 12 percent and that of the middle one fifth decreased by 3 percent.
in contrast thanks to the soaring stock market and increasingly generous pay for top executives the income of the top onefifth rose 38 percent.
the wealth of the richest americans exploded during the 1990s.
sales of luxury goods like yachts and mansions boomed.
bill gates head of microsoft and the countrys richest person owned as much wealth as the bottom 40 percent of the american population put together.

voices of freedom from bill clinton s p e e c h o n s i g n i n g o f n a f ta 1 9 9 3 the north american free trade agreement was signed by president bill clinton early in his first term.
it created a free trade zone an area where goods can travel freely without paying import class that was created and enlarged by the wise policies of expanding trade at the end of world war and mexico.
clinton asked americans to accept ii has been under severe stress.
most americans are working harder for less.
they are vulnerable to the fear tactics and the averseness to change that are economic globalization as an inevitable form of behind much of the opposition to nafta.
but i duties composed of canada the united states progress and the path to future prosperity.
there will be no job loss he promised.
things did not entirely work out that way.
as president it is my duty to speak frankly to the american people about the world in which we now live.
fifty years ago at the end of world war ii an unchallenged america was protected by the oceans and by our technological superiority and very frankly by the economic devastation of the people who could otherwise have been our competitors.
we chose then to try to help rebuild our former enemies and to create a world of free trade supported by institutions which would facilitate it.
as a result jobs were created and opportunity thrived all across the world.
for the last 20 years in all the wealthy countries of the world because of changes in the global environment because of the growth of technology because of increasing competition the middle want to say to my fellow americans when you live in a time of change the only way to recover your security and to broaden your horizons is to adapt to the change to embrace to move forward.
the only way we can recover the fortunes of the middle class in this country so that people who work harder and smarter can at least prosper more the only way we can pass on the american dream of the last 40 years to our children and their children for the next 40 is to adapt to the changes which are occurring.
in a fundamental sense this debate about nafta is a debate about whether we will embrace these changes and create the jobs of tomorrow or try to resist these changes hoping we can preserve the economic structures of yesterday.

f r o m g l o b a l e x c h a n g e s e at t l e declaration for global democracy december 1999 the demonstrations that disrupted the december 1999 meeting of the world trade organization in seattle brought to public attention a widespread dissatisfaction with the effects of economic globalization in this declaration organizers of the protest offered their critique.
global trade agreements must not undermine the ability of each nation state or local community to meet its citizens social environmental cultural or economic needs.
the world trade organization must be replaced by a democratic and transparent body accountable to citizens not to corporations.
no globalization without representation.
as citizens of global society recognizing that the world trade organization is unjustly dominated by corporate interests and run for the enrichment of the few at the expense of all others we demand representatives from all sectors of society must be included in all levels of trade policy formulations.
all global citizens must be democratically represented in the formulation implementation and evaluation of all global social and economic policies.
global trade and investment must not be ends in themselves but rather the instruments for achieving questions 1.
why does clinton feel that free trade is necessary to american prosperity.
why do the seattle protesters feel that the world trade organization is a threat to democracy.

but companies continued to shift manufacturing jobs overseas.
thanks to nafta which eliminated barriers to imports from mexico a thriving industrial zone emerged just across the southern border of the united states where american manufacturers built plants to take advantage of cheap labor and weak environmental and safety regulations.
despite low unemployment companies threats to shut down and move exerted downward pressure on american wages.
in 2000 the united states no longer led the world in the hourly wages of manufacturing workers lagging behind several countries in europe.
in terms of the distribution of income and wealth the united states was the most unequal society in the developed world.
high tech firms did not create enough high paying jobs to compensate.
microsoft symbol of the new economy employed only 30 000 people.
in 1970 general motors had been the countrys largest corporate employer.
in the early twenty first century it had been replaced by wal mart a giant discount retail chain that paid most of its 1 6 million workers slightly more than the minimum wage.
wal mart aggressively opposed efforts at collective bargaining.
not a single one of its employees belonged to a union.
in 2000 well over half the labor force worked for less than fourteen dollars per hour a wage on which families found it very difficult to make ends meet.
because of the decline in union membership and the spread of part time employment fewer and fewer workers enjoyed fringe benefits common in union contracts such as employer provided health insurance.
in dual cities like los angeles and new york high tech computer companies and firms engaging in international finance coexisted with sweatshops reminiscent of the progressive era where workers toiled in overcrowded conditions for the minimum wage or less.
poverty was not limited to urban areas.
the highest rates of poverty could be found in isolated rural regions that experienced the continuation of the long term decline in family farming.
what forces drove the economic resurgence of the 1990s.
of the twenty five poorest counties in the united states in 2000 nine were located in nebraska and south dakota.
at the end of the twentieth century the united states more than ever before was a suburban nation.
two thirds of new jobs were created in the suburbs.
suburbs were no longer places from which people commuted to jobs in central cities their office parks industrial plants and huge shopping malls employed many local residents.
nor were suburbs as racially segregated as in the past.
in 2000 one quarter of the suburban population was black and hispanics represented a majority of the population in the suburbs of los angeles and miami.
but suburbs remained divided by income there were rich suburbs middle class suburbs and poor suburbs with little connection between them.
c u lt u r e w a r s the end of the cold war ushered in hopes for a new era of global harmony.
instead what one observer called a rebellion of particularisms renewed emphasis on group identity and insistent demands for group recognition and power racked the international arena during the 1990s.
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries socialism and nationalism had united people of different backgrounds in pursuit of common goals.
now in africa asia the middle east and parts of europe the waning of movements based on socialism and the declining power of nation states arising from globalization seemed to unleash long simmering ethnic and religious antagonisms.
partly in reaction to the global spread of a secular culture based on consumption and mass entertainment intense religious movements attracted increasing numbers of followers hindu nationalism in india orthodox judaism in israel islamic fundamentalism in much of the muslim world and evangelical christianity in the united states.
like other nations although in a far less extreme way and with little accompanying violence the united states experienced divisions arising from the intensification of ethnic and racial identities and religious fundamentalism.
the newest immigrants because of shifts in immigration cultural and racial diversity became increasingly visible in the united states.
until the immigration law of 1965 the vast majority of twentieth century newcomers had hailed from table 27 1 immigration to the united states 1960 2000 decade total europe asia western hemisphere africa oceania 1961 1970 3 321 584 1 123 492 427 642 1 716 374 28 954 25 122 1971 1980 4 493 302 800 368 1 588 178 1 982 735 80 779 41 242 1981 1990 7 337 030 761 550 2 738 157 3 615 225 176 893 45 205 1991 2000 9 052 999 1 359 737 2 795 672 4 486 806 354 939 55 845 ch.

20 c u lt u r e w a r s 35 50 percentage of county population asian 5 20 35 50 percentage of county population hispanic 5 20 35 50 europe.
that measure as noted in chapter 25 sparked a wholesale shift in immigrants origins.
between 1965 and 2000 nearly 24 million immigrants entered the united states a number only slightly lower than the 27 million during the peak period of immigration between 1880 and 1924.
about 50 percent came from latin america and the caribbean 35 percent from asia and smaller numbers from the middle east and africa.
only 10 percent arrived from europe mostly from the war torn balkans and the former soviet union.
in 2000 the number of foreign born persons living in the united states stood at more than 31 million or 11 percent of the population.
although less than the peak proportion of 14 percent in 1910 in absolute numbers this represented the largest immigrant total in the nations history.
the immigrant influx changed the countrys religious and racial map.
by 2000 more than 3 million muslims resided in the united states and the combined population of buddhists and hindus exceeded 1 million.
what cultural conflicts emerged in the 1990s.
as in the past most immigrants became urban residents with new york city los angeles chicago and miami the most common destinations.
new ethnic communities emerged with homes shops restaurants foreign language newspapers radio and television stations and ethnic professionals like businessmen and lawyers.
unlike in the past rather than being concentrated in one or two parts of city centers immigrants quickly moved into outlying neighborhoods and older suburbs.
the immigrant influx revitalized neighborhoods like new york citys washington heights a dominican enclave and flushing a center for asian newcomers.
by the turn of the century more than half of all latinos lived in suburbs.
orange county california which had been a stronghold of suburban conservatism between 1960 and 1990 elected a latina democrat to congress in the late 1990s.
while most immigrants settled on the east and west coasts some moved to other parts of the country.
they brought cultural and racial diversity to once homogeneous communities in the american heartland.
post 1965 immigration formed part of the worldwide uprooting of labor arising from globalization.
in 2000 the global immigrant population was estimated at 100 million.
those who migrated to the united states came from a wide variety of backgrounds.
they included poor illiterate refugees from places of economic and political crisis central americans escaping the regions civil wars and poverty haitians and cambodians fleeing repressive governments.
but many immigrants were well educated professionals from countries like india and south korea where the availability of skilled jobs had not kept pace with the spread of higher education.
in the year 2000 more than 40 percent of all immigrants to the united states had a college education.
for the first time in american history women made up the majority of newcomers reflecting the decline of manufacturing jobs that had previously absorbed immigrant men as well as the spread of employment opportunities in traditionally female fields like care of children and the elderly and retail sales.
many were paid by their employers off the books without withholding taxes.
this practice became a focus of public discussion in 1993 when president clinton was forced to withdraw two female cabinet nominees when it came to light that they had hired undocumented immigrants as housekeepers and paid them in this manner.
thanks to cheap global communications and jet travel modern day immigrants retained strong ties with their countries of origin frequently phoning and visiting home.
the new diversity latinos formed the largest single immigrant group.
this term was invented in the united states and included people from quite different origins mexicans central and south americans and migrants from spanishspeaking caribbean islands like cuba the dominican republic and puerto rico although the last group of course were american citizens not immigrants.
with 95 million people mexico in 2000 had become the worlds largest spanish speaking nation.
its poverty high birthrate and proximity to the united states made it a source of massive legal and illegal immigration.
in 2000 mexican americans made up a majority of the hispanic population of the united states and nearly half the residents of los angeles.

numbering more than 45 million in 2007 latinos had become the largest minority group in the united states.
latinos were highly visible in entertainment sports and politics.
indeed the hispanic presence transformed american life.
jos was now the most common name for baby boys in texas and the third most popular in california.
smith remained the most common american surname but garcia rodriguez gonzales and other hispanic names were all in the top fifty.
latino communities remained far poorer than the rest of the country.
a flourishing middle class developed in los angeles miami and other cities with large spanish speaking populations.
but most immigrants from mexico and central america competed at the lowest levels of the job market.
the influx of legal and illegal immigrants swelled the ranks of lowwage urban workers and agricultural laborers.
latinos lagged far behind other americans in education.
in 2007 their poverty rate stood at nearly double the national figure of 12 5 percent.
living and working conditions among predominantly latino farm workers in the west fell back to levels as dire as when csar chavez established the united farm workers union in the 1960s.
asian americans also became increasingly visible in the 1990s.
there had long been a small population of asian ancestry in california and new york city but only after 1965 did immigration from asia assume large proportions.
by 2000 the number of asian americans stood at 11 9 million eight times the figure of 1970.
like latinos asian americans were a highly diverse population including well educated koreans indians and japanese as well as poor refugees from cambodia vietnam and china.
growing up in tight knit communities that placed great emphasis on education young asian americans poured into american colleges and universities.
once subjected to harsh discrimination asian americans now achieved remarkable success.

model minority by 2007 the median family income of asian americans 66 000 surpassed that of whites.
but more than any other group asianamericans clustered at opposite ends of the income spectrum.
large numbers earned either more than 75 000 per year doctors engineers and entrepreneurs or under 5 000 unskilled laborers in sweatshops and restaurants.
the united states of course had long been a multiracial society.
but for centuries race relations had been shaped by the black white divide and the experience of slavery and segregation.
the growing visibility of latinos and asians suggested that a two race system no longer adequately described american life.
multiracial imagery filled television films and advertising.
interracial marriage at one time banned in forty two states became more common and acceptable.
among asian americans at the turn of the century half of all marriages involved a non asian partner.

27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 figure 27 3 the projected non white majority racial and ethnic breakdown 46 66 30 c u lt u r e w a r s figure for latinos was 30 percent.
some commentators spoke of the end of racism and the emergence of a truly color blind society.
others argued that while asians and some latinos were being absorbed into an expanded category of white americans the black white divide remained almost as impenetrable as ever.
one thing however seemed clear at the dawn of the twenty first century diversity was here to stay.
in 2000 whites made up around 70 percent of the population blacks and hispanics around 13 percent each and asians 6 percent.
because the birthrate of racial minorities is higher than that of whites the census bureau projected that by 2050 only 50 percent of the american population would be white a little less than 25 percent would be hispanic and blacks and asians would account for around 13 percent each.
african americans in the 1990s compared with the situation in 1900 or 1950 the most dramatic change in american life at the turn of the century was the absence of legal segrega13 tion and the presence of blacks in areas of american life from which they 13 had once been almost entirely excluded.
thanks to the decline in overt dis8 crimination and the effectiveness of many affirmative action programs 4 5 3 blacks now worked in unprecedented numbers alongside whites in corpo2008 rate board rooms offices and factories.
the number of black policemen non hispanic white asian for example rose from 24 000 to 65 000 between 1970 and 2000 and in the hispanic other latter year 37 percent of the black population reported having attended black college.
the economic boom of the late 1990s aided black americans enormously the average income of black families rose more rapidly than that of whites.
one major change in black life was the growing visibility of africans among the nations immigrants.
between 1970 and 2000 twice as many africans immigrated to the united states as had entered during the entire period of the atlantic slave trade.
for the first time all the elements of the african diaspora natives of africa caribbeans central and south despite the ups and downs of americans of african descent europeans with african roots could be unemployment the rate for non whites found in the united states alongside the descendants of american slaves.

indeed some african countries comnon white plained of a brain drain as physicians teachers and other female highly skilled persons sought opportunities in the united white states that did not exist in their own underdeveloped counfemale tries.
while some prospered others found it difficult to white male transfer their credentials to the united states and found jobs driving taxis and selling african crafts at street fairs.
195519601965 19701975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 most african americans nonetheless remained in a more year precarious situation than whites or many recent immigrants.
the black unemployment rate remained double that percentage of population 15 what cultural conflicts emerged in the 1990s.

half of all black children lived in poverty two thirds were born out of wedlock and in every index of social well being from health to quality of housing blacks continued to lag.
despite the continued expansion of the black middle class a far lower percentage of blacks than whites owned their homes or held professional and managerial jobs.
housing segregation remained pervasive.
in 2000 more than one third of the black population lived in suburbs but mostly in predominantly black communities.
the gap in wealth between blacks and whites remained enormous.
in 2007 the total assets of the median white family bank accounts stocks the value of a home etc.
stood at 87 000.
for black families the figure was 5 400.
the role of the courts as in the late nineteenth century the supreme court in the last years of the twentieth century little by little retreated from the civil rights revolution.
the justices made it increasingly difficult for victims of discrimination to win lawsuits and proved increasingly sympathetic to the pleas of whites that affirmative action plans discriminated against them.
in patterson v mclean credit union 1989 the court barred a black employee who suffered racial harassment while working from suing for damages under the civil rights act of 1866.
that law the justices maintained only prohibited discrimination at the moment of signing a contract not on the job.
in the same year the court overturned a richmond law reserving 30 percent of city construction contracts for minority businesses.
less than 1 percent of such contracts had gone to black owned companies in the five years before the city council enacted the new law.
but justice sandra day oconnor who wrote the opinion insisted that in the absence of clear statements of racism by government officials hardly a likely occurrence one could not prove the existence of discrimination.
blacks she speculated may have been attracted to other industries than construction as if their distribution among the occupations had historically been a matter of free choice.
despite the nations growing racial diversity school segregation now resulting from housing patterns and the divide between urban and suburban school districts rather than laws requiring racial separation was on the rise.
most city public school systems consisted overwhelmingly of minority students large numbers of whom failed to receive an adequate education.
the courts released more and more districts from desegregation orders.
by 2000 the nations black and latino students were more isolated ch.

nearly 80 percent of white students attended schools where they encountered few if any pupils of another race.
since school funding rested on property taxes poor communities continued to have less to spend on education than wealthy ones.
black male 1850 1870 1890 1910 1930 year spread of imprisonment during the 1960s the nations prison population had declined.
but in the 1970s with urban crime rates rising politicians of both parties sought to convey the image of being tough on crime they insisted that the judicial sysblack female tem should focus on locking up criminals for long periods 1950 1970 1990 rather than rehabilitating them.
they treated drug addiction as a violation of the law rather than as a disease.
state governments greatly increased the penalties for crime and reduced the possibility of parole.
successive presidents launched wars on the use of illegal drugs.
as a result the number of americans in prison rose dramatically most of them incarcerated for non violent drug offenses.
during the 1990s thanks to the waning of the crack epidemic and more effective urban police tactics crime rates dropped dramatically across the country.
but because of the sentencing laws of the previous two decades this did nothing to stem the increase of the prison population.
in 2008 it reached 2 3 million ten times the figure of 1970.
several million more individuals were on parole probation or under some other kind of criminal supervision.
these figures dwarfed those of every other western society.
as the prison population grew a prison industrial complex emerged.
struggling communities battered by deindustrialization saw prisons as a source of jobs and income.
between 1990 and 1995 the federal government and the states constructed more than 200 new prisons.
in 2008 five states spent more money on their prison systems than on higher education.
convict labor a practice the labor movement had managed to curtail in the late nineteenth century revived in the late twentieth.
private companies in oregon leased prisoners for three dollars per day.
a call to trans world airlines for a flight reservation was likely to be answered by a california inmate.
white male the white female the burden of imprisonment members of racial minorities experienced most strongly the paradox of growing islands of unfreedom in a nation that prided itself on liberty.
in 1950 whites accounted for 70 percent of the nations prison population and non whites 30 percent.
by 2000 these figures had been reversed.
one reason was that severe penalties faced those convicted of using or selling crack a particularly potent form of cocaine concentrated among the urban poor while the use of powder cocaine the drug of choice in suburban america led to far lighter sentences.
the percentage of the black population in prison stood eight times higher than the proportion for white americans.
more than one quarter of all black men could expect to serve time in prison at some time during their lives.
a criminal record made it very difficult for ex prisoners to find what cultural conflicts emerged in the 1990s.
partly because so many young men were in prison blacks had a significantly lower rate of marriage than other americans.
their children became prison orphans forced to live with relatives or in foster homes.
with twenty nine states denying the vote to those on probation and seven barring ex felons from voting for their entire lives an estimated 4 million black men 13 percent of the black male population could not cast a ballot at the end of the twentieth century.
in 2000 in the seven states that denied the vote to ex offenders alabama florida iowa kentucky mississippi nevada and virginia one black man in four was permanently disenfranchised.
since then most of these states have taken steps to restore voting rights to those who have served their sentences.
blacks convicted of crimes were also more likely than whites to receive the death penalty.
in 1972 the supreme court had temporarily suspended states use of this punishment.
but the court soon allowed it to resume despite evidence of racial disparities in its application.
even as western europe and other countries abolished the death penalty the united states executed 598 persons between 1977 and 1999.
in the 1830s alexis de tocqueville had described executions as common in europe but rare in america.
at the close of the twentieth century with more than 3 000 prisoners on death row the united states ranked with china iran and saudi arabia as the nations that most often executed their citizens.
the 2 3 million americans in prison in 2008 represented one quarter of the entire worlds inmates and far exceeded the number in any other country.
the continuing frustration of urban blacks exploded in 1992 when an all white suburban jury found four los angeles police officers not guilty in the beating of black motorist rodney king even though an onlooker had captured their assault on videotape.
the deadliest urban uprising since the new york draft riots of 1863 followed.
some fifty two people died and property damage approached 1 billion.
many latino youths who shared blacks resentment over mistreatment by the police joined in the violence.
the uprising suggested that despite the civil rights revolution the nation had failed to address the plight of the urban poor.
racial minorities benefited enormously from the dramatic decline in unemployment that accompanied the economic boom of the mid and late 1990s.
but when the boom ended in 2000 these gains once again began to disappear.

the quilt was exhibited throughout the country heightening public awareness of the aids epidemic.
continuing c u lt u r e w a r s rights revolution reflecting the continued power of the rights revolution the 1990s also witnessed the emergence of new movements for public recognition.
in 1990 newly organized disabled americans won passage of the americans with disabilities act.
this far reaching measure prohibited discrimination in hiring and promotion against persons with disabilities and required that entrances to public buildings be redesigned so as to ensure access for the disabled.
some movements that were descended from the late 1960s achieved their greatest visibility in the 1990s.
prominent among these was the campaign for gay rights which in the last two decades of the century increasingly turned its attention to combating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids a fatal disease spread by sexual contact drug use and transfusions of contaminated blood.
aids first emerged in the early 1980s.
it quickly became epidemic among homosexual men.
the gay movement mobilized to promote safe sex prevent discrimination against people suffering from aids and press the federal government to devote greater resources to fighting the disease.
by 2000 even though more than 400 000 americans had died of aids its spread among gays had been sharply curtailed.
but in other parts of the world such as africa the aids epidemic remained out of control.
gay groups also played an increasing role in politics.
in cities with large gay populations such as new york and san francisco politicians vied to attract their votes.
overall the growth of public tolerance of homosexuality was among the most striking changes in american social attitudes in the last two decades of the century.
native americans in another social movement spawned by the 1960s that continued to flourish was the american indian movement.
the indian population reached 4 million in the 2000 census a sign not only of population growth but also of a renewed sense of pride that led many indians for the first time to identify themselves as such to census enumerators.
meanwhile with the assistance of the native american rights fund established in 1971 some tribes embarked on a campaign for restitution for past injustices.
in 2001 for example a new york court awarded the cayuga nation 248 million for illegal land seizures two centuries earlier.
the legal position of indians as american citizens who enjoy a kind of quasi sovereignty still survives in some cases.
notable examples are the lucrative indian casinos now operating in states that otherwise prohibit gambling.
indian casinos take in around 15 billion each year making some tribes very rich.
one such group is the pequot tribe of connecticut.
in 1637 as the result of a brief bloody war puritan new englanders exterminated or sold into slavery most of the tribes members.
the treaty that restored peace decreed that the tribes name should be wiped from the historical record.
today the few hundred members of the pequot tribe operate foxwoods reputedly the worlds largest casino.
the census of 2000 listed a native american population of around 2 5 million 80 percent of them of mixed indian and non indian ancestry.
half what cultural conflicts emerged in the 1990s.
of todays indians live in five western states california oklahoma arizona new mexico and washington.
although some tribes have reinvested casino profits in improved housing and health care and college scholarships for native american students most indian casinos are marginal operations whose low wage jobs as cashiers waitresses and the like have done little to relieve indian poverty.
native americans continue to occupy the lowest rung on the economic ladder.
at least half of those living on reservations have incomes below the poverty line.
m u lt i c u lt u r a l i s m the new face of american society went hand in hand with one of the most striking developments of the 1990s the celebration of group difference and demands for group recognition.
multiculturalism became the term for a new awareness of the diversity of american society past and present and for vocal demands that jobs education and politics reflect that diversity.
as the numbers of minority and female students at the nations colleges and universities rose these institutions moved aggressively to diversify their faculties and revise the traditional curriculum.
one sign of multiculturalism could be seen in the spread of academic programs dealing with the experience of specific groups black studies latino studies womens studies and the like.
literature departments added the writings of female and minority authors to those of white men.
numerous scholars now taught and wrote history in ways that stressed the experiences of diverse groups of americans rather than a common national narrative.
at the same time public opinion polls revealed a remarkable growth of toleration.
the number of respondents who accepted interracial dating without objection rose from 45 percent in 1987 to 78 percent in 2003.
those who believed gays should automatically be fired from teaching jobs fell from 50 to 35 percent over the same period.
in addition popular television shows portrayed gay characters in a sympathetic light.
the identity debate among some americans the heightened visibility of immigrants racial minorities and inheritors of the sexual revolution inspired not celebration of pluralism but alarm over perceived cultural fragmentation.
conservatives and some traditional liberals as well decried identity politics and multiculturalism for undermining a common sense of nationhood.
as in the debates over the alien act of the 1790s irish immigration in the 1850s and the new immigrants of the early twentieth century the definition of american nationality again became a contentious political question.
bill clintons 1992 slogan its the economy stupid was directed in part at members of the democratic party who preferred to focus on racial and gender issues rather this public sculpture by the native american artist lewis desoto links his own surname with more than four centuries of american history.

27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 c u lt u r e w a r s than traditional economic concerns.
republicans appealed most directly to those alarmed by the influx of non white immigrants and the decline of traditional family values but differences over diversity did not follow party lines.
increased cultural diversity and changes in educational policy inspired harsh debates over whether immigrant children should be required to learn english and whether further immigration should be discouraged.
these issues entered politics most dramatically in california whose voters in 1994 approved proposition 187 which denied illegal immigrants and their children access to welfare education and most health services.
a federal judge soon barred implementation of the measure on the grounds that control over immigration policy rests with the federal government.
but during the 1990s california voters also approved measures banning bilingual education in public schools and affirmative action in admission to public colleges and universities.
by 2000 twenty three states had passed laws establishing english as their official language similar to measures enacted in the aftermath of world war i.
the 1996 law that abolished welfare also barred most immigrants who had not become citizens from receiving food stamps.
but since 1900 the united states had become a far more tolerant society.
efforts to appeal to prejudice for political gain often backfired.
in california republicans anti immigrant campaigns inspired minorities to mobilize politically and offended many white americans.
in 2000 republican presidential candidate george w bush emphasized that his brand of conservatism was multicultural not exclusionary.
c u lt u r a l conservatism immigration occupied only one front in what came to be called the culture wars battles over moral values that raged throughout the 1990s.
the christian coalition founded by evangelical minister pat robertson became a major force in republican politics.
it launched crusades against gay rights abortion secularism in public schools and government aid to the arts.

what cultural conflicts emerged in the 1990s.
fa m i ly values in retreat the census of 2000 showed family values increasingly in disarray.
half of all marriages ended in divorce 70 percent on the west coast and over one third of all births were to unmarried women including not only sexually active teenagers but growing numbers of professional women in their thirties and forties as well.
two thirds of married women worked outside the home and less than one fourth of all households consisted of a traditional family a wife husband and their children.
however the pay gap between men and women persisted.
in 2008 mens median weekly earnings were 800 womens 610.
in only two occupational categories did women earn more than men postal service clerks and special education teachers.
although dominated by conservatives the supreme court in casey v planned parenthood of pennsylvania 1992 reaffirmed a womans right to obtain an abortion.
the decision allowed states to enact mandatory waiting periods and anti abortion counseling but it overturned a requirement that the husband be given notification before the procedure was undertaken.
at the heart of liberty said the court is the right to.
make the most intimate and personal choices without outside interference.
in effect casey repudiated the centuries old doctrine that a husband has a legal claim to control the body of his wife.
the narrowness of the 5 4 vote in casey and the vehemence of the dissenters including chief justice william rehnquist in insisting that roe v wade must be reversed left the legal status of abortion rights dependent on future changes in the courts membership.
as of 2000 however although conservatives had controlled the presidency under reagan and bush congress after 1994 and the supreme court they had not eliminated abortion rights restored prayer to public schools or persuaded women to abandon public aspirations and go about the business of marrying and raising children as republican congressional leader richard armey indelicately demanded.
women did not listen to armey.
at the dawn of the twentieth century women received more than 60 percent of all college degrees as opposed to 35 percent in 1960 and over 40 percent of advanced law medical and business degrees up from around 5 percent forty years figure 27.
6 women in the paid workforce 1940 2000 workforce in millions war for the soul of america mentioned earlier alarmed many voters.
but cultural conservatives hailed it as their new rallying cry.
it sometimes appeared during the 1990s that the country was refighting old battles between traditional religion and modern secular culture.
in an echo of the 1920s a number of localities required the teaching of creationism a religious alternative to darwins theory of evolution.
the battles of the 1960s seemed to be forever unresolved.
many conservatives railed against the erosion of the nuclear family the changing racial landscape produced by immigration and what they considered a general decline of traditional values.
cultural conservatives were not satisfied with a few victories over what they considered immorality such as rules banning the national endowment for the arts from making grants to artists who produced sexually explicit material or the defense of marriage act of 1996 which barred gay couples from spousal benefits provided by federal law.

c u lt u r e w a r s earlier.
the abortion rate declined throughout the 1990s but this was mostly because teenagers had increasing access to contraception.
the sexual revolution and feminism it seemed were here to stay.
the antigovernment extreme at the radical fringe of conservatism the belief that the federal government posed a threat to american freedom led to the creation of private militias who armed themselves to fend off oppressive authority.
groups like aryan nation posse comitatus and other self proclaimed christian patriots spread a mixture of racist anti semitic and antigovernment ideas.
private armies like the militia of montana vowed to resist enforcement of federal gun control laws.
for millions of americans owning a gun became a prime symbol of liberty.
were here because we love freedom declared a participant in a 1995 washington rally against proposed legislation banning semiautomatic assault weapons.
many militia groups employed the symbolism and language of the american revolution sprinkling their appeals with warnings about the dangers of government tyranny drawn from the writings of thomas jefferson patrick henry and thomas paine.
they warned that leaders of both major parties formed part of a conspiracy to surrender american sovereignty to the united nations or to some shadowy international conspiracy.
although such organizations had been growing for years they burst into the national spotlight in 1995 when timothy mcveigh a member of the militant antigovernment movement exploded a bomb at a federal office building in oklahoma city.
the blast killed 168 persons including numerous children at a day care center.
mcveigh was captured convicted and executed.
the worst act of terrorism in american history until the twenty first century the bombing alerted the nation to the danger of violent antigovernment right wing groups.
what cultural conflicts emerged in the 1990s.
impeachment and the election of 2000 the unusually intense partisanship of the 1990s seemed ironic given clintons move toward the political center.
republicans intense dislike of clinton could only be explained by the fact that he seemed to symbolize everything conservatives hated about the 1960s.
as a college student the president had smoked marijuana and participated in antiwar demonstrations.
he had married a feminist made a point of leading a multicultural administration and supported gay rights.
clintons popularity puzzled and frustrated conservatives reinforcing their conviction that something was deeply amiss in american life.
from the very outset of his administration clintons political opponents and a scandal hungry media stood ready to pounce.
clinton himself provided the ammunition.
the impeachment of clinton charges of sexual misconduct by public officials had a long history.
federalists had accused thomas jefferson of having sexual relations with his slave sally hemings a charge apparently confirmed by dna tests during the 1990s.
but in the 1980s and 1990s scrutiny of politicians private lives became far more intense than in the past.
gary hart as noted in the previous chapter had been driven from the 1988 campaign because of an extramarital liaison.
in 1991 senate hearings on the nomination to the supreme court of clarence thomas a black conservative became embroiled in sensational charges of sexual harassment leveled against thomas by law professor anita hill.
to the outrage of feminists the senate narrowly confirmed him.
from the day clinton took office charges of misconduct bedeviled him.
in 1993 an investigation began of an arkansas real estate deal known as whitewater from which he and his wife had profited.
the following year an arkansas woman paula jones filed a civil suit charging that clinton had sexually harassed her while he served as governor of that state.
in 1998 it became known that clinton had carried on an affair with monica lewinsky a white house intern.
kenneth starr the special counsel who had been appointed to investigate whitewater shifted his focus to lewinsky.
he issued a lengthy report containing almost pornographic details of clintons sexual acts with the young woman and accused the president of lying when he denied the affair in a deposition for the jones lawsuit.
in december 1998 the republican controlled house of representatives voted to impeach clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice.
he became the second president to be tried before the senate.
early in 1999 the vote took the aftermath of the bombing of a federal office building in oklahoma city in 1995 the worst act of terrorism in the united states during the twentieth century.
27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 impeachment and the election of 2000 place.
neither charge mustered a simple majority much less than the two thirds required to remove clinton from office.
karl marx once wrote that historical events occur twice first as tragedy the second time as farce.
the impeachment of andrew johnson in 1868 had revolved around some of the most momentous questions in american history the reconstruction of the south the rights of the former slaves relations between the federal government and the states.
clintons impeachment had to do with what many considered to be a juvenile escapade.
polls suggested that the obsession of kenneth starr and members of congress with clintons sexual acts appalled americans far more than the presidents irresponsible behavior.
clintons continuing popularity throughout the impeachment controversy demonstrated how profoundly traditional attitudes toward sexual morality had changed.
the herbert blocks 1998 cartoon comments humorously on clintons talent for political survival.
a member of a florida election board trying to determine a voters intent during the recount of presidential ballots in november 2000.
the u s supreme court eventually ordered the recount halted.
disputed election had clinton been eligible to run for reelection in 2000 he would probably have won.
but after the death of fdr the constitution had been amended to limit presidents to two terms in office.
democrats nominated vice president al gore to succeed clinton pairing him with senator joseph lieberman of connecticut the first jewish vice presidential nominee.
republicans chose george w bush the governor of texas and son of clintons predecessor as their candidate with former secretary of defense dick cheney as his running mate.
the election proved to be one of the closest in the nations history.
the outcome remained uncertain until a month after the ballots had been cast.
gore won the popular vote by a tiny margin 540 000 of 100 million cast or one half of 1 percent.
victory in the electoral college hinged on which candidate had carried florida.
there amid widespread confusion at the polls and claims of irregularities in counting the ballots bush claimed a margin of a few hundred votes.
in the days after the election democrats demanded a hand recount of the florida ballots for which machines could not determine a voters intent.
the florida supreme court ordered the recount to proceed.
just as clintons impeachment recalled the trial of andrew johnson the battle for the presidency in 2000 seemed to repeat the disputed election that ended reconstruction a contest in which florida had also played a crucial role.
as in 1877 it fell to supreme court justices to decide the outcome.
on december 12 2000 by a 5 4 vote the court ordered a halt to the recounting of florida ballots allowing the states governor jeb bush george w bushs brother to certify that the republican candidate had carried the state and had therefore won the presidency.
the decision in bush v gore was one of the oddest in supreme court history.
in the late 1990s the court had reasserted the powers of the states within the federal system reinforcing their immunity from lawsuits by individuals who claimed to be victims of discrimination and denying the power of congress to force states to carry out federal policies.
now however it overturned a decision of the florida supreme court interpreting the states election laws.
many observers did not expect the justices to consider the matter at all since it did not seem to raise a federal constitutional question.
they justified their decision by insisting that the equal protection how did a divisive political partisanship affect the election of 2000.
clause of the fourteenth amendment required that all ballots within a state be counted in accordance with a single standard something impossible given the wide variety of machines and paper ballots used in florida.
perhaps recognizing that this new constitutional principle threatened to throw into question results throughout the country since many states had voting systems as complex as floridas the court added that it applied only in this single case.
the presidential election of 2000 challenged democracy coming at the end of the decade of democracy the 2000 election revealed troubling features of the american political system at the close of the twentieth century.
the electoral college devised by the founders to enable the countrys prominent men rather than ordinary voters to choose the president gave the white house to a candidate who did not receive the most votes an odd result in a political democracy.
a country that prided itself on modern technology had a voting system in which citizens choices could not be reliably determined.
counting both congressional and presidential races the campaign cost more than 1 5 billion mostly raised from wealthy individuals and corporate donors.
this reinforced the widespread belief that money dominated the political system.
it remained for future 22 12 21 r e s u lt the most remarkable thing about the election of 2000 was not so much its controversial ending as the even division of the country it revealed.
bush and gore each received essentially half of the popular vote.
the final count in the electoral college stood at 271 266 the narrowest margin since 1876.
the senate ended up divided 50 50 between the party two parties.
but these figures concealed deep political and republican democrat social fissures.
bush carried the entire south and nearly all the states of the trans mississippi farm belt and rockies.
gore won almost all the states of the northeast old northwest and west coast.
residents of urban areas voted overwhelmingly for gore.
rural areas went just as solidly for bush.
members of racial minorities gave gore large majorities while white voters preferred bush.
the results also revealed a significant gender gap until the 1960s women had tended to vote disproportionately republican.
in 2000 women favored gore by 11 percent while men preferred bush by the same margin.
democrats blamed the supreme court ralph nader and sheer bad luck for bushs narrow victory.
running as the candidate of the environmentalist green party nader had won tens of thousands of votes in florida that otherwise may have gone to gore.
in one county a faulty ballot design led several thousand gore voters accidentally to cast their votes for independent conservative candidate pat buchanan.
had their votes been counted for gore he would have been elected president.
but the largest reason for gores loss of florida was that 600 000 persons overwhelmingly black and latino men had lost the right to vote for their entire lives after being convicted of a felony.
a the 3 15 candidate bush gore electoral vote share 271 50 5 266 49 5 popular vote share 50 456 062 47 9 50 996 582 48 4 ch.
27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 freedom and the new century generations to ponder the implications for democracy of the ever closer connection between power in the economic marketplace and power in the marketplace of politics and ideas.
evidence abounded of a broad disengagement from public life.
as governments at all levels competed to turn their activities over to private contractors and millions of americans walled themselves off from their fellow citizens by taking up residence in socially homogeneous gated communities the very idea of a shared public sphere seemed to dissolve.
organizations like parent teacher associations the boy scouts and the red cross all suffered declining membership and volunteering.
with politicians and political parties still in disrepute and neither candidate able to generate much enthusiasm voter turnout remained far below that of other democracies.
nearly half the eligible voters did not bother to go to the polls and in state and local elections turnouts typically ranged between only 20 and 30 percent.
more people watched the televised nixon kennedy debates of 1960 than the bush gore debates of 2000 even though the population had risen by 100 million.
both candidates sought to occupy the political center and relied on public opinion polls and media consultants to shape their messages.
major issues like health care race relations and economic inequality went virtually unmentioned during the campaign.
another cartoon by herbert block from 2000 suggests that democracy has been corrupted by the influence of big money interests on government.
freedom and the new century the century that ended with the 2000 election witnessed vast human progress and unimaginable human tragedy.
it saw the decolonization of asia and africa the emergence of women into full citizenship in most parts of the world and amazing advances in science medicine and technology.
thanks to the spread of new products available at ever cheaper prices it brought more improvement in the daily conditions of life to more human beings than any other century in history.
worldwide life expectancy in the twentieth century rose from forty to sixty seven years and the literacy rate increased from 25 percent to 80 percent.
this was the first century in which the primary economic activity for most of mankind moved beyond the acquisition of basic food clothing and shelter.
but the twentieth century also witnessed the death of uncounted millions in wars and genocides and the widespread degradation of the natural environment the underside of progress.
exceptional america in the united states people lived longer and healthier lives in 2000 compared to previous generations and they enjoyed a level of material comfort unimagined a century before.
in 1900 the average annual income was 3 000 in todays dollars.
the typical american had no indoor plumbing no telephone or car and had not graduated from high school.
as late as 1940 one third of american households did not have running water.
in 2000 health conditions had improved so much that the average life expectancy for men had risen to seventy four and for women to seventy nine from what were the prevailing ideas of american freedom at the end of the century.
forty six and forty eight in 1900.
more than 14 million americans attended college in 2000 more than three times the figure for 1960.
in 2000 nearly one american in seven was older than sixty five.
certain to continue rising in the twenty first century this figure sparked worries about the future cost of health care and the economic stability of the social security system.
but it also suggested that people would enjoy far longer and more productive periods of retirement than in the past.
on the other hand poverty income inequality and infant mortality in the united states considerably exceeded that of other economically advanced countries and fewer than 10 percent of workers in private firms belonged to unions a figure not seen since the nineteenth century.
many of the changes affecting american life such as the transformed role of women the better health and longer lifespan of the population the spread of suburbanization and the decline of industrial employment have taken place in all economically advanced societies.
in other ways however the united states at the dawn of the twenty first century differed sharply from other developed countries.
prevailing ideas of freedom in the united states seemed more attuned to individual advancement than to broad social welfare.
in 2003 when asked whether it was more important for the government to guarantee freedom from want or freedom to pursue individual goals only 35 percent of americans selected freedom from want as opposed to 58 percent in germany 62 percent in france and great britain and 65 percent in italy.
the united states was a far more religious country.
sixty percent of americans agreed with the statement religion plays a very important part in my life while the comparable figure was 32 percent in britain 26 percent in italy and only 11 percent in france.
one in three americans said he or she believed in the literal truth of the bible and half that the united states enjoys special protection from god religion and at the beginning of the twenty first century more than 7 million american families lived in gated communities where the wealthy and some members of the middle class as well walled themselves off from the rest of society.
this one is in the brentwood section of los angeles.
27 globalization and its discontents 1989 2000 freedom and the new century nationalism reinforced one another far more powerfully in the united states than in the more secular nations of western europe.
other forms of american exceptionalism had a darker side.
among advanced countries the united states has by far the highest rate of murder using guns.
in 1998 the last year for which comparative statistics are available there were 11 789 murders with guns in the united states as opposed to 373 in germany 151 in canada 54 in great britain and 19 in japan.
the united states continued to lag behind other countries in providing social rights to its citizens.
in europe workers are guaranteed by law a paid vacation each year and a number of paid sick days.
american employers are not required to offer either to their workers.
only four countries in the world have no national provision for paid maternity leave after a woman gives birth to a child liberia papua new guinea swaziland and the united states.
varieties of freedom in a speech at midnight on january 1 2000 strictly speaking a year before the twenty first century actually began president clinton proclaimed the great story of the twentieth century is the triumph of freedom and free people freedom remained a crucial point of self definition for individuals and society at large.
when asked in a public opinion survey what they were proudest of about america 69 percent of respondents answered freedom americans were increasingly tolerant of divergent personal lifestyles cultural backgrounds and religious persuasions.
they enjoyed a degree of freedom of expression unmatched in virtually any country in the world.
but their definition of freedom had changed markedly during the course of the twentieth century.
thanks to the rights revolution and the political ascendancy of antigovernment conservatives the dominant definition of freedom stressed the capacity of individuals to realize their desires and fulfill their potential unrestricted by authority.
other american traditions freedom as economic security freedom as active participation in democratic government freedom as social justice for those long disadvantaged seemed to be in eclipse.
americans sought freedom within themselves not through social institutions or public engagement.
it was an irony of late twentieth century life that americans enjoyed more personal freedom than ever before but less of what earlier generations called industrial freedom the sustained recovery from the recession of the early 1990s did not entirely relieve a widespread sense of economic insecurity.
globalization which treated workers at home and abroad as interchangeable factors of production capable of being uprooted or dismissed without warning seemed to render individual and even national sovereignty all but meaningless.
since economic liberty has long been associated with economic security and rights have historically been linked to democratic participation and membership in a nation state these processes had ominous implications for traditional understandings of freedom.
it remained to be seen whether a conception of freedom grounded in access to the consumer marketplace and the glorification of individual self fulfillment unrestrained by government social citizenship or a common public culture could provide an adequate way of comprehending the world of the twenty first century.

l n o member of the present generation will ever forget when he or she first learned of the events of september 11 2001.
that beautiful late summer morning began with the sun rising over the east coast of the united states in a crystal clear sky.
but september 11 soon became one of the most tragic dates in american history.
around 8 a m hijackers seized control of four jet airliners filled with passengers.
they crashed two into the world trade center in new york city igniting infernos that soon caused these buildings which dominated the lower manhattan skyline to collapse.
a third plane hit a wing of the pentagon the countrys military headquarters in washington d c on the fourth aircraft passengers who had learned of these events via their cell phones overpowered the hijackers.
the plane crashed in a field near pittsburgh killing all aboard.
counting the nineteen hijackers the more than 200 passengers pilots and flight attendants and the victims on the ground around 3 000 people died on september 11.
the victims included nearly 400 police and firefighters who had rushed to the world trade center in a rescue effort and perished when the twin towers collapsed.
most of the dead were americans but citizens of more than eighty other countries also lost their lives.
relatives and friends desperately seeking information about the fate of those lost in the attacks printed thousands of missing posters.
these remained in public places in new york and washington for weeks grim reminders of the lives extinguished on september 11.
the attack dealt new york city and the country as a whole a severe blow.
immediate damage and recovery costs ran into the billions of dollars.
an estimated 80 000 persons lost their jobs in the new york area.
they included employees of financial firms housed in the world trade center as well as waiters retail sales clerks and cleaning workers dismissed when business in lower manhattan ground to a halt and tourism to the city plummeted.
the loss of tax revenue plunged the city into a deep fiscal crisis.
major airlines also faced bankruptcy as americans became afraid to fly.
the bush administration quickly blamed al qaeda a shadowy terrorist organization headed by osama bin laden for the attacks.
a wealthy islamic fundamentalist from saudi arabia bin laden had joined the fight against the soviet occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s.
he had developed a relationship with the central intelligence agency and received american funds to help build his mountain bases.
but after the gulf war of 1991 his anger increasingly turned against the united states.
bin laden was especially outraged by the presence of american military bases in saudi arabia and by american support for israel in its ongoing conflict with the palestinians.
more generally bin laden and his followers saw the united states with its religious pluralism consumer culture and open sexual mores as the antithesis of the rigid values in which they what were the major policy elements of the war on terror in the wake of september 11 2001.
he feared that american influence was corrupting saudi arabia islams spiritual home and helping to keep the saudi royal family which failed to oppose this development in power.
but if al qaeda believed in traditional islamic values it also acted much like a modern transnational organization taking full advantage of globalization.
the terrorists moved freely across national borders financed themselves through international capital flows and communicated via e mail and the internet.
terrorism the targeting of civilian populations by violent organizations who hope to spread fear for a political purpose has a long history including in the united states.
during the reconstruction era after the civil war the ku klux klan and similar groups launched a reign of terror that led to the deaths of thousands of american citizens most of them newly emancipated slaves.
between the assassination of president william mckinley in 1901 and the wall street bombing of 1920 anarchists committed numerous acts of violence.
antigovernment extremist timothy mcveigh killed 168 persons when he exploded a bomb at a federal office building in oklahoma city in 1995.
in the last three decades of the twentieth century terrorist groups who held the united states and other western countries responsible for the plight of the palestinians had engaged in hijackings and murders.
in october 1985 a group of palestinians seized control of the achille lauro an italian cruise ship and killed an american jewish passenger.
in 1988 a bomb planted by operatives based in libya destroyed a pan american flight over scotland killing all 259 persons on board.
after the gulf war osama bin laden declared war on the united states.
terrorists associated with al qaeda exploded a truck bomb at the world trade center in 1993 killing six persons and set off blasts in 1998 at american the twin towers of the world trade center after being struck by hijacked airplanes on september 11 2001.
shortly after this photograph was taken the towers collapsed.
a bystander gazes at some of the missing posters with photographs of those who died on september 11.
28 september 11 and the next american century in the years following september 11 2001 fear remained a prominent feature of american life.
authorities urged americans to monitor each others activities.
this sign widely displayed on subway and railroad cars advised new yorkers if you see something say something as the sign notes 1 944 reports of suspicious behavior were made to the police in 2007.
these reports included muslims seen counting in the subway they turned out to be men counting prayers with the equivalent of rosary beads and individuals taking pictures of railroad tracks.
the 1 944 reports resulted in eighteen arrests.
none involved a terrorist plot though they did include persons selling false drivers licenses and dealing illegally in fireworks.
the war on terrorism embassies in kenya and tanzania in which more than 200 persons mostly african embassy workers died.
thus a rising terrorist threat was visible before september 11.
nonetheless the attack came as a complete surprise.
with the end of the cold war in 1991 most americans felt more secure especially within their own borders than they had for decades.
september 11 enveloped the country in a cloud of fear.
the sense of being under assault was heightened in the following weeks when unknown persons sent letters to prominent politicians and television journalists containing spores that cause the deadly disease anthrax.
five individuals postal workers and others who handled the letters died.
in the months that followed as the government periodically issued alerts concerning possible new attacks national security remained at the forefront of americans consciousness and fear of terrorism powerfully affected their daily lives.
in the immediate aftermath of september 11 the bush administration announced a war on terrorism over the next two years the united states embarked on wars in afghanistan and iraq the second with very limited international support.
it created a new department of homeland security to coordinate efforts to improve security at home and it imposed severe limits on the civil liberties of those suspected of a connection with terrorism and more generally on immigrants from the middle east.
the attacks of september 11 2001 gave new prominence to ideas deeply embedded in the american past that freedom was the central quality of american life and that the united states had a mission to spread freedom throughout the world and to fight those it saw as freedoms enemies.
the attacks and events that followed also lent new urgency to questions that had recurred many times in american history should the united states act in the world as a republic or an empire.
what is the proper balance between liberty and security.
who deserves the full enjoyment of american freedom.
none had an easy answer.
t h e wa r o n t e r r o r i s m bush before september before becoming president george w bush had been an executive in the oil industry and had served as governor of texas.
he had worked to dissociate the republican party from the harsh anti immigrant rhetoric of the what were the major policy elements of the war on terror in the wake of september 11 2001.
mid 1990s and had proven himself an effective proponent of what he called compassionate conservatism because of his narrow margin of victory in the election of 2000 he came into office without a broad popular mandate.
he had received fewer votes than his opponent al gore and his party commanded only tiny majorities in the house of representatives and senate.
nonetheless from the outset bush pursued a strongly conservative agenda.
in 2001 he persuaded congress to enact the largest tax cut in american history.
with the economy slowing he promoted the plan as a way of stimulating renewed growth.
in keeping with the supply side economic outlook embraced twenty years earlier by ronald reagan most of the tax cuts were directed toward the wealthiest americans on the assumption that they would invest the money they saved in taxes in economically productive activities.
bush also proposed changes in environmental policies including opening alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling for oil and allowing timber companies to operate in national forests claiming that this would reduce forest fires.
but soon after the passage of the tax bill senator jim jeffords of vermont a moderate republican abandoned the party and declared himself an independent.
his action gave democrats a one vote margin in the senate and made it difficult for bush to achieve further legislative victories.
bush and the world in foreign policy bush emphasized american freedom of action unrestrained by international treaties and institutions.
during the 2000 campaign he had criticized the clinton administrations penchant for nation building american assistance in creating stable governments in chaotic parts of the world.
once in office bush announced plans to push ahead with a national missile defense system another inheritance from the reagan era even though this required american withdrawal from the anti ballistic missile treaty of 1972 which barred the deployment of such systems.
he repudiated a treaty establishing an international criminal court to try violators of human rights fearing that it would assert its jurisdiction over americans.
critics charged that bush was resuming the tradition of american isolationism which had been abandoned after world war ii.
to great controversy the bush administration announced that it would not abide by the kyoto protocol of 1997 which sought to combat global warming a slow rise in the earths temperature that scientists warned could have disastrous effects on the worlds climate.
global warming is caused when gases released by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil remain in the upper atmosphere trapping heat reflected from the earth.
evidence of this development first surfaced in the 1990s when scientists studying layers of ice in greenland concluded that the earths temperature had risen significantly during the past century.
further investigations revealed that areas of the antarctic once under ice had become covered by grass and that glaciers across the globe are retreating.
today most scientists consider global warming a serious situation.
climate change threatens to disrupt long established patterns of agriculture and the melting of glaciers and the polar ice caps because of rising temperatures may raise ocean levels and flood coastal cities.
28 september 11 and the next american century the war on terrorism by the time bush took office some 180 nations including the united states had agreed to accept the goals set in the kyoto protocol for reducing the output of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels.
since the united states burns far more fossil fuel than any other nation bushs repudiation of the treaty on the grounds that it would weaken the american economy infuriated much of the world as well as environmentalists at home.
they hate freedom september 11 transformed the international situation the domestic political environment and the bush presidency.
an outpouring of popular patriotism followed the attacks all the more impressive because it was spontaneous not orchestrated by the government or private organizations.
throughout the country people demonstrated their sense of resolve and their sympathy for the victims by displaying the american flag.
public trust in government rose dramatically and public servants like firemen and policemen became national heroes.
after two decades in which the dominant language of american politics centered on deregulation and individualism the country experienced a renewed feeling of common social purpose.
americans of all backgrounds shared the sense of having lived through a traumatic experience.
the bush administration benefited from this patriotism and identification with government.
the presidents popularity soared.
as in other crises americans looked to the federal government and especially the president for reassurance leadership and decisive action.
bush seized the opportunity to give his administration a new direction and purpose.
like presidents before him he made freedom the rallying cry for a nation at war.
on september 20 2001 bush addressed a joint session of congress and a national television audience.
his speech echoed the words of fdr truman and reagan freedom and fear are at war.
the advance of human freedom.
now depends on us the countrys antagonists bush went on hate our freedoms our freedom of religion our freedom of speech our this photograph of three emergencyresponse workers at the world trade center site suggests that the composition of the construction industry labor force had become more diverse as a result of the civil rights movement.
what were the major policy elements of the war on terror in the wake of september 11 2001.
a homemade float in a july 4 2002 parade in amherst massachusetts illustrates how the twin towers had become a symbol of american patriotism.
freedom to assemble and disagree with each other in later speeches he repeated this theme.
why did terrorists attack the united states the president repeatedly asked.
his answer because we love freedom thats why.
and they hate freedom the bush doctrine bushs speech announced a new foreign policy principle which quickly became known as the bush doctrine.
the united states would launch a war on terrorism.
unlike previous wars this one had a vaguely defined enemy terrorist groups around the world that might threaten the united states or its allies and no predictable timetable for victory.
the american administration would make no distinction between terrorists and the governments that harbored them and it would recognize no middle ground in the new war either you are with us or you are with the terrorists bush demanded that afghanistan ruled by a group of islamic fundamentalists called the taliban surrender osama bin laden who had established a base in the country.
when the taliban refused the united states on october 7 2001 launched air strikes against its strongholds.
bush gave the war in afghanistan the name enduring freedom by the end of the year the combination of american bombing and ground combat by the northern alliance afghans who had been fighting the taliban for years had driven the regime from power.
a new government friendly to and dependent on the united states took its place.
it repealed taliban laws denying women the right to attend school and banning movies music and other expressions of western culture but found it difficult to establish full control over the country.
fewer than 100 americans died in the war while afghan military and civilian casualties numbered in the thousands.
but bin laden had not been found and many taliban supporters continued to pose a threat to the new governments stability.
indeed by early 2007 the taliban had reasserted their power in some parts of afghanistan and no end was in sight to the deployment of american troops there.
28 september 11 and the next american century the supporters of the bush administration who turned out in washington d c late in 2001 to confront demonstrators opposed to the war in afghanistan.
the war on terrorism axis of e v i l like the surprise attack on pearl harbor in 1941 september 11 not only plunged the united states into war but also transformed american foreign policy inspiring a determination to reshape the world in terms of american ideals and interests.
remarkable changes quickly followed the assault on afghanistan.
to facilitate further military action in the middle east the united states established military bases in central asia including former republics of the soviet union like kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and tajikistan.
such an action would have been inconceivable before the end of the cold war.
the administration sent troops to the philippines to assist that government in combating an islamic insurgency and it announced plans to establish a greater military presence in africa.
it solidified its ties with the governments of pakistan and indonesia which confronted opposition from islamic fundamentalists.
the toppling of the taliban bush repeatedly insisted marked only the beginning of the war on terrorism.
in his state of the union address of january 2002 the president accused iraq iran and north korea of harboring terrorists and developing weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological that posed a potential threat to the united states.
he called the three countries an axis of evil even though no evidence connected them with the attacks of september 11 and they had never cooperated with one another iraq and iran in fact had fought a long and bloody war in the 1980s.
the national security strategy in september 2002 one year after the september 11 attacks the bush administration released a document called the national security strategy.
like nsc 68 of 1950 discussed in chapter 23 the national security strategy outlined a fundamental shift in american foreign policy.
and like nsc 68 it began with a discussion not of weaponry or military strategy but of freedom.
the document defined freedom as consisting of political democracy freedom of expression religious toleration free trade and free markets.
these it proclaimed were universal ideals right and true for every person in every society it went on to promise that the united states would extend the benefits of freedom by fighting not only terrorists but also tyrants around the world.
since nothing less than freedom was at stake the document insisted that the united states must maintain an overwhelming preponderance of military power not allowing any other country to challenge either its overall strength or its dominance in any region of the world.
and to replace the cold war doctrine of deterrence which assumed that the certainty of retaliation would prevent attacks on the what were the major policy elements of the war on terror in the wake of september 11 2001.
united states and its allies the national security strategy announced a new foreign policy principle preemptive war.
if the united states believed that a nation posed a possible future threat to its security it had the right to attack before such a threat materialized.
an american empire.
the axis of evil speech and national security strategy sent shock waves around the world.
in the immediate aftermath of september 11 a wave of sympathy for the united states had swept across the globe.
most of the world supported the war in afghanistan as a legitimate response to the terrorist attacks.
by late 2002 however many persons overseas feared that the united states was claiming the right to act as a world policeman in violation of international law.
relations between the united states and europe warned ivo daalder a dutch born former official of the clinton administration were on a collision course because washington had become dismissive of the perspectives of others critics including leaders of close american allies wondered whether dividing the world into friends and enemies of freedom ran the danger of repeating some of the mistakes of the cold war.
antiamericanism in the middle east they argued reached far beyond bin ladens organization and stemmed not simply from dislike of american freedom but rightly or wrongly from opposition to specific american policies toward israel the palestinians and the regions corrupt and undemocratic regimes.
and like the battle against communism the war on terrorism seemed to be leading the united states to forge closer and closer ties with repressive governments like pakistan and the republics of central asia that consistently violated human rights.
charges quickly arose that the united states was bent on establishing itself as a new global empire.
indeed september 11 and its aftermath highlighted not only the vulnerability of the united states but also its overwhelming strength.
in every index of power military economic cultural the united states far outpaced the rest of the world.
it accounted for just under one third of global economic output and more than one third of global military spending.
its defense budget exceeded that of the next twenty powers combined.
the united states maintained military bases throughout the world and deployed its navy on every ocean.
it was not surprising that in such circumstances many american policymakers felt that the country had a responsibility to impose order in a dangerous world even if this meant establishing its own rules of international conduct.
in public discussion in the united states after september 11 the word empire once a term of abuse came back into widespread use.
the need to shoulder the burdens of empire emerged as a common theme in discussions among foreign policy analysts and political commentators who embraced the new foreign policy.
as we have seen the idea of the united states as an empire has a long history dating back to jeffersons empire of liberty see chapter 7 and mckinleys benevolent imperialism see chapter 17.
but talk of a new american empire alarmed people at home and abroad who did not desire to have the united states reconstruct the world in its own image.
voices of freedom from the national security strategy of the united states september 2002 the national security strategy issued in 2002 by the bush administration outlined a new foreign and military policy for the united states in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001.
it announced the doctrine of preemptive war that the united states retained the right to use its military power against countries that might pose a threat in the future.
but the document began with a statement of the administrations definition of freedom and its commitment to spreading freedom to the entire world.
the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise.
these values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society.
today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war.
the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe.
we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world.
in building a balance of power that favors freedom the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities.
nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.
nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease.
today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedoms triumph over all these foes.
the united states welcomes our opportunity to lead in this great mission.
from president barack obama s p e e c h t o t h e i s l a m i c wo r l d 2 0 0 9 in june 2009 president obama traveled to egypt to deliver a speech aimed at repairing american relations with the islamic world severely damaged by the war in iraq and the sense that many americans identified all muslims with the actions of a few terrorists.
entitled a new beginning it acknowledged past american misdeeds and promised to respect islamic traditions and values rather than trying to impose american ideas on the worlds more than 1 billion muslims.
let me also address the issue of iraq.
unlike afghanistan iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.
although i believe that the iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of saddam hussein i also believe that events in iraq have reminded america of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible.
and finally just as america can never tolerate violence by extremists we must never alter our principles.
9 11 was an enormous trauma to our country.
the fear and anger that it provoked was understandable but in some cases it led us to act contrary to our ideals.
we are i have come here to seek a new beginning between taking concrete actions to change course.
i have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the the united states and muslims around the world one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.
united states and i have ordered the prison at guantanamo bay closed by early next year.
i consider it part of my responsibility as president of the united states to fight against negative stereotypes of islam wherever they appear.
but let me be clear no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other.
that does not lessen my commitment however to that same principle must apply to muslim per governments that reflect the will of the people.
each ceptions of america.
just as muslims do not fit a crude stereotype america is not the crude stereotype of a self interested empire.
the united states has been one of the greatest sources of progress that nation gives life to this principle in its own way grounded in the traditions of its own people.
america does not presume to know what is best for everyone.
the world has ever known.
we were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words within our borders and around the world.
moreover freedom in america is indivisible from the freedom to practice ones religion.
that is why there is a mosque in every state of our union and over 1 200 mosques within our borders.
america is not and never will be at war with islam.
questions 1.
how does the national security strategy define the global mission of the united states.
how does obama hope to change relations between the united states and islamic countries.
in what ways is obamas speech a repudiation of the assumptions of the national security strategy.
28 september 11 and the next american century confronting steve bensons 2003 cartoon which alters a renowned world war ii photograph of soldiers raising an american flag illustrates widespread skepticism about american motivations in the iraq war.
an american empire.
iraq these tensions became starkly evident in the bush administrations next initiative.
the iraqi dictatorship of saddam hussein had survived its defeat in the gulf war of 1991.
husseins opponents charged that he had flouted united nations resolutions barring the regime from developing new weapons.
during the clinton administration the united states had occasionally bombed iraqi military sites in retaliation for husseins lack of cooperation with un weapons inspectors.
from the outset of the bush administration a group of conservative policymakers including vice president dick cheney secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and deputy defense secretary paul d wolfowitz were determined to oust hussein from power.
they developed a military strategy to accomplish this massive initial air strikes followed by invasion by a relatively small number of troops.
they insisted that the oppressed iraqi people would welcome an american army as liberators and quickly establish a democratic government allowing for the early departure of american soldiers.
this group seized on the opportunity presented by the attacks of september 11 to press their case and president bush adopted their outlook.
secretary of state colin powell who believed the conquest and stabilization of iraq would require hundreds of thousands of american soldiers and should not be undertaken without the support of americas allies found himself marginalized in the administration.
even though hussein was not an islamic fundamentalist and no known evidence linked him to the terrorist attacks of september 11 the bush administration in 2002 announced a goal of regime change in iraq.
hussein administration spokesmen insisted must be ousted from power because he had developed an arsenal of chemical and bacterial weapons of mass destruction and was seeking to acquire nuclear arms.
american newspaper and television journalists repeated these claims with almost no independent investigation.
the un security council agreed to step up weapons inspections but the bush administration soon declared that inspectors could never uncover husseins military capabilities.
early in 2003 despite his original misgivings secretary of state powell delivered a speech before the un outlining the administrations case.
he claimed that hussein possessed a mobile chemical weapons laboratory had hidden weapons of mass destruction in his many palaces and was seeking to acquire uranium in africa to build nuclear weapons.
every one of these assertions later turned out to be false.
shortly after powells address the president announced his intention to go to war with or without the approval of the united nations.
congress passed a resolution authorizing the president to use force if he deemed it necessary.
the iraq war the decision to go to war split the western alliance and inspired a massive antiwar movement throughout the how did the war in iraq unfold in the wake of 9 11.
in february 2003 between 10 million and 15 million people across the globe demonstrated against the impending war.
there were large scale protests in the united states which brought together veterans of the antiwar movement during the vietnam era and a diverse group of young activists united in the belief that launching a war against a nation because it might pose a security threat in the future violated international law and the un charter.
foreign policy realists including members of previous republican administrations like brent scowcroft the national security adviser under the first president bush warned that the administrations preoccupation with iraq deflected attention from its real foe al qaeda which remained capable of launching terrorist attacks.
they insisted that the united states could not unilaterally transform the middle east into a bastion of democracy as the administration claimed was its long term aim.
both traditional foes of the united states like russia and china and traditional allies like germany and france refused to support a preemptive strike against iraq.
many americans resented international criticism.
some restaurants stopped selling french wines and the senate dining room renamed french fries as freedom fries recalling the rechristening of items with german names during world war i.
unable to obtain approval from the united nations for attacking iraq the united states went to war anyway in march 2003 with great britain as its sole significant ally.
president bush called the war operation iraqi freedom its purpose he declared was to defend our freedom and bring freedom to others the hussein regime proved no match for the american armed forces with their precision bombing satellite guided missiles and welltrained soldiers.
within a month american troops occupied baghdad.
after hiding out for several months hussein was captured by american forces and subsequently put on trial before an iraqi court.
late in 2006 he was found guilty of ordering the killing of many iraqis during his reign and was sentenced to death and executed.
another vietnam.
soon after the fall of baghdad a triumphant president bush appeared in an air force flight suit on the deck of an aircraft carrier beneath a banner reading mission accomplished but after the fall of hussein everything seemed to go wrong.
rather than parades welcoming american liberators looting and chaos followed the fall of the iraqi regime.
with too few american troops to establish order mobs promptly sacked libraries museums government offices and businesses and seized caches of weapons.
an insurgency quickly developed that targeted american soldiers and iraqis cooperating with them.
sectarian violence soon swept throughout iraq with militias of shiite and sunni muslims fighting each other.
under hussein sunnis a minority of iraqs population had dominated the government and army now the shiite majority sought to exercise power and part of the massive crowd that gathered in new york city on february 15 2003 a day of worldwide demonstrations against the impending war against iraq.

despite holding a number of elections in iraq the united states found it impossible to create an iraqi government strong enough to impose order on the country.
by 2006 american intelligence agencies concluded iraq had become what it had not been before a haven for terrorists bent on attacking americans.
how did the war in iraq unfold in the wake of 9 11.
the world and the israel the west bank and gaza strip 1 967 ce a se f i re li n e jordan river fewer than 200 american soldiers died in the initial phase of the iraq war.
but by the end of 2006 iraq stood at the brink of civil war.
american deaths had reached nearly 3 000 with 20 000 or more wounded.
according to the estimates of u s and iraqi scientists hundreds of thousands of iraqis most of them civilians had also died and tens of thousands more had fled to neighboring countries seeking safety.
initially the bush administration had estimated that the war would cost 60 billion to be paid for largely by iraqs own oil revenues.
by early 2006 expenditures had reached 200 billion and were climbing fast and the insurgency prevented iraq from resuming significant oil production.
some economists estimated that the iraq war would end up costing the united states nearly 2 trillion an almost unimaginable sum.
with no end in sight to the conflict comparisons with the american experience in vietnam became commonplace.
iraq and vietnam of course have very different histories cultures and geographies.
but in both wars american policy was made by officials who had little or no knowledge of the countries to which they were sending troops and distrusted state department experts on these regions who tended be skeptical about the possibility of achieving quick military and long term political success.
the wars architects preferred to get their knowledge of iraq from saddam husseins exiled opponents who exaggerated their own popularity and the degree of popular support for an american invasion.
administration officials gave little thought to postwar planning.
mediterranean sea nablus wes t ba n k 1 94 9 arm i s t i ce li n e ramallah israel g aza str ip war the war marked a new departure in american foreign policy.
the united states had frequently intervened unilaterally in the affairs of latin american countries.
but outside the western hemisphere it had previously been reluctant to use force except as part of an international coalition.
and while the united states had exerted enormous influence in the middle east since world war ii never before had it occupied a nation in the center of the worlds most volatile region.
rarely in its history had the united states found itself so isolated from world public opinion.
initially the war in iraq proved to be popular in the united states.
after all unlike earlier wars this one brought no calls for public sacrifice from the administration.
there were no tax increases and no reintroduction of the draft to augment the hard pressed all volunteer army.
many americans believed the administrations claims that saddam hussein had something to do with september 11 and had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction.
the realization that in fact hussein had no such weapons discredited the administrations rationale for the war.
subsequent investigations revealed that intelligence reports at variance with administration claims had been sidetracked or ignored.
with the weapons argument discredited the bush administration increasingly defended the war as an effort to bring freedom to the people of iraq.
this argument resonated with deeply rooted american values.
but by early 2007 polls showed that a large majority of americans considered the invasion of iraq a mistake and the war a lost cause.

28 september 11 and the next american century the aftermath of september 11 at home president bush standing on the deck of the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln on may 10 2003 announcing the end of combat operations in iraq.
a banner proclaims mission accomplished unfortunately the war was not in fact over.
much of the outside world now viewed the united states as a superpower unwilling to abide by the rules of international law.
they believed that a nation whose declaration of independence had proclaimed its signers decent respect to the opinions of mankind had become indifferent or hostile to the views of others.
as early as 2003 a survey of global opinion had found that even in western europe large numbers of people viewed the united states as a threat to world peace.
the fact that iraq possessed the worlds second largest reserves of oil reinforced suspicions that american motives had less to do with freedom than self interest.
the iraq war severely strained the united nations and the western alliance created in the aftermath of world war ii.
but whatever the outcome for the third time in less than a century the united states had embarked on a crusade to create a new world order.
t h e a f t e r m at h o f s e p t e m b e r 1 1 at h o m e security and liberty like earlier wars the war on terrorism raised anew the problem of balancing security and liberty.
in the immediate aftermath of the attacks congress rushed to passage the usa patriot act a mammoth bill it ran to more than 300 pages that few members of the house or senate had actually read.
it conferred unprecedented powers on law enforcement agencies charged with preventing the new vaguely defined crime of domestic terrorism including the power to wiretap spy on citizens open letters read e mail and obtain personal records from third parties like universities and libraries without the knowledge of a suspect.
unlike during world wars i and ii with their campaigns of hatred against german americans and japanese americans the bush administration made a point of discouraging anti arab and anti muslim sentiment.
nonetheless at least 5 000 foreigners with middle eastern connections were rounded up and more than 1 200 arrested.
many with no link to terrorism were held for months without either a formal charge or a public notice of their fate.
the administration also set up a detention camp at the u s naval base at guantnamo bay cuba for persons captured in afghanistan or otherwise accused of how did the war on terror affect the economy and american liberties.
more than 700 persons the nationals of many foreign countries were detained there.
in november 2001 the bush administration issued an executive order authorizing the holding of secret military tribunals for noncitizens deemed to have assisted terrorism.
in such trials traditional constitutional protections such as the right of the accused to choose a lawyer and see all the evidence would not apply.
a few months later the justice department declared that american citizens could be held indefinitely without charge and not allowed to see a lawyer if the government declared them to be enemy combatants the presidents press secretary ari fleischer warned americans to watch what they say and attorney general john ashcroft declared that criticism of administration policies aided the countrys terrorist enemies.
the power of the president in the new atmosphere of heightened security numerous court orders and regulations of the 1970s inspired by abuses of the cia fbi and local police forces were rescinded allowing these agencies to resume surveillance of americans without evidence that a crime had been committed.
some of these measures were authorized by congress but the president implemented many of them unilaterally claiming the authority to ignore laws that restricted his power as commander in chief in wartime.
thus soon after september 11 president bush authorized the national security agency nsa to eavesdrop on americans telephone conversations without a court warrant a clear violation of a law limiting the nsa to foreign intelligence gathering.
two centuries earlier in the 1790s james madison had predicted that for many years to come the danger to individual liberty would lie in abuse of power by congress.
this is why the bill of rights barred congress not the president or the states from abridging civil liberties.
but madison continued in the long run the president might pose the greatest danger especially in time of war.
in war he wrote the discretionary power of the executive is extended no nation madison believed could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare madisons remarkable warning about how presidents might seize the power afforded them in war to limit freedom has been borne out at many points in american history from lincolns suspension of the writ of habeas corpus to wilsons suppression of free speech and franklin d roosevelts internment of japanese americans.
the administration of george w bush was no exception.
but no other president had ever made so sweeping an assertion of the power to violate both longstanding constitutional principles such as the right to trial by jury and any law he chooses during wartime.
the majority of americans seemed willing to accept the administrations contention that restraints on time honored liberties were necessary to fight terrorism especially since these restraints applied primarily to muslims and immigrants from the middle east.
others recalled previous times when wars produced limitations on civil liberties and public officials equated political dissent with lack of patriotism the alien and sedition acts during the quasiwar with france in 1798 the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus during the civil war the severe repression of free speech and persecution of german americans during world war i japanese american internment in world war ii and mccarthyism during the cold war.
these episodes underscored the fragility of principles most americans have learned to take for ch.
28 september 11 and the next american century the aftermath of september 11 at home granted civil liberties and the ideal of equality before the law regardless of race and ethnicity.
the debate over liberty and security seemed certain to last as long as the war on terrorism itself.
the based on an infamous photograph circulated around the world of an iraqi prisoner abused while in american custody this 2004 cartoon suggests how such mistreatment damaged the image of the united states.
torture controversy officials of the bush administration also insisted in the aftermath of september 11 that the united states need not be bound by international law in pursuing the war on terrorism.
they were especially eager to sidestep the geneva conventions and the international convention against torture which regulate the treatment of prisoners of war and prohibit torture and other forms of physical and mental coercion.
in january 2002 the justice department produced a memorandum stating that these rules did not apply to captured members of al qaeda as they were unlawful combatants not members of regularly constituted armies.
white house counsel alberto gonzales who later became attorney general advised the president that the geneva accords were quaint and obsolete in this new kind of war in february 2003 president bush issued a directive that denied al qaeda and taliban prisoners the geneva protections.
amid strong protests from secretary of state powell and senior military officers who feared that the new policy would encourage the retaliatory mistreatment of american prisoners of war in april 2003 the president prohibited the use of torture except where special permission had been granted.
nonetheless the defense department approved methods of interrogation that most observers considered torture.
in addition the cia set up a series of jails in foreign countries outside the traditional chain of military command and took part in the rendition of suspects that is kidnapping them and spiriting them to prisons in egypt yemen syria and former communist states of eastern europe where torture is practiced.
in this atmosphere and lacking clear rules of behavior some military personnel in afghanistan at abu ghraib prison in iraq and at guantnamo beat prisoners who were being held for interrogation subjected them to electric shocks let them be attacked by dogs and forced them to strip naked and lie atop other prisoners.
some prisoners in u s custody died from their maltreatment.
as it turned out the military guards and interrogators who committed these acts had not been adequately trained for their missions.
indeed some took photographs of the maltreatment of prisoners and circulated them by e mail.
inevitably the photos became public.
their exposure around the world in newspapers on television and on the internet undermined the reputation of the united states as a country that adheres to standards of civilized behavior and the rule of law.
the military investigated prisoner abuse but punished only a few low level visions of freedom freedom certain restrictions apply.
this work by the artist george mill includes language that parodies the small print in advertisements and consumer warranties.
the disclaimer reads certain restrictions apply.

the right of freedom is made available as is and without warranty of any kind this was part of a 2008 exhibit in which artists produced works on the theme thoughts on freedom many of the works suggested that the policies of the bush administration had made americans freedom more precarious.
questions 1.
what restrictions on freedom do you think the artist has in mind.
what is the purpose of juxtaposing the large word freedom with the small print.
28 september 11 and the next american century the aftermath of september 11 at home soldiers not the commanders who were supposed to be in charge of these prisons and had tolerated or failed to halt the abuse.
after much debate congress in 2005 inserted in the defense appropriations act a measure sponsored by senator john mccain of arizona a former prisoner of war in vietnam banning the use of torture.
president bush signed the bill but issued a signing statement reaffirming his right as commander in chief to set rules for the military by himself.
late in 2008 and early the following year previously secret government documents were released demonstrating that torture was the result not of missteps by a few bad apples as the administration had claimed but decisions at the highest levels of government.
secretary of defense donald rumsfeld attorney general alberto gonzales and other officials had authorized the torture of persons captured in the war on terrorism over the objections of many in the military.
ironically some of the techniques used especially water boarding simulated drowning had been employed by the government during the korean war to train soldiers how to withstand torture if captured by the enemy.
no one in the administration seemed concerned about what these practices might do to the reputation of the united states as a law abiding nation.
the revelations left a difficult question for the administration of barack obama whether or not to prosecute officials and interrogators who had violated international treaties and american laws.
the economy under bush in the congressional elections of 2002 bush took full advantage of his post september 11 popularity campaigning actively for republican candidates.
his intervention was credited with helping his party increase its small majorities in the house and senate in defiance of the traditional pattern in which the presidents party loses seats in midterm elections.
continuing chaos in iraq began to undermine support for bushs foreign policy.
but the main threat to the presidents reelection appeared to be the condition of the american economy.
during 2001 the economy slipped into a recession that is it contracted rather than grew.
growth resumed at the end of the year but with businesses reluctant to make new investments after the overexpansion of the 1990s it failed to generate new jobs.
the o b l e s s recovery talk of economic pain reappeared in public discussions.
the sectors that had expanded the most in the previous decade contracted rapidly.
the computer industry slashed more than 40 percent of its jobs during the first two years of the bush presidency.
thanks to the internet jobs as computer programmers and other highly skilled technology positions could be shifted to india which had a large number of well educated persons willing to work for far less than their american counterparts.
employment in the media advertising and telecommunications industries also fell.
the difficulties of these sectors received much publicity.
but in fact 90 percent of the jobs lost during the recession of 2001 2002 were in manufacturing.
despite the renewed spirit of patriotism deindustrialization continued.
textile firms closed southern plants and shifted production to how did the war on terror affect the economy and american liberties.
cheap labor factories in china and india.
maytag a manufacturer of washing machines refrigerators and other home appliances announced plans to close its factory in galesburg illinois where wages averaged fifteen dollars per hour to open a new one in mexico where workers earned less than one seventh that amount.
even after economic recovery began the problems of traditional industries continued.
employment in steel 520 000 in 1970 had dropped to 120 000 by 2004.
late in 2005 facing declining profits and sales general motors which once had 600 000 employees announced plans to reduce its american workforce to 86 000.
major companies also moved to eliminate the remnants of the post world war ii social contract in which industries provided manufacturing workers with both high paying jobs and the promise that they would be provided for in old age.
many eliminated or sharply reduced pensions and health benefits for retired workers.
between 1988 and 2004 the number of private businesses with pension plans fell by two thirds.
rapid job creation during the 1990s had benefited those at the bottom of the economic scale and especially racial minorities.
now they suffered the most from the economys continued shedding of jobs in the early 2000s.
for example the black and latino unemployment rates stood at double that for whites.
indeed bush became the first president since herbert hoover to see the economy lose jobs over the course of a four year term.
the bush administration responded to economic difficulties by supporting the federal reserve boards policy of reducing interest rates and by proposing another round of tax cuts.
in 2003 the president signed into law a 320 billion tax reduction one of the largest in american history.
in accordance with supply side theory the cuts were again geared to reducing the tax burden on wealthy individuals and corporations.
left to future generations were the questions of how to deal with a rapidly mounting federal deficit which exceeded 400 billion a record in 2004 and how to pay for the obligations of the federal government and the needs of american society.
the economy grew at the healthy rate of 4 2 percent in 2004.
but job creation proceeded more slowly than during previous recoveries.
because of the continuing decline in union membership which fell to 8 percent of private sector employees in 2006 the failure of congress to raise the minimum wage which between 1997 and 2006 remained at 5 15 per hour thereby steadily falling in real value the continuing shift of higher paying manufacturing jobs overseas and the skewing of the tax cuts toward the most wealthy americans economic inequality continued to increase.
the real income of average american families fell slightly despite the economic recovery.
the number of americans without health insurance continued its upward climb reaching 16 percent of the population by 2005.
nearly all the benefits of growth went to the top 5 percent of the population.
the winds of change the e l e c t i o n with bushs popularity sliding because of the war in iraq and a widespread sense that many americans were not benefiting from economic growth democrats in 2004 sensed a golden opportunity to retake the white house.
they nominated as their candidate john kerry a senator ch.
28 september 11 and the next american century from massachusetts and the first catholic to run for president since john f kennedy in 1960.
a decorated combat veteran in vietnam kerry had joined the antiwar movement after leaving the army.
the party hoped that kerrys military experience would insulate him from republican 3 4 4 charges that democrats were too weak willed to be trusted to protect the united states from further terrorist attacks while his antiwar credentials in vietnam would appeal to voters opposed to the invasion of iraq.
21 11 3 15 5 13 kerry proved a surprisingly ineffective candidate.
an aloof man who lacked the common touch he failed to gen11 erate the same degree of enthusiasm among his supporters 6 9 15 as bush did among his.
kerrys inability to explain why he voted in favor of the iraq war in the senate only to denounce it later as a major mistake enabled republicans to portray him as lacking the kind of resolution neceselectoral vote popular vote sary in dangerous times.
meanwhile karl rove bushs share share chief political adviser worked assiduously to mobilize 286 53 2 62 040 606 51 252 46 8 59 028 109 48 the republican partys conservative base by having 411 304 1 republicans stress the presidents stance on cultural issues opposition to the extension of the right to marry to homosexuals which the supreme court of massachusetts had ruled must receive legal recognition in that state opposition to abortion rights and so on.
throughout the campaign polls predicted a very close election.
bush won a narrow victory with a margin of 2 percent of the popular vote and thirty four electoral votes.
the results revealed a remarkable electoral stability.
both sides had spent tens of millions of dollars in advertising and had mobilized new voters nearly 20 million since 2000.
but in the end only three states voted differently than four years earlier new hampshire which kerry carried and iowa and new mexico which swung to bush.
post election polls initially suggested that moral values held the key to the election outcome leading some commentators to urge democrats to make peace with the religious right.
most evangelical christians indeed voted for bush.
but the moral values category was a grab bag indicating everything from hostility to abortion rights to the desire for a leader who says what he means and apparently means what he says.
more important to the outcome were the attacks of september 11 and the sense of being engaged in a worldwide war on terror.
no american president who has sought reelection during wartime has ever been defeated although harry s truman and lyndon johnson declined to run again during unpopular wars.
the bush campaign consistently and successfully appealed to fear with continuous reminders of september 11 and warnings of future attacks.
republicans also slightly increased their majorities in the house of representatives and the senate.
but the most striking feature of the congressional races was that by the careful drawing of district lines in state legislatures both parties had managed to make a majority of the seats safe ones.
only three incumbents were defeated for reelection and nearly all the house seats were won by a margin of 10 percent or more.
in the old days one commentator quipped voters chose their political leaders.
today politicians choose their voters.
the presidential election of 2004 party republican democrat independent candidate bush kerry nader the winds of change what events eroded support for president bushs policies during his second term.
bush s second term in his second inaugural address in january 2005 bush outlined a new american goal ending tyranny in the world striking a more conciliatory tone than during his first administration he promised that the united states would not try to impose our style of government on others and that it would in the future seek the advice of allies.
he said nothing specific about iraq but tried to shore up falling support for the war by invoking the ideal of freedom the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands in his first inaugural in january 2001 bush had used the words freedom free or liberty seven times.
in his second they appeared forty nine times.
again and again bush insisted that the united states stands for the worldwide triumph of freedom.
republicans were overjoyed by bushs electoral triumph.
now comes the revolution declared one conservative leader.
but the ongoing chaos in iraq coupled with a spate of corruption scandals surrounding republicans in congress and the white house eroded bushs standing.
vice president cheneys chief of staff was convicted of perjury in connection with an investigation of the illegal leak to the press of the name of a cia operative whose husband had criticized the manipulation of intelligence before the invasion of iraq.
he was the first white house official to be indicted while holding office since orville babcock grants chief of staff in 1875.
a texas grand jury indicted tom delay the house majority leader for violating campaign finance laws and jack abramoff a republican activist and lobbyist pleaded guilty to defrauding his clients and bribing public officials.
a culture of corruption democrats charged had overtaken the nations capital.
bushs popularity continued to decline.
at one point in 2006 his approval rating fell to 31 percent.
bush did get congress in 2005 to extend the life of the patriot act with a few additional safeguards for civil liberties.
but otherwise the first two years of his second term were devoid of significant legislative achievement.
bush launched a highly publicized campaign to reform the social security system the most enduring and popular legacy of the new deal by allowing workers to set up private retirement accounts a step toward eliminating the entire system democrats charged but it got nowhere.
congress rejected the presidents proposal to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil drilling and it refused to eliminate the estate tax a tax on property owned at a persons death which affected only the richest 1 percent of americans.
hurricane katrina a further blow to the bush administrations standing came in august 2005 when hurricane katrina slammed ashore near new orleans.
situated below sea level between the mississippi river and lake pontchartrain new orleans has always been vulnerable to flooding.
for years scientists had predicted a catastrophe if a hurricane hit the city.
but requests to strengthen its levee system had been ignored by the federal government.
when the storm hit on august 29 the levees broke and nearly the entire city with a population of half a million was inundated.
nearby areas of the louisiana and mississippi gulf coast were also hard hit.
28 september 11 and the next american century a satellite photograph superimposed on a map of the gulf coast shows the immensity of hurricane katrina as its eye moved over new orleans.
the winds of change the natural disaster quickly became a man made one with ineptitude evident from local government to the white house.
the mayor of new orleans had been slow to order an evacuation fearing this would damage the citys tourist trade.
when he finally instructed residents to leave a day before the storms arrival he neglected to provide for the thousands who did not own automobiles and were too poor to find other means of transportation.
in november 2002 a new department of homeland security had been created absorbing many existing intelligence agencies including the federal emergency management agency fema which is responsible for disaster planning and relief within the united states.
fema was headed by michael brown who lacked experience in disaster management and had apparently been appointed because he was a college friend of his predecessor in the office.
although warned of impending disaster by the national weather service fema had done almost no preparation.
vacationing in texas the president announced that new orleans had dodged the bullet when the storm veered away from a direct hit.
when he finally visited the city he seemed unaware of the scope of devastation.
if the bush administration had prided itself on anything it was competence in dealing with disaster.
katrina shattered that image.
the new orleans disaster for days vast numbers of people most of them poor african americans remained abandoned amid the floodwaters.
the government was not even aware that thousands had gathered at the new orleans convention center without food water or shelter until television reporters asked federal officials about their status.
for days bodies floated in the streets and people died in city hospitals and nursing homes.
by the time aid began to arrive damage stood at 80 billion the death toll was around 1 500 and two thirds of the citys population had been displaced.
the what events eroded support for president bushs policies during his second term.
televised images of misery in the streets of new orleans shocked the world and shamed the country.
to leave the poorest behind and unhelped one editorial writer commented was like abandoning wounded soldiers on a battlefield.
hurricane katrina shone a bright light on both the heroic and the less praiseworthy sides of american life.
where government failed individual citizens stepped into the breach.
people with boats rescued countless survivors from rooftops and attics private donations flowed in to aid the victims and neighboring states like texas opened their doors to thousands of refugees.
like the publication of jacob riiss how the other half lives 1890 and michael harringtons the other america 1962 the hurricanes aftermath alerted americans to the extent of poverty in the worlds richest country.
generations of state and local policies pursuing economic growth via low wage nonunion employment and low investment in education health and social welfare had produced a large impoverished population in the south.
once a racially mixed city new orleans was now essentially segregated with a population two thirds black surrounded by mostly white suburbs.
nearly 30 percent of new orleanss population lived in poverty and of these seven eighths were black.
for a moment people previously invisible to upper and middle class america appeared on television screens and magazine covers.
stung by criticism of his response to the hurricane president bush spoke of the need to take aggressive action against deep persistent poverty whose roots lay in a history of racial discrimination but unwilling to raise taxes the republican congress instead cut billions of dollars from medicaid food stamps and other social programs to help pay for rebuilding efforts along the gulf coast.
a year after the hurricane hit the population of new orleans stood at half the pre storm total and reconstruction had barely begun in many neighborhoods.
hurricane katrina had another result as well.
the shutting down of oil refining capacity on the gulf coast led to an immediate rise in the price of oil and thus of gasoline for american drivers.
with the rapidly growing economies of china and india needing more and more oil and with instability in the middle east threatening to affect oil production prices remained at historic highs throughout 2006.
despite decades of talk about the need to develop alternative energy supplies the united states remained as dependent as ever on imported oil and extremely vulnerable to potential disruptions of oil imports.
rising prices threatened to derail the economic recovery by dampening consumer spending on other goods.
they also dealt yet another blow to american automobile manufacturers who had staked their futures on sales of light trucks and sport utility vehicles suvs.
these vehicles generated high profits for the car companies but achieved very low gas mileage.
when gas prices rose consumers shifted their purchasing to smaller cars with better fuel efficiency most of which were produced by japanese and other foreign automakers.
residents of new orleans stranded on a rooftop days after flood waters engulfed the city frantically attempt to attract the attention of rescue helicopters.
28 september 11 and the next american century the immigration the winds of change debate in the spring of 2006 an issue as old as the american nation suddenly burst again onto the center stage of politics immigration.
as we have seen the hart celler act of 1965 led to a radical shift in the origins of those entering the united states and especially the rapid growth of the hispanic population.
the influx of immigrants proceeded apace during the first five years of the twenty first century.
by 2005 immigrants represented 12 4 percent of the nations population up from 11 2 percent in 2000.
many of these newcomers were bypassing traditional immigrant destinations and heading for areas in the midwest small town new england and the upper south.
the city with the highest rate of growth of its immigrant population from 1990 to 2005 was nashville tennessee.
racial and ethnic diversity was now a fact of life in the american heartland.
alongside legal immigrants undocumented newcomers made their way to the united states mostly from mexico.
at the end of 2005 it was estimated there were 11 million illegal aliens in the united states 7 million of them members of the workforce.
economists disagree about their impact.
it seems clear that the presence of large numbers of uneducated low skilled workers pushes down wages at the bottom of the economic ladder especially affecting african americans.
on the other hand immigrants both legal and illegal receive regular paychecks spend money and pay taxes.
they fill jobs for which american workers seem to be unavailable because the wages are so low.
it is estimated that more than one fifth of construction workers domestic workers and agricultural workers are in the united states illegally.
as noted in previous chapters mexican immigration has long been a controversial subject especially in the southwest.
before 1924 there were no limits on immigration from the western hemisphere.
during the 1930s hundreds of thousands of mexican americans were repatriated.
the bracero program of the 1940s and 1950s brought thousands of mexicans into the united states under labor contracts as migrant agricultural workers.
operation wetback in 1954 sent 1 million mexicans home.
since the rise of the chicano movement of the late 1960s and 1970s the mexicanamerican community has generally defended the rights of undocumented workers although some advocates have feared that the presence of illegal aliens lowers the standing in the eyes of other americans of everyone of mexican descent.
unions generally fear that such workers lower wages for all low skilled workers and make labor organizing more difficult.
in 1986 the reagan administration had granted amnesty that is the right to remain in the united states and become citizens to 3 million illegal immigrants.
during the 1990s conservatives in states with significant populations of illegal immigrants especially california had called for a tough crackdown on their entry and rights within the united states.
as governor of texas by contrast george w bush had strived to win hispanic support and downplayed the immigration issue.
but in 2006 with many americans convinced that the united states had lost control of its borders and that immigration was in part responsible for the stagnation of real wages the house of representatives approved a bill making it a felony to be in the country illegally and a crime to offer aid to illegal immigrants.
what events eroded support for president bushs policies during his second term.
the immigrant rights movement the response was utterly unexpected a series of massive demonstrations in the spring of 2006 by immigrants legal and illegal and their supporters demanding the right to remain in the country as citizens.
in cities from new york to chicago los angeles phoenix and dallas hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets.
nashville experienced the largest public demonstration in its history a march of more than 10 000 mostly hispanic immigrants.
people living at the margins of american society suddenly found their voice.
all that we want is to have a shot at the american dream said one.
another an iraq war veteran who marched with his parents who had come to the country illegally said ive fought for freedom overseas.
now im fighting for freedom here at the same time church groups used to sheltering and feeding the destitute denounced the proposed bill as akin to the fugitive slave law of 1850 for making it a crime to help a suffering human being and vowed to resist it.
on the other hand many conservatives condemned the marches as ominous and their display of the flags of the marchers homelands as repellant when the senate passed a different immigrant bill tightening patrols of the border but offering a route to citizenship for illegal aliens the house refused to approve it.
all congress could agree on was a measure to build a 700 mile wall along part of the u s mexico border.
in early 2007 the immigration issue was at a stalemate and its ultimate resolution impossible to predict.
the constitution and liberty as in the 1980s and 1990s conservatives proved far more successful in implementing their views in economic and foreign policy than in the ongoing culture wars.
two significant supreme court decisions in june in april 2006 millions of people demonstrated for immigrant rights.
this photograph shows part of the immense crowd in chicago bearing the flags of many nations.
28 september 11 and the next american century the winds of change 2003 revealed how the largely conservative justices had come to accept that the social revolution that began during the 1960s could not be undone.
in two cases arising from challenges to the admissions policies of the university of michigan the supreme court issued its most important rulings on affirmative action since the bakke case twenty five years earlier.
a 5 4 majority upheld the right of colleges and universities to take race into account in admissions decisions.
writing for the majority justice sandra day oconnor argued that such institutions have a legitimate interest in creating a diverse student body to enhance education.
the bush administration had urged the court to reject affirmative action.
but oconnor was strongly influenced by briefs on its behalf filed by corporate executives and retired military officers.
in todays world they argued the united states cannot compete in the global economy or maintain effective armed services without drawing its college trained business and military leaders from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds.
in the second decision in lawrence v texas a 6 3 majority declared unconstitutional a texas law making homosexual acts a crime.
written by justice anthony kennedy the majority opinion overturned the courts 1986 ruling in bowers v hardwick which had upheld a similar georgia law.
today kennedy insisted the idea of liberty includes not only freedom of thought belief and expression but intimate conduct as well.
the decision was a triumph for the feminist and gay movements which had long campaigned to extend the idea of freedom into the most personal realms of life.
and it repudiated the conservative view that constitutional interpretation must rest either on the original intent of the founding fathers or on a narrow reading of the documents text.
instead kennedy reaffirmed the liberal view of the constitution as a living document whose protections expand as society changes.
times can blind us to certain truths he wrote and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress.
as the constitution endures persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom the court and the president nor did the supreme court prove receptive to president bushs claim of authority to disregard laws and treaties and to suspend constitutional protections of individual liberties.
in a series of decisions the court reaffirmed the rule of law both for american citizens and for foreigners held prisoner by the united states.
the first cases were decided in 2004.
in rasul v bush the court allowed a british citizen held at guantnamo bay cuba to challenge his incarceration in federal court.
in hamdi v rumsfeld it considered the lawsuit of yasir hamdi an american citizen who had moved to saudi arabia and been captured in afghanistan.
hamdi was imprisoned in a military jail in south carolina without charge or the right to see a lawyer.
the court ruled that he had a right to a judicial hearing.
a state of war wrote sandra day oconnor for the 8 1 majority is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nations citizens even justice antonin scalia the courts most prominent conservative rejected the presidents claim of authority to imprison a citizen at will as antithetical to the very core of what events eroded support for president bushs policies during his second term.
liberty after claiming in court that hamdi was so dangerous that he could not even be allowed a hearing the administration allowed him to return to saudi arabia on condition that he relinquish his american citizenship.
by the time the next significant case hamdan v rumsfeld came before the court in 2006 president bush had appointed two new justices chief justice john roberts to replace william rehnquist who died in 2005 and samuel alito jr who succeeded the retiring sandra day oconnor.
the court was clearly becoming more conservative.
but in june 2006 by a 5 3 margin with roberts not participating because he had ruled on the case while serving on an appeals court the justices offered a stinging rebuke to the key presumptions of the bush administration that the geneva conventions do not apply to prisoners captured in the war on terrorism that the president can unilaterally set up secret military tribunals in which defendants have very few if any rights and that the constitution does not apply at guantnamo.
congress the majority noted had never authorized such tribunals and they clearly violated the protections afforded to prisoners of war by the geneva conventions which the court declared was the law of the land.
like the nixon tapes case of 1974 the decision was a striking illustration of the separation of powers envisioned by the constitutions framers an affirmation that the courts have the right and responsibility to oversee actions by the president.
however it was unusual that the decision came in wartime.
the court had upheld jailings under the sedition act in world war i and japanese internment in world war ii.
previously the court had only exerted its oversight authority once peace arrived.
but bushs claims of presidential authority had been so sweeping that a judicial reaction was all but inevitable.
as the war on terror entered its sixth year later in 2006 the scope of the presidents power to detain and punish suspects outside of normal legal procedures remained unresolved.
in september 2006 in response to the hamdan decision congress enacted a bill authorizing the establishment of special military tribunals to try accused terrorists and giving the president the authority to jail without charge anyone he declared to be an illegal enemy combatant the measure authorized certain kinds of harsh treatment of prisoners with evidence obtained during coercive interrogations usable in these new courts and stripped detainees in military prisons of the right to challenge their detention in federal courts.
many military lawyers objected strongly to these provisions as did other army officials fearing that captured u s soldiers might be subjected to the same treatment.
it remained to be seen whether the supreme court would allow congress to override the geneva conventions and eliminate judicial oversight of the treatment of prisoners.
in june 2008 for the third time in four years the supreme court rebuffed the bush administrations strategy of denying detainees at guantnamo bay the normal protections guaranteed by the constitution.
written by justice anthony kennedy the 5 4 decision in boumediene v bush affirmed the detainees right to challenge their detention in u s courts.
the laws and constitution are designed kennedy wrote to survive and remain in force in extraordinary times security he added consists not simply in military might but in fidelity to freedoms first principles including freedom from arbitrary arrest and the right of a person to go to court to challenge his or her imprisonment.
28 september 11 and the next american century the midterm elections the winds of change of with president bushs popularity having plummeted because of the war in iraq and the hurricane katrina disaster congress beset by scandal after scandal and public opinion polls revealing that a majority of americans believed the country to be on the wrong track democrats expected to reap major gains in the congressional elections of 2006.
they were not disappointed.
interest in the election ran high.
voter turnout in 2006 exceeded 40 percent of those eligible the highest figure for a midterm election since 1990.
in a sweeping repudiation of the administration voters gave democrats control of both houses of congress for the first time since the republican sweep of 1994.
in january 2007 democrat nancy pelosi of california became the first female speaker of the house in american history.
no sooner had the votes been counted than political observers began to speculate about the presidential election of 2008 the first time since 1952 that the major party candidates for the highest office in the land would not include a sitting president or vice president.
as the end of his second term approached bushs popularity sank to historic lows.
this occurred even though in november 2008 the united states and iraq approved an agreement providing for the withdrawal of all american troops by 2011 thus ensuring that one of the longest and most unpopular wars in american history would come to an end.
by sending more troops to iraq in 2007 a step that bush mindful of memories of vietnam called a surge rather than an escalation and by forging alliances with local tribal leaders anxious to end the bloodshed the administration had achieved a significant decline in violence in iraq making american withdrawal seem possible.
by the time bush left office more than 4 000 american soldiers had died in iraq.
but no one could predict what a postwar iraq would look like.
in january 2009 as bushs presidency came to an end only 22 percent of americans approved of his performance in office the lowest figure since such polls began in the mid twentieth century.
indeed it was difficult to think of many substantive achievements during bushs eight years in office.
his foreign policy alienated most of the world leaving the united states militarily weakened and diplomatically isolated.
because of the tax cuts for the wealthy that he pushed through congress during his first term as well as the cost of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the large budget surplus he had inherited was transformed into an immense deficit.
his initiatives on immigration and social security reform went nowhere.
the percentage of americans living in poverty and those without health insurance rose substantially during bushs presidency.
the housing bubble at one point in his administration bush might have pointed to the economic recovery that began in 2001 as a major success.
but late in 2007 the economy entered a recession.
and in 2008 the american banking system suddenly found itself on the brink of collapse threatening to drag the national and world economies into a repeat of the great depression.
the roots of the crisis of 2008 lay in a combination of public and private policies that favored economic speculation free wheeling spending and what events eroded support for president bushs policies during his second term.
a stalled residential project in merced california symbolizes the collapse of the housing bubble in 2008.
merced like many communities in california was the site of numerous housing developments planned to be built when prices were at their peak.
when prices fell developers declared bankruptcy.

for years the federal reserve bank kept interest rates at unprecedented low levels first to help the economy recover from the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000 and then to enable more americans to borrow money to purchase homes.
the result was a new bubble as housing prices rose rapidly.
consumer indebtedness also rose dramatically as people who owned houses took out second mortgages or simply spent to the limits on their credit cards.
in mid 2008 when the median family income was around 50 000 the average american family owed an 84 000 home mortgage 14 000 in auto and student loans 8 500 to credit card companies and 10 000 in home equity loans.
all this borrowing fueled increased spending.
the yearly savings of the average family amounted to less than 400.
an immense influx of cheap goods from china accelerated the loss of manufacturing jobs in the united states which continued their decline despite the overall economic recovery but also enabled americans to keep buying even though for most household income stagnated during the bush years.
indeed china helped to finance the american spending spree by buying up hundreds of billions of dollars worth of federal bonds in effect loaning money to the united states so that it could purchase chinese made goods.
banks and other lending institutions issued more and more subprime mortgages risky loans to people who lacked the income to meet their monthly payments.
the initially low interest rates on these loans were set to rise dramatically after a year or two.
banks assumed that home prices would keep rising and if they had to foreclose they could easily resell the property at a profit.

these graphs offer a vivid visual with the value of their homes and stock market accounts in free fall illustration of the steep decline in the americans cut back on spending leading to business failures and a rapid american economy in 2008 and the first rise in unemployment.
by the end of 2008 2 5 million jobs had been lost part of 2009 the most in any year since the end of world war ii.
unemployment was concentrated in manufacturing and construction sectors dominated by men.
as a result by mid 2009 for the first time in american history more women than men in the united states held paying jobs.
in the last three months of 2008 and again in the first three of 2009 the gross domestic product of the united states decreased by 6 percent a remarkably swift contraction.
even worse than the economic meltdown was the meltdown of confidence as millions of americans lost their jobs and or their homes and saw their retirement savings and pensions if invested in the stock market disappear.
in april 2009 the recession that began in december 2007 became the longest since the great depression.
in an era of globalization economic crises inevitably spread worldwide.
the decline in spending in the united states led to unemployment in china and plunging car sales led to a sharp decline in oil prices and economic problems in oil producing countries like russia nigeria and saudi arabia.
housing bubbles collapsed around the world from ireland to dubai.
the mortgage crisis affected minorities the most.
many had been steered by banks into subprime mortgages even when they had the assets and income to qualify for more traditional lower cost loans.
as a result foreclosures were highest in minority areas and the gains blacks asians and hispanics had made in home ownership between 1995 and 2004 now eroded.

a conspiracy against the public in the wealth of nations 1776 adam smith wrote people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public this certainly seemed an apt description of the behavior of leading bankers and investment houses whose greed helped to bring down the american economy.
like the scandals of the 1920s and 1990s those of the bush era damaged confidence in the ethics of corporate leaders.
indeed striking parallels existed between these three decades the get rich quick ethos the close connection between business and government the passion for deregulation and widespread corruption.
fueled by revelations of corporate misdeeds the reputation of stock brokers and bankers fell to lows last seen during the great depression.
one poll showed that of various social groups bankers ranked third from the bottom in public esteem just above prostitutes and convicted felons.
resentment was fueled by the fact that wall street had long since abandoned the idea that pay should be linked to results.
by the end of 2008 the worst year for the stock market since the depression wall street firms had fired 240 000 employees.
but they also paid out 20 billion in bonuses to top executives.
even the executives of lehman brothers a company that went bankrupt and it later turned out had shortchanged new york city by hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate and other taxes received 5 7 billion in bonuses in 2007 and 2008.
it was also revealed that bernard madoff a wall street investor who claimed to have made enormous profits for his clients had in fact run a ponzi scheme in which investors who wanted to retrieve their money were paid with funds from new participants.
madoff sent fictitious monthly financial statements to his clients but he never actually made stock purchases for them.
when the scheme collapsed madoffs investors suffered losses amounting to around 50 billion.

the collapse of market fundamentalism the crisis exposed the dark side of market fundamentalism the ethos of deregulation that had dominated world affairs for the preceding thirty years.
alan greenspan the head of the federal reserve bank from 1987 to 2006 had steered the american economy through crises ranging from the stock market collapse of 1987 to the terrorist attacks of 2001.
greenspan had presided over much of the era of deregulation artificially low interest rates and excessive borrowing and spending.
he and his successors had promoted the housing bubble and saw all sorts of speculative behavior flourish with no governmental intervention.
in effect they allowed securities firms to regulate themselves.
in 2008 greenspan admitted to congress that there had been a flaw in his long held conviction that free markets would automatically produce the best results for all and that regulation would damage banks wall street and the mortgage market.
he himself he said was in a state of shocked disbelief as the crisis turned out to be much broader than anything i could have imagined greenspans testimony seemed to mark the end of an era.
every president from ronald reagan onward had lectured the rest of the world on the need to adopt the american model of unregulated economic competition and berated countries like japan and germany for assisting failing businesses.
now the american model lay in ruins and a new role for government in regulating economic activity seemed inevitable.
bush and the crisis in the fall of 2008 with the presidential election campaign in full swing the bush administration seemed unable to come up with a response to the crisis.
in keeping with the free market ethos it allowed lehman brothers to fail.
but this immediately created a domino effect with the stock prices of other banks and investment houses collapsing and the administration quickly reversed course.
it persuaded a reluctant congress to appropriate 700 billion dollars to bail out other floundering firms.
insurance companies like aig banks like citigroup and bank of america and giant financial companies like the federal home loan mortgage corporation popularly known as freddie mac and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae which insured most mortgages in the country were deemed too big to fail that is they were so interconnected with other institutions that their collapse would drive the economy into a fullfledged depression.
through the federal bailout taxpayers in effect took temporary ownership of these companies absorbing the massive losses what events eroded support for president bushs policies during his second term.
created by their previous malfeasance.
most of this money was distributed with no requirements as to its use.
few of the rescued firms used the public funds to assist home owners threatened with foreclosure indeed since they pocketed lucrative fees from those who could not pay their mortgages they had no incentive to help them keep their homes or sell them.
giant banks and investment houses that received public money redirected some of it to enormous bonuses to top employees.
but despite the bailout the health of the banking system remained fragile.
firms still had balance sheets weighed down with toxic assets billions and billions of dollars in worthless loans.
the crisis also revealed the limits of the american safety net compared with other industrialized countries.
in western europe workers who lose their jobs typically receive many months of unemployment insurance amounting to a significant percentage of their lost wages.
in the united states only one third of out of work persons even qualify for unemployment insurance and it runs out after a few months.
the abolition of welfare the national obligation to assist the neediest americans during the clinton administration left the american safety net a patchwork of a few national programs like food stamps supplemented by locally administered aid.
the poor were dependent on aid from the states which found their budgets collapsing as revenues from property and sales taxes dried up.
california which in 2009 faced a budget gap of 26 billion was forced to slash spending for education health care and services for the poor.
in the united states as a whole only one fifth of poor children and their parents received any public relief at all.
the rise of obama with the economy in crisis and president bushs popularity at low ebb the time was ripe for a democratic victory in the election of 2008.
to the surprise of nearly all political pundits the long series of winter and spring caucuses and primary elections resulted in the nomination not of hilary rodham clinton the initial favorite but barack obama a relatively littleknown forty seven year old senator from illinois when the campaign began.
obama was the first black candidate to win the nomination of a major party.
his triumph was a tribute both to his own exceptional skills as a speaker and campaigner and to how american politics had changed.
obamas life story exemplified the enormous changes american society had undergone since 1960.
without the civil rights movement his election would have been inconceivable.
he was the product of an interracial marriage which ended in divorce when he was two years old between a kenyan immigrant and a white american woman.
when obama was born in 1961 their marriage was still illegal in many states.
he attended columbia college and harvard law school and worked in chicago as a community organizer before going into politics.
he also wrote two best selling books about his upbringing in indonesia where his a cartoon in the boston globe suggests the progress that has been made since rosa parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger.
28 september 11 and the next american century the rise of obama mother worked as an anthropologist and hawaii where his maternal grandparents helped to raise him and his search for a sense of identity given his complex background.
obama was elected to the u s senate in 2004 and first gained national attention with an eloquent speech at the democratic national convention that year.
clinton sought the democratic nomination by emphasizing her political experience both as first lady and as a senator from new york.
obama realized that in 2008 people were hungry for change not experience.
indeed while clintons nomination would also have been path breaking no woman has ever been the presidential candidate of a major party obama succeeded in making her seem a representative of the status quo.
his early opposition to the iraq war for which clinton had voted in the senate won the support of the partys large antiwar element his race galvanized the support of black voters and his youth and promise of change appealed to the young.
obama recognized how the internet had changed politics.
he established an e mail list containing the names of millions of voters with whom he could communicate instantaneously and used web based networks to raise enormous sums of money in small donations.
his campaign put out videos on popular internet sites.
with its widespread use of modern technology and massive mobilization of new voters obamas was the first political campaign of the twenty first century.
the c a m pa i g n having won the nomination obama faced senator john mccain the republican nominee in the general election.
at age sevety two mccain was the oldest man ever to run for president and he seemed even more a representative of the old politics than clinton.
citing his willingness to break with his party on issues like campaign finance reform mccain tried to portray himself not as part of the establishment but as a maverick or rebel.
he surprised virtually everyone by choosing as his running mate sarah palin the litthe presidential tle known governor of alaska in part as an attempt to election of 2008 woo democratic women disappointed at their partys rejection of hilary clinton.
palin quickly went on the attack accusing democrats of being unpatriotic lacking 3 4 4 traditional values and not representing the real america this proved extremely popular with the republican partys conservative base.
but her perform21 4 1 7 ances in speeches and interviews soon made it clear that 21 11 20 3 15 5 13 she lacked familiarity with many of the domestic and for8 eign issues a new administration would confront.
her selection raised questions among many americans about mccains judgment.
but the main obstacles for the mccain campaign were president bushs low popularity and the financial crisis that reached bottom in september and october.
obamas electoral vote popular vote promise of change seemed more appealing than ever.
on candidate share share party election day he swept to victory with 53 percent of the 365 67 8 66 882 230 53 obama democrat 173 32 2 58 343 671 46 mccain republican popular vote and a large majority in the electoral college.

carried not only democratic strongholds in new england the mid atlantic states the industrial midwest and the west coast but also states that had been reliably republican for years.
he cracked the solid south winning virginia north carolina and florida.
he did extremely well in suburbs throughout the country.
he even carried indiana where bush had garnered 60 percent of the vote in 2004 but which now was hard hit by unemployment.
obama put together a real rainbow coalition winning nearly the entire black vote and a large majority of hispanics who helped him to carry colorado nevada and florida.
he did exceptionally well among young voters.
obama carried every age group except persons over 65.
thus he was elected even though he received only 43 percent of the nations white vote.
the age of obama.
obamas victory seemed to mark the end of a political era that began with richard nixon and his southern strategy instead of using control of the south as the base to build a national majority republicans now ran the danger of becoming a regional and marginalized southern party.
in the wake of the iraq war the economic meltdown and the enthusiasm aroused by obamas candidacy republican appeals to patriotism low taxes and resentment against the social changes sparked by the 1960s seemed oddly out of date.
democrats not only regained the presidency but ended up with 60 of the 100 seats in the senate and a large majority in the house.
the groups carried by obama young voters hispanics suburbanites represented the growing parts of the population auguring well for future democratic success.
in an increasingly multi ethnic multiracial nation winning a majority of the white vote no longer translated into national victory.
republicans would have to find a way to appeal to the voters of the new america.
the election of the nations first african american president represented a historic watershed.
whether it constituted what political scientists call a critical election one that changes the basic assumptions governing national policy remained to be seen.
critical elections have been few and far between in american history.
the election of jefferson in 1800 dealt a death blow to the federalist party.
jacksons in 1828 ushered in the politics of popular democracy.
lincolns in 1860 ended southern control of the national government.
william mckinley in 1896 and franklin d roosevelt in 1932 created new political alignments and enduring national majorities for their parties.
ronald reagans election in 1980 established a new set of governing principles.
most presidential elections however have left the policies of the federal government largely unchanged even when a new party was victorious.
only time would tell whether obamas election announced the end of the age of reagan the era of economic deregulation the demonization of the federal government and an aggressive foreign policy abroad and the beginning of something fundamentally different.
o b a m a s inaguration few presidents have come into office facing as serious a set of problems as barack obama.

the rise of obama wars.
but americans including many who had not voted for him viewed obamas election as a cause for optimism.
two days after his victory a poll found two thirds of americans describing themselves as proud of the result and 60 percent excited at the prospect of an obama administration.
on january 20 2009 a day after the martin luther king jr holiday and more than forty five years after kings i have a dream speech obama was inaugurated as president.
more than 1 million people traveled to washington to view the historic event.
in his inaugural address see the full text in the appendix obama offered a stark rebuke to eight years of bush policies and more broadly to the premises that had shaped government policy since the election of reagan.
he promised a foreign policy based on diplomacy rather than unilateral force pledged to protect the environment spoke of the need to combat income inequality and lack of access to health care and blamed a culture of greed and irresponsibility for helping to bring on the economic crisis.
he promised to renew respect for the constitution.
unlike bush obama said little about freedom in his speech other than to note that the country could enjoy liberty and security at the same time rather than having to choose between them.
instead of freedom he spoke of community and responsibility.
his address harked back to the revolutionary era ideal of putting the common good before individual self interest.
o b a m a s first months in many ways obamas first policy initiatives lived up to the promise of change.
in his first three months he announced plans to close the prison at guantnamo bay in cuba barred the use of torture launched a diplomatic initiative to repair relations with the muslim world reversed the previous administrations executive orders limiting womens reproductive rights and abandoned bushs rhetoric about a god given american mission to spread freedom throughout the world.
when supreme court justice david souter announced his retirement obama named sonia sotomayor the first hispanic and third woman in the courts history to replace him.
the senate confirmed her in august 2009.
obamas first budget recalled the new deal and great society.
breaking with the reagan era motto government is the problem not the solution it anticipated active government support for health care reform clean energy and public education paid for in part by allowing bushs tax cuts for the wealthy to expire in 2010.
he pushed through congress a stimulus package amounting to nearly 800 billion in new government spending for construction projects the extension of unemployment benefits and aid to the states to enable them to balance their budgets.
what kinds of change did voters hope for when they elected barack obama.
the largest single spending appropriation in american history the bill was meant to pump money into the economy in order to save and create jobs and to ignite a resumption of economic activity.
for most of obamas first year in office congressional debate resolved around a plan to restructure the nations health care system so as to provide insurance coverage to the millions of americans who lacked it and to end abusive practices by insurance companies such as their refusal to cover patients with existing illnesses.
after months of increasingly bitter debate in march 2010 congress passed a sweeping health care bill that required all americans to purchase health insurance and most businesses to provide it to their employees.
it also offered subsidies to persons of modest incomes so they could afford insurance and required insurance companies to accept all applicants.
this was the most farreaching piece of domestic social legislation since the great society of the 1960s and it aroused strong partisan opposition.
claiming that it amounted to a government takeover of the health care industry even though plans for a government run insurance program had been dropped from the bill every republican in congress voted against the bill.
like many of his predecessors obama found that criticizing presidential power from outside is one thing dismantling it from inside another.
he reversed his previous promise to abolish the military tribunals bush had established.
he pledged to complete the planned withdrawal from iraq but dispatched 17 000 more american troops to afghanistan and in december 2009 announced plans to send another 30 000 creating the danger that his administration would become bogged down in another military quagmire.
his stimulus package marked a new departure but he chose his economic advisers from wall street and continued the bush administration policy of pouring taxpayer money into the banks and assuming responsibility for many of their debts.
in the meantime the economy continued to hemorrhage jobs the unemployment rate reached 10 2 percent in november.
as 2010 neared its midpoint it remained unclear how long it would take for the financial system to resume normal operations and for the country to emerge from the great recession.
learning from history the owl of minerva takes flight at dusk minerva was the roman goddess of wisdom and this saying suggests that the meaning of events only becomes clear once they are over.
it is still far too soon to assess the full impact of september 11 on american life and the long term consequences of the changes at home and abroad it inspired.

iran its power in the region enhanced by the american removal of its chief rival saddam husseins regime in iraq appeared to be bent on acquiring nuclear weapons which the united states vowed to prevent raising the prospect of future conflict.
other regions of the world also presented daunting problems for american policymakers.
north korea had acquired nuclear weapons and refused international pressure to give them up.
chinas rapidly growing economic power posed a challenge to american predominance.
a series of latin american countries elected presidents who rejected the doctrines of globalization and global free trade pressed so insistently by the united states.
no one could predict how any of these crises or others yet unimagined would be resolved.
and taking a longer view a study by american intelligence agencies predicted that by 2025 the united states would remain the worlds most powerful nation but that its economic and military predominance will have declined significantly.
a multipolar world with countries like china and india emerging as major powers would succeed the era of unquestioned american dominance.
how the continuing global financial crisis would affect these developments remained to be seen.
what is clear is that september 11 and its aftermath drew new attention to essential elements of the history of american freedom.
as in the past freedom is central to americans sense of themselves as individuals and as a nation.
americans continue to debate contemporary issues in a political landscape shaped by ideas of freedom.
indeed freedom remains as it has always been an evolving concept its definition open to disagreement its boundaries never fixed or final.
freedom is neither self enforcing nor selfcorrecting.
it cannot be taken for granted and its preservation requires eternal vigilance especially in times of crisis.

15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the meaning of freedom fa m i l i e s a post civil war photograph of an unidentified black family seated before their humble home possibly a former slave cabin.
freedom with slavery dead institutions that had existed before the war like the black family free blacks churches and schools and the secret slave church were strengthened expanded and freed from white supervision.
the family was central to the postemancipation black community.
former slaves made remarkable efforts to locate loved ones from whom they had been separated under slavery.
one northern reporter in 1865 encountered a freedman who had walked more than 600 miles from georgia to north carolina searching for the wife and children from whom he had been sold away before the war.
meanwhile widows of black soldiers successfully claimed survivors pensions forcing the federal government to acknowledge the validity of prewar relationships that slavery had attempted to deny.
but while reconstruction witnessed the stabilization of family life freedom subtly altered relationships within the family.
emancipation increased the power of black men and brought to many black families the nineteenth century notion that men and women should inhabit separate spheres immediately after the civil war planters complained that freedwomen had withdrawn from field labor and work as house servants.
many black women preferred to devote more time to their families than had been possible under slavery and men considered it a badge of honor to see their wives remain at home.
eventually the dire poverty of the black community would compel a far higher proportion of black women than white women to go to work for wages.

during reconstruction and for years thereafter former slaves exhibited a deep desire for education and learning took place outside of school as well as within.
in and school at the same time blacks abandoned white controlled religious institutions to create churches of their own.
on the eve of the civil war 42 000 black methodists worshiped in biracial south carolina churches by the end of reconstruction only 600 remained.
the rise of the independent black church with methodists and baptists commanding the largest followings redrew the religious map of the south.
as the major institution independent of white control the church played a central role in the black community.
a place of worship it also housed schools social events and political gatherings.
black ministers came to play a major role in politics.
some 250 held public office during reconstruction.
another striking example of the freedpeoples quest for individual and community improvement was their desire for education.
education declared a mississippi freedman was the next best thing to liberty the thirst for learning sprang from many sources a desire to read the bible the need to prepare for the economic marketplace and the opportunity which arose in 1867 to take part in politics.
blacks of all ages flocked to the schools established by northern missionary societies the freedmens what visions of freedom did the former slaves and slaveholders pursue in the postwar south.

northern journalist sidney andrews who toured the south in 1865 was impressed by how much education also took place outside of the classroom i had occasion very frequently to notice that porters in stores and laboring men in warehouses and cart drivers on the streets had spelling books with them and were studying them during the time they were not occupied with their work reconstruction also witnessed the creation of the nations first black colleges including fisk university in tennessee hampton institute in virginia and howard university in the nations capital.
political freedom in a society that had made political participation a core element of freedom the right to vote inevitably became central to the former slaves desire for empowerment and equality.
as frederick douglass put it soon after the souths surrender in 1865 slavery is not abolished until the black man has two maps of the barrow plantation illustrate the effects of emancipation on rural life in the south.

what visions of freedom did the former slaves and slaveholders pursue in the postwar south.
tennessee plantation former slaves claimed to be joint heirs to the estate and the owner complained took up residence in the rooms of my house in its individual elements and much of its language former slaves definition of freedom resembled that of white americans self ownership family stability religious liberty political participation and economic autonomy.
but these elements combined to form a vision very much their own.
for whites freedom no matter how defined was a given a birthright to be defended.
for african americans it was an open ended process a transformation of every aspect of their lives and of the society and culture that had sustained slavery in the first place.
although the freedpeople failed to achieve full freedom as they understood it their definition did much to shape national debate during the turbulent era of reconstruction.
masters without slaves most white southerners reacted to military defeat and emancipation with dismay not only because of the widespread devastation but also because they must now submit to northern demands.

nearly 260 000 men died for the confederacy more than one fifth of the souths adult male white population.
the widespread destruction of work animals farm buildings and machinery ensured that economic revival would be slow and painful.
in 1870 the value of property in the south not counting that represented by slaves was 30 percent lower than before the war.
planter families faced profound changes in the wars aftermath.
many lost not only their slaves but their life savings which they had patriotically invested in now worthless confederate bonds.
some whose slaves departed the plantation for the first time found themselves compelled to do physical labor.
general braxton bragg returned to his once prosperous alabama home to find all all was lost except my debts bragg and his wife a woman raised in affluence lived for a time in a slave cabin.
southern planters sought to implement an understanding of freedom quite different from that of the former slaves.
as they struggled to accept the reality of emancipation most planters defined black freedom in the narrowest manner.
as journalist sidney andrews discovered late in 1865 the whites seem wholly unable to comprehend that freedom for the negro means the same thing as freedom for them.

15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the meaning of freedom the antebellum definition of freedom as if nothing had changed.
freedom still meant hierarchy and mastery it was a privilege not a right a carefully defined legal status rather than an open ended entitlement.

a man may be free and yet not independent mississippi planter samuel agnew observed in his diary in 1865.
a kentucky newspaper summed up the stance of much of the white south the former slave was free but free only to labor the free labor vision along with former slaves and former masters the victorious republican north tried to implement its own vision of freedom.
central to its definition was the antebellum principle of free labor now further strengthened as a definition of the good society by the unions triumph.
in the free labor vision of a reconstructed south emancipated blacks enjoying the same opportunities for advancement as northern workers would labor more productively than they had as slaves.
at the same time northern capital and migrants would energize the economy.
the south would eventually come to resemble the free society of the north complete with public schools small towns and independent farmers.

it fell to the freedmens bureau an agency established by congress in march 1865 to attempt to establish a working free labor system.
the freedmens bureau under the direction of o o howard a graduate of bowdoin college in maine and a veteran of the civil war the bureau took on responsibilities that can only be described as daunting.
the bureau was an experiment in government social policy that seems to belong more comfortably to the new deal of the 1930s or the great society of the 1960s see chapters 21 and 25 respectively than to nineteenth century america.
bureau agents were supposed to establish schools provide aid to the poor and aged settle disputes between whites and blacks and among the freedpeople and secure for former slaves and white unionists equal treatment before the courts.
in your power to fulfill one tenth of the expectations of those who framed the bureau general william t sherman wrote to howard.
i fear you have hercules task the bureau lasted from 1865 to 1870.
even at its peak there were fewer than 1 000 agents in the entire south.
nonetheless the bureaus achievements in some areas notably education and health care were striking.
while the bureau did not establish schools itself it coordinated and helped to finance the activities of northern societies committed to black education.
what visions of freedom did the former slaves and slaveholders pursue in the postwar south.
by 1869 nearly 3 000 schools serving more than 150 000 pupils in the south reported to the bureau.
bureau agents also assumed control of hospitals established by the army during the war and expanded the system into new communities.
they provided medical care and drugs to both black and white southerners.
in economic relations however the bureaus activities proved far more problematic.
the fa i lu r e of land the freedmens bureau an engraving from harpers weekly july 25 1868 depicts the bureau agent as a promoter of racial peace in the violent postwar south.
reform the idea of free labor wrote one bureau agent was the noblest principle on earth all that was required to harmonize race relations in the south was fair wages good working conditions and the opportunity to improve the laborers situation in life.
but blacks wanted land of their own not jobs on plantations.
one provision of the law establishing the bureau gave it the authority to divide abandoned and confiscated land into forty acre plots for rental and eventual sale to the former slaves.
in the summer of 1865 however president andrew johnson who had succeeded lincoln ordered nearly all land in federal hands returned to its former owners.
a series of confrontations followed notably in south carolina and georgia where the army forcibly evicted blacks who had settled on sherman land when o o howard head of the freedmens bureau traveled to the sea islands to inform blacks of the new policy he was greeted with disbelief and protest.
a committee of former slaves drew up petitions to howard and president johnson.

the system involved both white and black farmers.
had no alternative but to work on white owned plantations often for their former owners.
far from being able to rise in the social scale through hard work black men were largely confined to farm work unskilled labor and service jobs and black women to positions in private homes as cooks and maids.
their wages remained too low to allow for any accumulation.
by the turn of the century a significant number of southern african americans had managed to acquire small parcels of land.
but the failure of land reform produced a deep sense of betrayal that survived among the former slaves and their descendants long after the end of reconstruction.
no sir mary gaffney an elderly ex slave recalled in the 1930s we were not given a thing but freedom toward a new south out of the conflict on the plantations new systems of labor emerged in the different regions of the south.
the task system under which workers were assigned daily tasks completion of which ended their responsibilities for that day survived in the rice kingdom of south carolina and georgia.
closely supervised wage labor predominated on the sugar plantations of southern louisiana.
sharecropping came to dominate the cotton belt and much of the tobacco belt of virginia and north carolina.
what visions of freedom did the former slaves and slaveholders pursue in the postwar south.
sharecropping initially arose as a compromise between blacks desire for land and planters demand for labor discipline.
the system allowed each black family to rent a part of a plantation with the crop divided between worker and owner at the end of the year.
sharecropping guaranteed the planters a stable resident labor force.
former slaves preferred it to gang labor because it offered them the prospect of working without day to day white supervision.
but as the years went on sharecropping became more and more oppressive.
sharecroppers economic opportunities were severely limited by a world market in which the price of farm products suffered a prolonged decline.
the white fa r m e r the plight of the small farmer was not confined to blacks in the postwar south.
wartime devastation set in motion a train of events that permanently altered the independent way of life of white yeomen leading to what they considered a loss of freedom.
before the war most small farmers had concentrated on raising food for their families and grew little cotton.
with much of their property destroyed many yeomen saw their economic condition worsened by successive crop failures after the war.
to obtain supplies from merchants farmers were forced to take up the growing of cotton and pledge a part of the crop as collateral property the creditor can seize if a debt is not paid.
this system became known as the crop lien since interest rates were extremely high and the price of cotton fell steadily many farmers found themselves still in debt after marketing their portion of the crop at years end.
they had no choice but to farmers with cotton in the courthouse square an 1880 photograph of marietta georgia.
after the civil war more and more white farmers began growing cotton to support their families permanently altering their formerly selfsufficient way of life.

from a sharecropping contract 1866 few former slaves were able to acquire land in the post civil war south.
most ended up as sharecroppers working on white owned land for a share of the crop at the end of the growing season.

the said ross agrees to furnish the land to cultivate and a sufficient number of mules horses and feed them to make and house said crop and all necessary farming utensils to carry on the same and to give unto said freedmen whose names appear below one half of all the cotton corn and wheat that is raised on said place for the year 1866 after all the necessary expenses are deducted out that accrues on said crop.

in what ways does the contract limit the freedom of the laborers.
what do these documents suggest about competing definitions of black freedom in the aftermath of slavery.
15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the meaning of freedom continue to plant cotton to obtain new loans.
by the mid 1870s white farmers who cultivated only 10 percent of the souths cotton crop in 1860 were growing 40 percent and many who had owned their land had fallen into dependency as sharecroppers who now rented land owned by others.
both black and white farmers found themselves caught in the sharecropping and crop lien systems.
a far higher percentage of black than white farmers in the south rented land rather than owned it.
but every census from 1880 to 1940 counted more white than black sharecroppers.
the workings of sharecropping and the crop lien system are illustrated by the case of matt brown a mississippi farmer who borrowed money each year from a local merchant.
he began 1892 with a debt of 226 held over from the previous year.
by 1893 although he produced cotton worth 171 browns debt had increased to 402 because he had borrowed 33 for food 29 for clothing 173 for supplies and 112 for other items.
brown never succeeded in getting out of debt.
he died in 1905 the last entry under his name in the merchants account book is a coffin.
the urban south even as the rural south stagnated economically southern cities experienced remarkable growth after the civil war.
as railroads penetrated the interior they enabled merchants in market centers like atlanta to trade directly with the north bypassing coastal cities that had traditionally monopolized southern commerce.
a new urban middle class of merchants railroad promoters and bankers reaped the benefits of the spread of cotton production in the postwar south.
thus reconstruction brought about profound changes in the lives of southerners black and white rich and poor.
in place of the prewar world of master slave and self sufficient yeoman the postwar south was peopled by new social classes landowning employers black and white sharecroppers cotton producing white farmers wage earning black laborers and urban entrepreneurs.
each of these groups turned to reconstruction politics in an attempt to shape to its own advantage the aftermath of emancipation.
aftermaths of slavery the united states of course was not the only society to confront the problem of the transition from slavery to freedom.
indeed many parallels exist between the debates during reconstruction and struggles that followed slavery in other parts of the western hemisphere over the same issues of land control of labor and political power.
in every case former planters or in haiti where the planter class had been destroyed the government itself tried to encourage or require former slaves to go back to work on plantations to grow the same crops as under slavery.
planters elsewhere held the same stereotypical views of black laborers as were voiced by their counterparts in the united states former slaves were supposedly lazy lacking in ambition and thought that freedom meant an absence of labor.
what visions of freedom did the former slaves and slaveholders pursue in the postwar south.
for their part former slaves throughout the hemisphere tried to carve out as much independence as possible both in their daily lives and in their labor.
they attempted to reconstruct family life by withdrawing women and children from field labor in the west indies women turned to marketing their families crops to earn income.
wherever possible former slaves acquired land of their own and devoted more time to growing food for their families than crops for the international market.
on small caribbean islands like barbados where no unoccupied land existed former slaves had no alternative but to return to plantation labor.
elsewhere the plantations either fell to pieces as in haiti or continued operating with a new labor force composed of indentured servants from india and china as in jamaica trinidad and british guiana.
as slavery ended between the years 1838 and 1865 more than 100 000 indian laborers were introduced into the british caribbean a process that could not have taken place without the consolidation of british control over india as part of its nineteenth century empire.
southern planters in the united states brought in a few chinese laborers in an attempt to replace freedmen but since the federal government opposed such efforts the chinese remained only a tiny proportion of the southern workforce.
but if struggles over land and labor united its postemancipation experience with that of other societies in one respect the united states was unique.
only in the united states were former slaves within two years of the end of slavery granted the right to vote and thus given a major share of political power.
few anticipated this development when the civil war ended.
it came about as the result of one of the greatest political crises of american history the battle between president andrew johnson and congress over reconstruction.
the struggle resulted in profound changes in the nature of citizenship the structure of constitutional authority and the meaning of american freedom.

15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the making of radical reconstruction the making of radical reconstruction andrew johnson to lincolns successor andrew johnson fell the task of overseeing the restoration of the union.
born in poverty in north carolina as a youth johnson worked as a tailors apprentice.
after moving to tennessee he achieved success through politics.
beginning as an alderman a town official he rose to serve in the state legislature the u s congress and for two terms as governor of tennessee.
johnson identified himself as the champion of his states honest yeomen and a foe of large planters whom he described as a bloated corrupted aristocracy a strong defender of the union he became the only senator from a seceding state to remain at his post in washington d c when the civil war began in 1861.
when northern forces occupied tennessee abraham lincoln named him military governor.
in 1864 republicans nominated him to run for vice president as a symbol of the partys hope of extending its organization into the south.
in personality and outlook johnson proved unsuited for the responsibilities he shouldered after lincolns death.
a lonely stubborn man he was intolerant of criticism and unable to compromise.
he lacked lincolns political skills and keen sense of public opinion.
a fervent believer in states rights johnson insisted that since secession was illegal the southern states had never actually left the union or surrendered the right to govern their own affairs.
moreover while johnson had supported emancipation once lincoln made it a goal of the war effort he held deeply racist views.
africanamericans johnson believed had no role to play in reconstruction.
the fa i lu r e of presidential reconstruction a little over a month after lees surrender at appomattox and with congress out of session until december johnson in may 1865 outlined his plan for reuniting the nation.
he issued a series of proclamations that began the period of presidential reconstruction 1865 1867.
johnson offered a pardon which restored political and property rights except for slaves to nearly all white southerners who took an oath of allegiance.
he excluded confederate leaders and wealthy planters whose prewar property had been valued at more than 20 000.
this exemption suggested at first that johnson planned a more punitive reconstruction than lincoln had intended.
most of those exempted however soon received individual pardons from the president.
johnson also appointed provisional governors and ordered them to call state conventions elected by whites alone that would establish loyal governments in the south.
apart from the requirement that they abolish slavery repudiate secession and refuse to pay the confederate debt all unavoidable consequences of southern defeat he granted the new governments a free hand in managing local affairs.
at first most northerners believed johnsons policy deserved a chance to succeed.
the conduct of the southern governments elected under his program however turned most of the republican north against the president.
by and large white voters returned prominent confederates and members of the old elite to power.
reports of violence directed against former slaves and northern visitors in the south further alarmed republicans.
what were the sources goals and competing visions for reconstruction.
the black codes but what aroused the most opposition to johnsons reconstruction policy were the black codes laws passed by the new southern governments that attempted to regulate the lives of the former slaves.
these laws granted blacks certain rights such as legalized marriage ownership of property and limited access to the courts.
but they denied them the rights to testify against whites to serve on juries or in state militias or to vote.
and in response to planters demands that the freedpeople be required to work on the plantations the black codes declared that those who failed to sign yearly labor contracts could be arrested and hired out to white landowners.
some states limited the occupations open to blacks and barred them from acquiring land and others provided that judges could assign black children to work for their former owners without the consent of the parents.
we are not permitted to own the land whereon to build a schoolhouse or a church complained a black convention in mississippi.
where is justice.
where is freedom clearly the death of slavery did not automatically mean the birth of freedom.
but the black codes so completely violated free labor principles that they called forth a vigorous response from the republican north.
wars especially civil wars often generate hostility and bitterness.
but few groups of rebels in history have been treated more leniently than the defeated confederates.
a handful of southern leaders were arrested but most were quickly released.
only one was executed henry wirz the commander of andersonville prison where thousands of union prisoners of war had died.
most of the union army was swiftly demobilized.
what motivated the norths turn against johnsons policies was not a desire to punish the white south but the inability of the souths political leaders to accept the reality of emancipation.
we must see to it announced selling a freeman to pay his fine at monticello florida an engraving from frank leslies illustrated newspaper january 19 1867.
under the black codes enacted by southern legislatures immediately after the civil war blacks convicted of vagrancy often because they refused to sign contracts to work on plantations were fined and if unable to pay auctioned off to work for the person who paid the fine.
15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the making of radical reconstruction republican senator william stewart of nevada that the man made free by the constitution of the united states is a freeman indeed the thaddeus stevens leader of the radical republicans in the house of representatives during reconstruction.
radical republicans when congress assembled in december 1865 johnson announced that with loyal governments functioning in all the southern states the nation had been reunited.
in response radical republicans who had grown increasingly disenchanted with johnson during the summer and fall called for the dissolution of these governments and the establishment of new ones with rebels excluded from power and black men guaranteed the right to vote.
radicals tended to represent constituencies in new england and the burned over districts of the rural north that had been home to religious revivalism abolitionism and other reform movements.
although they differed on many issues radicals shared the conviction that union victory created a golden opportunity to institutionalize the principle of equal rights for all regardless of race.
the radicals fully embraced the expanded powers of the federal government born during the civil war.
traditions of federalism and states rights they insisted must not obstruct a sweeping national effort to protect the rights of all americans.
the most prominent radicals in congress were charles sumner a senator from massachusetts and thaddeus stevens a lawyer and iron manufacturer who represented pennsylvania in the house of representatives.
before the civil war both had been outspoken foes of slavery and defenders of black rights.
early in the civil war both had urged lincoln to free and arm the slaves and both in 1865 favored black suffrage in the south.
the same national authority declared sumner that destroyed slavery must see that this other pretension racial inequality is not permitted to survive thaddeus stevenss most cherished aim was to confiscate the land of disloyal planters and divide it among former slaves and northern migrants to the south.
the whole fabric of southern society he declared must be changed.
without this this government can never be as it has never been a true republic but his plan to make small independent landholders of the former slaves proved too radical even for many of his radical colleagues.
congress to be sure had already offered free land to settlers in the west in the homestead act of 1862.
but this land had been in the possession of the federal government not private individuals although originally of course it had been occupied by indians.
most congressmen believed too deeply in the sanctity of property rights to be willing to take land from one group of owners and distribute it to others.
stevenss proposal failed to pass.
the origins of civil rights with the south unrepresented republicans enjoyed an overwhelming majority in congress.
but the party was internally divided.
most republicans were moderates not radicals.
moderates believed that johnsons plan was flawed but they desired to work with the president to modify it.
they feared that neither northern nor southern whites would accept black suffrage.
moderates and radicals joined in refusing to seat the southerners recently what were the sources goals and competing visions for reconstruction.
elected to congress but moderates broke with the radicals by leaving the johnson governments in place.
early in 1866 senator lyman trumbull of illinois proposed two bills reflecting the moderates belief that johnsons policy required modification.
the first extended the life of the freedmens bureau which had originally been established for only one year.
the second the civil rights bill was described by one congressman as one of the most important bills ever presented to the house for its action it defined all persons born in the united states as citizens and spelled out rights they were to enjoy without regard to race.
equality before the law was central to the measure no longer could states enact laws like the black codes discriminating between white and black citizens.
so were free labor values.
according to the law no state could deprive any citizen of the right to make contracts bring lawsuits or enjoy equal protection of ones person and property.
these said trumbull were the fundamental rights belonging to every man as a free man the bill made no mention of the right to vote for blacks.
in constitutional terms the civil rights bill represented the first attempt to give concrete meaning to the thirteenth amendment which had abolished slavery to define in law the essence of freedom.
to the surprise of congress johnson vetoed both bills.
both he said would centralize power in the national government and deprive the states of the authority to regulate their own affairs.
moreover he argued blacks did not deserve the rights of citizenship.
by acting to secure their rights congress was discriminating against the white race the vetoes made a breach between the president and nearly the entire republican party inevitable.
congress failed by a single vote to muster the two thirds majority necessary to override the veto of the freedmens bureau bill although later in 1866 it did extend the bureaus life to 1870.
but in april 1866 the civil rights bill became the first major law in american history to be passed over a presidential veto.
the fourteenth amendment congress now proceeded to adopt its own plan of reconstruction.
in june it approved and sent to the states for ratification the fourteenth amendment which placed in the constitution the principle of citizenship for all persons born in the united states and which empowered the federal government to protect the rights of all americans.
the amendment prohibited the states from abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens or denying them the equal protection of the law this broad language opened the door for future congresses and the federal courts to breathe meaning into the guarantee of legal equality.
in a compromise between the radical and moderate positions on black suffrage the amendment did not grant blacks the right to vote.
but it did provide that if a state denied the vote to any group of men that states representation in congress would be reduced.
this provision did not apply when states barred women from voting.
the abolition of slavery threatened to increase southern political power since now all blacks not merely three fifths as in the case of slaves would be counted in determining a states representation in congress.
the fourteenth amendment offered the leaders of the white south a choice allow black men to vote and keep their president andrew johnson in an 1868 lithograph by currier and ives.

states full representation in the house of representatives or limit the vote to whites and sacrifice part of their political power.
the fourteenth amendment produced an intense division between the parties.
not a single democrat in congress voted in its favor and only 4 of 175 republicans were opposed.
radicals to be sure expressed their disappointment that the amendment did not guarantee black suffrage.
it was far from perfect stevens told the house but he intended to vote for it because i live among men and not among angels nonetheless by writing into the constitution the principle that equality before the law regardless of race is a fundamental right of all american citizens the amendment made the most important change in that document since the adoption of the bill of rights.
the reconstruction act the fourteenth amendment became the central issue of the political campaign of 1866.
johnson embarked on a speaking tour of the north called by journalists the swing around the circle to urge voters to elect members of congress committed to his own reconstruction program.
denouncing his critics the president made wild accusations that the radicals were plotting to assassinate him.
his behavior further undermined public support for his policies as did riots that broke out in memphis and new orleans in which white policemen and citizens killed dozens of blacks.
in the northern congressional elections that fall republicans opposed to johnsons policies won a sweeping victory.

in march 1867 over johnsons veto congress adopted the reconstruction act which temporar what were the sources goals and competing visions for reconstruction.
ily divided the south into five military districts and called for the creation of new state governments with black men given the right to vote.
thus began the period of radical reconstruction which lasted until 1877.
a variety of motives combined to produce radical reconstruction demands by former slaves for the right to vote the radicals commitment to the idea of equality widespread disgust with johnsons policies the desire to fortify the republican party in the south and the determination to keep ex confederates from office.
but the conflict between president johnson and congress did not end with the passage of the reconstruction act.
impeachment and the election of grant in march 1867 congress adopted the tenure of office act barring the president from removing certain officeholders including cabinet members without the consent of the senate.
johnson considered this an unconstitutional restriction on his authority.

the making of radical reconstruction found uncomfortably slim.
the result led congress to adopt the eras third and final amendment to the constitution.
in february 1869 it approved the fifteenth amendment which prohibited the federal and state governments from denying any citizen the right to vote because of race.
bitterly opposed by the democratic party it was ratified in 1870.
although the fifteenth amendment opened the door to suffrage restrictions not explicitly based on race literacy tests property qualifications and poll taxes and did not extend the right to vote to women it marked the culmination of four decades of abolitionist agitation.
as late as 1868 even after congress had enfranchised black men in the south only eight northern states allowed african american men to vote.
with the fifteenth amendment the american anti slavery society disbanded its work its members believed now complete.
nothing in all history exclaimed veteran abolitionist william lloyd garrison equaled this wonderful quiet sudden transformation of four millions of human beings from.
the auction block to the ballot box the great constitutional revolution the laws and amendments of reconstruction reflected the intersection of two products of the civil war era a newly empowered national state and the idea of a national citizenry enjoying equality before the law.
what republican leader carl schurz called the great constitutional revolution of reconstruction transformed the federal system and with it the language of freedom so central to american political culture.
before the civil war american citizenship had been closely linked to race.
the first congress in 1790 had limited to whites the right to become a naturalized citizen when immigrating from abroad.
no black person free or slave the supreme court had declared in the dred scott decision of 1857 could be a what were the sources goals and competing visions for reconstruction.
citizen of the united states.
the laws and amendments of reconstruction repudiated the idea that citizenship was an entitlement of whites alone.
the principle of equality before the law moreover did not apply only to the south.
the reconstruction amendments voided many northern laws discriminating on the basis of race.
and as one congressman noted the amendments expanded the liberty of whites as well as blacks including the millions of people of foreign birth who will flock to our shores the new amendments also transformed the relationship between the federal government and the states.
the bill of rights had linked civil liberties to the autonomy of the states.
its language congress shall make no law reflected the belief that concentrated national power posed the greatest threat to freedom.
the authors of the reconstruction amendments assumed that rights required national power to enforce them.
rather than a threat to liberty the federal government in charles sumners words had become the custodian of freedom the reconstruction amendments transformed the constitution from a document primarily concerned with federal state relations and the rights of property into a vehicle through which members of vulnerable minorities could stake a claim to freedom and seek protection against misconduct by all levels of government.
in the twentieth century many of the supreme courts most important decisions expanding the rights of american citizens were based on the fourteenth amendment perhaps most notably the 1954 brown ruling that outlawed school segregation see chapter 24.
boundaries of freedom reconstruction redrew the boundaries of american freedom.
lines of exclusion that limited the privileges of citizenship to white men had long been central to the practice of american democracy.
only in an unparalleled crisis could they have been replaced even temporarily by the vision uncle sams thanksgiving dinner an engraving by thomas nast from harpers weekly november 20 1868 shortly after the election of ulysses s grant graphically illustrates how the boundaries of freedom had expanded during reconstruction.

15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the making of radical reconstruction of a republic of equals embracing black americans as well as white.
that the united states was a white mans government had been a widespread belief before the civil war.
it is not difficult to understand why andrew johnson in one of his veto messages claimed that federal protection of blacks civil rights violated all our experience as a people reconstruction republicans belief in universal rights also had its limits.
in his remarkable composite nation speech of 1869 frederick douglass condemned prejudice against immigrants from china.
americas destiny he declared was to transcend race by serving as an asylum for people gathered here from all corners of the globe by a common aspiration for national liberty a year later charles sumner moved to strike the word white from naturalization requirements.
senators from the western states objected.
at their insistence the naturalization law was amended to make africans eligible to obtain citizenship when migrating from abroad.
but asians remained ineligible.
the racial boundaries of nationality had been redrawn but not eliminated.
the juxtaposition of the amended naturalization law and the fourteenth amendment created a significant division in the asian american community.
well into the twentieth century asian immigrants could not become citizens but their native born children automatically did so.

women activists saw reconstruction as the moment to claim their own emancipation.
no less than blacks proclaimed elizabeth cady stanton women had arrived at a transition period from slavery to freedom the rewriting of the constitution declared suffrage leader olympia brown offered the opportunity to sever the blessings of freedom from sex as well as race and to bury the black man and the woman in the citizen the destruction of slavery led feminists to search for ways to make the promise of free labor real for women.
every issue of the new womens rights journal the agitator edited by mary livermore who had led fund raising efforts for aid to union soldiers during the war carried stories complaining of the limited job opportunities and unequal pay for females who entered the labor market.
other feminists debated how to achieve liberty for married women demands for liberalizing divorce laws which generally required evidence of adultery desertion or extreme abuse to termi what were the sources goals and competing visions for reconstruction.
nate a marriage and for recognizing womans control over her own body including protection against domestic violence and access to what later generations would call birth control moved to the center of many feminists concerns.
our rotten marriage institution one ohio woman wrote is the main obstacle in the way of womans freedom feminists and radicals talk of woman suffrage and redesigning marriage found few sympathetic male listeners.
even radical republicans insisted that reconstruction was the negros hour the hour that is of the black male.
the fourteenth amendment for the first time introduced the word male into the constitution in its clause penalizing a state for denying any group of men the right to vote.
the fifteenth amendment outlawed discrimination in voting based on race but not gender.
these measures produced a bitter split both between feminists and radical republicans and within feminist circles.
some leaders like stanton and susan b anthony opposed the fifteenth amendment because it did nothing to enfranchise women.
they denounced their former abolitionist allies and moved to sever the womens rights movement from its earlier moorings in the antislavery tradition.
on occasion they appealed to racial and ethnic prejudices arguing that nativeborn white women deserved the vote more than non whites and immigrants.
patrick and sambo and hans and yung tung who do not know the difference between a monarchy and a republic declared stanton had no right to be making laws for feminist leader lucretia mott but other abolitionist feminists like abby kelley and lucy stone insisted that despite their limitations the reconstruction amendments represented steps in the direction of truly universal suffrage and should be supported.
the result was a split in the movement and the creation in 1869 of two hostile womens rights organizations the national woman suffrage association led by stanton and the american woman suffrage association with lucy stone as president.
they would not reunite until the 1890s.
thus even as it rejected the racial definition of freedom that had emerged in the first half of the nineteenth century reconstruction left the gender boundary largely intact.
when women tried to use the rewritten legal code and constitution to claim equal rights they found the courts unreceptive.
myra bradwell invoked the idea of free labor in challenging an illinois statute limiting the practice of law to men but the supreme court in 1873 rebuffed her claim.
free labor principles the justices declared did not apply to women since the law of the creator had assigned them to the domestic sphere despite their limitations the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and the reconstruction act of 1867 marked a radical departure in american and world history.
alone among the nations that abolished slavery in the nineteenth century the united states within a few years of emancipation clothed its former slaves with citizenship rights equal to those of whites.

but the tocsin warning bell of freedom sounded and knocked at the door and we walked out like free men and shouldered the responsibilities what were the social and political effects of radical reconstruction in the south.
by 1870 all the former confederate states had been readmitted to the union and in a region where the republican party had not existed before the war nearly all were under republican control.
their new state constitutions drafted in 1868 and 1869 by the first public bodies in american history with substantial black representation marked a considerable improvement over those they replaced.
the constitutions greatly expanded public responsibilities.
they established the regions first statefunded systems of free public education and they created new penitentiaries orphan asylums and homes for the insane.
the constitutions guaranteed equality of civil and political rights and abolished practices of the antebellum era such as whipping as a punishment for crime property qualifications for officeholding and imprisonment for debt.
a few states initially barred former confederates from voting but this policy was quickly abandoned by the new state governments.
the black officeholder throughout reconstruction black voters provided the bulk of the republican partys support.
but african americans did not control reconstruction politics as their opponents frequently charged.
the highest offices remained almost entirely in white hands and only in south carolina where blacks made up 60 percent of the population did they form a majority of the legislature.
nonetheless the fact that some 2 000 african americans occupied public offices during reconstruction represented a fundamental shift of power in the south and a radical departure in american government.
african americans were represented at every level of government.
fourteen were elected to the national house of representatives.

in addition a number of black reconstruction officials like pennsylvania born jonathan j wright who served on the south carolina supreme court had come from the north after the civil war.
the majority however were former slaves who had established their leadership in the black community by serving in the union army working as ministers teachers or skilled craftsmen or engaging in union league organizing.
among the most celebrated black officeholders was robert smalls who had worked as a slave on the charleston docks before the civil war and who won national fame in 1862 by secretly guiding the planter a confederate vessel out of the harbor and delivering it to union forces.
smalls became a powerful political leader on the south carolina sea islands and was elected to five terms in congress.

and radical reconstruction in the south scalawags the new southern governments also brought to power new groups of whites.
many reconstruction officials were northerners who for one reason or another had made their homes in the south after the war.
their opponents dubbed them carpetbaggers implying that they had packed all their belongings in a suitcase and left their homes in order to reap the spoils of office in the south.
some carpetbaggers were undoubtedly corrupt adventurers.
the large majority however were former union soldiers who decided to remain in the south when the war ended before there was any prospect of going into politics.
others were investors in land and railroads who saw in the postwar south an opportunity to combine personal economic advancement with a role in helping to substitute as one wrote the civilization of freedom for that of slavery teachers freedmens bureau officers and others who came to the region genuinely hoping to assist the former slaves represented another large group of carpetbaggers most white republicans however had been born in the south.
former confederates reserved their greatest scorn for these scalawags whom they considered traitors to their race and region.
some southern born republicans were men of stature and wealth like james l alcorn the owner of one of mississippis largest plantations and the states first republican governor.
most scalawags however were non slaveholding white farmers from the southern upcountry.
many had been wartime unionists and they now cooperated with the republicans in order to prevent rebels from returning to power.
others hoped reconstruction governments would help them recover from wartime economic losses by suspending the collection of debts and enacting laws protecting small property holders from losing their homes to creditors.
in states like north carolina tennessee and arkansas republicans initially commanded a significant minority of the white vote.
even in the deep south the small white republican vote was important because the population remained almost evenly divided between blacks almost all of whom voted for the party of lincoln and whites overwhelmingly democratic.
southern republicans in power in view of the daunting challenges they faced the remarkable thing is not that reconstruction governments in many respects failed but how much they did accomplish.
perhaps their greatest achievement lay in establishing the souths first state supported public schools.
the new educational systems served both black and white children although generally in schools segregated by race.
only in new orleans were the public schools integrated during reconstruction and only in south carolina did the state university admit black students elsewhere separate colleges were established.
by the 1870s in a region whose prewar leaders had made it illegal for slaves to learn and had done little to provide education for poorer whites more than half the children black and white were attending public schools.
the new governments also pioneered civil rights legislation.
their laws made it illegal for railroads hotels and other institutions to discriminate on the basis of race.
enforcement varied considerably from locality to locality but reconstruction established for the first time at the state what were the social and political effects of radical reconstruction in the south.

level a standard of equal citizenship and a recognition of blacks right to a share of public services.
republican governments also took steps to strengthen the position of rural laborers and promote the souths economic recovery.
they passed laws to ensure that agricultural laborers and sharecroppers had the first claim on harvested crops rather than merchants to whom the landowner owed money.
south carolina created a state land commission which by 1876 had settled 14 000 black families and a few poor whites on their own farms.
the quest for prosperity rather than land distribution however the reconstruction governments pinned their hopes for southern economic growth and opportunity for african americans and poor whites alike on regional economic development.
railroad construction they believed was the key to transforming the south into a society of booming factories bustling towns and diversified agriculture.
a free and living republic declared a tennessee republican would spring up in the track of the railroad every state during reconstruction helped to finance railroad construction and through tax reductions and other incentives tried to attract northern manufacturers to invest in the region.
the program had mixed results.
economic development in general remained weak.
with abundant opportunities existing in the west few northern investors ventured to the reconstruction south.
to their supporters the governments of radical reconstruction presented a complex pattern of disappointment and accomplishment.
a revitalized southern economy failed to materialize and most african americans remained locked in poverty.
on the other hand biracial democratic government a thing unknown in american history for the first time functioned effectively in many parts of the south.

they denounced them as corrupt inefficient and examples of black supremacy intelligence virtue and patriotism in public life declared a protest by prominent southern democrats had given way to ignorance stupidity and vice corruption did exist during reconstruction but it was confined to no race region or party.
the rapid growth of state budgets and the benefits to be gained from public aid led in some states to a scramble for influence that produced bribery insider dealing and a get rich quick atmosphere.
southern frauds however were dwarfed by those practiced in these years by the whiskey ring which involved high officials of the grant administration and by new yorks tweed ring controlled by the democrats whose thefts ran into the tens of millions of dollars.
these are discussed in the next chapter.
the rising taxes needed to pay for schools and other new public facilities and to assist railroad development were another cause of opposition to reconstruction.
many poor whites who had initially supported the republican party turned against it when it became clear that their economic situation was not improving.
what were the main factors in b oth the north and south for the abandonment of reconstruction.
the most basic reason for opposition to reconstruction however was that most white southerners could not accept the idea of former slaves voting holding office and enjoying equality before the law.
in order to restore white supremacy in southern public life and to ensure planters a disciplined reliable labor force they believed reconstruction must be overthrown.
opponents launched a campaign of violence in an effort to end republican rule.
their actions posed a fundamental challenge both for reconstruction governments in the south and for policymakers in washington d c a reign of terror the civil war ended in 1865 but violence remained widespread in large parts of the postwar south.
in the early years of reconstruction violence was mostly local and unorganized.
blacks were assaulted and murdered for refusing to give way to whites on city sidewalks using insolent language challenging end of year contract settlements and attempting to buy land.
the violence that greeted the advent of republican governments after 1867 however was far more pervasive and more directly motivated by politics.
in wide areas of the south secret societies sprang up with the aim of preventing blacks from voting and destroying the organization of the republican party by assassinating local leaders and public officials.
the most notorious such organization was the ku klux klan which in effect served as a military arm of the democratic party in the south.
from its founding in 1866 in tennessee the klan was a terrorist organization.
it quickly spread into nearly every southern state.
led by planters merchants and democratic politicians men who liked to style themselves the souths respectable citizens the klan committed some of the most brutal criminal acts in american history.
in many counties it launched what one victim called a reign of terror against republican leaders black and white.
the klans victims included white republicans among them wartime unionists and local officeholders teachers and party organizers.
william luke an irish born teacher in a black school was lynched in 1870.
but african americans local political leaders those who managed to acquire land and others who in one way or another defied the norms of white supremacy bore the brunt of the violence.
in york county south carolina where nearly the entire white male population joined the klan and women participated by sewing the robes and hoods klansmen wore as disguises the organization committed eleven murders and hundreds of whippings.
on occasion violence escalated from assaults on individuals to mass terrorism and even local insurrections.
in meridian mississippi in 1871 some thirty blacks were murdered in cold blood along with a white republican judge.
the bloodiest act of violence during reconstruction took place in colfax louisiana in 1873 where armed whites assaulted the town with a small cannon.
hundreds of former slaves were murdered including fifty members of a black militia unit after they had surrendered.

15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the overthrow of reconstruction governments appealed to washington for help.
in 1870 and 1871 congress adopted three enforcement acts outlawing terrorist societies and allowing the president to use the army against them.
these laws continued the expansion of national authority during reconstruction.
they defined crimes that aimed to deprive citizens of their civil and political rights as federal offenses rather than violations of state law.
in 1871 president grant dispatched federal marshals backed up by troops in some areas to arrest hundreds of accused klansmen.
many klan leaders fled the south.

liberal republicans despite the grant administrations effective response to klan terrorism the norths commitment to reconstruction waned during the 1870s.
many radicals including thaddeus stevens who died in 1868 had passed from the scene.
within the republican party their place was taken by politicians less committed to the ideal of equal rights for blacks.
northerners increasingly felt that the south should be able to solve its own problems without constant interference from washington.
the federal government had freed the slaves made them citizens and given them the right to vote.
now blacks should rely on their own resources not demand further assistance.
in 1872 an influential group of republicans alienated by corruption within the grant administration and believing that the growth of federal power during and after the war needed to be curtailed formed their own party.
they included republican founders like lyman trumbull and prominent editors and journalists such as e l godkin of the nation.
calling themselves liberal republicans they nominated horace greeley editor of the new york tribune for president.
what were the main factors in b oth the north and south for the abandonment of reconstruction.
the liberals alienation from the grant administration initially had little to do with reconstruction.
they claimed that corrupt politicians had come to power in the north by manipulating the votes of immigrants and workingmen while men of talent and education like themselves had been pushed aside.
democratic criticisms of reconstruction however found a receptive audience among the liberals.
as in the north they became convinced the best men of the south had been excluded from power while ignorant voters controlled politics producing corruption and misgovernment.
power in the south should be returned to the regions natural leaders during the campaign of 1872 greeley repeatedly called on americans to clasp hands across the bloody chasm by putting the civil war and reconstruction behind them.
greeley had spent most of his career first as a whig and then as a republican denouncing the democratic party.
but with the republican split presenting an opportunity to repair their political fortunes democratic leaders endorsed greeley as their candidate.
many rank and file democrats unable to bring themselves to vote for greeley stayed at home on election day.
as a result greeley suffered a devastating defeat by grant whose margin of more than 700 000 popular votes was the largest in a nineteenth century presidential contest.
but greeleys campaign placed on the northern agenda the one issue on which the liberal reformers and the democrats could agree a new policy toward the south.
the north s retreat the liberal attack on reconstruction which continued after 1872 contributed to a resurgence of racism in the north.
journalist james s pike a leading greeley supporter in 1874 published the prostrate state an influential account of a visit to south carolina.
the book depicted a state engulfed by political corruption drained by governmental extravagance and under the control of a mass of black barbarism the souths problems he insisted arose from negro government the solution was to restore leading whites to political power.
newspapers that had long supported reconstruction now began to condemn black participation in southern government.
they expressed their views visually as well.
engravings depicting the former slaves as heroic civil war veterans upstanding citizens or victims of violence were increasingly replaced by caricatures presenting them as little more than unbridled animals.
resurgent racism offered a convenient explanation for the alleged failure of reconstruction.
other factors also weakened northern support for reconstruction.
in 1873 the country plunged into a severe economic depression.
distracted changes in graphic artist thomas nasts depiction of blacks in harpers weekly mirrored the evolution of republican sentiment in the north.

15 what is freedom reconstruction 1865 1877 the overthrow of reconstruction by economic problems republicans were in no mood to devote further attention to the south.
the depression dealt the south a severe blow and further weakened the prospect that republicans could revitalize the regions economy.
democrats made substantial gains throughout the nation in the elections of 1874.
for the first time since the civil war their party took control of the house of representatives.
before the new congress met the old one enacted a final piece of reconstruction legislation the civil rights act of 1875.
this outlawed racial discrimination in places of public accommodation like hotels and theaters.
but it was clear that the northern public was retreating from reconstruction.
the supreme court whittled away at the guarantees of black rights congress had adopted.
in the slaughterhouse cases 1873 butchers excluded from a state sponsored monopoly in louisiana went to court claiming that their right to equality before the law guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment had been violated.
the justices rejected their claim ruling that the amendment had not altered traditional federalism.

triumph of the redeemers by the mid 1870s reconstruction was clearly on the defensive.
democrats had already regained control of states with substantial white voting majorities such as tennessee north carolina and texas.
the victorious democrats called themselves redeemers since they claimed to have redeemed the white south from corruption misgovernment and northern and black control.
in those states where reconstruction governments survived violence again erupted.
this time the grant administration showed no desire to intervene.

to succeed grant the republicans nominated governor rutherford b hayes of ohio.
democrats chose as his opponent new yorks governor samuel j tilden.
by this time only south carolina florida and louisiana remained under republican control.
the election turned out to be so close that whoever captured these states which both parties claimed to have carried would become the next president.
unable to resolve the impasse on its own congress in january 1877 appointed a fifteen member electoral commission composed of senators representatives and supreme court justices.
republicans enjoyed an 8 7 majority on the commission and to no ones surprise the members decided by that margin that hayes had carried the disputed southern states and had been elected president.
even as the commission deliberated however behind thescenes negotiations took place between leaders of the two parties.

they also pledged that hayes would place a southerner in the cabinet position of postmaster general and that he would work for federal aid to the texas and pacific railroad a transcontinental line projected to follow a southern route.
for their part democrats promised not to dispute hayess right to office and to respect the civil and political rights of blacks.
thus was concluded the bargain of 1877.
not all of its parts were fulfilled.
but hayes became president and he did appoint david m key of tennessee as postmaster general.
hayes quickly ordered federal troops to stop guarding the state houses in louisiana and south carolina allowing democratic claimants to become governor.
contrary to legend hayes did not remove the last soldiers from the south he simply ordered them to return to their barracks.
but the texas and pacific never did get its land grant.
of far more significance the triumphant southern democrats failed to live up to their pledge to recognize blacks as equal citizens.
the is this a republican form of government a cartoon by thomas nast in harpers weekly september 2 1876 illustrates his conviction that the overthrow of reconstruction meant that the united states was not prepared to live up to its democratic ideals or protect the rights of black citizens threatened by violence.
end of reconstruction as a historical process the nations adjustment to the destruction of slavery reconstruction continued well after 1877.
blacks continued to vote and in some states hold office into the 1890s.
but as a distinct era of national history when republicans controlled much of the south blacks exercised significant political power and the federal government accepted the responsibility for protecting the fundamental rights of all american citizens reconstruction had come to an end.
despite its limitations reconstruction was a remarkable chapter in the story of american freedom.
nearly a century would pass before the nation again tried to bring equal rights to the descendants of slaves.
the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s would sometimes be called the second reconstruction.
even while it lasted however reconstruction revealed some of the tensions inherent in nineteenth century discussions of freedom.
the policy of granting black men the vote while denying them the benefits of land ownership strengthened the idea that the free citizen could be a poor dependent laborer.
reconstruction placed on the national agenda a problem that would dominate political discussion for the next half century how in a modern society to define the economic essence of freedom.

by 1900 the country had emerged as the worlds major industrial power and thanks to the spanishamerican war of 1898 the possessor of a small overseas empire.
giant new corporations now dominated the economy.
they introduced new forms of labor control and new methods of mass production manufacturing a seemingly endless array of industrial and consumer goods.
immigrants arrived from abroad in unprecedented numbers providing labor for the expanding economy and fueling the growth of the nations cities.
in 1920 residents of cities for the first time outnumbered those living in rural areas.
in the first two decades of the twentieth century the united states became a major participant in world affairs.
it repeatedly sent troops to direct the affairs of caribbean and central american countries.
during world war i president woodrow wilson not only dispatched american soldiers for the first time to fight in europe but also called for continuous american involvement in the creation and preservation of a peaceful economically interconnected world order.
these changes increased the economic opportunities of many americans.
the middle class of clerks managers and other whitecollar workers expanded significantly.
economic growth drew large numbers of women into the workforce.
when the outbreak of world war i cut off immigration from europe hundreds of thousands of blacks moved from southern farms to jobs in northern cities gaining access to the industrial economy and changing the countrys racial configuration.
what is sometimes called the second industrial revolution also led to an era of persistent and often violent labor conflict.
to many americans social life seemed increasingly polarized between those at the top who reaped most of the benefits of economic expansion and workers struggling to make ends meet on low wages and living in desperate conditions in city slums.
democracy itself seemed threatened by the political influence of the large corporations and the corrupt activities of city bosses.
in the early twentieth century increasing numbers of americans concluded that only the reform of politics and increased government intervention in economic life could curb the powers of the new corporations ensure safe working conditions and provide economic security for ordinary men and women.
throughout these years divergent views of the countrys course of development and the proper role of government in shaping and reshaping it found expression in debates over american freedom.
many americans held to a traditional understanding of freedom as the absence of external restraints on free individuals operating in a competitive marketplace.
in this view known as liberty of contract any government interference with economic relationships represented an infringement on property rights and therefore on freedom.
others turned to collective action economic and political to try to reverse what they considered a decline of traditional freedoms.
workers flocked into unions that promised not only higher wages but also industrial freedom a share in basic economic decision making.
during the 1890s millions of farmers joined the populist movement in an attempt to reverse their declining economic prospects and rescue the government from what they saw as control by powerful corporate interests.
in the progressive era of the early twentieth century urban reformers sought to expand economic and political freedom by increasing workers rights weakening the power of city bosses and using the power of the state and national governments to regulate corporate behavior.
in many cities and states and at the national level under presidents theodore roosevelt william howard taft and woodrow wilson government took on new roles in progressive america.
it sought to protect workers especially women and children from economic hardship established agencies to determine rules for corporate behavior and set aside parks and forests to preserve them from commercial exploitation.
to progressives freedom was a positive idea the effective power to achieve personal and social goals.
at the same time the expansion of the consumer economy and the new freedoms for women offered by city life encouraged the growth of an idea of personal freedom based on individual fulfillment including self determination in the most intimate areas of life.
even as definitions of freedom expanded the number of americans who enjoyed genuine freedom contracted.
in the 1890s and the early twentieth century the political leaders of the white south imposed on the regions african americans a comprehensive system of second class citizenship that rested on racial segregation denial of the right to vote lack of economic opportunities and the ever present threat of violence.
many native born americans considered immigrants especially the large numbers arriving from southern and eastern europe as unfit for american citizenship.
they sought to restrict their numbers and to force those already here to americanize themselves by abandoning traditional cultures for mainstream values.
the countrys emergence as a world power intensified these debates over freedom.
to its supporters the new american empire represented a continuation of the countrys traditional self image of promoting liberty and democracy throughout the world.
president wilson envisioned american involvement in world war i as a crusade not for national aggrandizement but to make the world safe for democracy yet critics of the acquisition of foreign colonies questioned whether an empire could still be considered a democracy.
this question gained new urgency during world war i.
on the one hand the war ushered in the final success of the long struggle for woman suffrage the greatest expansion of democracy in american history.
on the other the federal government and private patriotic organizations embarked on the most extensive campaign in american history to stifle criticism of administration policies and the economic status quo.
by 1920 the united states was the worlds foremost economic and military power.
but the role it would play in world affairs in the future and the fate of freedom at home remained unresolved.

the dedication of the statue of liberty october 28 1886 l a n immense crowd gathered in new york harbor on october 28 1886 for the dedication of liberty enlightening the world a fitting symbol for a nation now wholly free.
the idea for the statue originated in 1865 with douard de laboulaye a french educator and the author of several books on the united states as a response to the assassination of abraham lincoln.
the statue de laboulaye hoped would celebrate both the historic friendship between france and the united states and the triumph through the unions victory in the civil war of american freedom.
measuring more than 150 feet from torch to toe and standing atop a huge pedestal the edifice was the tallest manmade structure in the western hemisphere.
it exceeded in height newspapers noted with pride the colossus of rhodes a wonder of the ancient world.
in time the statue of liberty as it came to be called would become americans most revered national icon.
for over a century it has stood as a symbol of freedom.
the statue has offered welcome to millions of immigrants the huddled masses yearning to breathe free celebrated in a poem by emma lazarus inscribed on its base in 1903.
in the years since its dedication the statues familiar image has been reproduced by folk artists in every conceivable medium and has been used by advertisers to promote everything from cigarettes and lawn mowers to war bonds.
as its use by chinese students demanding democracy in the tiananmen square protests of 1989 showed it has become a powerful international symbol as well.
the year of the statues dedication 1886 also witnessed the great upheaval a wave of strikes and labor protests that touched every part of the nation.
six months before the unveiling of the statue of liberty police had killed four striking workers who attempted to prevent strikebreakers w h a t f a c t o r s c o m b i n e d t o m a k e t h e u n i t e d s t a t e s a m a t u r e i n d u s t r i a l s o c i e t y a f t e r t h e c i v i l wa r.
from entering a chicago factory.
this was only one of many violent clashes that accompanied labor unrest between the end of reconstruction in 1877 and the turn of the twentieth century.
the 600 dignitaries 598 of them men who gathered on what is now called liberty island for the dedication hoped the statue of liberty would inspire renewed devotion to the nations political and economic system.
but for all its grandeur the statue could not conceal the deep social divisions and fears about the future of american freedom that accompanied the countrys emergence as the worlds leading industrial power.
nor did the celebrations address the crucial questions that moved to the center stage of american public life during the 1870s and 1880s and remained there for decades to come what are the social conditions that make freedom possible and what role should the national government play in defining and protecting the liberty of its citizens.
the second industrial revolution between the end of the civil war and the early twentieth century the united states underwent one of the most rapid and profound economic revolutions any country has ever experienced.
there were numerous causes for this explosive economic growth.
the country enjoyed abundant natural resources a growing supply of labor an expanding market for manufactured goods and the availability of capital for investment.
in addition the federal government actively promoted industrial and agricultural the strike an 1886 painting by the german born artist robert koehler who had grown up in a working class family in milwaukee.
koehler depicts a confrontation between a factory owner dressed in a silk top hat and angry workers.
a woman and her children presumably members of a strikers family watch from the side while another woman at the center appears to plead for restraint.
the threat of violence hangs in the air and a striker in the lower righthand corner reaches for a stone.
the painting was inspired by events in pittsburgh during the great railroad strike of 1877 although koehler was living in new york city at the time.

before going off to war many soldiers sat for photographs like these reproduced on small cards called cartes de visite which they distributed to friends and loved ones.
jemison was killed in the battle of malvern hill in july 1862.
the two combatants almost any comparison between union and confederacy seemed to favor the union.
the population of the north and the loyal border slave states numbered 22 million in 1860 while only 9 million persons lived in the confederacy 3 5 million of them slaves.
in manufacturing railroad mileage and financial resources the union far outstripped its opponent.
on the other hand the union confronted by far the greater task.
to restore the shattered nation it had to invade and conquer an area larger than western europe.
confederate soldiers were highly motivated fighters defending their homes and families.
like washingtons forces during the american revolution southern armies could lose most of the battles and still win the war if their opponent tired of the struggle.
no people confederate general p g t beauregard later claimed ever warred for independence with more relative advantages than the confederacy on both sides the outbreak of war stirred powerful feelings of patriotism.
recruits rushed to enlist expecting a short glorious war.
later as enthusiasm waned both sides resorted to a draft.
the confederacy in the spring of 1862 passed the first draft law in american history and the north soon followed.
by 1865 more than 2 million men had served in the union army and 900 000 in the confederate army.
each was a cross section of its society the norths was composed largely of farm boys shopkeepers artisans and urban workers while the souths consisted mostly of non slaveholding small farmers with slaveowners dominating the officer corps.
few recruits had any military experience.
fifteen years had passed since the mexican war.
ideas about war were highly romantic based on novels magazine articles and lithographs of soldiers covering themselves with glory.
one private wrote home in 1862 that his notion of combat had come from the pictures of battles he had seen they would all be in a line all standing in a nice level field fighting a number of ladies taking care of the wounded etc.
but it isnt so nor were the recruits ready for military regimentation.
it comes rather hard at first to be deprived of liberty wrote an illinois soldier.

on the battlefield.
according to one estimate during the first two years of the war the main union force the army of the potomac spent only thirty days in actual combat.
the technology of war neither the soldiers nor their officers were prepared for the way technology had transformed warfare.
the civil war was the first major conflict in which the railroad transported troops and supplies and the first to see railroad junctions such as atlanta and petersburg become major military objectives.
the famous sea battle between the union vessel monitor and the confederate merrimac in 1862 was the first demonstration of the superiority of ironclads over wooden ships revolutionizing naval warfare.
the war saw the use of the telegraph for military communication the introduction of observation balloons to view enemy lines and even primitive hand grenades and submarines.
perhaps most important a revolution in arms manufacturing had replaced the traditional musket accurate at only a short range with the more modern rifle deadly at 600 yards or more because of its grooved or rifled barrel.
this development changed the nature of combat emphasizing the importance of heavy fortifications and elaborate trenches and giving those on the defensive usually southern armies a significant advantage over attacking forces.
my men said confederate general thomas stonewall jackson sometimes fail to drive the enemy from his position but to hold one never the war of rifle and trench produced the appalling casualty statistics of civil war battles.
the 620 000 who perished in the war represent the equivalent in terms of todays population of more battle of the iron clads monitor and merrimac painted in 1877 by william torgerson depicts the first clash between ironclad ships which took place off the coast of virginia on march 9 1862.

with medical knowledge and practices primitive at best far more men died from wounds infections and disease than in battle.
the first modern war than 6 million men.
these figures do not include the thousands of civilians who became victims of battles or who perished in disease ridden camps for runaway slaves or in conflicts between unionist and confederate families that raged in parts of the south.
the death toll in the civil war nearly equals the total number of americans who died in all the nations other wars from the revolution to the war in iraq.
nor was either side ready for other aspects of modern warfare.
medical care remained primitive.
i believe the doctors kill more than they cure wrote an alabama private in 1862.
diseases like measles dysentery malaria and typhus swept through army camps killing more men than did combat.
the civil war was the first war in which large numbers of americans were captured by the enemy and held in dire conditions in military prisons.
some 50 000 men died in these prisons victims of starvation and disease including 13 000 union soldiers at andersonville georgia.
everywhere in the world war was becoming more destructive.
the scale of civil war bloodshed was unique in american history but not in the nineteenth century world.
the taiping rebellion in china 1850 1864 resulted in 23 million deaths.
the war of the triple alliance in south america 1864 1870 which pitted argentina brazil and uruguay against paraguay caused the death of half of paraguays prewar population of around 525 000.
napoleon iiis military destruction of the paris commune in 1871 resulted in the death of more than 20 000 of his fellow countrymen in a single city.

at the same time the wars brutal realities were brought home with unprecedented immediacy to the public at large.
war correspondents accompanied the armies and newspapers reported the results of battles on the following day and quickly published long lists of casualties.
the infant art of photography carried images of war into millions of american living rooms.
beginning in 1862 when photographers entered the battlefield to take shocking pictures of the dead at antietam the camera in the words of one journalist brought the bodies and laid them in our door yards mathew brady who organized a corps of photographers to cover the war found the conflict a passport to fame and wealth.
for photography itself it was a turning point in its growth as an art and business enterprise.
mobilizing resources figure 14 1 resources for war union versus confederacy population 22 million 9 million including 3 5 million slaves factories value of goods produced railroad tracks of total u s mileage textiles including cotton cloth and woolen goods the outbreak of the war found both sides unprepared.
in 1861 there was no national railroad gauge the distance separating the two tracks so trains built for one line could not run on another.
there was no national banking system no tax system capable of raising the enormous funds needed to finance the war and not even accurate maps of the southern states.
soon after the firing on fort sumter lincoln proclaimed a naval blockade of the south part of the so called anaconda plan which aimed to strangle the south economically.
but the navy charged with patrolling the 3 500 mile coastline consisted of only ninety vessels fewer than half of them steam powered.
not until late in the war did the blockade become effective.
then there was the problem of purchasing and distributing the food weapons and other supplies required by the soldiers.
the union army eventually became the best fed and best supplied military force in history.
by the wars third year on the other hand southern armies were suffering from acute shortages of food uniforms and shoes.
yet the chief of the confederacys ordnance bureau josiah gorgas a transplanted northerner proved brilliantly resourceful in arming southern troops.

but this did not make union victory inevitable as during the war of independence the stronger side sometimes loses.

14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 the first modern war tion the confederate government imported weapons from abroad and established arsenals of its own to turn out rifles artillery and ammunition.
military strategies each side tried to find ways to maximize its advantages.
essentially the confederacy adopted a defensive strategy with occasional thrusts into the north.
general robert e lee the leading southern commander was a brilliant battlefield tactician who felt confident of his ability to fend off attacks by larger union forces.
he hoped that a series of defeats would weaken the norths resolve and lead it eventually to abandon the conflict and recognize southern independence.
lincolns early generals found it impossible to bring the unions advantages in manpower and technology to bear on the battlefield.
in april 1861 the regular army numbered little more than 15 000 men most of whom were stationed west of the mississippi river.
its officers had been trained to lead small professional forces into battle not the crowds of untrained men who assembled in 1861.
the north also suffered from narrowness of military vision.
its generals initially concentrated on occupying southern territory and attempting to capture richmond the confederate capital.
they attacked sporadically and withdrew after a battle thus sacrificing the norths manpower superiority and allowing the south to concentrate its smaller forces when an engagement impended.
well before his generals did lincoln realized that simply capturing and occupying territory would not win the war and that defeating the souths armies not capturing its capital had to be the norths battlefield objective.
and when he came to adopt the policy of emancipation lincoln acknowledged what confederate vice president alexander h stephens had already affirmed slavery was the cornerstone of the confederacy.
to win the war therefore the union must make the institution that lay at the economic and social foundation of southern life a military target.
the war begins in the east most of the wars fighting took place in a narrow corridor between washington and richmond a distance of only 100 miles as a succession of union generals led the army of the potomac as the main northern force in the east was called toward the confederate capital only to be turned back by southern forces.
the first significant engagement the first battle of bull run took place in northern virginia on july 21 1861.
it ended with the chaotic retreat of the union soldiers along with the sightseers and politicians who had come to watch the battle.
almost 800 men died at bull run a toll eclipsed many times in the years to come but more americans than had been killed in any previous battle in the nations history.
the encounter disabused both sides of the idea that the war would be a brief lark.
in the wake of bull run george b mcclellan an army engineer who had recently won a minor engagement with confederate troops in western virginia assumed command of the unions army of the potomac.
a brilliant organizer mcclellan succeeded in welding his men into a superb fighting force.

here they confronted the smaller army of northern virginia under the command of the confederate general joseph e johnston and after he was wounded robert e lee.
a brilliant battlefield tactician lee had been offered a command in the union army but chose to fight for the confederacy because of his devotion to virginia.
in the seven days campaign a series of engagements in june 1862 on the peninsula south of richmond lee blunted mcclellans attacks and forced him to withdraw back to the vicinity of washington d c.
in during the first two years of the war most of the fighting took place in virginia and maryland.

successful on the defensive lee now launched an invasion of the north.
he hoped to bring the border slave states into the confederacy persuade britain and france to recognize southern independence influence the norths fall elections and perhaps capture washington d c at the battle of antietam in maryland mcclellan and the army of the potomac repelled lees advance.
in a single day of fighting nearly 4 000 men were killed and 18 000 wounded 2 000 of whom later died of their injuries.

indeed more american soldiers perished at antietam than in all the other wars fought by the united states in the nineteenth century combined.
since lee was forced to retreat the north could claim antietam as a victory.
it was to be the unions last success in the east for some time.
in december 1862 the union suffered one of its most disastrous defeats of the war when general ambrose e burnside who had replaced mcclellan as the head of the army of the potomac assaulted lees army which was entrenched on heights near fredricksburg virginia.
it was not a fight wrote one union soldier to his mother it was a massacre the war in the west while the union accomplished little in the east in the first two years of the war events in the west followed a different course.
here the architect of early success was ulysses s grant.
a west point graduate who had resigned from the army in 1854 in part because of allegations of excessive drinking grant had been notably unsuccessful in civilian life.

but union momentum in the west then stalled.
t h e c o m i n g o f e m a n c i pat i o n slavery and the war war it has been said is the midwife of revolution.
and the civil war produced far reaching changes in american life.
the most dramatic of these was the destruction of slavery the central institution of southern society.
between 1831 when the british abolished slavery in their empire and 1888 when emancipation came to brazil some 6 million slaves gained their freedom in the western hemisphere.
of these nearly 4 million two thirds of the total lived in the southern united states.
in numbers scale and the economic power of the institution of slavery american emancipation dwarfed that of any other country although far more people were liberated in 1861 when czar alexander ii abolished serfdom in the russian empire.
at the outset of the war lincoln invoked time honored northern values to mobilize public support.
in a message to congress he identified the union cause with the fate of democracy for the whole family of man he identified the differences between north and south in terms of the familiar free labor ideology this is essentially a peoples struggle.
on the side of the union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men.
to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life but while appealing to free labor values lincoln initially insisted that slavery was irrelevant to the conflict.
in the wars first year his paramount concerns were to keep the border slave states delaware maryland kentucky and missouri in the union and to build the broadest base of support in the north for the war effort.
action against slavery he feared would drive the border with its white population of 2 6 million and nearly 500 000 slaves into the confederacy and alienate conservative northerners.
the unraveling of slavery thus in the early days of the war a nearly unanimous congress adopted a resolution proposed by senator john j crittenden of kentucky which affirmed that the union had no intention of interfering with slavery.
northern military commanders even returned fugitive slaves to their owners a policy that raised an outcry in antislavery circles.
yet as the confederacy set slaves to work as military laborers and blacks began to escape to union lines the policy of ignoring slavery unraveled.
by the end of 1861 the military had adopted the plan begun in virginia by general benjamin f butler of treating escaped blacks as contraband of war that is property of military value subject to confiscation.
butlers order added a word to the wars vocabulary.
escaping slaves became known as the contrabands they were housed by the army in contraband camps and educated in new contraband schools meanwhile slaves themselves took actions that helped propel a reluctant how did a war to preserve the union become a war to end slavery.
white america down the road to emancipation.
whatever the policies of the administration blacks saw the outbreak of fighting as heralding the long awaited end of bondage.
well before lincoln made emancipation a war aim blacks in the north and the south were calling the conflict the freedom war in 1861 and 1862 as the federal army occupied confederate territory slaves by the thousands headed for union lines.
unlike fugitives before the war these runaways included large numbers of women and children as entire families abandoned the plantations.
not a few passed along military intelligence and detailed knowledge of the souths terrain.
the most valuable and reliable information of the enemys movements in our vicinity that we have been able to get noted the union general daniel e sickles derived from negroes who came into our lines in southern louisiana the arrival of the union army in 1862 led slaves to sack plantation houses and refuse to work unless wages were paid.
slavery there wrote a northern reporter is forever destroyed and worthless no matter what mr lincoln or anyone else may say on the subject steps toward emancipation at first blacks determination to seize the opportunity presented by the war proved a burden to the army and an embarrassment to the administration.
but the failure of traditional strategies to produce victory strengthened the hand of antislavery northerners.
since slavery stood at the foundation of the southern economy they insisted emancipation was necessary to weaken the souths ability to sustain the war.
the most uncompromising opponents of slavery before the war abolitionists and radical republicans quickly concluded that the institution must become a target of the union war effort.
it is plain declared thaddeus stevens a radical republican congressman from pennsylvania that nothing approaching the present policy will subdue the rebels outside of congress few pressed the case for emancipation more eloquently than frederick douglass.
from the outset he insisted that it was futile to separate the freedom of the slave from the victory of the government fire must be met with water douglass declared darkness with light and war for the destruction of liberty must be met with war for the destruction of slavery these appeals won increasing support in a congress frustrated by lack of military success.
in march 1862 congress prohibited the army from returning fugitive slaves.
then came abolition in the district of columbia with monetary compensation for slaveholders and the territories followed in july by the second confiscation act which liberated slaves of disloyal owners in union occupied territory as well as slaves who escaped to union lines.
an 1863 advertisement for a runaway domestic slave circulated by louis manigault a member of a prominent georgia and south carolina planter family.
manigault blamed an unknown white man for enticing her away but she most likely escaped with a male slave who had begun to court her.
slaves fled to union lines from the first days of the civil war.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 the coming of emancipation throughout these months lincoln struggled to retain control of the emancipation issue.
in august 1861 john c frmont commanding union forces in missouri a state racked by a bitter guerrilla war between pronorthern and pro southern bands decreed the freedom of its slaves.
fearful of the orders impact on the border states lincoln swiftly rescinded it.
in november the president proposed that the border states embark on a program of gradual emancipation with the federal government paying owners for their loss of property.
he also revived the idea of colonization.
in august 1862 lincoln met at the white house with a delegation of black leaders and urged them to promote emigration from the united states.
you and we are different races he declared.
it is better for us both to be separated as late as december the president signed an agreement with a shady entrepreneur to settle former slaves on an island off the coast of haiti.
lincolns abe lincolns last card an engraving from the british magazine punch october 18 1862 portrays the preliminary emancipation proclamation as the last move of a desperate gambler.
decision sometime during the summer of 1862 lincoln concluded that emancipation had become a political and military necessity.
many factors contributed to his decision lack of military success hope that emancipated slaves might help meet the armys growing manpower needs changing northern public opinion and the calculation that making slavery a target of the war effort would counteract sentiment in britain for recognition of the confederacy.
but on the advice of secretary of state william h seward lincoln delayed his announcement until after a union victory lest it seem an act of desperation.
on september 22 1862 five days after mcclellans army forced lee to retreat at antietam lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation.
it warned that unless the south laid down its arms by the end of 1862 he would decree abolition.
the initial northern reaction was not encouraging.
in the fall elections of 1862 democrats made opposition to emancipation the centerpiece of their campaign warning that the north would be africanized inundated by freed slaves who would compete for jobs and seek to marry white women.
the republicans suffered sharp reverses.
they lost control of the legislatures of indiana and illinois and the governorship of new york and saw their majorities dangerously reduced in other states.
in his annual message to congress early in december lincoln tried to calm northerners racial fears reviving the ideas of gradual emancipation and colonization.
he concluded however on a higher note fellow citizens we cannot escape history.
the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.
in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve how did a war to preserve the union become a war to end slavery.
the emancipation proclamation on january 1 1863 after greeting visitors at the annual white house new years reception lincoln retired to his study to sign the emancipation proclamation.
the document did not liberate all the slaves indeed on the day it was issued it applied to very few.
because its legality derived from the presidents authority as military commander in chief to combat the souths rebellion the proclamation exempted areas firmly under union control where the war in effect had already ended.
thus it did not apply to the loyal border slave states that had never seceded or to areas of the confederacy occupied by union soldiers such as tennessee and parts of virginia and louisiana.
but the vast majority of the souths slaves more than 3 million men women and children it declared henceforward shall be free since most of these slaves were still behind confederate lines however their liberation would have to await union victories.
despite its limitations the proclamation set off scenes of jubilation among free blacks and abolitionists in the north and contrabands and slaves in the south.
sound the loud timbrel oer egypts dark sea intoned a black preacher at a celebration in boston.
jehovah hath triumphed his people are free by making the union army an agent of emancipation and wedding the goals of union and abolition the proclamation sounded the eventual death knell of slavery.
not only did the emancipation proclamation alter the nature of the civil war and the course of american history but it also represented a turning point in lincolns own thinking.
it contained no reference to compensation to slaveholders or to colonization of the freed people.
for the first time it committed the government to enlisting black soldiers in the union army.
lincoln now became in his own mind the great emancipator that is he assumed the role that history had thrust upon him and he tried to live up freed negroes celebrating president lincolns decree of emancipation a fanciful engraving from the french periodical le monde illustr march 21 1863.
visions of freedom freedom to the slave.
this handcolored lithograph from 1863 celebrates the promise of emancipation and also links the american flag the symbol of nationality with freedom by placing a liberty cap atop it.
on the left are symbols of freedom including a school a church a plow and a black man reading a newspaper.
a broken chain lies in the right foreground.
the image conveys the optimism inspired by the emancipation proclamation.
but many former slaves would never fully enjoy the kinds of freedom imagined in this lithograph.
questions 1.
what does the image tell us about how emancipation was achieved.
in what ways does the artist suggest that freedom differed from life under slavery.
how did a war to preserve the union become a war to end slavery.
the emancipation proclamation pennsylvania ohio colorado territory illinois west virginia missouri virginia kentucky new mexico territory maryland delaware indiana kansas indian territory new jersey north carolina tennessee arkansas mississippi south carolina alabama georgia texas louisiana florida free state slave state in the union to which proclamation does not apply free territory confederate area occupied by union exempted from proclamation areas to which emancipation proclamation applies confederate area occupied by union where slaves are freed immediately to it.
he would later refuse suggestions that he rescind or modify the proclamation in the interest of peace.
were he to do so he told one visitor i should be damned in time and eternity like the end of slavery in haiti and mainland latin america abolition in the united states came about as the result of war.
but emancipation in the united states differed from its counterparts elsewhere in the western hemisphere it was immediate not gradual and offered no compensation to slaveholders for their loss of property with the exception of those in washington d c it also foretold the inevitable end of slavery in cuba puerto rico and brazil.
not until 1888 however when brazil abolished the institution did slavery come to an end in the entire western hemisphere.
the civil war which was begun to preserve the prewar union now portended a far reaching transformation in southern life and a redefinition of american freedom.
decoupling emancipation from colonization meant that the freed slaves would become part of american life.
a new system of labor politics and race relations would have to replace the shattered institution of slavery.
up to now wrote the socialist thinker karl marx observing events from london we have witnessed only the first act of the civil war the constitutional waging of war.
the second act the revolutionary waging of war is at hand the evolution of 300 miles 300 kilometers with the exception of a few areas the emancipation proclamation applied only to slaves in parts of the confederacy not under union control on january 1 1863.
lincoln did not free the slaves with a stroke of his pen but the proclamation did change the nature of the civil war.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 the coming of emancipation lincolns emancipation policy displayed the hallmarks of his wartime leadership his capacity for growth and his ability to develop broad public support for his administration.
enlisting this widely reprinted recruiting poster urged african american men to join the union army after congress and the president changed the policy of allowing only whites to serve.
black troops of the proclamations provisions few were more radical in their implications than the enrollment of blacks into military service.
since sailor had been one of the few occupations open to free blacks before the war secretary of the navy gideon welles had already allowed african americans to serve on union warships.
but as during the american revolution when george washington initially excluded blacks from the continental army blacks in the civil war had to fight for the right to fight on land.
early in the war harry jarvis a virginia slave escaped to fortress monroe and offered to enlist in the union army.
general benjamin f butler jarvis later recalled said it wasnt a black mans war.
i told him it would be a black mans war before they got through at the outset the union army refused to accept northern black volunteers.
the administration feared that whites would not be willing to fight alongside blacks and that enlisting black soldiers would alienate the border slave states that remained in the union.
by the end of 1861 however the army was employing escaped slaves as cooks laundresses and laborers.
preliminary steps to enlist combat troops were taken in a few parts of the south in 1862.
white abolitionist thomas wentworth higginson was sent to the south carolina sea islands which the union navy had seized early in the war to enroll slaves in the first south carolina volunteers.
but only after the emancipation proclamation did the recruitment of black soldiers begin in earnest.
by the end of the war more than 180 000 black men had served in the union army and 24 000 in the navy.
one third died in battle or of wounds or disease.
fifteen black soldiers and eight sailors received the medal of honor the highest award for military valor.
some black units won considerable notoriety among them the fiftyfourth massachusetts volunteers a company of free blacks from throughout the north commanded by robert gould shaw a young reformer from a prominent boston family.
the bravery of the fifty fourth in the july 1863 attack on fort wagner south carolina where nearly half the unit including shaw perished helped to dispel widespread doubts about blacks ability to withstand the pressures of the civil war battlefield.
the exploits of shaw and the fiftyfourth massachusetts were popularized in the 1989 film glory.
how did a war to preserve the union become a war to end slavery.
most black soldiers were emancipated slaves who joined the army in the south.
after union forces in 1863 seized control of the rich plantation lands of the mississippi valley general lorenzo thomas raised fifty regiments of black soldiers some 76 000 men in all.
another large group hailed from the border states exempted from the emancipation proclamation where enlistment was for most of the war the only route to freedom.
here black military service undermined slavery for congress expanded the emancipation proclamation to liberate black soldiers and their families.
the black soldier for black soldiers themselves military service proved to be a liberating experience.
no negro who has ever been a soldier wrote a northern official in 1865 can again be imposed upon they have learned what it is to be free and they will infuse their feelings into others service in the army established men as community leaders and opened a door to political advancement.
out of the army came many of the leaders of the reconstruction era.
at least 130 former soldiers served in political office after the civil war.
in time the memory of black military service would fade from white americas collective memory.
of the hundreds of civil war monuments that still dot the northern landscape fewer than a dozen contain an image of a black soldier.
but well into the twentieth century it remained a point of pride in black families throughout the united states that their fathers and grandfathers had fought for freedom.
the union navy treated black sailors pretty much the same as white sailors.
conditions on ships made racial segregation impossible.
black and white sailors lived and dined together in the same quarters.
they received equal pay and had the same promotion opportunities.
within the army however black soldiers received treatment that was anything but equal to their white counterparts.
organized into segregated units under sometimes abusive white officers they initially received lower pay ten dollars per month compared to sixteen dollars for white soldiers.
they were dis photographs of four anonymous black civil war soldiers including a sergeant with three stripes on his uniform.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 the second american revolution proportionately assigned to labor rather than combat and they could not rise to the rank of commissioned officer until the very end of the war.
if captured by confederate forces they faced the prospect of sale into slavery or immediate execution.
in a notorious incident in 1864 200 of 262 black soldiers died when southern troops under the command of nathan b forrest overran fort pillow in tennessee.
some of those who perished were killed after surrendering.
nonetheless black soldiers played a crucial role not only in winning the civil war but in defining the wars consequences.
once let a black man get upon his person the brass letters u s wrote frederick douglass in urging blacks to enlist and there is no power on earth which can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship in the united states as douglass predicted thanks in part to black military service many republicans in the last two years of the war came to believe that emancipation must bring with it equal protection of the laws regardless of race.
one of the first acts of the federal government to recognize this principle was the granting of retroactive equal pay to black soldiers early in 1865.
racism was hardly eliminated from national life.
but declared george william curtis the editor of harpers weekly the war and emancipation had transformed a government for white men into one for mankind the service of black soldiers affected lincolns own outlook.
he insisted that they must be treated the same as whites when captured and suspended prisoner of war exchanges when the confederacy refused to include black troops.
in 1864 lincoln who before the war had never supported suffrage for african americans urged the governor of union occupied louisiana to work for the partial enfranchisement of blacks singling out soldiers as especially deserving.
at some future time he observed they might again be called upon to keep the jewel of liberty in the family of freedom the second american revolution old things are passing away wrote a black resident of california in 1862 and eventually old prejudices must follow.
the revolution has begun and time alone must decide where it is to end the changing status of black americans was only one dramatic example of what some historians call the second american revolution the transformation of american government and society brought about by the civil war.
liberty the illustration accompanying the american flag a piece of patriotic civil war sheet music exemplifies how the war united the ideals of liberty and nationhood.
and union never was freedoms contested nature more evident than during the civil war.
we all declare for liberty lincoln observed in 1864 but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing to the north he continued freedom meant for each man to enjoy the product of his labor to southern whites it conveyed mastership the power to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labor the unions triumph consolidated the northern understanding of freedom as the national norm.
the attack on fort sumter crystallized in northern minds the direct conflict between freedom and slavery that abolitionists had insisted upon h o w d i d t h e c i v i l wa r t r a n s f o r m t h e n a t i o n a l e c o n o m y a n d c r e a t e a s t r o n g e r n a t i o n s t a t e.
for decades.
the war as frederick douglass recognized as early as 1862 merged the cause of the slaves and the cause of the country liberty and union he continued have become identical as during the american revolution religious and secular understandings of freedom joined in a celebration of national destiny.
as he died to make men holy let us die to make men free proclaimed the popular song battle hymn of the republic written by julia ward howe and published in 1862.
emancipation offered proof of the progressive nature and global significance of the countrys history.
for the first time wrote the chicago tribune the united states could truly exist as our fathers designed it the home of freedom the asylum of the oppressed the seat of justice the land of equal rights under the law lincolns vision but it was lincoln himself who linked the conflict with the deepest beliefs of northern society.
it is sometimes said that the american civil war was part of a broader nineteenth century process of nation building.
throughout the world powerful centralized nation states developed in old countries and new nations emerged where none had previously existed.
the civil war took place as modern states were consolidating their power and reducing local autonomy.
the meiji restoration in japan saw the emperor reclaim power from local lords or shoguns.
argentina in the 1850s adopted a new constitution that abolished slavery established universal male suffrage and gave the national government the right to intervene in local affairs.
as in the united states economic development quickly followed national unification.
japan soon emerged as a major economic power and argentina embarked on a policy of railroad construction centralization of banking industrial development and the encouragement of european immigration which soon made it the worlds sixth largest economy.
lincoln has been called the american equivalent of giuseppe mazzini or otto von bismarck who during this same era created nation states in italy and germany from disunited collections of principalities.
but lincolns nation was different from those being constructed in europe.
they were based on the idea of unifying a particular people with a common ethnic cultural and linguistic heritage.
to lincoln the american nation embodied a set of universal ideas centered on political democracy and human liberty.
the united states represented to the world the principle that government should rest on popular consent and that all men should be free.
these ideals lincoln declared allowed immigrants from abroad who could not trace their connection by blood to the nations birth nonetheless to become fully american.
lincoln summarized his conception of the wars meaning in november 1863 in brief remarks at the dedication of a military cemetery at the site of the wars greatest battle.
the gettysburg address is considered his finest speech see the appendix for the full text.
in less than three minutes he identified the nations mission with the principle that all men are created equal spoke of the war as bringing about a new birth of freedom and defined the essence of democratic government.
the sacrifices of union soldiers he declared would ensure that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth lincoln and the female slave by the free black artist david b bowser.
working in philadelphia bowser painted flags for a number of black civil war regiments.

14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 the second american revolution from union to nation the eagles nest an 1861 antisecession cartoon promising annihilation to traitors the eggs representing seceding states have become rotten and are hatching monsters.
the mobilization of the unions resources for modern war brought into being a new american nation state with greatly expanded powers and responsibilities.
the united states remained a federal republic with sovereignty divided between the state and national governments.
but the war forged a new national selfconsciousness reflected in the increasing use of the word nation a unified political entity in place of the older union of separate states.
in his inaugural address in 1861 lincoln used the word union twenty times while making no mention of the nation by 1863 union does not appear at all in the 269 word gettysburg address while lincoln referred five times to the nation liberty.
true liberty the writer francis lieber proclaimed requires a country this was the moral of one of the eras most popular works of fiction edward everett hales short story the man without a country published in 1863.
hales protagonist philip nolan in a fit of anger curses the land of his birth.
as punishment he is condemned to live on a ship never to set foot on american soil or hear the name the united states spoken.
he learns that to be deprived of national identity is to lose ones sense of self.
the war and american religion the upsurge of patriotism and of national power was reflected in many aspects of american life.
even as the war produced unprecedented casualties the northern protestant clergy strove to provide it with a religious justification and to reassure their congregations that the dead had not died in vain.
the religious press now devoted more space to military and political developments than to spiritual matters.
in numerous wartime sermons christianity and patriotism were joined in a civic religion that saw the war as gods mechanism for ridding the united states of slavery and enabling it to become what it had never really been a land of freedom.
lincoln one of the few american presidents who never joined a church shrewdly marshaled religious symbolism to generate public support declaring days of thanksgiving after northern victories and encouraging northern clergymen to support republican candidates for office.
religious beliefs also enabled americans to cope with the unprecedented mass death the war involved.
of course equating death with eternal life h o w d i d t h e c i v i l wa r t r a n s f o r m t h e n a t i o n a l e c o n o m y a n d c r e a t e a s t r o n g e r n a t i o n s t a t e.
is a central tenet of christianity.
but the war led to what one historian calls a transformation of heaven as americans imagined future celestial family reunions that seemed more and more like gatherings in middle class living rooms.
some americans could not wait until their own deaths to see the departed.
spiritualism belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew in popularity.
mary todd lincoln held seances in the white house to experience again the presence of her young son willie who succumbed to disease in 1862.
coping with death also required unprecedented governmental action from notifying next of kin to accounting for the dead and missing.
both the union and confederacy established elaborate systems for gathering statistics and maintaining records of dead and wounded soldiers an effort supplemented by private philanthropic organizations.
after the war ended the federal government embarked on a program to locate and re bury hundreds of thousands of union soldiers in national military cemeteries.
between 1865 and 1871 the government reinterred more than 300 000 union but not confederate soldiers including black soldiers who were buried as they had fought in segregated sections of military cemeteries.
liberty in wartime this intense new nationalism made criticism of the war effort or of the policies of the lincoln administration seem to republicans equivalent to treason.
although there had been sporadic persecution of opponents of the mexican war the civil war presented for the first time since the revolution the issue of the limits of wartime dissent.
during the conflict declared the republican new york times the safety of the nation is the supreme law arbitrary arrests numbered in the thousands.
they included opposition newspaper editors democratic politicians individuals who discouraged enlistment in the army and ordinary civilians like the chicago man briefly imprisoned for calling the president a damned fool with the constitution unclear as to who possessed the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus thus allowing prisoners to be held without charge this image adorned a printed version of a popular civil war song the dying soldier it illustrates how americans sought solace in religion in the face of the wars enormous death toll.

our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas its foundations are laid its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and moral condition.
this our new government is the first in the history of the world based upon this great physical philosophical the confederate constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions african slavery as it exists among us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization.
this was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.
the prevailing ideas entertained by jefferson and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution were that the enslavement of the african was in violation of the laws of nature that it was wrong in principle socially morally and politically.
these ideas however were fundamentally wrong.
they rested on the assumption of the equality of and moral truth.
it is the first government ever instituted upon principles in strict conformity to nature and the ordination of providence in furnishing the materials of human society.
many governments have been founded upon the principles of certain classes but the classes thus enslaved were of the same race and in violation of the laws of nature.
our system commits no such violation of natures laws.
the negro by nature or by the curse against canaan is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our system.
the substratum of our society is made of the material fitted by nature for it and by experience we know that it is the best not only for the superior but for the inferior race that it should be so.
from abraham lincoln a d d r e s s a t s a n i t a r y fa i r b a l t i m o r e a p r i l 1 8 1 8 6 4 abraham lincolns speech at a sanitary fair a grand bazaar that raised money for the care of union soldiers offers a dramatic illustration of the contested meaning of freedom during the civil war.
the world has never had a good definition of the word liberty and the american people just now are much in want of one.
we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.
with some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the was a black one.
plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty and precisely the same difference prevails today among us human creatures even in the north and all professing to love liberty.
hence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty.
recently as it seems the people of maryland have been doing something to define liberty abolishing slavery in the state and thanks to them that in what they have done the wolfs dictionary has been repudiated.
product of his labor while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labor.
here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same name liberty.
and it questions follows that each of the things is by the respective 1.

14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 the second american revolution lincoln claimed the right under the presidential war powers and twice suspended the writ throughout the entire union for those accused of disloyal activities the courts generally gave the administration a free hand.
they refused to intervene when a military court convicted clement l vallandigham a leading ohio democrat known for his blistering antiwar speeches of treason.
on lincolns order vallandigham was banished to the confederacy.
in 1861 chief justice roger b taney had ordered the president to release john merryman a civilian who had been arrested by military authorities in maryland but the president ignored him.
not until 1866 after the fighting had ended did the supreme court in the case ex parte milligan declare it unconstitutional to bring accused persons before military tribunals where civil courts were operating.
the constitution declared justice david davis is not suspended in wartime it remains a law for rulers and people equally in time of war and peace lincoln was not a despot.
most of those arrested were quickly released the democratic press continued to flourish and contested elections were held throughout the war.
but the policies of the lincoln administration offered proof to be repeated during later wars of the fragility of civil liberties in the face of assertive patriotism and wartime demands for national unity.
the north s transformation even as he invoked traditional values lincoln presided over far reaching changes in northern life.
the effort to mobilize the resources of the union greatly enhanced the power not only of the federal government but also of a rising class of capitalist entrepreneurs.
unlike the south which suffered economic devastation the north experienced the war as a time of prosperity.
nourished by wartime inflation and government contracts the profits of industry boomed.
new england mills worked day and night to supply the army with blankets and uniforms and pennsylvania coal mines and ironworks rapidly expanded their production.
mechanization proceeded apace in many industries especially those like boot and shoe production and meatpacking that supplied the armys ever increasing needs.
agriculture also flourished for even as farm boys by the hundreds of thousands joined the army the frontier of cultivation pushed westward with machinery and immigrants replacing lost labor.
wisconsin furnished 90 000 men to the union army yet its population grain production and farm income continued to grow.
government sheet music for two of the best known patriotic songs written during the civil war.
and the economy as in contemporary germany and japan the new american nation state that emerged during the civil war was committed to rapid economic development.
congress adopted policies that promoted economic growth and permanently altered the nations financial system.
with the south now unrepresented the lawmakers adopted policies long advocated by many northerners.
to spur agricultural development the homestead act offered 160 acres of free public land to settlers in the west.
it took effect on january 1 1863 the same day as the emancipation proclamation and like the proclamation tried to implement a vision of freedom.
by the 1930s h o w d i d t h e c i v i l wa r t r a n s f o r m t h e n a t i o n a l e c o n o m y a n d c r e a t e a s t r o n g e r n a t i o n s t a t e.
more than 400 000 families had acquired farms under its provisions.
in addition the land grant college act assisted the states in establishing agricultural and mechanic colleges building the transcontinental railroad congress also made huge grants of money and land for internal improvements including up to 100 million acres to the union pacific and central pacific two companies chartered in 1862 and charged with building a railroad from the missouri river to the pacific coast.
these were the first corporate charters issued by the federal government since the second bank of the united states in 1816.
when first proposed by entrepreneur asa whitney in 1846 the idea of a transcontinental railroad had been considered by congress too gigantic and entirely impracticable and indeed the project was monumental.
the central pacific progressed only twenty miles a year for the first three years of construction because the sierra nevada range was almost impassable.
it required some 20 000 men to lay the tracks across prairies and mountains a substantial number of them immigrant chinese contract laborers called coolies by many americans.
hundreds of chinese workers died blasting tunnels and building bridges through this treacherous terrain.
when it was completed in 1869 the transcontinental railroad which ran from omaha nebraska to san francisco expanded the national market facilitated the spread of settlement and investment in the west and heralded the doom of the plains indians.
the war and native americans one of lincolns first orders as president was to withdraw federal troops from the west so that they could protect washington d c recognizing that this would make it impossible for the army to keep white interlopers from intruding on indian land as treaties required it to do indian leaders begged lincoln to reverse this decision but to no avail.
inevitably conflict flared in the west between native americans and white settlers with disastrous results.
during the civil war the sioux killed hundreds of white farmers in minnesota before being subdued by the army.
after a military court sentenced more than 300 indians to death lincoln commuted the sentences of all but 38.
but their hanging in december 1862 remains the largest official execution in american history.
in 1864 a unit of colorado soldiers under the command of colonel john chivington attacked a village of cheyenne and arapaho indians at sand creek killing perhaps 400 men women and children.
the union army also launched a campaign against the navajo in the southwest destroying their orchards and sheep and forcing 8 000 people to move to a reservation set aside by the government.
the navajos long walk became as central to their historical experience as the trail of tears to the cherokee see chapter 10.
unlike the eastern indians however the navajo were eventually allowed to return to a portion of their lands.
ironically the confederacy although defending slavery treated native americans more fairly than the union.
the confederate constitution provided for indian tribes to elect representatives to congress and the davis c h.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 a union soldier stands guard over a group of indians during the navajos long walk in which the army removed them from their new mexico homeland to a reservation hundreds of miles away.
the second american revolution administration removed state jurisdiction over indian reservations allowing them complete self government.
some tribes that owned slaves like the cherokee sided with the confederacy.
after 1865 they were forced to cede much of their land to the federal government and to give some land to their former slaves the only slaveowners required to do so.
a new financial system the need to pay for the war produced dramatic changes in financial policy.
to raise money the government increased the tariff to unprecedented heights thus promoting the further growth of northern industry imposed new taxes on the production and consumption of goods and enacted the nations first income tax.
it also borrowed more than 2 billion by selling interest bearing bonds thus creating an immense national debt.
and it printed more than 400 million worth of paper money called greenbacks declared to be legal tender that is money that must be accepted for nearly all public and private payments and debts.
to rationalize the banking system congress established a system of nationally chartered banks which were required to purchase government bonds and were given the right to issue bank notes as currency.
a heavy tax drove money issued by state banks out of existence.
thus the united states whose money supply before the war was a chaotic mixture of paper notes issued by state and local banks now had essentially two kinds of national paper currency greenbacks printed directly by the federal government and notes issued by the new national banks.
along with profitable contracts to supply goods for the military effort wartime economic policies greatly benefited northern manufacturers railroad men and financiers.
numerous americans who would take the lead in reshaping the nations postwar economy created or consolidated their fortunes during the civil war among them iron and steel entrepreneur andrew carnegie oil magnate john d rockefeller financiers jay gould and j p morgan and philip d armour who earned millions supplying beef to the union army.
these and other captains of industry managed to h o w d i d t h e c i v i l wa r t r a n s f o r m t h e n a t i o n a l e c o n o m y a n d c r e a t e a s t r o n g e r n a t i o n s t a t e.
escape military service sometimes by purchasing exemptions or hiring substitutes as allowed by the draft law.
taken together the unions economic policies vastly increased the power and size of the federal government.
the federal budget for 1865 exceeded 1 billion nearly twenty times that of 1860.
with its new army of clerks tax collectors and other officials the government became the nations largest employer.
and while much of this expansion proved temporary the government would never return to its weak and fragmented condition of the prewar period.
women and the war for many northern women the conflict opened new doors of opportunity.
women took advantage of the wartime labor shortage to move into jobs in factories and into certain largely male professions particularly nursing.
the expansion of the activities of the national government opened new jobs for women as clerks in government offices.
many of these wartime gains were short lived but in white collar government jobs retail sales and nursing women found a permanent place in the workforce.
some northern women took a direct part in military campaigns.
clara barton a clerk in the patent office in washington d c when the war began traveled with the army of northern virginia helping to organize supply lines and nursing wounded soldiers.
barton worked alone rather than as a part of the department of female nurses and she never received compensation from the government.
hundreds of thousands of northern women took part in organizations that gathered money and medical supplies for soldiers and sent books clothing and food to freedmen.
the united states sanitary commission emerged as a centralized national relief agency to coordinate donations on the northern home front.
although control at the national level remained in male hands patriotic women did most of the grassroots work.
women played the leading role in organizing sanitary fairs filling cartridges at the u s arsenal of watertown massachusetts an engraving from harpers weekly september 21 1861.
both men and women were drawn to work in the booming war related industries of the north.

some accompanied their husbands and even brought their children.
grand bazaars that displayed military banners uniforms and other relics of the war and sold goods to raise money for soldiers aid.
new york citys three week fair of 1864 attracted a crowd of 30 000 and raised more than 1 million.
many men understood womens war work as an extension of their natural capacity for self sacrifice.
but the very act of volunteering to work in local soldiers aid societies brought many northern women into the public sphere and offered them a taste of independence.
the suffrage movement suspended operations during the war to devote itself to the union and emancipation.
but womens continuing lack of the vote seemed all the more humiliating as their involvement in war work increased.
from the ranks of this wartime mobilization came many of the leaders of the postwar movement for womens rights.
mary livermore the wife of a chicago minister for example toured military hospitals to assess their needs cared for injured and dying soldiers and organized two sanitary fairs.
she emerged from the war with a deep resentment of womens legal and political subordination and organized her states first woman suffrage convention.
women she had concluded must think and act for themselves after the war clara barton not only became an advocate of woman suffrage but as president of the american national red cross lobbied for the united states to endorse the first geneva convention of 1864 which mandated the humane treatment of battlefield casualties.
largely as a result of bartons efforts the senate ratified the convention in 1882.
subsequent geneva conventions in the twentieth century would deal with the treatment of prisoners of war and civilians during wartime.

the divided north despite lincolns political skills the war and his administrations policies divided northern society.
republicans labeled those opposed to the war copperheads after a poisonous snake that strikes without warning.
mounting casualties and rapid societal changes divided the north.
disaffection was strongest among the large southern born population of states like ohio indiana and illinois and working class catholic immigrants in eastern cities.
as the war progressed it heightened existing social tensions and created new ones.
the growing power of the federal government challenged traditional notions of local autonomy.
the unions draft law which allowed individuals to provide a substitute or buy their way out of the army caused widespread indignation.
workers resented manufacturers and financiers who reaped large profits while their own real incomes dwindled because of inflation.
the war witnessed the rebirth of the northern labor movement which organized numerous strikes for higher wages.
the prospect of a sweeping change in the status of blacks called forth a racist reaction in many parts of the north.
throughout the war the democratic party subjected lincolns policies to withering criticism although it remained divided between war democrats who supported the military effort while criticizing emancipation and the draft and those who favored immediate peace.
on occasion dissent degenerated into outright violence.
in july 1863 the introduction of the draft provoked four days of rioting in new york city.
the mob composed largely of irish immigrants assaulted symbols of the new order being created by the war draft offices the mansions of wealthy republicans industrial establishments and the citys black population many of whom fled to new jersey or took refuge in central park.
only the arrival of union troops quelled the uprising but not before more than 100 persons had died.
the riots in new york the mob lynching a negro in clarkson street an engraving from the british magazine illustrated london news august 8 1863 reveals how the new york city draft riots escalated from an attempt to obstruct the draft into an assault on the citys black population.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 the confederate nation t h e c o n f e d e r at e n at i o n leadership and government the man charged with the task of rallying public support for the confederacy proved unequal to the task.
born in 1808 in kentucky within eight months and 100 miles of lincolns birth jefferson davis had moved to mississippi as a youth attended west point and acquired a large plantation.
aloof stubborn and humorless he lacked lincolns common touch and political flexibility.
although known before the war as the cicero of the senate for his eloquent speeches davis unlike lincoln proved unable to communicate the wars meaning effectively to ordinary men and women.
moreover the confederacys lack of a party system proved to be a political liability.
like the founders of the american republic southern leaders saw parties as threats to national unity.
as a result davis lacked a counterpart to the well organized republican party which helped to mobilize support for the lincoln administration.
under davis the confederate nation became far more centralized than the old south had been.
the government raised armies from scratch took control of southern railroads and built manufacturing plants.
but it failed to find an effective way of utilizing the souths major economic resource cotton.
in the early part of the war the administration tried to suppress cotton production urging planters to grow food instead and banning cotton exports.
this it was hoped would promote economic self sufficiency and force great britain whose textile mills could not operate without southern cotton to intervene on the side of the confederacy.
the centrality of slavery to the confederacy is illustrated by the paper money issued by state governments and private banks which frequently juxtaposed scenes of slaves at work with other revered images.
the ten dollar note of the eastern bank of alabama depicts slaves working in the field and at a port along with an idealized portrait of southern white womanhood.
alabamas five dollar bill includes an overseer directing slaves in the field and a symbol of liberty.
how did the war effort and leadership problems affect the society and economy of the confederacy.
5 6 9 king cotton diplomacy turned out to be ineffective.
large crops in 1859 and 1860 had created a huge stockpile in english warehouses.
by the time distress hit the manufacturing districts in 1862 the government of prime minister palmerston had decided not to intervene partly because britain needed northern wheat almost as much as southern cotton.
but the confederate policy had far reaching global consequences.
recognizing their overdependence on southern cotton other nations moved to expand production.
britain promoted cultivation of the crop in egypt and india and russia did the same in parts of central asia.
as a result the resumption of american cotton production after the war led directly to a worldwide crisis of overproduction that drove down the price of cotton impoverishing farmers around the world.
nor did davis deal effectively with obstructionist governors like joseph e brown of georgia who denounced the confederate draft as a dangerous usurpation of states rights and individual liberty.
all in all davis was so inferior to lincoln as a wartime leader that one historian has suggested that had the north and south exchanged presidents the south would have won the war.
the inner civil war as the war progressed social change and internal turmoil engulfed much of the confederacy.
at the outset most white southerners rallied to the confederate cause.
no less fervently than northern troops southern soldiers spoke of their cause in the language of freedom.
we are fighting for our liberty wrote one volunteer without any sense of contradiction against tyrants of the north.
who are determined to destroy slavery but public disaffection eventually became an even more serious problem for the confederacy than for the union.
even as it waged a desperate struggle for independence the south found itself increasingly divided.
one grievance was the draft.
like the union the confederacy allowed individuals to provide a substitute.
because of the accelerating disintegration of slavery it also exempted one white male for every twenty slaves on a plantation thus releasing many overseers and planters sons from service.
the twenty negro provision convinced many yeomen that the struggle for southern independence had become a rich mans war and a poor mans fight economic problems economic deprivation also sparked disaffection.
as the blockade tightened areas of the confederacy came under union occupation and production by a drawing by langdon cheves iii the teenage grandson of a prominent south carolina political leader depicts a confederate killing a yankee officer.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 an engraving in the new york illustrated news depicts the bread riot that took place in mobile alabama in the fall of 1863.
the confederate nation slaves declined shortages arose of essential commodities such as salt corn and meat.
the war left countless farms plantations businesses and railroads in ruins.
the economic crisis which stood in glaring contrast to the norths boom was an unavoidable result of the war.
but confederate policies exaggerated its effects.
war requires sacrifice and civilian support for war depends in part on the belief that sacrifice is being fairly shared.
many non slaveholders however became convinced that they were bearing an unfair share of the wars burdens.
like the union the confederacy borrowed heavily to finance the war.
unlike federal lawmakers however the planter dominated confederate congress proved unwilling to levy heavy taxes that planters would have to pay.
it relied on paper money of which it issued 1 5 billion far more than the norths greenbacks.
congress also authorized military officers to seize farm goods to supply the army paying with increasingly worthless confederate money.
small farmers deeply resented this practice known as impressment the rebel army treated us a heap worse than union general william t sherman did a georgia farmer later recalled.
i had hogs and a mule and a horse and they took them all numerous yeoman families many of whom had gone to war to preserve their economic independence sank into poverty and debt.
food riots broke out in many places including richmond virginia and mobile alabama where in 1863 large crowds of women plundered army food supplies.
in 1862 joshua b moore a slaveholder in northern alabama commented on how slavery threatened the confederate war effort men who have no interest in it he wrote are not going to fight through a long war to save it never.
they will tire of it and quit as the war progressed desertion became what one officer called a crying evil for the southern armies.
by the wars end more than 100 000 men had deserted almost entirely from among the poorest class of nonslaveholders whose labor is indispensable to the daily support of their families men another official noted cannot be expected to fight for the government that permits their wives and children to starve southern unionists by 1864 organized peace movements had appeared in several southern states and secret societies such as the heroes of america were actively promoting disaffection.
confederate military tribunals imprisoned hundreds of unionists.
others were violently driven from their homes and a few were executed by the army or civilian authorities.
but southerners loyal to the union made a significant contribution to northern victory.
by the end of the war an estimated 50 000 white southerners had fought in the union armies.
how did the war effort and leadership problems affect the society and economy of the confederacy.
5 7 1 one of the most celebrated union heroes of the war was elizabeth van lew of richmond who had persuaded her mother to free the familys slaves when her father died in 1843.
during the war she frequently visited libby prison in the confederate capital bringing supplies to union prisoners of war and helping some of them to escape.
with the aid of mary elizabeth bowser a former slave of the van lew family who worked as a servant in the southern white house van lew passed information about confederate plans to union forces.
women and the confederacy even more than in the north the war placed unprecedented burdens on southern white women.
left alone on farms and plantations they were often forced to manage business affairs and discipline slaves previously the responsibility of men.
as in the north women mobilized to support soldiers in the field and stepped out of their traditional sphere to run commercial establishments and work in arms factories.
in richmond government girls staffed many of the clerkships in the new confederate bureaucracy.
rose greenhow the widow of a former american diplomat headed an espionage ring in washington d c that passed valuable information about union troop movements to the confederacy early in the war.
even after her arrest and jailing she managed to smuggle out intelligence until she was exiled to richmond in 1862.
jefferson davis rewarded greenhow with 2 500 for her services.
southern womens self sacrificing devotion to the cause became legendary.
but as the war went on and the death toll mounted increasing numbers of women came to believe that the goal of independence was not worth the cost.
the growing disaffection of southern white women conveyed in letters to loved ones at the front contributed to the decline in civilian morale and encouraged desertion from the army.
black soldiers for the confederacy the growing shortage of white manpower eventually led confederate authorities to a decision no one could have foreseen when the war began they authorized the arming of slaves to fight for the south.
as early as september 1863 a mississippi newspaper had argued for freeing and enlisting able bodied black men.
let them it wrote be declared free placed in the ranks and told to fight for their homes and country but many slaveholders fiercely resisted this idea and initially the confederate senate rejected it.
not until march 1865 after robert e lee had endorsed the plan did the confederate congress authorize the arming of slaves.
the war ended before the recruitment of black soldiers actually began.
but the confederate army did employ numerous blacks nearly all of them slaves as laborers.
this later led to some confusion over whether blacks actually fought for the confederacy apart from a handful who passed for white none in fact did.
but the souths decision to raise black troops illustrates how the war undermined not only slavery but also the proslavery ideology.
the day you make soldiers of them is the beginning of the end of the revolution declared howell cobb a georgia planter and politician.
if slaves make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong c h.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 turning points turning points gettysburg and vicksburg despite the accelerating demise of slavery and the decline of morale in the south the wars outcome remained very much in doubt for much of its third and fourth years.
in april 1863 fighting joe hooker who had succeeded ambrose e burnside as the union commander in the east brought the army of the potomac into central virginia to confront lee.
outnumbered two to one lee repelled hookers attack at chancellorsville although he lost his ablest lieutenant stonewall jackson mistakenly killed by fire from his own soldiers.
lee now gambled on another invasion of the north although his strategic objective remains unclear.
perhaps he believed a defeat on its own territory would destroy the morale of the northern army and public.
in any event the two armies with union soldiers now under the command of in july 1863 the union won major victories at gettysburg and vicksburg.

general george g meade met at gettysburg pennsylvania on the first three days of july 1863.
with 165 000 troops involved gettysburg remains the largest battle ever fought on the north american continent.
lee found himself in the unusual position of confronting entrenched union forces.
after two days of failing to dislodge them he decided to attack the center of the union line.
on july 3 confederate forces led by major general george e picketts crack division marched across an open field toward union forces.
withering artillery and rifle fire met the charge and most of picketts soldiers never reached union lines.
of the 14 000 men who made the advance the flower of lees army fewer than half returned.
later remembered as the high tide of the confederacy picketts charge was also lees greatest blunder.
his army retreated to virginia never again to set foot on northern soil.
on the same day that lee began his retreat from gettysburg the union achieved a significant victory in the west.
late in 1862 grant had moved into mississippi toward the city of vicksburg.
from its heights defended by miles of trenches and earthworks the confederacy commanded the central mississippi river.
when direct attacks failed as did an attempt to divert the river by digging a canal grant launched a siege.
on july 4 1863 vicksburg surrendered and with it john c pembertons army of 30 000 men a loss the confederacy could ill afford.
the entire mississippi valley now lay in union hands.
the simultaneous defeats at gettysburg and vicksburg dealt a heavy blow to southern morale.
today absolute ruin seems our portion one official wrote in his diary.
the confederacy totters to its destruction nearly two years however would pass before the war ended.
brought east to take command of union forces grant in 1864 began a war of attrition against lees army in virginia.
that is he was willing to accept high numbers of casualties knowing that the north could replace its manpower losses while the south could not.
grant understood that to bring the norths manpower advantage into play he must attack continuously all along the line thereby preventing the enemy from concentrating its forces or retreating to safety after an engagement.
in may 1864 the 115 000 man army of the potomac crossed the rapidan river to do battle with lees forces in virginia.
a month of the wars bloodiest fighting followed.
grant and lee first encountered each other in the wilderness a wild shrub covered region where one participant recalled it was as though christian men had turned to fiends and hell itself had usurped the place of earth grants army suffered 18 000 casualties while lees far smaller forces incurred 7 500.
previous union generals had broken off engagements after losses of this magnitude.
but grant continued to press forward attacking again at spotsylvania and then at cold harbor.
at the end of six weeks of fighting grants casualties stood at 60 000 almost the size of lees entire army while lee had lost 30 000 men.
the sustained fighting in virginia was a turning point in modern warfare.
with daily combat and a fearsome casualty toll it had far more in common with the trench warfare of world war i discussed in chapter 19 than the almost gentlemanly fighting with which the civil war began.

14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 rehearsals for reconstruction and the end of the war grant had become the only union general to maintain the initiative against lee but at a cost that led critics to label him a butcher of men victory still eluded him.
grant attempted to capture petersburg which controlled the railway link to richmond but lee got to petersburg first and grant settled in for a prolonged siege.
meanwhile general william t sherman who had moved his forces into georgia from tennessee encountered dogged resistance from confederate troops.
not until september 1864 did he finally enter atlanta seizing georgias main railroad center.
as casualty rolls mounted in the spring and summer of 1864 northern morale sank to its lowest point of the war.
lincoln for a time believed he would be unable to win reelection.
in may hoping to force lincoln to step aside radical republicans nominated john c frmont on a platform calling for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery federal protection of the freedmens rights and confiscation of the land of leading confederates.
the democratic candidate for president general george b mcclellan was hampered from the outset of the campaign by a platform calling for an immediate cease fire and peace conference a plan that even war weary northerners viewed as equivalent to surrender.
in the end frmont withdrew and buoyed by shermans capture of atlanta lincoln won a sweeping victory.
he captured every state but kentucky delaware and new jersey.
the result ensured that the war would continue until the confederacys defeat.
rehearsals for reconstruction a n d t h e e n d o f t h e wa r as the war drew toward a close and more and more parts of the confederacy came under union control federal authorities found themselves presiding over the transition from slavery to freedom.
in south carolina louisiana and other parts of the south debates took place over issues access to land control of labor and the new structure of political power that would reverberate in the postwar world.
the long abraham lincoln a little longer harpers weeklys comment on lincolns reelection in 1864.
at six feet four inches lincoln was the tallest american president.
sea island experiment the most famous rehearsal for reconstruction took place on the sea islands just off the coast of south carolina.
the war was only a few months old when in november 1861 the union navy occupied the islands.
nearly the entire white population fled leaving behind some 10 000 slaves.
the navy was soon followed by other northerners army officers treasury agents prospective investors in cotton land and a group known as gideons band which included black and white reformers and teachers committed to uplifting the freed slaves.
each of these groups in addition to the islands black population had its own view of how the transition to freedom should be organized.
and journalists reported every development on the islands to an eager reading public in the north.
convinced that education was the key to making self reliant productive citizens of the former slaves northern born teachers like charlotte forten a member of one of philadelphias most prominent black families and laura m towne a white native of pittsburgh devoted themselves to teaching the freed blacks.
towne who in 1862 helped to establish penn school on what were the most important wartime rehearsals for reconstruction.
diagram of plots selected by former slaves on port royal island south carolina january 25 1864.
taking advantage of a sale of abandoned property eighteen blacks seventeen men and one woman selected plots on a sea island plantation for purchase.
st helena island remained there as a teacher until her death in 1901.
like many of the gideonites towne and forten assumed that blacks needed outside guidance to appreciate freedom.
but they sympathized with the former slaves aspirations central to which was the desire for land.
other northerners however believed that the transition from slave to free labor meant not giving blacks land but enabling them to work for wages in more humane conditions than under slavery.
when the federal government put land on the islands up for sale most was acquired not by former slaves but by northern investors bent upon demonstrating the superiority of free wage labor and turning a tidy profit at the same time.
by 1865 the sea island experiment was widely held to be a success.
black families were working for wages acquiring education and enjoying better shelter and clothing and a more varied diet than under slavery.
but the experiment also bequeathed to postwar reconstruction the contentious issue of whether land ownership should accompany black freedom.
wartime reconstruction in the west a very different rehearsal for reconstruction involving a far larger area and population than the sea islands took place in louisiana and the mississippi valley.
after the capture of vicksburg the union army established regulations for plantation labor.
military authorities insisted that the emancipated slaves must sign labor contracts with plantation owners who took an oath of loyalty.
but unlike before the war they would be paid wages and provided with education physical punishment was prohibited and their families were safe from disruption by sale.
neither side was satisfied with the new labor system.
blacks resented having to resume working for whites and being forced to sign labor contracts.
planters complained that their workers were insubordinate.
without the whip they insisted discipline could not be enforced.
but only occasionally did army officers seek to implement a different vision of freedom.
at davis bend mississippi site of the cotton plantations of jefferson davis and his brother joseph general grant decided to establish a negro para teachers in the freedmens schools in norfolk 1863 a photograph of a group of black and white teachers who brought education to former slaves in a unionoccupied part of virginia.
14 a new birth of freedom the civil war 1861 1865 rehearsals for reconstruction and the end of the war dise here rather than being forced to labor for white owners the emancipated slaves saw the land divided among themselves.
in addition a system of government was established that allowed the former slaves to elect their own judges and sheriffs.
the politics of wartime reconstruction as the civil war progressed the future political status of african americans emerged as a key dividing line in public debates.
events in union occupied louisiana brought the issue to national attention.
hoping to establish a functioning civilian government in the state lincoln in 1863 announced his ten percent plan of reconstruction.
he essentially offered an amnesty and full restoration of rights including property except for slaves to nearly all white southerners who took an oath affirming loyalty to the union and support for emancipation.
when 10 percent of the voters of 1860 had taken the oath they could elect a new state government which would be required to abolish slavery.
lincolns plan offered no role to blacks in shaping the post slavery order.
his leniency toward southern whites seems to have been based on the assumption that many former slaveholders would come forward to accept his terms thus weakening the confederacy shortening the war and gaining white support for the ending of slavery.
another group now stepped onto the stage of politics the free blacks of new orleans who saw the union occupation as a golden opportunity to press for equality before the law and a role in government for themselves.
their complaints at being excluded under lincolns reconstruction plan won a sympathetic hearing from radical republicans in congress.
by the summer of 1864 dissatisfaction with events in louisiana helped to inspire the wade davis bill named for two leading republican members of congress.
this bill required a majority not one tenth of white male southerners to pledge support for the union before reconstruction could begin in any state and it guaranteed blacks equality before the law although not the right to vote.
the bill passed congress only to die when lincoln refused to sign it and congress adjourned.
as the war drew to a close it was clear that while slavery was dead no agreement existed as to what social and political system should take its place.
victory general william t sherman photographed in 1864.
at last after lincolns reelection the war hastened to its conclusion.
in november 1864 sherman and his army of 60 000 set out from atlanta on their march to the sea.
cutting a sixty mile wide swath through the heart of georgia they destroyed railroads buildings and all the food and supplies they could not use.
his aim sherman wrote was to whip the rebels to humble their pride to follow them to their innermost recesses and make them fear and dread us here was modern war in all its destructiveness even though few civilians were physically harmed.
in january 1865 after capturing savannah sherman moved into south carolina bringing even greater destruction.
anarchy reigned on the plantations as slaves drove off remaining overseers destroyed planters homes plundered smokehouses and storerooms and claimed the land for themselves.
what were the most important wartime rehearsals for reconstruction.
on january 31 1865 congress approved the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery throughout the entire union and in so doing introduced the word slavery into the constitution for the first time.
in march in his second inaugural address lincoln called for reconciliation with malice toward none with charity for all.

rehearsals for reconstruction and the end of the war unlike the northern clergy who were sure of what god intended lincoln suggested that man does not know gods will a remarkably modest statement on the eve of union victory.
perhaps lincoln suggested god had brought on the war to punish the entire nation not just the south for the sin of slavery.
and if god willed that the war continue until all the wealth created by 250 years of slave labor had been destroyed and every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword this too would be an act of justice see the appendix for the full text.
april 1865 brought some of the most momentous events in american history.
on april 2 grant finally broke through lees lines at petersburg forcing the army of northern virginia to abandon the city and leaving richmond defenseless.
the following day union soldiers occupied the southern capital.
at the head of one black army unit marched its chaplain garland h white a former fugitive from slavery.
called upon by a large crowd to make a speech white as he later recalled proclaimed for the first time in that city freedom to all mankind then the doors of all the slave pens were thrown open and thousands came out shouting and praising god and father or master abe on april 4 heedless of his own safety lincoln walked the streets of richmond accompanied only by a dozen sailors.
at every step he was besieged by former slaves some of whom fell on their knees before the embarrassed president who urged them to remain standing.
meanwhile lee and his army headed west only to be encircled by grants forces.
realizing that further resistance was useless lee surrendered at appomattox courthouse virginia on april 9.
although some confederate units remained in the field the civil war was over.
lincoln did not live to savor victory.
on april 11 in what proved to be his last speech he called publicly for the first time for limited black suffrage.
three days later while attending a performance at fords theatre in washington d c the president was mortally wounded by john wilkes booth one of the nations most celebrated actors.
lincoln died the next what were the most important wartime rehearsals for reconstruction.
a train carried the presidents body to its final resting place in illinois on a winding 1 600 mile journey that illustrated how tightly the railroad now bound the northern states.
grieving crowds lined the train route and solemn processions carried the presidents body to lie in state in major cities so that mourners could pay their respects.
it was estimated that 300 000 persons passed by the coffin in philadelphia 500 000 in new york and 200 000 in chicago.
on may 4 1865 lincoln was laid to rest in springfield.
the war and the world in 1877 soon after retiring as president ulysses s grant embarked with his wife on a two year tour of the world.
at almost every location he was greeted as a modern day hero.
what did america in the aftermath of the civil war represent to the world.
in england the son of the duke of wellington greeted grant as a military genius the primary architect of victory in one of the greatest wars in human history and a fitting successor to his own father the general who had vanquished napoleon.
in newcastle parading english workers hailed him as the man whose military prowess had saved the worlds leading experiment in democratic government and as a hero of freedom whose commander in chief abraham lincoln had vindicated the principles of free labor by emancipating americas slaves.
in berlin otto von bismarck the chancellor of germany welcomed grant as a nation builder who had accomplished on the battlefield something national unity that bismarck was attempting to create for his own people.
you had to save the union bismarck commented just as we had to save germany the ruins of richmond in an 1865 photograph by alexander gardner.

war in american suggested reading history the civil war laid the foundation for modern america guaranteeing the unions permanence destroying slavery and shifting power in the nation from the south to the north and more specifically from slaveowning planters to northern capitalists.
it dramatically increased the power of the federal government and accelerated the modernization of the northern economy.
and it placed on the postwar agenda the challenge of defining and protecting african american freedom.
paradoxically both sides lost something they had gone to war to defend.
slavery was the cornerstone of the confederacy but the war led inexorably to slaverys destruction.
in the north the war hastened the transformation of lincolns america the world of free labor of the small shop and independent farmer into an industrial giant.
americans in the words of the abolitionist wendell phillips would never again.
see the republic in which we were born late in may 1865 a little over a month after lincolns death some 200 000 veterans paraded through washington d c for the grand review of the union armies a final celebration of the nations triumph.
the scene inspired the poet bret harte to imagine a very different parade a phantom army of the union dead the martyred heroes of malvern hill of gettysburg and chancellorsville the men whose wasted figures fill the patriot graves of the nation.
and marching beside the others came the dusky martyrs of pillows fight.
to harte the wars meaning ultimately lay in the sacrifices of individual soldiers.
he included in his reverie the black troops including those massacred at fort pillow.

l o n the evening of january 12 1865 less than a month after union forces captured savannah georgia twenty leaders of the citys black community gathered for a discussion with general william t sherman and secretary of war edwin m stanton.
mostly baptist and methodist ministers the group included several men who within a few years would assume prominent positions during the era of reconstruction that followed the civil war.
ulysses s houston pastor of the citys third african baptist church and james porter an episcopal religious leader who had operated a secret school for black children before the war in a few years would win election to the georgia legislature.
james d lynch who had been born free in baltimore and educated in new hampshire went on to serve as secretary of state of mississippi.
the conversation revealed that the black leaders brought out of slavery a clear definition of freedom.
asked what he understood by slavery garrison frazier a baptist minister chosen as the groups spokesman responded that it meant one persons receiving by irresistible power the work of another man and not by his consent freedom he defined as placing us where we could reap the fruit of our own labor and take care of ourselves the way to accomplish this was to have land and turn it and till it by our own labor frazier insisted that blacks possessed sufficient intelligence to maintain themselves in freedom and enjoy the equal protection of the laws.
shermans meeting with the black leaders foreshadowed some of the radical changes that would take place during the era known as reconstruction meaning literally the rebuilding of the shattered nation.
in the years following the civil war former slaves and their white allies north and south would seek to redefine the meaning and boundaries of american freedom.
previously an entitlement of whites freedom would be expanded to include black americans.
the laws and constitution would be rewritten to guarantee african americans for the first time in the nations history recognition as citizens and equality before the law.
black men would be granted the right to vote ushering in a period of interracial democracy throughout the south.
black schools churches and other institutions would flourish laying the foundation for the modern african american community.
many of the advances of reconstruction would prove temporary swept away during a campaign of violence in the south and the norths retreat from the ideal of equality.
but reconstruction laid the foundation for future struggles to extend freedom to all americans.
all this however lay in the future in january 1865.
four days after the meeting sherman responded to the black delegation by issuing special field order 15.
this set aside the sea islands and a large area along the south carolina and georgia coasts for the settlement of black families on what visions of freedom did the former slaves and slaveholders pursue in the postwar south.
forty acre plots of land.
he also offered them broken down mules that the army could no longer use.
in shermans order lay the origins of the phrase forty acres and a mule that would reverberate across the south in the next few years.
by june some 40 000 freed slaves had been settled on sherman land among the emancipated slaves shermans order raised hopes that the end of slavery would be accompanied by the economic independence that they like other americans believed essential to genuine freedom.
the meaning of freedom with the end of the civil war declared an illinois congressman in 1865 the united states was a new nation for the first time wholly free the destruction of slavery however made the definition of freedom the central question on the nations agenda.
what is freedom asked congressman james a garfield in 1865.
is it the bare privilege of not being chained.
if this is all then freedom is a bitter mockery a cruel delusion did freedom mean simply the absence of slavery or did it imply other rights for the former slaves and if so which ones equal civil rights the vote ownership of property.
during reconstruction freedom became a terrain of conflict its substance open to different often contradictory interpretations.
out of the conflict over the meaning of freedom arose new kinds of relations between black and white southerners and a new definition of the rights of all americans.
blacks and the meaning of freedom african americans understanding of freedom was shaped by their experiences as slaves and their observation of the free society around them.
to begin with freedom meant escaping the numerous injustices of slavery punishment by the lash the separation of families denial of access to education the sexual exploitation of black women by their owners and sharing in the rights and opportunities of american citizens.
if i cannot do like a white man henry adams an emancipated slave in louisiana told his former master in 1865 i am not free blacks relished the opportunity to demonstrate their liberation from the regulations significant and trivial associated with slavery.
they openly held mass meetings and religious services free of white supervision and they acquired dogs guns and liquor all barred to them under slavery.
no longer required to obtain a pass from their owners to travel former slaves throughout the south left the plantations in search of better jobs family members or simply a taste of personal liberty.
many moved to southern towns and cities where it seemed freedom was free er family record a lithograph marketed to former slaves after the civil war centers on an idealized portrait of a middle class black family with scenes of slavery and freedom.
