hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 the civil war began in 1861 as a conflict over whether southern states possessed the right to secede from the union.
but when lincolns emancipation proclamation took effect on january 1 1863 it became a war against slavery.
the soldiers depicted in this joyous scene were among the nearly 200 000 african american soldiers who contributed to the union armys successful campaign to defeat the confederacy.
in february 1865 a few weeks after the second anniversary of the emancipation proclamation the popular magazine harpers weekly published this drawing entrance of the fifty fifth massachusetts colored regiment into charleston feb 21 1865 the image reflected not merely a growing acceptance of slaverys demise among northerners but also the celebration of emancipation as a noble cause along with restoration of the union that helped the north justify the terrible human cost of the war.
emancipation was but one of the many extraordinary aspects of the civil war that make it the most written about event in american history.
the war pitted american against american in some cases brother against brother.
senator john j crittenden of kentucky for example saw two sons become generals one confederate and the other union.
mary todd lincoln the presidents wife lost three brothers who fought for the confederacy.
the civil war was also an unusually bloody war.
the 618 000 americans who died in the four years of conflict far outnumber the 117 000 lost in world war i and the 417 000 in world war ii.
the war also brought to the fore larger than life personalities such as generals william tecumseh sherman ulysses s grant robert e lee and thomas stonewall jackson and it produced moments of heroism that would become the stuff of legend.
if these aspects of the war explain its popularity as a historical subject they also indicate why the civil war has generated such heated debate.
for generations americans have argued over the true cause of the war and why the north won or as some like to put it why the south lost.
they have debated the significance and wisdom of crucial decisions such as lees move to attack the north in 1863 or union general george meades failure to pursue the weakened confederates after gettysburg.
yet for all this debate few commentators dispute this fact the civil war brought profound social political and economic change to the united states.
most also agree that although the war ended the contentious question of slavery it immediately raised equally challenging questions about racial equality.
war for the destruction of liberty must be met by war for the destruction of slavery african american leader frederick douglass chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 mobilization strategy and diplomacy neither the north nor south envisioned the character and course of the war that began with the souths firing on fort sumter in april 1861.
both sides had to hastily mobilize recruit train and outfit modern armies.
the north possessed overwhelming advantages in population and industry but the south enjoyed superior military leadership a white population largely united against invading union armies and a hope that france or britain would intervene in the conflict on their behalf.
comparative advantages and disadvantages as north and south prepared for war both sides believed they would win decisively.
journalist horace greeley spoke for many northerners when he boasted of the president of the confederate states of america and his administration that jeff davis and co will be swinging from the battlements at washington at least by the 4th of july on paper this confidence seemed justified.
as the table 13 1 illustrates the northern states possessed more than twice the population of the confederacy giving the north an enormous advantage in soldiers farmers and industrial workers.
the north also possessed a vast industrial system nine times greater than that of the confederacy.
producing 97 percent of the nations firearms 94 percent of its cloth and 90 percent of its shoes and boots this system could union confederacy population 22 000 000 5 500 000 white 3 500 000 enslaved industrial workers 1 300 000 110 000 110 000 18 000 1 5 billion 155 million 22 000 9 000 97 3 330 000 000 27 000 000 factories value goods manufactured v railroad mileage weapons manufacturing percent u s total banking capital 13 1 union advantages on the eve of war 1861 the enormous disparities between north and south suggested to many a quick union victory.
but many factors beyond these statistics notably superior confederate military leadership would make for a long and bloody war.
what significant advantages did the north hold over the south on the eve of war.
provide the union armies with unlimited supplies.
the north also had a modern railroad system twice the size of the confederacys and it was far more integrated.
a final advantage was the firm belief among many northern soldiers that they were fighting to uphold the constitution and the union.
this sentiment was stoked by a profusion of speeches songs and printed matter like the poster the eagles nest 13 2 extolling the union cause.
demonizing secession as treason by invoking the famous 1830 declaration of president andrew jackson a southerner and slave owner the union.
it must and shall be preserved it also draws on familiar images of patriotism such as the bald eagle and the american flag.
many northerners believed they were indebted to the founding fathers whose sacrifices won american independence and established a republic where all possessed equal opportunity to succeed.
southerners likewise sought to boost their wartime morale.
as the song sheet secession quick step 13 3 shows they often drew on the same patriotic images and themes as northerners.
this song and the accompanying image seek to connect the colonists break from britain during the american revolution with the souths quest for confederate independence.
note the reference to minute men the dont tread on me snake a popular image of colonial resistance to british authority in the 1770s see chapter 4.
southerners also matched northerners in their confidence about achieving a quick victory.
just throw three or four shells among those blue bellied yankees boasted one north carolinian and theyll scatter like sheep confederates were keenly aware that although they lacked population industry and infrastructure they possessed certain advantages.
to begin with they hear the audio battle hymn of the republic mobilization strategy and diplomacy 13 2 the eagles nest northerners promoted patriotic sentiment in speeches songs and printed matter.
this poster the eagles nest linked the union cause to familiar images such as the bald eagle and the flag.
were fighting a war for independence that carried with it a sense of destiny that would sustain them through the difficult times ahead just as it had sustained they reminded themselves the overmatched colonists in their fight for independence from a superior great britain nearly a century earlier.
the south also enjoyed an important geographic advantage to deny confederate independence the north had to conquer the south an area as large as western europe.
furthermore this monumental invasion and occupation would likely unify the south including poor whites who might otherwise view the conflict as a war to protect the interests of slaveholders.
the south could thus fight a defensive war until the north grew tired of the conflict and withdrew or until a european power most likely britain which depended heavily on southern cotton intervened militarily and forced the north to let the states secede.
finally whether they knew it or not in april 1861 southerners had the upper hand in military leadership.
for the first half of the war generals such as robert e lee and thomas stonewall jackson would stymie much larger and better equipped northern armies led by inept generals.
mobilization in the north 13 3 connecting to the colonial cause as in the north southerners fostered unity emphasizing the connection between the colonists revolt against british rule during the american revolution and the confederate bid for southern independence.
mobilization of the union army began days after the firing at fort sumter with lincolns call for 75 000 volunteers for 90 days service and the imposition of a naval blockade along the southern coast.
eager volunteers jammed recruiting stations convinced the union would win quickly and with little loss of life.
among those who clamored to join the army were thousands of free african americans anxious to defeat the slaveholding south.
yet they were turned away because of an overabundance of white volunteers and lincolns desire to sidestep issues of slavery and race to avoid provoking the slaveholding states that remained in the union kentucky maryland delaware and missouri from seceding.
why did southerners seek to link secession to the american revolution.
chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 unfortunately for lincoln the union armys enthusiasm was no substitute for experience.
in 1861 there were only 16 000 professional soldiers in the army most of them stationed in the west.
one third of the armys officers joined the confederacy.
of those officers who remained few possessed any real combat experience.
to make matters worse because state officials named the officers to command the new regiments of volunteers they invariably chose men whose chief qualifications were their political connections and fondness for parading.
one regiment the 11th new york volunteer infantry was perhaps the most vivid example of this phenomenon.
as this print 13 4 shows these volunteers donned flashy uniforms patterned after the zouaves frances famous regiments in algeria replete with red silk pantaloons and green jackets.
the new york zouaves enjoyed great celebrity at the wars outset and one of them colonel elmer ephraim ellsworth at right became the unions first martyr when he was killed pulling down a confederate flag in virginia.
despite their stylishness however the 11th new york zouaves performed disastrously at bull 13 4 the zouaves of the 11th new york many regiments raised to fight for the union and the confederacy included inexperienced men whose romantic visions of warfare were expressed in their fanciful uniforms.
how did the doctrine of states rights hinder the southern war effort.
as the war progressed both armies replaced special regimental uniforms with union blue and confederate gray.
mobilization in the south unlike the north the confederacy needed to create an army from scratch.
immediately after seceding southern states revived reorganized and expanded their militias many of which were more like social clubs than military units.
in march 1861 the confederate congress established an army of 100 000 volunteers for one year terms of service leading to the merging of most state militia companies into the confederate army.
to thwart the unions intended blockade of the southern coastline the confederacy commenced creating a navy and authorizing privateers to seize union ships.
equipping their soldiers and sailors proved a far greater challenge.
lacking the industrial base of the north the south built arms factories that eventually turned out some 350 000 rifles.
they also imported 700 000 more.
nonetheless throughout the war confederate soldiers often needed to scavenge battlefields to find weapons and ammunition.
the confederate effort to thwart the union blockade was similarly hampered by a lack of shipyards.
the davis administration also had to pay for the war.
possessing few banks and limited reserves of gold and silver the government tried several schemes including requiring individual states to pay for the war and imposing an income tax.
when none of these policies worked the confederate government simply printed paper money.
with more than 1 billion in circulation by 1864 twice the amount issued in the north the citizens of the confederacy faced punishing inflation which reached 9 000 percent by 1865 as compared with 80 percent in the union.
another obstacle to confederate victory was the souths popular doctrine of states rights.
it envisioned the ideal national government as one that left most power and authority to the states.
even though the confederacy ultimately managed to overcome states rights opposition and create a centralized national government and military its efforts were hindered by vociferous critics.
governors zebulon b vance of north carolina and joseph e brown of georgia for example opposed the incorporation of their state militias into the confederate army.
later when the confederacy enacted a military draft they raised a loud protest and created hundreds of exemptions for friends and state officials.

what made the border states so economically and militarily valuable to the confederacy.
chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 wartime diplomacy davis hoped to gain from britain and france diplomatic recognition for the confederacy and perhaps even military intervention.
he knew the leaders and aristocracy of both countries sympathized with the confederate cause and that their economies depended heavily on southern cotton.
accordingly davis sent emissaries to britain and france to lobby for recognition.
to increase the chances of foreign intervention the confederacy in 1861 also established a cotton embargo a ban on the export of cotton the souths most valuable commodity.
because the confederacy wanted to avoid any appearance of blackmailing cotton importing nations like britain and france the embargo was voluntary and unofficial.
although the embargo damaged the southern economy confederates believed it a worthwhile risk if it caused enough economic pain in britain and france to in the words of one charleston newspaper editor bring about either the bankruptcy of every cotton factory in great britain or france or the acknowledgement of our independence keenly aware that foreign intervention would likely demolish his goal of restoring the union lincoln dispatched his own emissaries to britain and france.
shortly after fort sumter both nations seeking to avoid war declared their neutrality and agreed to honor the union blockade.
this was crucial to the north because had britain or france insisted on their right as neutrals to trade with the south lincoln would have been forced either to stop their ships a policy certain to draw them into the war or allow them to pass and thereby provide the confederacy with badly needed supplies.
despite diplomatic efforts conflict with britain soon erupted threatening british neutrality.
in november 1861 a u s warship stopped the british ship trent and removed two confederates heading for europe to press for foreign recognition.
as indicated in this cartoon 13 6 from the british magazine punch britain reacted with outrage to the trent affair putting its military forces on alert.
you do what is right britannia warns a bellicose but smaller america or ill blow you out of the water lincoln determined to avoid war released the two confederates claiming that the captain had acted without authority.
the roles were reversed in 1863 when the british government faced with a union threat of war prevented delivery to the confederacy of two ironclad warships built in a british shipyard.
a diplomatic dust up jack bull great britain threatens uncle sam in the wake of the trent affair an incident that nearly prompted the british to intervene in the war.
why did lincoln decide to back down and release the confederates in the trent affair.
the early campaigns 1861 1863 the early campaigns 1861 1863 beginning with bull run in july 1861 the confederacy won repeated victories in virginia thwarting union attempts to seize richmond the confederate capital.
the union found success in the west and moved closer to securing control of the mississippi river.
by 1862 new technologies in communications transportation and armaments made warfare more complex protracted and deadly.
the war also assumed a revolutionary character as slaves flocked to invading union armies eventually convincing the lincoln administration to embrace emancipation as a goal of the war.
no short and bloodless war in the weeks following fort sumter pressure mounted in both the north and south for a decisive victory despite the disorganized state of their armies.
although some argued that given the souths limited resources its best chance of victory lay with a defensive military posture most southerners wanted their army to take the offensive believing that one or two early victories would bring foreign intervention or prompt lincoln to abandon efforts to restore the union by force.
northern leaders faced similar demands.
general winfield scott had devised a grand strategy called the anaconda plan to slowly envelop and strangle the south but popular sentiment demanded an immediate strike to crush the rebellion.
the anticipated first clash the first battle of bull run came in mid july 1861.
general irwin mcdowell led 30 000 union soldiers of the army of the potomac south toward the town of manassas virginia site of an important railroad junction and a small confederate force commanded by general p g t beauregard.
hundreds of curious and confident spectators from washington d c followed the army many with picnic baskets in hand hoping to witness some of the excitement.
beauregard positioned his army above manassas on the south side of a small stream named bull run.
on july 21 mcdowell attacked and nearly drove the confederates from the field.
beauregard however stabilized his troops and with reinforcements staged a counterassault.
lines of exhausted and undisciplined union soldiers soon disintegrated into a chaotic humiliating retreat to washington.
victory boosted confederate spirits and confirmed their belief that one southerner could whip ten yankees.
for the north the stunning humiliation demolished the notion of a short and bloodless war.
within a week of the debacle lincoln authorized the enlistment of one million volunteers for three year terms of service.
to rebuild the demoralized army of the potomac lincoln turned to general george b mcclellan.
dubbed the young napoleon by the press mcclellan was an impressive but arrogant man who treated lincoln with barely disguised contempt.
lincoln tolerated this disrespect because mcclellan inspired professionalism among his troops and by the spring of 1862 had transformed a mass of inexperienced volunteers into a well trained army numbering some 150 000.

i almost think that were i to win some small success now i could become dictator or anything else that might please me gen george b mcclellan to his wife 1861 as the army of the potomac regrouped union forces in the west gained two desperately needed victories.
as indicated in the map 13 7 on page 382 in february 1862 union forces led by a virtual unknown named ulysses s grant seized forts henry and donelson.
the twin victories gave the union control of vital communication and transportation routes on the tennessee and cumberland rivers and drove the confederates out of kentucky and most of tennessee.
they also created an early hero ulysses s grant whose initials the press suggested stood for unconditional surrender grant continued south along the tennessee river to seize more railroad lines as part of the read the document joseph e johnston a confederate general assesses first bull run 1861 why did the first battle of bull run take place before either army was adequately prepared.

the confederacy suffered another setback that same month when david g farraguts union why did the peninsular campaign fail.
the peninsular campaign lincoln welcomed the successes in the west but recognized that defeat of the confederacy required victory over its armies in northern virginia.
accordingly he pressed mcclellan to begin an offensive early in 1862.
despite his gallant martial image however mcclellan seemed unwilling to fight claiming his troops were not yet prepared.
only after weeks of goading did he agree to begin an offensive.
the peninsular campaign as his plan was known reflected mcclellans flamboyant style.
rather than a direct overland march on richmond he designed a complex plan whereby 400 ships deposited 120 000 soldiers on a long peninsula just east of richmond at fortress monroe between the james and york rivers 13 8.
to lincolns frustration it took three weeks for the soldiers to get in place.
then mcclellan continued to delay.
the confederates exploited mcclellans delays by sending 17 000 men under general thomas stonewall jackson into the shenandoah valley.
there between early may and june he defeated larger union forces raising fears that he would capture washington.
concerned for the capitals security lincoln withheld a large force of 30 000 that was scheduled to join mcclellan.
when mcclellan finally began to inch his army toward richmond in late may he confronted confederate general joseph e johnston in the battle of fair oaks from may 31 to june 1 1862.
although technically a union victory since johnston failed to dislodge mcclellans army the battle proved inconclusive.
yet it was a turning point in the war because johnston severely injured was replaced by general robert e lee.
lee proved a brilliant commander and strategist who made the most of the confederacys limited resources to bedevil and defeat much larger union forces.
often this meant taking the offensive as in the seven days battle june 25 july 1 1862.
lee attacked with 85 000 troops against mcclellans 110 000 and forced the union commander to retreat to a secure location on the james river.
the week long clash produced staggering carnage but mcclellan lost proportionately fewer men than lee and his army lay just 25 miles from richmond.

soldiers also suffered from bad norfolk food and from disease that raged in the 50 km camps and claimed three lives for every one lost in actual combat.
50 miles boredom disease and hardship although difficult to endure were not new to military life.

its adoption during the civil war contributed to the high death toll in combat.

the key technological breakthrough for the rifle was the minie ball invented in france in the 1840s.
as these photographs 13 9 show the conical shaped minie ball left replaced round musket balls right and were the forerunners of the bullet.
the grooves inside the rifle barrel caused the minie ball when fired to spiral much like a football increasing its accuracy.
other aspects of modern war included the emphasis on destroying the enemys army rather than merely seizing and holding territory and a willingness to inflict suffering on the civilian population.
military commanders on both sides however were slow to adjust to these changes.
schooled in traditional warfare at military academies such as west point most were reluctant to abandon the strategy of attacking entrenched enemy positions with massed infantry.
when defenders of these positions turned their modern weaponry on charging soldiers the results were horrific.
toward emancipation along with modern technology slavery also shaped the civil war.
at the outset of the conflict moderates like lincoln insisted the goal of the war was to preserve the union not to abolish slavery.
they realized that while many northerners opposed slavery they also rejected the idea of racial equality.
they also feared that talk of emancipation would cause the border states to secede and alienate pro union residents of the south who lincoln hoped would overthrow confederate rule and return their states to the union.
abolitionists however argued that because the southern states seceded to protect slavery reunion could occur only after it was destroyed.
but while white northerners debated emancipation enslaved african americans in the south how did lincoln expect the emancipation proclamation to benefit the union war effort.
took matters into their own hands by fleeing to union army lines.
only weeks after the war began in may 1861 an angry virginia slaveholder demanded the union army observe the terms of the 1850 fugitive slave act and return his three escaped slaves.
general benjamin butler refused declaring fugitive slaves contraband of war or seized property.
the lincoln administration endorsed the contraband policy as a shrewd war tactic likely to cause havoc in the south.
self emancipating slaves continued to arrive at union army camps in ever growing numbers totaling close to one million by the wars end see images as history who freed the slaves.
in response to these events congress slowly began the process of dismantling slavery.
in august 1861 the first confiscation act declared free any slaves used in the confederate war effort.
a second confiscation act in july 1862 empowered the army to seize and render forever free the slaves of anyone aiding the confederacy.
that same month congress authorized the president to let african americans fight in the union army.
these measures demonstrated a growing understanding among northerners that winning the war required the abolition of slavery.
the threat to slavery posed by these actions was not lost on southerners who feared not only the loss of their slaves but also a large scale slave insurrection.
slave escapes rumors of slave revolts and the increased insubordination of many slaves led to rising anxiety among southerners.
they accordingly stepped up slave patrols and scrutinized slave behavior for any sign of ill intent.
lincoln gradually came to see emancipation not merely as inevitable but as essential for union victory since it would strike at the heart of the rebellion and prevent british intervention.
on july 22 1862 he informed the cabinet of his intent to issue a decree of emancipation.
but to avoid the appearance of acting in desperation lincoln waited for a union victory before issuing this decree.
the union victory came two months later in mid september at the battle of antietam in maryland.
lee choosing to wage a bold offensive led his army north into maryland.
mcclellan even after acquiring a copy of the confederate battle plan reacted slowly allowing lee to consolidate his troops.
finally on september 17 1862 mcclellan attacked lees army.
after squandering several chances to defeat lee mcclellans forces were eventually stymied by the last minute arrival of confederate reinforcements.
the next day view the closer look lincoln visits mcclellan the early campaigns 1861 1863 images as history who freed the slaves.
why did abraham lincoln decide to issue the emancipation proclamation in 1862 after stating many many times that he had no intention of abolishing slavery.
there were several reasons not the least of which was that one year into the war the confederacy seemed as strong as ever.
lincoln decided that attacking slavery would hasten the end of the war.
but there is another often overlooked reason for lincoln to change and decide to embrace abolition from the moment the war began thousands of slaves began to flee to freedom often to the camps of union soldiers.
this wave of selfemancipation vividly captured in this 1867 painting by theodor kaufmann on to liberty forced the lincoln administration to formulate wartime policies regarding slavery a process that ultimately led to emancipation.
but even as kaufmann and others celebrated african americans role in their own liberation white americans after the war began to present a different and inaccurate version of the story see chapter 14.
former slaves raised most of the money to pay for the freedmens memorial that was unveiled in 1876 in washington d c.
but they were excluded from the committee in charge of the monuments design.
as a result the monument celebrated president lincoln as the sole individual responsible for emancipation while depicting african americans as passive figures who played no role at all in gaining their freedom.
kaufmann contrasts the darkness of slavery which the escapees are fleeing with the bright light of freedom they are moving toward.
unlike most images of african americans in this period kaufmann portrays these women as dignified and courageous agents pursuing freedom for their families.
this smoke is emanating from a battle between union and confederate armies.
long before the emancipation proclamation slaves came to believe that the union army somehow represented their liberation.
so they headed to union lines despite the danger.
by presenting lincoln as standing over the kneeling slave the sculptor emphasizes his and by extension all white peoples superiority over african americans.
note how there are no white people in kaufmanns scene of liberation.
these two children are reluctant to keep moving ahead probably because of the gunfire from the battle in the distance.
the chained slave kneels in a submissive passive position that suggests that african americans were merely receiving freedom rather than playing a key role in seizing it by self emancipating on a mass scale as depicted in kaufmanns painting.
holding the emancipation proclamation in his right hand while outstretching his left lincoln appears like a biblical prophet or even like christ bestowing a blessing upon a sinner.
how did the actions of slaves push lincoln toward emancipation.
chapter 13 13 10 dead soldiers along the sunken road antietam 1862 the civil war was the first military conflict in american history captured by the relatively new medium of photography.
photographs such as this one taken by alexander gardner after the battle of antietam brought home to millions of americans the brutality of modern war.
a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 mcclellan chose not to attack despite superior numbers and the shattered condition of lees army.
the following day lee led his army back into virginia handing mcclellan a technical victory a frustrated lincoln however soon removed him from command.
the battle as indicated by the grim scene 13 10 of its aftermath captured by photographer alexander gardner claimed 6 000 lives and left 17 000 wounded making it the deadliest single day of the war.
shortly after antietam in september 1862 lincoln issued his preliminary emancipation proclamation.
unless the seceded states and parts thereof that were not under union army control returned to the union by january 1 1863 the decree warned their slaves shall be then thenceforward and forever free even though the decree left slavery intact in the border states and areas held by the union army lincoln knew conservatives northern democrats and border state unionists would react negatively and that republicans might suffer at the polls that november.
still he reasoned the benefits of emancipation far outweighed the risks as it would cause chaos by encouraging slaves to flee their masters and make it highly unlikely that britain where anti slavery sentiment was strong would intervene in the conflict.
why did photography have a more powerful impact on the public than artists depictions of battles.
though some radicals and abolitionists expressed dismay because the proclamation freed slaves only in the seceded states they recognized that lincolns simple terse statement of military policy had transformed the meaning of the conflict.
if northerners by late 1862 realized the war was no mere insurrection they also understood that its goal was something greater than simply a restored union.
it was now a war of subjugation.
reunion would occur only after the fabric of southern society was destroyed.
slaughter and stalemate restoring the union and abolishing slavery of course depended entirely on victory in the field.
but the army of the potomac now commanded by general ambrose e burnside suffered a devastating defeat at the battle of fredericksburg on december 13 1862.
burnside tried one more offensive on january 22 1863 a disastrous mid winter effort that became mired in muddy impassible roads.
a despondent lincoln replaced burnside with general joseph hooker.
not all the news from the union battlefields in late 1862 was negative.
on december 31 union troops under general william s rosecrans turned back an attempt by confederate general braxton bragg to regain western tennessee and kentucky in the battle of murfreesboro.
braggs retreat left the west firmly in the hands of the union army for the rest of the war.
lee and his army of northern virginia however continued to thwart the union effort to take richmond.
in the battle of chancellorsville april 30 may 6 1863 despite commanding a force half the size of hookers lee scored a smashing victory.
but it came at a price stonewall jackson the man lee had come to count on most was killed accidentally by his own men.
view the closer look images as history photography and the visualization of modern war behind the lines behind the lines the war brought challenges and hardships to the union and confederate home fronts.
civilians faced shortages of goods soaring inflation and conscription.
these conditions were more severe in the south where many civilians also came under union military rule.
these problems coupled with mounting death tolls led to sagging morale and rising criticism of political leaders in both regions.
occasionally discontent exploded into violent riots.
the war placed an especially great demand on women who assumed new occupational and civic roles.
meeting the demands of modern war while war raged in the east and west republicans took advantage of their dominant position in congress to enact legislation long opposed by southerners.
most were policies to promote industrialization a high tariff and westward settlement the homestead and pacific railway acts.
several laws however were part of an unprecedented effort to outfit and finance a modern army.
the national bank acts of 1863 and 1864 established a national banking system whereby member banks could issue treasury notes or greenbacks as currency.
the nations first income tax the sale of 400 million in bonds to the public and the borrowing of 2 6 billion from banks helped pay for the war.
the cost of the war increased the federal budget twenty fold during the war from 63 million in 1861 to 1 3 billion in 1865.
all told the war effort greatly expanded the size and scope of the federal government.
in contrast to the unions ability to sustain the war effort davis and other confederate leaders soon discovered that there were limits to southerners willingness to adapt to the demands of modern warfare.
in response to the need for more soldiers and revenue the confederate congress established a military draft and an income tax in april 1862.
officials across the confederacy denounced the measures as gross violations of states rights.
among the loudest protestors was alexander stephens daviss own vice president.
southerners evaded both the draft and income tax to such an extent that neither measure produced the needed men or money.
draft and tax evasion also occurred on a large scale in the north to be sure but greater supplies of men and money diminished their impact.
these limits were compounded by president davis.
despite his extensive political and military experience he proved an ineffective leader for a time of crisis.
unlike lincoln he selected a weak cabinet to prevent challenges to his authority and bristled at the slightest disagreement.
he also micromanaged the war department firing or driving to resignation five secretaries of war in four years.
the confederate armys success in the wars first two years obscured daviss flaws but as the armys fortunes declined after 1862 the presidents leadership style sparked rancor and disunity.
hardships on the home front while soldiers fought in the field civilians in the north and south faced a number of hardships.
in the north the arms metalworking boot making and shipbuilding industries boomed but the scarcity of cotton caused widespread layoffs and closures in the textile industry.
workers wages rose by 40 percent but prices rose even faster as inflation averaged 15 percent annually.
in response many workers formed and joined craft unions but appeals to patriotism and the use of strikebreakers discouraged strikes.
southerners faced far worse economic problems.
the southern economy was hard hit by the cessation of trade with the north and europe due to the union blockade.
southern industry and agriculture were hindered by chronic labor shortages due to military service and by the flight of slaves and the destruction or seizure of farms and factories by union armies.
as a result the production of goods and agricultural produce in the south decreased by 30 percent during the war.
by contrast northern output increased significantly.
these conditions led to shortages of nearly everything in the south how did the union fund the war.
chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 including food and the emergence of a thriving black market.
the cartoon 13 11 from a richmond newspaper captured the anger among southerners directed at speculators and black marketers.

new roles for women the war changed the lives of millions of women who remained behind the lines in both the north and south.
with hundreds of thousands of men gone to war women assumed new roles running farms and shops and working in factories and offices.
many did so out of a sense of duty to the war effort whereas others worked to earn badly needed income as military pay was low and inflation pushed up the cost of living.
13 11 anger on the home front runaway inflation and scarcity of necessities sparked angry accusations that speculators were hoarding supplies and selling them at extortionate prices.
here a speculator counts his profits while a starving mother and child look on.
what new opportunities did the war open up for women.
the war also enabled women to enter previously male dominated professions such as teaching civil service and nursing.
in nursing the shortage of men and the recruitment efforts by women like dorothea dix head of the u s sanitary commission led to thousands of women volunteering to serve as nurses in field hospitals despite opposition from male doctors and others who disapproved of women working in such indelicate situations.
supporters argued that women brought to the profession nurturing and domestic skills.
as clara barton civil war nurse and future founder of the american red cross put it at the end of the war the american woman was at least fifty years in advance of the normal position which continued peace would have assigned her over the next 30 years women took over almost completely the profession of nursing.
many women also joined organizations that actively supported the union cause such as the womens central association of relief whose 7 000 chapters across the north raised money and sent supplies to the soldiers in the field.
southern women experienced similar changes during the war.
they took on new responsibilities such as running farms and plantations managing stores working in government and serving as nurses.
many worked in factories including more than 500 employed by the confederate ordnance department to fill cartridges dangerous work that killed dozens in explosions.
their jobs grew more demanding as the war demolished the southern economy and sent food prices soaring.
the union armys sweep across the south in late 1864 and early 1865 left many southern women and their children destitute and hungry.

many slaves who did not flee took advantage of a planters absence and challenged the authority of women unaccustomed to the role of master.
as one exasperated wife wrote to her husband the negroes are all expecting to be set free very soon and it causes them to be very troublesome copperheads one group that benefitted from the hard times in the north was the democratic party.
even though many northerners associated it with secession and the confederacy it remained a viable political power in the north during the war.
after all it had received 44 percent of the popular vote there in 1860.
many democrats supported the war against secession but copperheads or peace democrats argued for a cease fire followed by a negotiated peace settlement even if it resulted in an independent confederacy.
a few copperheads even expressed support for the confederacy.
lincoln viewed the opposition of copperheads to the union war effort as seditious if not treasonous and took steps early to squelch it.
after the pro confederate rioting in baltimore in 1861 he suspended habeas corpus citing the section of the constitution providing the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it in so doing lincoln established a principle he followed for the rest of the war.
to save the union and the constitution he would not hesitate to suppress constitutional guarantees of free speech and the right to a speedy trial.
over the next few years thousands of copperheads were jailed for lengthy periods without trial.
copperheads initially attracted few followers but dissatisfaction with the war rose in the winter of 1862 1863 after repeated union army failures and the enactment of the controversial emancipation proclamation and military draft.
led by former ohio congressman clement vallandigham copperheads denounced lincoln as a tyrant who abused his power and suppressed free speech by shutting down opposition newspapers and arresting people who voiced hostility toward the union war effort or sympathy for the confederacy.
copperheads gained support among farmers in the west by claiming the new republican tariff hurt them economically and among urban workers and immigrants by stoking racial fears that emancipation would lead to social chaos and job competition.
to counter rising copperhead sentiment pro union speakers editors and cartoonists vilified copperheads as dangerous disloyal men who threatened the union.
in february 1863 harpers weekly printed the cartoon shown in competing visions civil liberties in a civil war see page 390.
the cartoonist shows the goddess liberty who is bearing a shield labeled constitution and a drawn sword being prevented from engaging in battle against the confederacy by three peace democrats depicted as copperhead snakes.
to squelch copperhead activism the lincoln administration stepped up arrests.
on may 5 1863 a union army commander in ohio arrested vallandigham after he delivered a speech denouncing the war and the draft.
conscription and civil unrest despite the lincoln administrations crackdown on copperhead dissent opposition to the war among northerners increased in 1863 especially among those expected to fight.
the poor performance of the union army in the field coupled with staggering numbers of killed and wounded extinguished much of the early enthusiasm for war.
despite offers of cash bonuses and time off in exchange for reenlistment union soldiers were heading home as their enlistment terms expired and recruitment offices now went begging for new recruits.
to solve the manpower problem in march 1863 congress passed the conscription act which declared all male citizens and immigrants who had applied for citizenship aged 20 45 eligible for draft into the army.
each state was assigned a quota of men.

chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 competing visions civil liberties in a civil war the following opinions present opposing views on the constitutionality of lincolns policy toward copperheads.
one is a series of resolutions adopted and sent to lincoln by democrats.
the other is lincolns formal response.
note what the parties define as the greatest threat to civil liberties and the constitution.
were lincolns actions justified.
are principles such as civil liberties subject to different treatment during a national crisis such as war.
on may 19 1863 a meeting of democrats including former congressman erastus corning in albany new york passed and delivered to lincoln a series of resolutions accusing the administration of having acted unconstitutionally in placing military authority over civil authority.
resolved we denounce the recent assumption of a military commander to seize and try a citizen of ohio clement l vallandigham for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course of the administration and in condemnation of the military orders of that general.
resolved that this assumption of power by a military tribunal if successfully asserted not only abrogates the right of the people to assemble and discuss the affairs of government the liberty of speech and of the press the right of trial by jury the law of evidence and the privilege of habeas corpus but it strikes a fatal blow at the supremacy of law and the authority of the state and federal constitutions.
resolved that regarding the blow struck at a citizen of ohio as aimed at the rights of every citizen of the north we denounce it as against the spirit of our laws and constitution and most earnestly call upon the president of the united states to reverse the action of the military tribunal which has passed a cruel and unusual punishment upon the party arrested prohibited in terms by the constitution and to restore him to the liberty of which he has been deprived.
on june 12 1863 lincoln defended his actions as both constitutional and necessary for the preservation of the union.
gentlemen ours is a clear flagrant and gigantic case of rebellion and the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it is the provision which specially applies to our present case mr vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on the part of the union and his arrest was made because he was laboring with some effect to prevent the raising of troops to encourage desertions from the army and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it.
he was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal interests of the commanding general but because he was damaging the army upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends.
he was warring upon the military and this gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him.
long experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death must i shoot a simple minded soldier boy who deserts while i must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert.
i think that in such a case to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional but withal a great mercy.
i am un able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting in albany that the american people will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the right of public discussion the liberty of speech and the press the law of evidence trial by jury and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite peaceful future any more than i am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life.
northern unionists depicted copperheads as traitors who threatened the republic.
here liberty defends herself from the copperheads with the shield of union.
how did lincoln justify the suspension of habeas corpus.
behind the lines 300 to the government or hire a substitute to serve in his place.
men lacking such substantial sums of money 300 was equivalent to a years pay for a common laborer could simply disappear which more than 20 percent of draftees did.
the draft began in early july and touched off widespread protest.
disturbances broke out in boston troy new york wooster ohio portsmouth new hampshire and other cities.
opposition to the draft was greatest in new york city where on july 13 1863 it erupted in unprecedented violence known as the draft riots.
for four days mobs of mostly poor immigrant and working class rioters attacked draft offices union army recruiting stations institutions associated with the republican party or abolition and symbols of wealth and privilege reflecting animosity toward the inequity that allowed the rich to pay a 300 fee to avoid the draft.
rioters also attacked african americans.
as the image 13 12 illustrates they lynched at least eighteen.
rioters blamed blacks as the cause of the war and feared them as potential labor competition.
the riots resulted in at least 119 deaths and 5 million in property damage.
officials eventually defused opposition to the draft by raising money to pay the 300 commutation fee or hire substitutes for draftees not willing to join the army and allowing easy exemptions for reasons of health or family considerations.
discontent and unrest also rocked the confederate home front.
in october 1862 the confederate congress passed what came to be known as the twenty negro law it exempted from the draft one white man per plantation that held 20 or more slaves.
supporters argued that the measure was vital to maintaining order and productivity on plantations but to poor white southerners it engendered levels of anger and protest similar to those evoked by the commutation provisions in the north.
many cited the law as the reason they deserted from the confederate army.
another source of discontent was the shortage of food brought about by drought the blockade and union conquest of southern territory.
when shortages and high prices reached critical proportions in 1863 southern women led food riots in several towns and cities including most dramatically in richmond.
bread they cried our children are starving while the rich roll in wealth the reference to the rich reflected the widespread belief that confederate leaders and merchants were profiting from the war.
read the document testimony from victims of new yorks draft riots july 1863 13 12 opposition to the draft turns violent poor new yorkers rioted against the draft in july 1863 venting their anger on army recruiting stations and against african americans whom they blamed for the war.
why did new yorkers riot against the draft.
chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 toward union victory despite many setbacks by mid 1863 the norths superior industrial strength large population and improved military leadership gave the union the advantage.
so too did the decision to allow african americans to serve in the army for they provided the union with badly needed manpower when enlistments were declining.
victories at gettysburg vicksburg and atlanta boosted morale in the north and led to lincolns reelection in 1864.
relentless military offensives by grant in virginia and william t sherman in georgia led to the confederate surrender in april 1865.
the assassination of president lincoln however dampened the norths joy.
turning point 1863 although the destruction and antiwar sentiment in new york city shocked lincoln events elsewhere in 1863 gave him hope.
back in may lee had convinced davis to approve another invasion of the north.
it was risky but they believed it might force lincoln to pull troops out of the western theater where grant was threatening to seize the entire lower mississippi.
a victory on northern soil would also demoralize the lincoln administration and strengthen the copperheads and peace democrats who were calling for a negotiated settlement.
it might even convince france or britain to intervene.
in june lee headed north through virginias shenandoah valley into maryland and pennsylvania.
although slow to react the army of the potomac now under general george g meade eventually caught up with lee in central pennsylvania.
on july 1 the two armies collided at gettysburg a small town at the junction of several major roads.
although outnumbered 90 000 to 75 000 the confederates made significant advances that day.
the following day the battles momentum swung back and forth before union forces pushed the confederates back to the previous days position.
on the third and decisive day lee recklessly ordered an all out assault on the fortified union center.
picketts charge as it became known proved gallant but suicidal.
union forces devastated general george picketts 12 000 men as they tried to cross a mile of open field and ascend cemetery ridge.
pickets division just seemed to melt away recalled one witness.
nothing but stragglers came back with 23 000 union and 28 000 confederate soldiers killed and wounded gettysburg was by far the bloodiest battle of the war.
why did lee decide to invade the north a second time.
the next day july 4 having lost one third of his men lee retreated back toward virginia.
although frustrated that meade failed to pursue lincoln nonetheless recognized that the union had won a major victory.
gettysburg marked the last time the confederate army invaded the north.
that same day lincoln received news of a vital victory in the west.
in may grant had begun a siege of vicksburg the confederacys last stronghold on the mississippi river.
it fell on july 4 severing the confederacy in two and giving the union control over the entire mississippi.
african americans under arms but the union army was still far from ultimate victory.
one of the most formidable challenges it faced was finding new recruits.
declining enlistments of whites and lobbying by black leaders and abolitionists eventually convinced union officials to form african american regiments.
thousands of free african american men already toiled for the union army moving supplies and building fortifications now they would have the chance to fight to defeat the confederacy and end slavery.
one of the first and the most famous of all the african american regiments was the 54th massachusetts organized in 1863 by leading black abolitionists.
i urge you to fly to arms and smite with death the power that would bury the government and your liberty in the same hopeless grave read a recruitment pamphlet written by frederick douglass.
among the regiments members were two of douglasss sons lewis and charles and the grandson of sojourner truth james caldwell.
colonel robert gould shaw son of a leading white massachusetts abolitionist family commanded the regiment.
read the document abraham lincoln gettysburg address 1863 toward union victory african american soldiers experienced many forms of racism within the union army.
they served in strictly segregated units under white officers and as this drawing 13 13 indicates initially served mainly in noncombat duty as guards and laborers.
many also charged that they received substandard medical care compared to white soldiers.
most galling as seen in choices and consequences equal peril unequal pay page 394 was that african american soldiers received lower pay than white soldiers.
african american soldiers also faced brutal treatment at the hands of confederates when captured.
the davis administration announced that african american soldiers taken prisoner would be subject to execution as rebellious slaves.
lincolns threat of retaliation prevented the confederacy from carrying out this policy on a wide scale but african americans were murdered tortured and mutilated.
in the most egregious incident 13 14 on page 395 the fort pillow massacre in tennessee confederate troops murdered dozens of captured black soldiers in april 1864.
this image which ran in a popular northern magazine depicted confederates as brutal and inhumane.
southern publications ran similar images that alleged northern atrocities.
the creation of all black units in the union army raised another critical issue beyond the question of equality of pay or the assignment of white officers to lead them.
would these units be sent into actual combat.
racist notions led whites to question whether african americans possessed the courage to fight.
others cautioned that if black 13 13 held back by racism believing african americans lacked the courage to fight under fire union commanders initially relegated them to noncombat roles.
eventually however blacks fought in 449 battles including the battle of millikens bend on june 7 1863 center.
we have dyed the ground with blood in defense of the union and democracy.
we have done a soldiers duty.
why cant we have a soldiers pay letter of corporal james henry gooding of 54th massachusetts to president lincoln september 1863 how were african american soldiers treated in the union army.
chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 choices and consequences equal peril unequal pay at first the war department planned to pay african american soldiers the same 13 per month plus 3 50 for clothes as white soldiers.
indeed as the recruitment poster below shows many early black recruits received equal pay.
but in june 1863 the lincoln administration fearing a backlash among white soldiers who did not see african americans as their equals adopted a two tier wage scale that paid black soldiers just 7 per month plus 3 for clothes.
outraged african american officers and enlisted men of the 54th and 55th massachusetts colored infantry pondered their options.
choices quietly accept the lower wages as a regrettable but unavoidable trade off that allowed them to enlist in the union army and fight to end slavery.
accept the unequal wages as better than nothing and necessary to maintain their families while protesting the injustice and lobbying for equal pay.
reject the lower wages on principle despite the financial hardship on their families while fulfilling their duties as soldiers protesting the injustice and lobbying for equal pay.
lay down their arms and refuse to obey orders until they received equal pay.
decision the men chose the third option rejecting the lower wages on principle despite the financial hardship on their families.
they even rejected an offer by the governor of massachusetts to pay the 6 per month difference out of the state treasury citing the principle of equality that was at stake.
meanwhile they fulfilled their duties as soldiers protested the injustice and lobbied the lincoln administration for equal pay.
consequences the soldiers and their families hung on for more than a year until congress in june 1864 authorized an equal pay scale for all soldiers regardless of race.
by then given the well documented professionalism and courage exhibited by black soldiers on the battlefield the distinction in pay had become an embarrassment to lincolns administration.
not all black regiments however made the same decision as the massachusetts 54th and 55th and the consequences of their actions were starkly different.
sergeant william walker of the 21st u s.
colored infantry had his men lay down their arms in protest over unequal pay.
he was convicted of mutiny and executed.
continuing controversies how were african americans in the military treated after the civil war.
the u s army eradicated the two tier pay scale but not racial segregation.
african american leaders protested segregation but for all subsequent wars through world war ii black soldiers and sailors served in segregated units under mostly white officers.
president harry truman ordered the military desegregated in 1948.
what role did african american soldiers play in the union war effort.
read the document james henry gooding letter to president lincoln 1863 toward union victory regiments were not used judiciously critics would accuse the army of racism asserting it carelessly sent them into harms way.
the first well publicized test of african american soldiers came on july 18 1863 when the 54th massachusetts led a nighttime assault on fort wagner a key confederate outpost that guarded charleston harbor.
the confederates repulsed their attack.
but the courage exhibited by the soldiers the unit lost 100 dead and 146 were wounded won them universal praise and undermined the racist belief that blacks would not fight.
all told 198 000 blacks including 144 000 former slaves served in the union army and navy.
this number amounted to 10 percent of the total enlisted men even though african americans comprised only 1 percent of the northern population.
african american soldiers participated in over 449 separate engagements against confederate troops and 38 000 died during the war.
sixteen black soldiers and four black sailors received the medal of honor.
the colored soldiers in this four years struggle wrote one african american soldier have proven themselves in every respect to be men their contribution to the union war effort proved vital to winning the war.
most significant african american service in the war empowered them to claim full citizenship after the war.
once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters u s let him get an eagle on his button and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket said frederick douglass there is no power on earth that can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship the confederacy begins to crumble news of the losses at gettysburg and vicksburg caused dismay across the south.
moreover davis and the confederate leadership had other reasons to worry.
the immediate problem was a lack of men.
a draft instituted in april 1862 failed to attract enough recruits.
protests by poor whites forced the revision in 1863 of a provision in the draft law that exempted wealthy whites who held 20 or more slaves but still new recruits fell short of the number needed.
the continued loss of territory to the union army exacerbated this trend as did a sharp rise in desertions which topped 100 000 by late 1864.
see envisioning evidence human resources in the armies of the civil war.
read the document letter from a free black volunteer to the christian recorder 13 14 the massacre at fort pillow in april 1864 confederate soldiers slaughtered dozens of captured african american soldiers at fort pillow in tennessee.
why did lincoln initially agree to pay african american soldiers less than white soldiers.
chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 envisioning evidence human resources in the armies of the civil war at the outset of the civil war the union possessed roughly two and a half times the population of the confederacy 23 million vs 9 million.
this advantage translated into an immediate and lasting military advantage as it allowed the union to field a much larger army and navy throughout the course of the war.
indeed as the data below shows this manpower advantage increased over the course of the four year conflict in part because of the lincoln administrations decision to allow african americans to serve in the military and the confederacys resistance to this idea until the last weeks of the war.
the union also enjoyed a much larger and steadily increasing population of immigrants from which to draw fresh recruits.
had the war lasted two or three years these differences in manpower might not have had played such an important role in determining its outcome.
but it lasted four years and it was in the last one that the manpower disparity became most pronounced and significant in determining the final outcome.
relative military strength 1862 1865 698 808 the unions advantage in population 2 5 times greater than the confederacy is reflected in its ability to field a much larger army throughout the war.
527 204 number of soldiers thousands because the confederacy largely fought a defensive war it did not need to match the union soldier for soldier in order to win.
253 208 620 924 611 250 the surging number of union troops in 1863 reflected the imposition of the draft and the decision to allow african americans into the army.
desertions caused much of the decline in confederate forces as many as 100 000 deserted in 1864 1865.
confederate leaders in 1864 responded by expanding the age range of men eligible for the draft to 17 to 50 from 18 to 35 in 1862.
both sides suffered huge numbers of casualties in the fierce fighting of 1864.
but the union was able to replace its fallen soldiers far more easily than the confederacy.

african americans as a percentage of military personnel southerners claimed the union relied heavily on immigrants for its army.
but it was the confederacy that drew proportionally more soldiers from its foreign born population.
immigrants comprised 7 5 percent of the souths population but 10 percent of the confederate army.
in the union immigrants made up 31 percent of the population but comprised just 26 percent of its soldiers.
foreign born as a percentage of overall regional population percentage of foreignborn of total military personnel percent confederate sources james mcpherson ordeal by fire new york knopf 1982 james mcpherson battle cry of freedom new york oxford university press 1988 u s census historical statistics.
how did the unions 2 1 advantage over the confederacy in overall population play a role in winning the war.
union toward union victory by mid 1863 the inherent weaknesses of the confederate economy began to show.
the union blockade which had stopped only one in eight confederate ships in 1862 grew increasingly effective.
by 1864 it stopped one out of every three confederate blockade runners and half of them by 1865.
the impact on the import dependent southern economy was devastating.
civilians and soldiers alike suffered shortages of food clothing and equipment.
the growing success of the union blockade also exposed a critical miscalculation made by the davis administration in 1861.
the embargo on cotton exports failed because britain possessed a surplus of cotton in 1861 and later found alternative sources in egypt and india.
moreover english workers including an estimated half million who lost their jobs due to cotton shortages expressed strong sympathy for the union and thereby made british intervention on behalf of the confederacy politically controversial.
when the south finally lifted the embargo in 1862 the union blockade was much stronger.
the confederacys economic dilemma posed a serious threat to its chances for success.
it desperately needed hard currency to buy ships weapons ammunition and other supplies for the war.
but the main product it had to sell cotton was bottled up in southern ports unable to reach markets in europe.
this conundrum is captured in the image 13 15 that adorned cotton bonds authorized for sale by the confederacy in europe.
a southern version of columbia holds the confederate flag and leans on cotton bales while looking out to sea at a patrolling union ship.
in exchange for cash usually 90 percent of face value investors were promised payment in southern cotton with interest.
the plan brought in the state of despondency that now prevails among our people is producing a bad effect upon the troops.
desertions are becoming very frequent robert e lee february 24 1865 only 7 million to the confederate treasury far less than needed.
the emancipation proclamation also shook southern society as lincoln had hoped it would.
inspired by word that freedom was at hand thousands of slaves left their places of bondage and headed for the union army or to the northern states exacerbating the confederacys labor shortage and further weakening southern agriculture.
despite these hardships the confederacy remained undefeated and the longer confederates defended their independence the greater their chances of success.
for even as the union won major victories at gettysburg and vicksburg discontent and war weariness among northerners grew.
if lincoln hoped to preserve the union he needed more military victories and soon.
victory in battle and at the polls the key to winning the war lincoln realized was effective military leadership.
after suffering many disappointments and near disasters with a succession of poor generals lincoln finally found his man 13 15 cotton for sale.

chapter 13 a nation torn apart the civil war 1861 1865 in ulysses s grant who at the end of 1863 delivered yet another badly needed victory for the union at the battle of chattanooga.
on november 23 grant and the general he increasingly counted on william t sherman drove braxton braggs army from tennessee into georgia putting most of eastern tennessee and the vital tennessee river under union control.
already cut in two after the fall of vicksburg the confederates now faced being sliced into thirds.
their main hope was that northerner dissatisfaction with the war might lead to lincolns defeat in the election of 1864 or at least force him to accept peace negotiations.
in early 1864 lincoln named grant commander of all the union armies.
many in the war department objected arguing that the rough hewn soldier who had left the army in disgrace in 1854 for heavy drinking was an alcoholic who could not be entrusted with a major assignment.
but lincoln had had enough of generals with impressive rsums and martial airs.
kentucky om ac 20 km saw in grant a commander who understood the key to victory in modern warfare seek out and destroy the enemys army and sources of supplies.
pursuing this policy with single minded determination grant in 1864 devised a two pronged attack to finish off the confederacy.
as shown in the map 13 16 he sent the army of the potomac now swollen to nearly 120 000 south to destroy lees army of 66 000 and take richmond.
in the west grant sent general william t sherman a man who shared his understanding of modern warfare and an army of 90 000 east from tennessee to destroy general joseph e johnstons force of 60 000 and seize atlanta 13 17.
the first clash of this campaign the battle of the wilderness began with lee attacking grant on may 5.
over the next two days aided by the rough wooded terrain and sluggish union leadership the confederates survived the clash despite grants vastly superior numbers.

normally after so great an engagement union commanders spent weeks if not months repairing their armies.
but the next day grant ordered his army to move against lee.
possessing total confidence in his strategy he also knew that unlike lee he could replace his fallen soldiers.
on may 8 the two armies clashed again ten miles closer to richmond in the battle of spotsylvania court house an epic struggle that left another 30 000 casualties between the two armies.
still grant remained resolute driving the union army southward trying to draw lee out for a final decisive battle.
lee maneuvered his army between grant and richmond playing for time and avoiding total defeat.
on june 3 at cold harbor grant again ordered a massive assault against lees smaller but heavily entrenched force.
the result was the greatest loss of life since fredericksburg.
many northerners appalled at the 55 000 union casualties to 30 000 confederate in a single month questioned grants competence others simply called him a butcher.
peace democrats renewed their calls for an end to the conflict.
altering his strategy grant marched his army south to seize the vital railroad junction at petersburg and cut richmond off from the rest of the confederacy.
but lee managed to dig in around petersburg just before grant arrived.
by now grant recognized the futility of staging frontal assaults against entrenched troops and settled down for a siege.
it was not the aggressive form of warfare he preferred but the fall of petersburg and richmond seemed only a matter of time.
rising popular dissatisfaction with the seemingly endless bloodshed in summer 1864 however imperiled lincolns chances for reelection davis was serving a six year term.
democrats tried to capitalize on the dour mood by nominating former union general george b mcclellan for president and calling for a cease fire and peace conference.
they also hoped mcclellans outspoken criticism of emancipation would draw votes from racist northerners.
the republican party recognized its vulnerability it had lost many seats in the 1862 congressional elections and tried to broaden its appeal heading into the 1864 election.
first republicans adopted the name union hear the audio when this cruel war is over party to attract pro war democrats.
second they replaced lincolns vice president with andrew johnson of tennessee a pro union democrat and the only southern senator not to resign during the secession winter of 1861.
finally as this campaign broadside 13 18 illustrates lincolns campaign argued that a vote for mcclellan was a vote for slavery and military defeat.
while lincoln shakes hands with an artisan representing the free labor north mcclellan shakes hands with jefferson davis who stands beneath the flag of an independent confederate nation with a slave auction taking place in the background.
behind lincoln white and black children enjoy the benefits of freedom and education.
as late as august 1864 however lincoln and many of his supporters expected to lose.
in september 1864 however lincoln received news that sherman had captured atlanta.
this crushing blow all but doomed the confederacy to collapse.
it also boosted morale across the north and weakened the democrats peace strategy.
two months later lincoln soundly defeated mcclellan winning every state except for kentucky new jersey and delaware to garner 55 percent of the popular vote.
still his margin of victory just ten percent demonstrated just how essential military success was to political victory.
war is hell six weeks after lincoln won reelection sherman began to march his army across georgia see 13 17 to deprive the confederate army of 13 18 lincoln promises victory and union lincolns 1864 presidential campaign suggested that while he stood for liberty his opponent democrat george b mcclellan would make peace with the confederates and preserve slavery.

known as shermans march to the sea the scorched earth campaign traversed 285 miles of georgia.
shermans soldiers lived off the land taking what agricultural produce and livestock they needed and destroying the rest.
they also destroyed southern infrastructure tearing up railroad tracks burning bridges and pulling down telegraph wires to impair the confederacys ability to move goods soldiers and information.
shermans army also enticed thousands of slaves to flock to its camps.
by the time it reached the coast shermans campaign of destruction left the confederate army bereft of a major source of supplies.
more important the campaign demonstrated the effectiveness of a tactic that would become central to modern warfare in the twentieth century bringing the conflict to the civilian population to undermine its willingness to support the war.
we are not only fighting hostile armies sherman told his men but a hostile people and we must make old and young why did sherman destroy so much property in georgia.
rich and poor feel the hand of war as well as their organized armies sherman compounded the horror felt by georgians with his policy toward the states freed slaves.
after meeting with secretary of war edwin stanton and 20 african american ministers to discuss the fate of the freed slaves sherman issued special field order no.
this directive set aside more than 400 000 acres of seized confederate land for distribution to former slaves in 40 acre plots.
congress soon followed with the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery everywhere in the united states it would be ratified 11 months later.
with georgia in ashes the stage was set for the final phase of grants plan crushing lees army between his and shermans forces.
on february 1 sherman left savannah and headed north into south carolina.
he faced almost no opposition a sign southern resistance was disintegrating.
as this photograph 13 19 indicates fire destroyed more than half of columbia the capital of south carolina.
evacuating confederates and liberated slaves set some of the fires but some were also started by union soldiers motivated by vengeance against the state that for decades leading up to the war represented southern nationalism and ultimately toward union victory secession.
shermans men kept moving north into north carolina where the meager opposition provided by general joseph e johnstons force slowed him only slightly.
as the situation grew critical for the confederacy its leaders tried desperate measures.
among them were secret peace negotiations held in february 1865 at hampton roads virginia which failed union representatives insisted on unconditional surrender with the suggested possibility of compensated emancipation while their southern counterparts demanded recognition of confederate independence.
confederate officials also began drafting soldiers as young as 17 and as old as 50.
the depth of confederate desperation was revealed in march 1865 when the confederate congress authorized a draft of up to 300 000 slaves to serve as soldiers only two regiments were raised and neither saw combat.
if slaves make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong confederate major general howell cobb georgia by now grants nearly nine month long siege of lees army at petersburg began to take its toll.
cut off from supplies lees men were starving.
thousands had deserted.
on april 1 in the battle of five forks general philip sheridans cavalry and a large force of infantry cut the only remaining railroad line into petersburg.
when grant attacked all along the confederate line the next day he forced lee to retreat from both richmond and petersburg.
lees remaining hope was to slip his ragged army west and south to join forces with johnston in north carolina.
to prevent this sheridans cavalry headed them off at a small town named appomattox courthouse virginia.
on april 8 lee made one last attempt to break out but failed.
there is nothing left for me to do he sadly informed his officers and i would rather die a thousand deaths the next day april 9 1865 lee surrendered.

the 30 000 men in lees army were permitted to go home providing they swore never again to take up arms against the federal government.
grant also ordered they be given three days rations of food and stopped his men from firing their weapons in victory celebration.
celebrations broke out across the north as people weary of four years of war reveled in both the victory and the peace.
the exultation quickly changed to despair.
on the night of april 14 just five days after lees surrender confederate sympathizer john wilkes booth shot lincoln at close range as he watched a play at fords theatre in washington.
lincoln died early the following day.
the tragedy elicited an outpouring of grief for the martyred president among northerners and freed slaves in the south.
after a somber funeral procession in washington a train carried lincolns body back to springfield illinois past some seven million people who lined the tracks.
lincolns counterpart jefferson davis who had fled hoping to establish a new confederate government in texas was captured on may 10 and cast in prison.
as this image 13 20 shows the popular anger over the war and lincolns assassination focused on davis with many northerners demanding his execution for treason.
passions cooled however and davis was released after two years without being tried.
after lees surrender the war came to a rapid conclusion.
on april 26 sherman accepted johnstons surrender in north carolina.
others followed suit with the last confederate units laying down their arms on june 23.
with that the bloodiest war in american history one that cost 618 000 lives was over.

the seizure of vast tracts of land from mexico in 1848 ushered in a period of intense conflict between the north and the south over whether to permit slavery in the territories west of the mississippi.
at the root of these tensions were the starkly different paths of economic and social development being pursued in the two regions.
the south prospered in the 1840s and 1850s by expanding its agrarian slave labor economy the north by becoming more urban industrial commercial and multicultural.
in the process the two regions developed divergent visions of the ideal society the south celebrated the virtues of slavery states rights and white supremacy while the north touted the benefits of free labor upward mobility and equal opportunity.
one of the first and most bitter controversies of the period emerged with the passage of the fugitive slave act in 1850 a law requiring northerners to assist southerners in the apprehension of escaped slaves.
it produced almost immediately a series of sensational incidents in which abolitionists tried with some success to thwart the law and spirit escaped slaves to freedom.
drawn by an abolitionist in the midst of this controversy this image seeks to humanize the plight of escaped slaves while at the same time dramatizing the inhumanity of slave catchers and slaveholders.
the quotations from the bible thou shalt not deliver unto the master his servant which has escaped from his master unto thee and the declaration of independence we hold that all men are created equal highlight the fundamental claim of abolitionists that slavery violated both judeo christian morality and republican principles.
southern slaveholders of course rejected these claims and asserted their inalienable right to property in all things including slaves.
this controversy set the tone for a decade that was to be rocked by a series of political legal and economic disputes that ultimately led back to the slavery question.
by the mid 1850s each region increasingly came to see the others system as a threat.
northerners became convinced that southerners wanted to spread slavery to the west and even to the north while southerners believed northerners sought to destroy slavery and the southern way of life.
when republican abraham lincoln won the presidency in 1860 southerners declared the union dissolved setting in motion events that led to a far more bloody conflict the civil war.
it is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces and it means that the united states must and will sooner or later become either entirely a slaveholding nation or entirely a free labor nation william seward 1858 chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 the slavery question in the territories the election of 1848 revealed an emerging sectional divide between the north and south over the issue of slavery.
the dispute centered on whether slavery would be allowed in the new territories.
given the small population of white settlers in the west many politicians hoped that any decision on creating territories and admitting new states would not arise for years.
but the discovery of gold in california in 1848 brought tens of thousands of fortune seekers.
by late 1849 they constituted a population sufficient to apply for statehood.
after much acrimony congress eventually passed the compromise of 1850 a set of measures that quieted but did not resolve the fundamental disagreement over the future of slavery in america.
the gold rush although both whigs and democrats in congress sought to avoid the contentious issue of slavery and the territories the discovery of gold in california soon forced them to confront it.
in december 1848 following four months of rumors more than 300 ounces of pure gold arrived in washington d c sent by the new territorial government of california.
the news touched off the gold rush in 1849 a migration of thousands of gold seekers from farms and workshops in the east to northern california on news of the gold strike near san francisco.
californias population exploded rising from just 14 000 at the start of 1849 to more than 100 000 by years end.
by 1852 it reached 220 000.
eighty percent of the new arrivals were american born including free african americans with the rest coming from mexico south america europe and asia.
most were single white men in their twenties and thirties.
they came to california not to settle but to strike it rich and return home.
this fortune seeking spirit led to the creation of a rough and raucous society.
mining camps and boomtowns sprang up almost overnight only to be abandoned the moment the gold disappeared or word arrived of a fresh strike elsewhere.
most mining towns lacked any formal government including sheriffs and judges leading to high rates of crime and violence.
by 1852 most of the gold that could be easily extracted was gone and with it individual earnings as high as 20 per day in 1849 compared to less than 2 per day back east.
with much gold remaining embedded in rock deep beneath the earths what was the fate of most fortune seekers who headed west to mine for gold.
surface mining shifted from independent miners to corporations possessing the capital to pay for the expensive technology required to extract the hardto reach gold.
most of the men who remained in mining after 1852 did so as wage laborers.
among them were thousands of prospectors who had sold their farms and shops in the east in a fruitless quest for easy wealth.
while many panned for gold thousands of migrants worked in enterprises that supported the mining industry such as hotels restaurants banks saloons and laundries.
they realized that the surest way to riches lay in selling supplies such as pickaxes shovels rope tents and clothing at outrageous prices to eager miners.
many women earned high wages working in cooking cleaning and health care jobs but many were forced into prostitution to survive a practice that flourished in the maledominated society of california.
by one estimate one out of every five women in california in 1850 worked as a prostitute.
another group that found its dreams of riches thwarted were the chinese 45 000 of whom i have no pile yet but you can bet your life i will never come home until i have something more than when i started a gold rush migrant on his way to california view the image gold mines of california lecture announcement the slavery question in the territories arrived in california by 1854.
white miners motivated by racism and greed used violence and intimidation to confine the chinese to the least desirable mining areas.
the drawing shown here 12 1 depicts the segregated world of these chinese miners.
no whites appear in the scene which shows the chinese engaged in several activities primarily mining.
in 1852 the state legislature imposed a heavy tax on chinese miners prompting many to turn from mining to farming fishing and operating restaurants and laundries.
but increased immigration and job competition with whites in the coming decades would lead to escalating anti chinese sentiment and violence in california see chapter 16.
much worse was the fate of the california indians.
the diseases brought by migrants killed tens of thousands while ruthless bands of miners killed thousands more or drove them off their lands.
of the 150 000 native americans who lived in california in 1848 on the eve of the gold rush only 30 000 remained by 1870.
meanwhile countless californios mexicans living in california lost title to their lands through legal obstacles that the new american government imposed.
the gold rush sparked western development and accelerated the creation of a coast to coast american nation.
but the immediate consequence of the gold rush was not economic or social it was political.
the arrival of tens of thousands of people in 1849 suddenly made california eligible to organize a territorial government as a prelude to statehood.
looming over any discussion of california statehood however was the divisive issue of slavery.
organizing california and new mexico even before the discovery of gold forced national leaders to consider california statehood the question of the western territories and the status of slavery there took center stage in congress.
tempers flared in the house when northern representatives unsuccessfully attempted to approve a motion upholding the wilmot proviso in the western territories draft a bill to organize california as a free territory and pass a bill ending the slave trade in the district of columbia.
the tension eventually subsided as congressmen decided to wait for president elect zachary taylor to take office and reveal his opinions on slavery and the western territories.
within weeks of his inauguration in march 1849 taylor made it clear that although he was a southerner who did not oppose slavery he would put national unity above regional loyalty.
instead of creating territorial governments for california and new mexico that would leave authority over the slavery issue with congress he proposed that they be made states view the closer look chinese gold mining in california 12 1 racism in the gold fields of california chinese goldseekers were often confined to segregated encampments and less desirable mining sites.
how did the gold rush affect the native americans of california.
chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 immediately and thus have the freedom to decide the slavery question according to popular will.
this would remove the contentious issue from congress where it sparked bitter debate and increasing sectionalism.
the people of the north need have no apprehension of the further extension of slavery president zachary taylor at mercer pennsylvania july 1849 12 2 the great seal of california the inclusion of 31 stars indicated the hope that california would be admitted as the thirty first state.
residents of new mexico and california responded enthusiastically to taylors invitation.
by the fall of 1849 california had approved a state constitution prohibiting slavery and applied to congress for admission as a free state.
they also adopted a seal 12 2 to symbolize their vision of the state and its future.
in the foreground sits minerva the roman goddess of wisdom while behind her a miner prospects for gold.
the motto eureka is greek for i have found it sheaves of wheat at her feet symbols of agriculture and ships symbolic of commerce sailing on the nearby waters indicate their expectations for robust economic growth.
in 1850 new mexicos residents also applied for admission.
taylors actions touched off a firestorm of protest in the south.
state legislatures forwarded petitions of protest to washington while mass meetings across the region denounced taylor and his northern supporters.
then in june 1850 hard line defenders of slavery often called fire eaters convened a southern rights convention in nashville tennessee to devise and adopt some mode of resistance to northern aggression what angered southerners most was the threat taylors plan posed to the balance of power in congress.
because of the norths greater population it sent more representatives to the house.
but with slave and free states numbering 15 each southerners enjoyed equal representation in the senate allowing them to block legislation deemed threatening to slavery or southern interests the so called southern veto.
admitting california and new mexico as free states would tip the balance in favor of the north.
under such conditions it would only be a matter of time warned southern defenders before a congress dominated by northerners abolished slavery altogether.
for the first time warned senator jefferson davis of mississippi we are about permanently to destroy the balance of power between the sections the compromise of 1850 as he had done in the missouri compromise in 1820 and the nullification crisis of 1832 1833 henry clay of kentucky proposed a compromise.
his plan admitted california as a free state and organized new mexico into two territories where the people would eventually vote to decide whether to permit slavery in a process known as popular sovereignty.
it also settled the border dispute between new mexico and texas arranged for the federal government to assume texass debt banned the slave trade in washington d c and established a stronger federal fugitive slave law.
the speeches inspired by the debate over clays bill among the most famous in the history of congress revealed an intensifying clash of visions over the future of slavery in america.
on march 4 a dying john c calhoun of south carolina had a colleague read his speech expressing the views of proslavery southern hardliners.
he demanded that the northerners end their attacks on slavery uphold southerners rights in the territories especially the right to own slaves and enforce the fugitive slave provisions in the constitution.
why did southerners react so negatively to president taylors plan.
read the document john c calhoun proposal to preserve the union 1850 the slavery question in the territories three days later the renowned massachusetts senator daniel webster delivered his famous seventh of march address an impassioned plea for moderation and compromise warning that both proslavery and antislavery extremism threatened to destroy the union.
william seward of new york then voiced the views of staunch antislavery northerners.
rejecting the southern argument that the constitution guaranteed the right to extend slavery into the territories seward invoked the authority of a higher law than the constitution the law of god under which all people deserved to live in freedom.
congress he argued should instead be debating how to eliminate slavery peacefully and gradually.
debate over clays compromise raged for months.
the hostility spawned by the differences of opinion over slavery and the western territories is captured in this 1850 political cartoon scene in uncle sams senate 12 3.
the cartoon is satirical but it depicts a real incident in which mississippi senator henry s foote pulled a pistol on missouri senator thomas hart benton shown holding his coat open and daring his opponent to shoot.
the senate finally voted the compromise down in july.
then the unexpected occurred.
president taylor died of severe gastroenteritis on july 9 1850 and the south asks for justice simple justice and less she ought not to take.
nothing else can with any certainty finally and for ever settle the question at issue terminate agitation and save the union john c calhoun march 4 1850 was succeeded by vice president millard fillmore a moderate whig from new york.
compared to taylor fillmore was more sympathetic to the south and eager to reach a compromise.
with his support a young and ambitious senator from illinois stephen a douglas revived the movement for compromise.
he broke up clays massive bill into separate pieces of legislation and then without appeals to patriotism or sectionalism he assembled enough votes to pass each individually.

finally a new fugitive slave act greatly increased the federal governments commitment to returning escaped slaves to their owners how did the congressional vote on the compromise of 1850 reveal growing sectionalism.
gulf of mexico something southern fire eaters had been demanding for years.
when the bills were all signed by midseptember joyful crowds gathered in the nations capital to serenade congress with song and cheers of the union is saved but a close examination of the votes on the compromises bills reveals a weakening of party loyalties and a growing tendency toward voting along sectional lines.
most northern whigs for example supported the admission of california as a free state and opposed the fugitive slave act.
most southern whigs voted in the opposite manner.
only 20 percent of congress generally moderate northern democrats and southern whigs voted for all five bills.
as many antislavery northerners and southern hardliners correctly predicted the question of slavery whether in the territories or elsewhere would surface again.
view the closer look the compromise of 1850 the slavery question in the territories sectionalism on the rise one element in the compromise of 1850 the fugitive slave act sparked a national controversy that intensified the sectionalism or hostility between north and south over slavery.
the act created a force of federal commissioners who possessed broad powers to pursue and return suspected escaped slaves to their owners.
it also permitted federal marshals to deputize private citizens to assist in capturing fugitive slaves.
those who refused to help were subject to fines and imprisonment.
once apprehended an accused fugitive had no right to a jury trial.
his or her fate was instead decided by a federal commissioner who stood to earn a fee of 10 if he returned the accused to slavery and only 5 if he released him or her.
fugitive slaves escaping to the north did not become a major political issue until the 1830s.
in that decade the growing abolitionist movement began to encourage and facilitate slave escapes along what came to be known metaphorically as the underground railroad.
it was a network of safe houses and other secret hiding places along a series of routes leading to the north and into canada where british law prohibited slavery.
the existence of such a network is revealed in this page from the 1844 diary of daniel osborn a quaker living in alum creek ohio 12 5.
between april and september of that year warm months ideal for travel osborn assisted 47 escapees.
his home was situated approximately halfway between the borders of northern kentucky where all but three of the fugitives came from and canada.
many of his quaker neighbors also harbored fugitives.
angry slaveholders and eager abolitionists spread fantastic stories of thousands of slaves being spirited north annually but the underground railroad probably brought no more than 5 000 slaves to freedom between 1830 and 1860.
its most famous conductor was harriet tubman an escaped slave who made 19 trips to the south to lead scores of slaves including many of her relatives to freedom.
osborns diary occasionally revealed a similar pattern on a smaller scale.
in one eight day period in august 1844 he recorded that an african american man passed through alum creek on his way back to kentucky where he gathered his wife child and sister in law and returned safely.
he was followed by a woman who came from canada to bring four of her children and one grandchild to freedom.
most 12 5 abolitionists assist escaped slaves along the underground railroad this page from the diary of daniel osborn a quaker living in alum creek ohio records the assistance he offered escaped slaves heading for canada in the spring of 1844 fugitives escaped to the north through less formal arrangements and a combination of perseverance ingenuity and luck.
although the number of escaped slaves remained relatively small averaging 1 000 per year out of a total slave population that approached four million by 1860 southern slaveholders grew increasingly angry over the unwillingness of northerners to assist in the return of their property especially galling were the personal liberty laws passed by nine northern states between 1842 and 1850 which prohibited the use of state officials or facilities like courts and jails for the capture and return of escaped slaves.
with these precedents in mind southerners made clear in the weeks following the compromise of 1850 that they expected northerners to uphold the fugitive slave act.
it is the deliberate opinion view the map interactive map the underground railroad why did southerners demand a fugitive slave act.
chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 of this convention resolved a gathering of georgia fire eaters that upon the faithful execution of the fugitive slave law depends the preservation of our much beloved union southern insistence on a new fugitive slave law was full of contradiction.
even though southern nationalists celebrated the sanctity of states rights they condemned northern states for enacting personal liberty laws states rights doctrine also opposed any increase of federal power especially when slavery was concerned yet southerners made an exception when it came to using federal authority to capture their escaped slaves.
abolitionists denounced the new fugitive slave law as a hateful statute of kidnappers they formed vigilance committees throughout the north and vowed in the words of one illinois newspaper to trample the law in the dust opportunities for resistance soon arose for unlike the abstract questions raised by the wilmot proviso and popular sovereignty the fugitive slave act created a succession of concrete human dramas in dozens of northern communities see choices and consequences resisting the fugitive slave act.
early and memorable incidents occurred in boston the unofficial headquarters of the abolitionist movement.
in october 1850 just weeks after the laws enactment two slave catchers arrived there in pursuit of william and ellen craft who had escaped from georgia two years earlier.
the citys vigilance committee swung into action hiding the crafts and posting handbills throughout the city denouncing the kidnappers after five days of sustained harassment and physical threats the slave catchers left the city.
taking no chances the crafts boarded a ship for england.
the controversy over the fugitive slave act played a significant role in popularizing and legitimizing antislavery sentiment though not necessarily abolitionism in the north.
in the early 1850s few northerners were abolitionists.
indeed many were deeply hostile to blacks and rejected racial equality.
other northerners opposed slavery but were not willing to jeopardize the national peace achieved by the compromise of 1850 by supporting abolitionist vigilantism.
nonetheless the controversies generated by the fugitive slave act forced northerners to confront the reality of an institution that had seemed distant and abstract.
the vivid images of southern agents seizing free people in a community of free citizens and returning them to a life of bondage shocked even the most conservative northerners.
as one conservative whig wrote after seeing the fugitive anthony burns returned to slavery from boston in 1854 when it was all over and i was alone in my office i put my face in my hands and wept although these and subsequent events in the 1850s did not convert masses of northerners to abolitionism they did move many to see slavery as an evil that at the least ought to be confined to its present boundaries to hasten its eventual demise.
many northerners also gradually became more hostile to slavery as the result of reading antislavery literature.
although the growing number of firsthand accounts of slavery by escaped slaves proved popular the most widely read and influential book was a work of fiction.
first published in installments in an abolitionist newspaper uncle toms cabin appeared as a novel in 1852.
its author harriet beecher stowe came from a prominent abolitionist family.
within a year her novel sold 300 000 copies making it the best selling book of the era.
soon thousands of theatrical versions of the story were being performed in cities across the north.
speeches diaries letters and other evidence indicate that stowes account of the brutality of slavery and the humanity of the enslaved moved millions of northerners to become increasingly hostile to slavery even if they did not believe in racial equality.
by contrast southerners denounced stowe as a wretch in petticoats and banned the book.
they also published dozens of proslavery novels with similar titles.
this image 12 6 from aunt philliss cabin or southern life as it is 1852 portrays slaves dancing suggesting they enjoy free time and are happy.
12 6 southerners refute the antislavery claims of uncle toms cabin this frontispiece from aunt philliss cabin or southern life as it is 1852 presents slavery as a happy carefree existence.
what made uncle toms cabin such an influential piece of antislavery literature.
view the closer look the fugitive slave act watch the video video lecture the making of uncle toms cabin the slavery question in the territories choices and consequences resisting the fugitive slave act in february 1851 bostons abolitionists faced a new challenge when federal authorities captured an escaped slave named shadrach minkins.
as a federal judge ordered a hearing to determine minkinss status to be held three days later 200 white and black abolitionists gathered outside the jail where he was held.
intimidating slave catchers and helping the crafts avoid arrest had constituted resistance to the fugitive slave act but with minkins in federal custody the question arose of whether abolitionists were willing to break the law to uphold their values.
choices drawing on the civil disobedience tradition see chapter 11 declare the fugitive slave act immoral and organize an extralegal effort to free minkins.
respect the laws regarding fugitive slaves but fight through the courts to prevent the extradition of minkins and other alleged fugitive slaves.
respect the laws regarding fugitive slaves and accept the likely transportation of minkins back to slavery but organize a more effective effort to spirit fugitive slaves out of the country like the crafts.
decision convinced that the hearing would result in minkinss return to slavery 20 african american men opted for choice 1.
they burst into the courtroom overpowered the guards and took minkins to montreal canada.
the incident thrilled abolitionists including theodore parker who wrote later i think it is the most noble deed done in boston since the destruction of the tea in 1773 southerners and conservative northerners like president fillmore denounced the action as lawless.
consequences when federal authorities apprehended another escaped slave thomas sims in boston two months later fillmore sent 250 soldiers to guard the courthouse and escort the captive to a ship bound for georgia.
nonetheless similar extralegal incidents by abolitionists occurred elsewhere.
in christiana pennsylvania in october 1851 for example two dozen armed african american men killed a slaveholder from nearby maryland who was pursuing two escaped slaves.
these events outraged southerners especially pro secessionist fire eaters.
south carolina mississippi and georgia held conventions to denounce abolitionism and consider secession.
the furor soon quieted down as the number of slave captures decreased sharply largely because thousands of free blacks and escaped slaves fled to canada ontarios african american population doubled in the 1850s.
continuing controversies when are acts of civil disobedience and violence to further the cause of justice legitimate.
in the 1850s abolitionists deemed slavery such an outrageous violation of american freedom that acts of resistance even violence were justified.
this question would generate heated debate in every subsequent era in american history including movements for womens suffrage in the 1910s and civil rights in the 1960s.
african americans drive off the slave catchers in christiana pennsylvania what caused the furor over the fugitive slave act to eventually subside.
chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 political realignment furor over the fugitive slave act subsided after 1851 and american politics experienced a period of relative calm.
some felt a rising optimism over the prospect of territorial expansion into the caribbean and latin america.
but unprecedented levels of immigration also spawned a powerful antiforeigner political movement that enjoyed widespread support until eclipsed by the reemergence of the slavery issue.
sectional animosity surged in 1854 as congress debated whether to allow slavery in the kansas and nebraska territories.
the resulting kansasnebraska act prompted the collapse of the whig party and in 1856 1857 a violent and protracted conflict between pro and antislavery forces known as bleeding kansas young america by late 1852 a prosperous economy and fear of disunion undermined the appeal of extremists in both north and south.
prosperity also helped calm the passions aroused by the compromise of 1850 and the enforcement of the fugitive slave act.
in the presidential election that year both parties nominated moderate candidates democrat franklin pierce and whig general winfield scott and pledged to uphold the compromise of 1850.
pierce won handily but the most telling aspect of the election was the woeful performance of the whig party in the south 12 7 where scott allied with the antislavery wing of his party won only kentucky and tennessee.
the whig party was falling apart and soon would be gone.
pierces popularity stemmed from his reputation as a northerner with southern sympathies.
he was also a member of a brash movement within 1 601 274 50 8 1 386 580 43 9 12 7 the election of 1852 scotts poor performance in the south winning only two states indicated that the whig party was fast disintegrating over the slavery issue.

a radiant sunset implies gods blessing on the enterprise.
as president pierce proved an ardent proponent of expansion which he believed would strengthen the democratic party and unite the nation.
yet his efforts had nearly the opposite effect.
when pierce entertained proposals to annex hawaii and purchase alaska southerners in congress stymied the plans because the treaties would have outlawed slavery.
conversely northern representatives denounced his attempt in 1854 to acquire cuba with its plantation economy and 300 000 slaves from spain.
northerners likewise took a dim view of the invasions of latin american and caribbean countries by small armies of expansion minded adventurers known as filibusters an english corruption of the dutch word for pirate.
these operations delighted southern slave owners however who viewed these lands as ideal in the words of mississippi senator albert g brown for the planting and spreading of slavery pierces support for proslavery expansionism alienated northern supporters and threatened to upset the sectional peace achieved by the compromise of 1850.
but the controversy over proposed expansion would pale by comparison with that sparked in 1854 over a plan to organize the territories of kansas and nebraska.
territories and eventually states in the land west of iowa and missouri essentially the northern half of the louisiana purchase.
he was not alone.
farmers were eager to settle in the regions fertile kansas and platte river valleys and promoters of a transcontinental railroad hoped to run a northern route through it.
neither settlement nor railroad construction could occur however before the federal government negotiated land treaties with indians and organized the area as a territory.
douglas faced strong opposition from southern congressmen who feared the new territories would eventually become two free states.
they also had their sights set on a southern route for the transcontinental railroad from new orleans through the new mexico territory to san francisco.
they told douglas they would support his plan only if it included a repeal of the ban on slavery north of 36 30 that had been a part of the missouri compromise in 1820.
promises of popular sovereignty they warned would not be enough.
fully aware that it would raise a hell of a storm but hopeful it would boost his presidential ambitions for 1856 douglas introduced his kansas nebraska act as a solution to the issues arising over these western territories.
in addition to repealing the ban on slavery north of 36 30 the act 12 8 an enthusiastic vision of westward expansion this 1861 painting westward the course of empire takes its way by emmanuel leutze vividly expresses the expansionist spirit of the young america movement.
the kansas nebraska act stephen a douglas of illinois another leading young america figure saw the future development of the united states in the rapid organization of why did many southerners support efforts to annex cuba and seize other caribbean and latin american countries.
chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 called for splitting the area into two separate territories kansas west of missouri and nebraska west of iowa 12 9.
he intended this last provision to placate both north and south by allowing the eventual establishment of kansas as a slave state since its soil and climate were similar to neighboring missouri and nebraska as a free state.
the kansas nebraska act touched off a national debate more intense than that of 1850.
most northerners both whigs and democrats considered the 36 30 line an untouchable agreement that had ensured national peace for more than 30 years.
although some moderates had been willing in 1850 to allow slavery via popular sovereignty into western territory lying south of the line they now balked at doing so in land north of it.
free soilers and abolitionists denounced the bill as conclusive evidence that the south now increasingly referred to as the slave power was bent on spreading the curse of slavery wherever possible.
they organized hundreds of anti nebraska rallies across the north and forwarded petitions to congress.
despite corruption bribery and treachery asserted one typical resolution nebraska the heart of our continent shall forever remain free undeterred douglas prevailed and his bill passed in may 1854.
but it was a costly victory that seriously weakened his democratic party and hampered his presidential ambitions by associating him with controversy.
the impact on the whigs was even worse shattering the party along sectional 12 9 the kansas nebraska act the goal of stephen a douglas in gaining passage of the kansas nebraska act was to open the great plains to settlement and facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad ideally running through his home state of illinois.

every northern whig in the house and senate voted against the measure whereas most southern whigs joined the democrats in support.
more seriously the death of the whig party in the south indicated that the bitter fight over nebraska had permanently ended the long standing spirit of accommodation between the north and south.
many northerners resolved to make no more concessions to the slave power whereas a growing number of southerners resolved to preserve their rights from attacks by abolitionists.
this intensifying polarization between north and south is revealed in these two sculptures of freedom by thomas crawford 12 10.
crawford was commissioned in 1854 to create a statue of a monumental figure representing liberty to top the capitol building in washington d c one year later he submitted a proposed model for the sculpture to secretary of war jefferson davis who was overseeing the renovation of the capitol.
davis approved of the overall scheme a large classically robed woman holding a sword and shield but one detail infuriated the vociferous defender of slavery from mississippi.
crawford had given freedom a cap worn by freed slaves in ancient rome.
sensing an abolitionist plot crawford was a friend of leading abolitionist senator charles sumner davis threatened to cancel the commission.
crawford quickly replaced the cap with a helmet surrounded by stars and a bald eagle.
with the addition of proslavery whigs.
from that point the party came under growing southern proslavery control.
the nascent republican party was not the only movement seeking to succeed the defunct whig party.
although many northerners harbored growing concern about the slave power others perceived a greater threat to their way of life mass immigration.
the flow of immigrants into the united states rising steadily since the 1820s became a tidal wave in the mid 1840s.
industrialization population growth and crop failure in europe led hundreds of thousands of irish german and other western europeans to seek new lives in america where industrial jobs and cheap land abounded.
between 1845 and 1855 three million immigrants arrived with most settling in northern cities.
republicans and know nothings the political impact of the kansas nebraska controversy became clear in the 1854 congressional elections.
free soilers ex whigs and antislavery democrats in the north formed dozens of local parties under names like the anti nebraska or the peoples party.
the most popular name and the one under which they would eventually unite was republican.
despite their varied names the parties shared an overriding commitment to opposing further concessions to southern slave interests.
as this loose collection of antislavery groups coalesced into the republican party the democratic party was transformed.
in the midterm elections of 1854 northern democrats lost control of the house of representatives and all but two free state legislatures.
many of the defeated democrats lost because they had voted for the kansas nebraska act.
but in the south the democratic party grew stronger 12 10 slavery and the republican image crawfords design for a sculpture to top the capitols dome included a hat worn by freed slaves in ancient rome above left.
bowing to proslavery objections crawford redesigned freedoms hat as a helmet surrounded by stars and topped by a bald eagle.
what events led to the formation of the republican party.
chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 this surge in immigration caused antiimmigrant sentiment or nativism native born americans belief in their superiority to the foreign born to rise sharply.
as images as history the foreign menace shows americans were upset not merely by the number of immigrants arriving but also by their perceived character.
although most immigrants in previous decades had been protestants from britain many of them with money and skills a large majority of immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s were poor unskilled catholics from germany and ireland.
anti catholicism with roots in american history going back to the nations earliest european founders surged into near hysteria.
some of the best selling books in the antebellum period charged that catholicism with its emphasis on clerical authority and loyalty to the pope in rome was incompatible with democracy.
nativists those born in the united states also feared that immigrants took american jobs drank too much alcohol refused to assimilate and increased poverty disease and crime.
the ill clad and destitute irishman is repulsive to our habits and our tastes the christian examiner n y 1848 anti immigrant sentiment reached a fever pitch in 1854 with the emergence of the american party.
its core constituents were members of secret antiimmigrant societies founded in cities in the late 1840s.
because secrecy required them to answer i know nothing when asked about their organization they earned the name know nothings their political platform condemned both political parties as hopelessly corrupt and called for legislation restricting office to native born citizens barring public funds for parochial schools and raising the period of naturalization for citizenship from five to 21 years.
with the whig party in decline and the democrats closely associated with the immigrant vote know nothings achieved stunning success in 1854 winning control of the state governments in delaware pennsylvania and massachusetts.
about 75 know nothing congressmen were sent to washington.
elections one year later in 1855 saw the party what anti immigrant laws did the american party propose.
win maryland and kentucky elect scores of nativists in new york and california and post impressive tallies across the south.
after the elections of 1854 the big question was which of these two new political forces antislavery republicans or anti immigrant know nothings would replace the defunct whig party.
but the american party disintegrated almost as quickly as it arose splitting like the whig party along sectional lines over slavery.
most of its members eventually joined the republican party.
although many former members retained their dislike of foreigners they perceived the growing aggression of the slave power as a greater threat to the nations well being.
this threat seemed most menacing in the newly created territory of kansas.
ballots and blood even as opponents denounced douglass plan to allow popular sovereignty to decide the status of slavery in the territories they devised a plan to ensure the results went their way.
we will engage in competition for the virgin soil of kansas william seward warned his southern colleagues in congress just before passage of the kansas nebraska act and god give victory to the side which is stronger in numbers as in right wealthy new england abolitionists established the emigrant aid company and financed the migration of more than 2 000 antislavery settlers to kansas.
thousands more went on their own.
proslavery interests however proved equal to the task of opposing them.
to offset the soaring numbers of northern settlers in kansas they organized bands of proslavery border ruffians to cross into kansas from missouri.
although some came as settlers most were illegal voters determined to see kansas enter the union as a slave state.
in spring 1855 men from missouri cast nearly 5 000 illegal votes helping elect a proslavery territorial government that gathered in the town of lecompton and legalized slavery.
antislavery settlers rejected the legitimacy of this bogus legislature in fall 1855 they drew up a freestate constitution held elections that resulted in an antislavery legislature and governor located in the town of lawrence and asked congress to admit the territory as a free state.
kansas now had two governments bitterly opposed to each other.
kansas quickly became a divisive issue in congress.
although the senate controlled by political realignment images as history the foreign menace from the colonial period up to the present americans have held conflicted visions about immigration.
on the one hand americans proudly view their country as a nation of immigrants that has incorporated millions of newcomers while fashioning an ethos of tolerance.
on the other periods of virulent anti immigrant sentiment have punctuated american history.
in the 1840s and 1850s nativists native born americans who believed themselves superior to the foreign born mobilized to oppose immigration.
although they failed by clothing the irishman and german in whiskey and beer barrels the artist reflects the widely held view that immigrants drank too much alcohol.
to stop the mass influx of foreigners their movement revealed a vision of immigration as a serious threat to the well being of the republic.

the drawing beneath it expresses the fear that catholic immigrants were part of a conspiracy to claim america for the pope.

chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 democrats voted to recognize the proslavery government of lecompton the house controlled by republicans recognized the free state government in lawrence.
on may 20 1856 senator charles sumner of massachusetts a rising figure in the abolitionist movement delivered a speech titled the crime against kansas a harsh denunciation of southern efforts to force slavery into the territory.
days later south carolina congressman preston brooks attacked sumner with a cane in the senate chamber for his affront to southern honor.
sumner nearly died from his injuries and never fully recovered his health.
as the image suggests 12 11 antislavery northerners hailed sumner as a near martyr.
the artists emphasis on brookss brutality and sumners vulnerability he is armed with only a pen popularized the abolitionist vision of slavery as an inherently barbarous institution and its supporters both in congress and on the plains of kansas as violent criminals who did not respect democracy or free speech.

the centerpiece of buchanans campaign was to play on the racism of many northern voters by branding his opponents black republicans a racist pejorative that suggested that republicans who opposed the extension of slavery into the western territories were dangerous radicals who favored abolition and racial equality.

when these proslavery men put the lecompton constitution before the people of kansas in a referendum antislavery residents deeming both the legislature and the convention illegitimate boycotted it.
as a result the constitution won approval easily and was forwarded to congress.
to complicate matters however in the fall the antislavery party won control of the territorial legislature and immediately authorized a second referendum on the proslavery constitution.
this time proslavery residents boycotted and the constitution was rejected by more than twothirds of the voters who were overwhelmingly antislavery.
the scene then shifted to washington.
president buchanan gave in under intense pressure from southerners in his cabinet and in congress who threatened secession if the proslavery lecompton constitution was not accepted and kansas admitted as a slave state.
douglas came out against lecompton because it was unpopular in his home state of illinois and it mocked his vaunted principle of popular sovereignty even as it exposed its weakness.

chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 two societies from an economic standpoint the 1850s brought stronger bonds of interdependence between north and south.
northern textile manufacturers depended on a steady supply of southern cotton whereas southerners relied on northern manufactured goods credit and shipping.
yet overshadowing the increased economic integration of north and south was their splitting into two distinct societies.
northeastern and midwestern states industrialized at a stunning pace symbolized by the spread in these regions of the railroad and factory.
in much of the south by contrast economic growth arose from an ever expanding system of staple crop production notably cotton that depended on the labor of four million slaves.
along with these divergent economies north and south developed distinct philosophies that defined their vision of the proper social order.
the industrial north 12 15 the crystal palace 1853 hundreds of thousands of visitors flocked to new york city in 1853 to view the exhibition of the industry of the world in the crystal palace.
the main building itself made of cast iron and glass was an expression of the latest industrial materials and design.
the industrial revolution that began in places like lowell massachusetts in the early 1800s and then staggered after the panic of 1837 reached new heights after the economic recovery in the early 1840s.
centered almost entirely in the north this boom was triggered by three main developments.
first starting in the firearms industry and spreading into clocks sewing machines and farming equipment americans pioneered in the creation of machines made of interchangeable parts thus facilitating the rapid manufacture of inexpensive goods.
second manufacturers began to power their machines with steam an energy source that was more powerful reliable what developments helped spur industrialization in the north.
and flexible than water power provided by rivers.
finally manufacturers benefited from the huge pool of cheap labor provided by a steady influx of immigrants.
manufacturing output soared and by 1860 the total value of all goods produced in the north reached 1 5 billion compared to 483 million for the entire nation in 1840.
the dynamic and innovative character of the northern industrial economy was displayed for all the world to see in 1853 at the crystal palace exhibition in new york city.
modeled on a similar exhibition in london in 1851 the exhibition of the industry of the world as it was officially known featured more than 4 000 exhibits most of them american.
even the building itself 12 15 a monumental cast iron two societies and glass structure reflected the latest trends in architecture design and construction materials.
more than one million people came to see the latest in modern technology including cyrus mccormicks mechanical reaper richard m hoes rotary printing press and elisha otiss elevator.
the only southern exhibitions of new technology were improved versions of the cotton gin.
the same spirit of enthusiasm and confidence that inspired the crystal palace exhibition is also captured in this advertisement for the colt patent fire arms manufactury in 1862 12 16.
samuel colt from connecticut patented a design for a revolver in 1837 and then established an enormously successful firearms manufacturing business in hartford.
the image that dominates the advertisement conveys two main ideas.
first it shows a huge manufacturing establishment the very size of which is intended to suggest strength and power.
second the image shows the modern factory nestled neatly within a small new england town suggesting that industry poses no threat to smalltown american values.
colts was one of many arms manufacturing businesses that flourished in the 1840s and 1850s.
nearly all of them were located in the north accounting for 90 percent of national output.
equally important to the emerging industrial economy was the building of a massive railroad network.
trackage soared from more than 9 000 miles in 1850 to over 30 000 in 1860.
because most of this track lay west of pennsylvania it bound the states of the northeast more closely with those in the midwest such as illinois.
trade increasingly moved east to west along railroads and canals rather than north to south along rivers as in earlier decades accentuating the growing sectional divide.
the growth of the railroads along with two additional technological innovations the reaper and the cast steel plow revolutionized northern and western agriculture which was still the foundation of the national economy.
cyrus mccormicks mechanical reaper was a piece of equipment on small wheels pulled by a horse.
as it passed through a field sharp blades moved back and forth severing stalks of wheat.
the harvested grain was then collected in a cradle.
the reaper allowed for a much faster harvest often crucial in times of bad weather and eliminated the need to hire expensive farm labor.
john deeres cast steel plow sliced smoothly through the toughest soil making farming much easier and more efficient.
both inventions allowed farmers to expand the size of their farms knowing they could handle the additional plowing and harvesting.
the railroad also allowed farmers to sell their produce in markets hundreds of miles away and to turn from raising a mixture of animal fruit vegetable and grain products to specializing in single crops such as wheat corn or oats.
rising prices and growing demand from abroad for american grain augmented this trend.
industrialization brought rising wages and opportunity to most northerners but also new levels of poverty especially among unskilled and immigrant workers who formed a growing class of urban poor.
wages in many industrializing sectors such as shoe making and textiles were too low for one earner to support a family.
to increase their familys income growing numbers of women and children worked in factories or performed outwork in their homes often for 60 or 70 hours per week.
many workers became unemployed for 12 16 celebrating northern industry this 1862 advertisement for colts patent fire arms manufactury celebrated the power of american industry.
the image of the factory situated neatly within a new england town also suggested that modern industry posed no threat to american values and lifestyles.
how did new technology transform american agriculture.
chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 envisioning evidence the rise of king cotton many americans associate cotton cultivation with slavery but the relationship really only took form in the last half century of slaverys existence in the united states roughly between 1810 and 1860.
the growth of textile manufacturing in britain and the northern united states in the early 1800s created a booming demand for cotton.
at the same time the expulsion of native americans from the fertile lands of georgia alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas texas florida and north and south carolina opened the way for cotton cultivation on a mass scale.
between 1815 and 1860 millions of white settlers moved into these lands.
they brought with them millions of slaves who they put to work raising cotton.
by 1830 cotton had become the souths most profitable product and slavery the single most important source of capital investment.
cottons value only increased over the next three decades leading many southerners to conclude that if the rising controversy over slavery led to secession the south was strong enough to flourish on its own.
cotton was king went a popular slogan in the late 1850s.
richmond kentucky missouri indian territory virginia nashville n carolina tennessee chattanooga memphis little rock s carolina arkansas alabama vicksburg jackson georgia montgomery charleston savannah louisiana san antonio houston c the wealth generated by king cotton was made possible by a dramatic increase in the souths slave population.

cotton is supreme resolves and re resolves in regard to his rights a vociferous advocate of southern economic diversification james d b debow started a magazine with the motto commerce is king and held commercial conventions throughout the south.
by 1860 debow and other proponents of greater southern economic independence could point to substantial progress.
southern railroad mileage had increased fourfold to 9 000 miles and there were 18 000 factories most in the upper south.
but the economy of the north grew even faster.
even as the south increased its textile manufacture by 44 percent in the 1850s its share of manufacturing nationwide declined by two percent.
indeed in 1860 the city of lowell massachusetts operated more textile spindles than all the southern states combined.
the south remained an agricultural society.
so long as staple crops brought high prices only a handful of southerners seemed willing to pursue industrialization.
industry also flourished in the upper south especially in maryland delaware kentucky tennessee and missouri.
but it paled in comparison to industrialization in the north and constituted only a fraction of the overall southern economy.
production of cash crops such as tobacco sugar and rice soared as did prices.
nothing however outperformed the souths main staple crop cotton.
production jumped from 1 35 million bales in 1840 to 4 8 million bales by 1860.
each bale weighed approximately 480 pounds.
southern cotton by this time accounted for three fifths of american exports and three quarters of the world supply.
as one southern nationalist put it cotton is king what made cotton king in this period was the labor of slaves nearly four million by 1860.

because slaves performed hard menial labor slavery established a floor in the southern economy below which even the poorest whites could not descend.
break down slavery argued one virginian and you would with the same blow destroy the great democratic principle of equality among men by which he meant white men.
above all poor southerners supported slavery because they accepted the essential tenets of white supremacy in particular the notion that blacks were inferior to whites and destined to live under their dominance.
now suppose they was free said a white alabama farmer about slaves to a northerner touring the south in the 1850s theyd all think themselves just as good as we how would you like to hev a nigger feelin just as good as a white man divergent visions southern society not only preached the superiority of whites over blacks but also the superiority of slave labor over northern wage labor.
the most prominent defender of slavery was george fitzhugh.
in books and pamphlets published in the 1850s he argued that all great societies in history practiced slavery and that the southern version was remarkably humane because masters felt obliged to feed clothe and shelter their slaves.
the negro slaves of the south he wrote are the happiest and in some sense the freest people in the world moreover argued fitzhugh and others such as the artist who drew this image that idealized slavery 12 17 slavery rescued africans from the so called barbarism of africa and exposed them to civilization and christianity.
pointing to the norths urban slums swelled with poor industrial workers fitzhugh ridiculed the northern contention that wage labor was morally superior to slavery.
northern factory workers he asserted were little more than wage slaves their condition was worse than that of the black slave because factory owners owed them nothing but the lowest possible wage.
capital exercises a more perfect compulsion over free laborers than human masters over slaves wrote fitzhugh for free laborers must at all times work or starve and slaves are supported whether they work or not northern society with its hireling labor claimed an official in charleston was characterized by pauperism rowdyism mobism and anti rentism why did southern whites who owned no slaves support slavery.
republicans had an answer for the likes of fitzhugh a free labor philosophy that celebrated the virtues of individualism independence entrepreneurship and upward mobility.
as fitzhugh did for the slave south they offered an idealized vision of the industrial north that conveniently ignored the hopeless plight of many poverty stricken city dwellers.
in the constitution of human nature wrote new york tribune editor horace greeley the desire of bettering ones condition is the mainspring of effort in contrast to the south which reserved hard labor for slaves argued greeley in the north all work was noble and moral no matter how menial.
better still for the ambitious wage labor need only be temporary.
if a man labored hard saved his money avoided drink and sought opportunity went the free labor philosophy he would soon possess his own farm or small business.
nothing not lack of money family ties formal education or american birth stood in the way of success.
a slave based society then for these republicans was the antithesis of this dynamic society of democratic opportunity.
enslave a man wrote greeley and you destroy his ambition his enterprise his capacity to northern abolitionists slavery also stifled the capacity of most poor and middling whites protecting the privileges of the aristocratic few and leaving the rest with little opportunity for success.
even worse slavery led to a culture that celebrated laziness luxury and decadence as opposed to the capitalist virtues of hard work thrift and self restraint.
northern writers like frederick law olmsted who traveled the south in the 1850s frequently commented on the backwardness of southern life its lack of public education railroads factories and substantial cities as well as a general tone of despair and fatalism among poor whites.
this ideological war of words intensified when a financial panic on wall street sent the economy plunging into a deep recession in late 1857 bringing unemployment and hard times to the industrial northeast and agrarian west.
but because the southern economy was so geared toward the export of cotton it experienced little of the panic of 1857.
southern nationalists pointed to this as evidence that cotton is supreme in comparison to northern industry.
southerners also argued that it proved the south could prosper on its own should the union ever dissolve.
the development of these divergent philosophies in the 1850s played a major role in creating a climate of extreme mistrust between north and south.
given the moral and social dimension of view the closer look competing visions slavery and christianity two societies 12 17 proslavery propaganda slavery and free labor contrasted this 1852 woodcut captures the argument of george fitzhugh and other proslavery propagandists claiming that masters care for their slaves even when sick and unable to work whereas cold hearted northern factory owners simply dump their sick or injured workers at the poor house.
the proslavery argument southerners perceived northern criticism of slavery and attempts to prevent its spread as attacks on their way of life likewise southern celebration of slavery and criticism of capitalist free labor convinced many northerners that the slave power intended to spread slavery everywhere including into the industrial north.
the successful efforts by southerners in congress to defeat proposals for higher tariffs to protect northern industry land grants to promote a transcontinental railroad and a homestead act to give 160 acres of public land to western settlers accentuated hard feelings in the north.
in 1858 a leading ideologue of the republican party william seward predicted an irrepressible conflict between the two societies.
how did the panic of 1857 strengthen the southern argument for secession.
chapter 12 slavery and sectionalism the political crisis of 1848 1861 a house divided by the late 1850s slavery dominated national politics.
nowhere was this more apparent than in the congressional elections of 1858 especially in illinois where senator stephen a douglas engaged in a series of famous debates mostly on the slavery issue with a little known republican challenger named abraham lincoln.
increasingly southerners became convinced that northerners wanted not simply to exclude slavery from the western territories but to destroy it.
john browns abolitionist raid on harpers ferry virginia in late 1859 only added to this perception.
the subsequent election the following year of abraham lincoln whose republican party southern hardliners believed was committed to abolition sparked a secession movement that soon brought the nation to the brink of civil war.
the lincoln douglas debates in 1858 national attention turned to illinois where stephen a douglas a leading democrat and certain 1860 presidential candidate was running for reelection to the senate.
many americans were eager to see which direction he would take on the slavery issue.
opposing him was abraham lincoln a former illinois state representative and congressman.
no abolitionist lincoln nevertheless believed slavery was immoral and hoped to prevent its spread to the western territories.
a house divided against itself cannot stand warned lincoln in his speech accepting the republican nomination to run for senator.
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free the overwhelming underdog in the contest lincoln boldly challenged douglas to a series of seven debates across illinois.
the ensuing lincolndouglas debates focused on the fate of slavery the legal and social status of african americans and the viability of popular sovereignty in the wake of the dred scott decision.
douglas portrayed lincoln as a radical abolitionist and black republican whose policies would destroy the union elevate blacks to social and legal equality with whites and promote interracial marriage.
lincoln denied these charges but made clear that a black man was entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in this he is my equal and the equal of judge douglas and the equal of every living man lincoln also castigated douglas for his professed moral indifference toward slavery.
if slavery is not wrong lincoln asserted nothing is wrong douglas won reelection to the senate but lincoln had forced him to make statements that appeared both indifferent to slavery and willing to let residents how did the lincoln douglas debates harm douglass presidential ambitions.
in the western territories ban it thereby antagonizing both southern fire eaters and northern free soilers.
his opponents would use these words against him in the presidential campaign in 1860.
more important the debates made lincoln a national figure and a rising star within the republican party.
john browns raid in 1857 just months after staging the pottawatomie creek massacre in kansas abolitionist john brown began plotting an invasion of the south that he hoped would lead to a widespread slave revolt and the end of slavery.
a deeply religious man raised from an early age to hate slavery brown believed god had called upon him to destroy slavery.
his sense of mission is revealed in this 1847 daguerreotype 12 18.
in it brown reenacts a scene from a decade earlier when he stood up in a crowded church raised his right hand and pledged to commit his life to abolition.
browns passion for the cause inspired many supporters and by the summer of 1859 with secret assistance from a number of prominent abolitionists he had gathered 17 whites including three of his sons and five blacks and moved to a farm in maryland.
john browns raid began at eight oclock on the evening of october 16.
leading his raiders across the potomac river to harpers ferry virginia brown quickly took control of the town and seized its federal arsenal full of guns and ammunition.
they planned to fan out across the south arming slaves and touching off a wave of rebellion.
but they were quickly cornered and on october 18 u s marines under colonel robert e lee stormed their stronghold.
the soldiers killed ten of browns men including two of his sons and took brown and six others prisoner.
read the document the lincoln douglas debates of 1858 a house divided 12 18 john brown vows to destroy slavery in 1847 john brown stood for this daguerreotype taken by african american photographer augustus washington reenacting a pledge he made to destroy slavery ten years earlier at an abolitionist meeting.
six weeks later a virginia jury found brown and his men guilty of treason and sentenced them to hang.
when given the opportunity to speak brown declared that he had acted in accordance with the bibles call to fight for justice a cause for which he was prepared to die.
on the day of his execution brown wrote one last note that proved eerily prophetic of the coming civil war.
i john brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood if in life brown had failed to overthrow slavery in death he furthered the abolitionist cause by becoming an instant martyr to many in the north.
on the day of his execution bells tolled in hundreds of towns from boston to chicago.
at rallies and church services brown was lionized as a righteous instrument of god.
ralph waldo emerson wrote of brown as a christ like figure who had made the gallows as glorious as the cross abolitionist william lloyd garrison a life long pacifist told an audience in boston i am hear the audio john brown an address by frederick douglass pamphlet excerpt prepared to say success to every slave insurrection at the south and in every slave country not all northerners were so enthusiastic however opponents of slavery like lincoln and greeley criticized browns use of violence.
still there was no denying observed one northerner that the death of no man in america has ever produced so profound a sensation sensation also struck in the south but it was one of fear and outrage.
browns audacious act rekindled among southerners what frederick douglass called the ever present dread and terror of slave insurrection.
browns glorification by northern editorialists politicians and ministers convinced many southerners that northern abolitionists would continue to conspire to instigate future slave uprisings to destroy southern society.
seward and his followers charged a mississippi legislator saying that the norths leading abolitionists have declared war upon us increasingly southerners talked of dissolving their union with the north to protect their property and way of life.
robert toombs of georgia voiced the most pressing concern of southerners never permit this federal government to pass into the traitorous hands of the black republican party the election of 1860 throughout the 1850s the democratic party had managed to withstand the strains of sectional discord that demolished the whigs and created a republican party with virtually no support in the south.
but when the democrats met in april 1860 in charleston south carolina to nominate a presidential candidate disagreements between northern and southern delegates caused the convention to disband unable to agree on a nominee.
the sectional split became official when a baltimore convention of mostly northern democrats nominated stephen a douglas a man southerners had become convinced would not protect slavery.
a week later a convention of southern democrats also met in baltimore and nominated john c breckinridge buchanans vice president and a staunch proslavery man from kentucky.
to complicate matters former southern whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee a pro union slaveholder of moderate views.
the split among the democrats and the emergence of the constitutional union party enhanced republican chances for victory.
deeming seward too controversial on the slavery issue republicans why did many northerners consider john brown a martyr.

lincoln won the four way election with just under 40 percent of the popular vote.

bell of the constitutional union party finished fourth taking three states of the upper south and 13 percent of the popular vote.
for the first time in the nations history a purely regional party the republicans had won the white house.
it was precisely the scenario southern extremists had threatened would lead to dissolution of the union.
that the south can afford to live under a government the majority of whose citizens regard john brown as a martyr and a christian hero rather than a murderer is a preposterous idea baltimore sun november 28 1859 secession southern fire eaters having warned southerners that the election of a black republican would lead to the end of slavery and the destruction of their society wasted no time in calling for secession.
secessionist rallies broke out across the south.
nowhere was secession sentiment stronger than in the epicenter of southern nationalism south carolina.
brushing aside the pleas of moderates to wait until the slave states could agree on a united course of action south carolina legislators called a convention to consider secession from the union.
on december 20 1860 this convention unanimously resolved that the union now subsisting between south carolina and the other states is hereby dissolved in less than two months six more states mississippi florida alabama georgia louisiana and texas also seceded 12 19.
one by one their representatives in washington delivered speeches resigned and headed home.
six of the seceded states sent delegates to montgomery alabama in early february where they organized a government similar to the one they had just left.
the major exception of course was that its constitution declared slavery legal and protected everywhere in the new nation.
they called their new nation the confederate states of america and elected jefferson davis of mississippi as its first president and alexander stephens of georgia as vice president.
they also created a confederate seal 12 20 that featured george washington not only the foremost founding father but a virginian and a slave owner at the center and established his birthday february 22 as the official birth of the confederacy.
these choices reflected the confederates goal to legitimize secession by comparing it to the thirteen colonies breaking away from britain during the american revolution.
even as the new confederate government took shape president james buchanan a weak and timid leader with southern sympathies did little to avert the crisis claiming that he lacked constitutional view the map atlas map secession authority to do anything.
moderates mobilized to see if they could as in previous sectional crises in 1820 1833 1850 and 1854 devise a compromise acceptable to both sections.
senator john j crittenden of kentucky put forth the leading proposal.
the crittenden compromise proposed constitutional amendments to protect slavery including one extending the old missouri compromise line of 36 30 to the pacific permitting slavery south of it prohibiting it to the north.
but while president elect lincoln expressed a willingness to compromise including supporting a constitutional amendment protecting slavery where it existed in the south he would not support the crittenden compromise.
on the territorial question he said in reference to the republican opposition to extending slavery into the west i am inflexible with that the proposal died.
confederate president jefferson davis likewise professed an aversion to conflict but rejected compromise.
for the confederate states of america the decision to secede was permanent.
the citizens of the confederacy he argued asked simply to be left alone.
the impasse left moderates in despair but lincoln placed his faith in pro union sentiment in the south.
he believed that for all 12 20 the confederate seal linking secession with the spirit of 1776 by placing george washington at the center of the confederate seal southerners sought to legitimize secession by comparing it to the decision of the thirteen colonies to break away from britain in 1776.

emphasized reconciliation while also declaring the union indivisible and secession illegal.
lincoln also asserted his intent to hold occupy and possess all federal property in the seceded states.
although the seceding states had seized nearly all federal property within their borders two harbor forts remained in federal control fort pickens in pensacola florida and fort sumter in charleston south carolina.
with food and other necessities running low at fort sumter lincoln informed the south carolina government of his intention to send a ship with non military supplies to resupply the garrison.
for confederate leaders the moment of truth had arrived.
if they submitted to federal authority secession would appear hollow.
if they fired on the ship they would be branded as the aggressors in the coming struggle.
confederate officials decided to force the issue before the ship arrived and ordered major robert anderson in command of the fort to surrender.
when anderson refused confederate general p g t beauregard began an artillery assault on the morning of april 12 and by afternoon the next day the union garrison surrendered.
southerners exulted in their quick victory and immediately raised the confederate flag over the ruins as a symbol of their triumph and sovereignty as an independent nation 12 21.
on april 15 lincoln declared the lower south to be in a state of insurrection and called for 75 000 men to enlist to put down the rebellion.
the civil war had begun.

patterned on the declaration of independence mississippis declaration of secession sets forth a list of alleged attacks on slavery and states rights by the north.
our position is thoroughly identified with slavery the greatest material interest of the world.
its labor supplies the product which constitutes the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth these products have become necessities of the world and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization the hostility to this institution commenced before the adoption of the constitution.
it has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves and refuses protection to that right on the high seas in the territories and wherever the government of the united states had jurisdiction.
it refuses the admission of new slave states into the union and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits denying the power of expansion it has nullified the fugitive slave law in almost every free state in the union it advocates negro equality socially and politically and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.
it has enlisted its press its pulpit and its schools against us until the whole popular mind of the north is excited and inflamed with prejudice it has recently obtained control of the government by the prosecution of its schemes and destroyed the last expectation of living together in friendship utter subjugation awaits us in the union if we should consent longer to remain in it.
it is not a matter of choice but of necessity.
we must either submit to degradation and to the loss of property worth four billions of money or we must secede from the union framed by our fathers to secure this as well as every other species of property.
for far less cause than this our fathers separated from the crown of england.
our decision is made.
we follow their footsteps.
we embrace the alternative of separation the flag of mississippi adopted after the states secession in january 1861.
lincoln used his inaugural address in march 1861 to respond directly to the assertions contained in the declarations of mississippi and other seceded states.
he attempted to reassure southerners that his administration was not hostile to their interests while rejecting their justification for secession.
fellow citizens of the united states i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual.
perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments.
it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances.
i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority.
in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war.
the government will not assail you.
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.
you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it i am loathe to close.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 this scene of industrial discontent the strike 1886 by artist robert koehler was inspired by the great railroad strike of 1877.
set in an unidentified industrial town it captures a moment of confrontation as workers pour out of a factory to gather outside the office of their employer.
unlike most scenes of labor unrest painted or drawn in the late nineteenth century koehler presented these workers as sympathetic characters painting each as an individual rather than as nondescript members of a mob.
many wear square hats popular among various skilled trades suggesting that these are more established workers.
they appear as hardworking and hard pressed men voicing their anger to the employer perhaps over a wage cut or layoffs through the spokesman at the bottom of the stairs.
yet the painting is fraught with tension and an atmosphere of impending violence.
note for example the worker in the foreground stooping to pick up a rock.
maybe he is doing this merely as a dramatic show of anger but perhaps he fully intends to throw it.
note also the scene to his left where a woman tries to calm down another angry worker.
again it is not clear that she will succeed.
and what about the employer.
he appears to be listening patiently to the workers representative but whether he will accede to their demands is unclear his stiff emotionless bearing suggests he will not.
the uncertainty in the painting over both what is about to happen and which side workers or employer is in the right illuminates a central theme in american society as it experienced rapid industrialization in the late nineteenth century.
by 1900 the industrial revolution had transformed the united states from a predominantly agricultural nation that ranked well behind britain germany and france to the worlds most formidable industrial power.
while many americans celebrated the industrial revolution for the unprecedented material wealth and progress it brought others grew disturbed by some of the grim consequences of industrialization especially the immense power accrued by big businesses and capitalists and the growing number of workers living in squalid slums.
the result of these conflicting visions was an intense debate much of it vividly captured in koehlers painting over the proper role of government in regulating the economy the rights of workers to form unions and strike for better wages and working conditions and the impact of growing disparities of wealth on americas republican traditions.
this association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times.
it is the riddle which the sphinx of fate puts to our civilization and which not to answer is to be destroyed henry george progress and poverty 1879 chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 the emergence of big business 16 1 the industrial revolution by the numbers during the second half of the nineteenth century every area of the economy produced enormous increases in output and value.
huge population increases helped to drive industrial and farm output.
americas huge supplies of key raw materials its rapidly growing urban workforce and its tradition of imposing few restraints on business enabled industrialization to boom after the civil war.
the railroads quickly emerged as the first big business followed by steel and petroleum.
all three industries pioneered in establishing modern business practices but they also drew increasing criticism as americans worried about their extraordinary power.
sources of the industrial revolution compared to most of western europe the united states was a relative latecomer to the industrial revolution which made its rise population 31 450 000 76 212 000 farms 2 044 000 5 737 000 6 64 billion 16 60 billion 140 500 510 000 value factory production 1 9 billion 13 billion industrial workers 1 3 million 5 1 million 4 589 95 573 20 million tons 270 million tons lumber 10 billion board ft 40 billion board ft cotton 3 8 million bales 10 1 million bales oil 500 000 barrels 45 824 000 barrels 30 000 track miles 193 000 track miles 13 000 tons 10 382 000 tons 7 billion 19 billion value of farms factories patents issued coal railroads steel gross national product how did human migration foster american industrialization.
to industrial supremacy by 1900 even more astonishing.
every statistical comparison between 1860 and 1900 from factory production to railroad mileage told the same story of phenomenal growth that saw the gross national product rise 171 percent 16 1.
several factors combined to allow the united states to surpass all other industrialized countries by increase 1900.
first the nation possessed enormous quantities of 142 3 two essential ingredients for rapid industrialization raw materials and cheap labor.
180 7 vast deposits of coal in pennsylvania west virginia and 150 0 kentucky for example provided a seemingly inexhaust263 0 ible supply of inexpensive fuel to fire steam locomo584 0 tives and factory machinery.
other plentiful resources 292 3 included iron lead copper silver gold wood cotton and oil.
cheap labor came from 1982 7 two sources.
record levels of immigration see chapter 17 in the late nineteenth century pushed the number of foreign born to one in five american workers two in 165 8 five in manufacturing and mining by 1910.
millions of 9064 8 american born workers also moved from rural settings to manufacturing centers in 543 3 search of new opportunities.
many women and children 79 761 5 both immigrant and nativeborn also entered the paid 171 4 workforce.
the emergence of big business the relentless development and adoption of new technology also furthered industrialization in the united states.
inventors flooded the u s patent office with applications raising the number from an average of 1 000 per year in the 1850s to 20 000 per year in the 1890s.
some notable inventors such as george eastman kodak camera william s burroughs adding machine isaac singer sewing machine alexander graham bell telephone and thomas edison incandescent light bulb phonograph motion picture camera mimeograph machine and more became business giants.
less well known were the many women immigrant and african american inventors who filed thousands of patents in this period.
for example jan matzeliger an immigrant of african and dutch heritage from south america invented a machine that simplified the most difficult and time consuming step in making shoes 16 2.
although much of shoemaking had become mechanized by the 1880s the difficult lasting process attaching the upper portion of a shoe to the sole could be done only by hand.
matzeligers lasting machine patented in 1883 was a complex device yet was easy for unskilled workers to operate allowing manufacturers to boost production while slashing costs.
government policy also boosted american industrialization.
the federal government and the states extended substantial support to railroad projects that totaled almost 180 million acres in land grants and 500 million in loans and tax breaks see chapters 13 and 15.
public officials in an argument later used to justify government support for the interstate highway system and the internet defended this largess by arguing that railroads generated economic growth that benefited everyone from travelers to farmers to manufacturers.
high federal tariffs that raised the price of imported goods thereby helping domestic manufacturers also promoted industrialization.
yet the government also facilitated industrialization by inaction.
public officials business leaders and conservatives subscribed to the philosophy of laissez faire french for let do or leave alone which argued that the government should impose no restraints on business including workers demands for laws to regulate the hours of work safety conditions and wages.
government officials also ignored reformers demands for an income tax and laws curbing cutthroat business read the document thomas edison the success of the electric light october 1880 16 2 the matzeliger lasting machine jan matzeligers complex sewing machine wiped out jobs for skilled shoe lasters who had hand stitched shoe tops to soles but allowed for a huge increase in mechanized shoe production.
as thomas nasts political cartoon vividly shows 16 3 business and government leaders argued that government interference harmed the american economy depicted here as a woman weighed down by government imposed burdens such as income taxes laws regulations and ideal money money not backed by gold.
the closed shop and idle ship in the background and the vultures circling overhead all suggested these policies would kill the economy.
widespread support for laissez faire among lawmakers left capitalists to operate in a market free of the restraints of government regulation.
16 3 defending laissez faire this 1878 cartoon warns that government interference with the economy threatens the well being of the nation.
how did government officials defend the practice of making huge land grants to the railroads.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 the railroads the most dramatic change in the late nineteenthcentury industrial economy was the emergence of large corporations business organizations established by a group of individuals and owned by people who buy shares of stock in the company.
before the civil war most american manufacturers were small scale operations with fewer than 25 employees.
they were usually privately owned and sold their products within a few hundred miles of where they were made.
all this changed after 1865 as entrepreneurs seeking bigger markets and greater profits that they could now reach thanks to the railroad and telegraph began to form massive corporations that boasted thousands of employees in a single factory complex operations in several states and millions of dollars of investment capital raised from the sales of stock.
the original big businesses were railroads and they played a key role in transforming the united states into an industrial power.
in 1865 scores of small railroad companies operated throughout the northeast and midwest and to a lesser extent the south.
comprising 35 000 miles of track they serviced small areas and established their own standards for things such as track gauge the distance between the rails.
nearly all suffered from financial instability and poor management.
but by 1900 this haphazard system had developed into a massive consolidated and integrated national railroad network of 193 000 miles dominated by just seven large corporations.
railroads grew at such a ferocious pace because they could be built almost anywhere creating a transportation network no longer confined to meandering rivers and expensive slow to construct canals that often froze in winter.
the railroad also offered another great advantage speed.
people mail and goods traveling by stagecoach might on a good day cover 50 miles.
a steam locomotive pulling many times more people mail and goods could cover the same distance in less than two hours.
and after the completion of the first trans continental line in 1869 see map 15 8 the railroad offered service from coast to coast.
the quicker and cheaper transportation offered by the railroad benefited the national economy.
railroads opened new areas of settlement enticing farmers to settle on nearby land often sold to them by the railroad confident that they could get their produce to market.
shopkeepers artisans laborers and railroad employees one million by 1900 settled in towns that sprang up along the tracks.
in turn they became consumers of finished goods brought by the railroad from eastern manufacturers.
the railroad industry also contributed to the national economy by consuming large quantities of iron steel coal and wood.
fierce competition among railroads initially led to the rapid expansion of lines.
by the 1870s many railroads tried to diminish competition by buying out rivals leading to the creation of giant corporations such as the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central railroad.
both owned thousands of miles of track in many states employed tens of thousands of workers and handled millions of dollars in investment capital and revenue.
modern business practices the success of the large railroad corporations led to the modernization of business practices in two important ways.
first railroad corporations showed other types of businesses the advantages of incorporating and issuing stock.
stock sales allowed corporations to raise capital to expand the business for example to buy new and more efficient equipment or a rival company.
if the company earned a profit stockholders benefited from an increase in the value of the stock which they could sell for a profit and sometimes by earning dividends.
stockholders played no direct role in running a company a professional management team performed that railroad time it appears is to be the time of the future.
and so people will now have to marry and die by railroad time.
ministers will preach by railroad time and banks will be required to open and close by the same time.

watch the video video lecture mastering time and space how the railroad changed america the emergence of big business function.
but stockholders also enjoyed limited liability if the company failed they were not liable for any of its debts or obligations they stood to lose only their shares.
by the 1870s many companies involved in manufacturing mining communications and finance had incorporated.
second the sudden emergence of huge railroad corporations encouraged the development of modern sophisticated management practices.
chief among these practices was standardization.
for example in 1883 the nations major railroads established the four time zones that are still in use today.
this decision helped to combat the problem of irregular local time for example when local time in new york city was 12 00 p m it might be 11 55 a m in philadelphia and 11 47 in washington d c that often led to costly accidents between trains sharing a single track or crossing at a junction.
similarly the development of standardized equipment like couplers signals and brakes allowed for easier operation and maintenance of a railroads growing fleet of rolling stock.
in 1886 the railroads also established a standard gauge for track of 4 feet 8 5 inches thereby eliminating costly delays caused by the need to transfer cargo from one train to another wherever tracks of two different gauges met.
as this drawing 16 4 indicates many americans viewed standard gauge as bringing both economic and political benefits to the nation since it promised to create both a more efficient railroad system and greater unity between the less developed south see chapter 14 with the rapidly industrializing north.
the banner the last spike of our commercial union likens the event to the 1869 completion of the transcontinental railroad.
to oversee these vast commercial operations the largest in the world executives of the major railroads such as jay gould tom scott and collis b huntington developed complex hierarchies of superintendents managers and clerks and new systems of accounting advertising information management and pricing.
other big businesses such as steel oil manufacturing and retailing soon copied these organizational practices making them the norm in most large corporations.
as the modern emblem of motion and power the pulse of the continent they delighted in the benefits of inexpensive and speedy travel and increased access to finished goods in new mail order catalogs.
yet many americans worried about the larger implications of the railroad.
this cartoon depicting rising concern over corporate power americans greeted the astonishing spread of the railroad with mixed feelings.
many agreed with poet walt whitman who celebrated the railroad 16 4 celebrating the standard gauge 1886 in this imagined scene northerners and southerners celebrate the adoption of a standard rail gauge as a measure destined to bind the country together economically.
what advantages did standardization bring to business.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 tions further tarnished the railroads image and fueled concerted efforts to curb their power.
although few critics raised the issue at the time later generations decried the railroad for its role in hastening the defeat of the plains indians and the near extermination of buffalo on which they depended see chapter 15.
growing anxiety and anger over the abusive practices of many large railroads eventually compelled reformers to seek tighter regulation of the industry.
given the immense power and wealth of the railroad and politicians reluctance to regulate business reform faced many setbacks.
farmers bitterly opposing the high rates charged by railroads to transport and store agricultural commodities led the first significant effort to curb laissez faire business practices.
known as the grange see chapter 15 it led a successful political movement in the 1870s to pass numerous laws regulating prices and outlawing unfair business practices.
andrew carnegie making steel and transforming the corporation 16 5 demonizing the monopoly americans grew increasingly worried about the rising power of railroads and the largest were often criticized as monopolies that strangled their competition.
the southern pacific railroad as a ravenous octopus 16 5 expressed their concern.
the railroads and the fabulously wealthy men who ran them shown in the eyes of the octopus wielded immense power.
the artist labeled the octopus a monopoly a popular term to describe the control of an industry or market by one corporation.
was such unchecked power vested in the hands of so few people worried the critics compatible with the nations republican principles.
many feared it was not especially when they learned that railroad executives routinely bribed state legislators members of congress and cabinet officials.
revelations of stock manipulation price gouging of farmers and manufacturers exploitation of workers shoddy construction and unsafe opera why did many americans come to see railroads as potential threats to democracy.
of all the new things produced by the explosion of industrial output after 1865 none was more important than steel.
much stronger than iron steel became the essential ingredient in the transformation of america into an industrial society allowing for the construction of the railroad and telegraph networks and tall buildings called skyscrapers steel also enabled the construction of huge factories filled with powerful machinery made from steel of course.
sharp durable and deep cutting steel plows and mechanical reapers accelerated the commercialization of american agriculture.
more accurate and powerful and thus more deadly weapons made of steel also altered modern warfare.
steel in short was as influential and revolutionary a substance in the late nineteenth century as silicon used to make computer chips was to become in the late twentieth.
steel was important in still another way for it brought to prominence the single most influential big businessman of the era andrew carnegie.
carnegies success was all the more remarkable because of his humble origins.
born in scotland in 1836 he immigrated to america with his family at age 12.
settling in pittsburgh they struggled to earn a living.
young carnegie dropped out of school and worked view the image modern colossus of rail roads 1879 the emergence of big business in a textile factory where he earned just 1 20 per finally carnegie pursued cutthroat practices week.
bright and ambitious he took night classes in to battle rival steel producers.
carnegie slashed his accounting taught himself telegraphy and worked prices to levels that bankrupted his competitors for western union.

to harvest the trees to achieve this goal carnegie hired the brightest executives railroad to bring lumber and chemicals to the paper factory and to ship the accountants managers scientists finished product to market and engineers.
he also invested heavily in the latest technology.

through horizontal integration they attempted to reduce competition by acquiring their competitors.

read the document interstate commerce act what policies contributed to andrew carnegies success in business.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 the result of carnegies business policies was astonishing bringing annual profits to 40 million by 1900.
by then carnegie steel was the largest corporation in the world with more than 20 000 employees and operations in many countries.
carnegies success was part of the larger story of the age of steel by 1900 the u s steel industry employed 272 000 workers who produced 10 4 million tons of steel an output more than twice that of its nearest rivals germany and great britain.
rockefeller and the rise of the trust carnegie was the most famous industrialist in the late nineteenth century but countless others developed key parts of the american economy.
they included entrepreneurs like philip armour and gustavus swift meat packing james b duke tobacco products george eastman kodak camera and cyrus mccormick farm equipment.
like carnegie these industry leaders and thousands more succeeded by combining vision and ruthlessness leading the public to both laud them as captains of industry who offered an ever growing number of new products and services and denounce them as robber barons greedy capitalists who grew rich by devious business practices exploitation of workers and political manipulation.
one industrialist frequently denounced as a robber baron was john d rockefeller.
his rise to dominance in the oil industry resembled that of andrew carnegie.
through relentless cost cutting acquisition of new technology hiring top notch managers and scientists and making secret deals with railroads to undermine his competition rockefellers standard oil company controlled 90 percent of the nations oil refining capacity by 1879.
unlike carnegie rockefeller initially expanded his interests via horizontal integration 16 6 focusing almost exclusively on buying or building oil refineries.
later he followed carnegies vertical integration model purchasing oil fields railroad cars and warehouses pipelines and barrel factories.
rockefellers chief contribution to the rise of big business was the invention of two new forms of corporate management the trust and the holding company.
like many industrial magnates rockefeller why did big business find trusts so useful and attractive.
paid lip service to the ideal of competition but privately he believed competition between rival companies was wasteful and led to market instability.
because so called pools secret deals between ostensibly rival companies to set production limits to keep prices high and award each participant a certain share of the market inevitably failed rockefeller devised the trust.
unlike pools which lacked any legal basis and thus carried no penalty for cheating trusts were legally binding arrangements that brought many companies in the same industry under the direction of a single board of trustees to join a trust a company turned over to a board a majority of its stock in exchange for trust certificates which guaranteed it a share of the profits.
rockefellers standard oil trust for example consisted of 40 companies under the direction of a nine member board of trustees selected by rockefeller himself.
as profits soared dozens of trusts in other industries such as sugar lead cotton and oil were formed although not all successfully.
honest labor never rusts up with labor down with trusts banner in 1889 boston labor day parade the rapid emergence of giant trusts as with the rise of large railroads alarmed many americans.
fueling this concern was the unwillingness of congress and the supreme court to curb the power of big business.
in 1886 the conservative supreme court declared that state railroad commissions did not have the authority to regulate railroads because only congress had the right to regulate interstate commerce wabash st louis pacific railway co v illinois 1886.
in a separate case santa clara county v southern pacific railroad 1886 the court also declared that corporations were de facto persons and thus subject to all the protections under the fourteenth amendment.
no state or local government therefore could impose limits on corporations without due process of law in other words approval by conservative federal courts.
the next year in 1887 congress attempted to curb the power of the railroads by establishing the interstate commerce commission icc and making pools and rebates special discounts by railroads view the image john d rockefeller cartoon 1901 the emergence of big business to favored customers illegal.
but the icc proved weak and ineffective especially in the face of a conservative supreme court.
of the 16 cases that resulted when railroads challenged a ruling by the icc between 1887 and 1905 the court sided with the railroads 15 times.
big business also benefited from enormous political influence in congress.
in this damning 1889 cartoon from the popular magazine puck the bosses of the senate 16 7 the bloated trusts are clearly in charge.
congress was all too willing to do the bidding of corporate interests.
note that the doorway marked peoples entrance is boarded shut while a much larger entrance for monopolists is wide open.
note too the bitter conclusion that big business has subverted american democracy this is a senate of the monopolists by the monopolists and for the monopolists the fate of the sherman anti trust act of 1890 seemed to verify this conclusion.
it was originally proposed to empower the justice department to prosecute any illegal contract combination or conspiracy among corporations that was designed to eliminate competition or restrain free trade.
in other words the act made trusts illegal.
but months of lobbying by corporate interests influenced congress to word the final version of the act so vaguely that it was essentially unenforceable.
as a result the justice department prosecuted only 18 antitrust cases between 1890 and 1904.
rockefellers other major corporate management innovation the holding company replaced the trust in the 1890s as the preferred big business model.
the holding company was a huge corporation that bought and ran other corporations by purchasing their stock.
rockefellers idea caught on immediately because it offered protection from the sherman act and allowed for the creation of enormous corporations many of which exercised near monopoly control of the market.
corporate mergers occurred at an astonishing pace.
by 1900 one percent of corporations controlled 33 percent of the nations manufacturing output a figure that rose to 44 percent by 1910.
the same was true of the railroads.
in 1900 seven colossal railroads controlled twothirds of the nations track mileage.
big business despite the best effort of reformers was here to stay.
16 7 the political power of the trusts reformers criticized trusts for their power to bribe and bully congress to pass favorable legislation.
here a meeklooking congress sits under the domineering gaze of the bloated trusts.
why did efforts to curb the power of trusts fail.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 creating a mass market railroads oil refineries textile factories and steel mills were the most vivid symbols of the industrial era but production was only one part of the story.
equally important was consumption getting the public to purchase the growing array of the national economys new products.
advertising would play a crucial role in creating a consumer culture as would the department store and mail order catalogs.
the art of selling to promote consumption businesses developed sophisticated advertising techniques and marketing strategies.
many hired psychologists and other experts to develop advertising campaigns that appealed to both consumers fears and their desires.
ads for toothpaste and deodorant for example stoked the publics fears about bad breath and body odor while those for pianos and fine clothing played to desires to appear sophisticated and wealthy.
advertisers also cultivated brand loyalty through catchy slogans and impressive claims.
the makers of ivory soap for example touted their products healthful qualities with the impressive but ridiculously exaggerated claim that it was 99 44100 pure recognizing the value of celebrity some manufacturers hired famous entertainers and athletes to endorse their products and allow the use of their pictures in ads.
the underlying idea of advertising spending a portion of a businesss profits to generate more profit soon became a standard business principle.
spending on advertising jumped accordingly from 50 million in 1867 to more than 500 million by 1900.
as advertising caught on among manufacturers and retailers competition led to increasingly complex and sophisticated advertisements.
gone were the days from before the civil war when advertisers relied exclusively on a few bold headlines in a newspaper or magazine and some accompanying text touting a products quality and price.
with so many advertisements jamming the pages of these media and adorning roadside signs sides of buildings and grocery store windows a products advertisement had to be eye catching convincing and memorable.
advertisers experimented with new styles and sizes of type developed catchy slogans and enlisted celebrities and experts like doctors to vouch for their product.
once developments in why did advertising become so important to business success.
print technology made it possible and affordable they focused increasingly on images to sell their products.
shopping as an experience the department store with the emergence of advertising came the department store.
irish immigrant alexander turney stewart established the first department store in new york city in 1846.
stewart and the entrepreneurs who copied his idea built giant stores that offered a huge selection of goods for sale usually organized into different departments customers also found a small army of clerks ready to assist them and fixed prices that eliminated uncomfortable negotiations.
retailers also offered attractive policies such as the money back guarantee and free delivery.
by the 1870s customers increasingly called shoppers flocked to department stores not only for the selection price and convenience but also for the experience.
retailers had discovered that it was not enough to offer the finest products at good prices.
shopping had to be a pleasurable experience so merchants built palatial richly decorated emporiums an impressive latin term meaning a store you can now buy your pins your outing shirts your wines your prayer books your indian clubs your pianolas your false teeth your automobiles and your spectacles in the same place the wall street journal 1903 view the closer look images as history advertising and the art of cultivating anxiety and desire creating a mass market that displayed a large variety of merchandise.
one of the first merchants to do so was john wanamaker who transformed a philadelphia railroad depot in 1876 into a massive and opulently decorated store called the grand depot.
rival stores soon sought to outdo each other in size and splendor and customers came to look forward to store openings.
on september 12 1896 for example 150 000 new yorkers paraded through the new siegel cooper store on opening day.
this new shopping resort as the new york times called it employed 8 000 clerks and cashiers and 1 000 drivers and packers.
it offered not only a huge selection of merchandise but also conveniences such as telegraph and long distance telephone services foreign currency exchange and stock trading and a dentist office.
as this photograph 16 8 of the central lobby shows the store also wowed shoppers with its lavish interior.
note the marble columns high decorative ceilings and the statue in the center of the republic a copy of the one carved by the renowned american sculptor daniel chester french for the 1893 worlds fair in chicago.
the success of the department store led some retail entrepreneurs to expand their operations to large regions or even the whole country.
the most noted figure in this field was frank w woolworth whose five and dime stores specialized in low prices rather than opulence.
he opened his first store in utica new york in 1879.
by 1911 he owned more than 600.
like their big business counterparts in manufacturing woolworth and other national retailers found that with size came advantages.
because he bought huge quantities of goods woolworth received big discounts from wholesalers and manufacturers that allowed him to sell his merchandise at low prices.
bringing the market to the frontier some entrepreneurs realized that despite advertising and the growth of department stores a massive retail market remained untapped rural america.
living on farms or in small towns far from cities these potential customers had money and desire to spend but lacked access to consumer goods.
in 1872 montgomery ward set out to change that.
if rural america could not get to a department store he would bring it to them in the form of a single broadsheet offering two dozen items for sale by mail order view the closer look testing clarks o n t.
spool cotton 16 8 shopping as an experience large retailers in cities built lavishly appointed shopping palaces to attract customers.
the siegel cooper store in new york city opened with great fanfare in 1896.
why did retailers spend so much money to build lavish stores.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 ward steadily expanded his list of offerings.
by 1884 his broadsheet was now a catalog featuring some 10 000 items.
by this time a rival mail order company run by richard w sears and alvah c roebuck had begun operation.
eager to reach this new market established department stores like macys in new york jordan marsh in boston and marshall fields in chicago brought out their own mail order catalogs.
the reach of corporate retailing beyond urban centers and into rural america where most americans lived until 1920 marked the emergence of a mass market.
whereas americans had long shared a common language and republican political culture they now developed a shared consumer culture.
exposed to the same advertising images and appeals millions of americans in different parts of the country began to adopt the same fashions develop the same habits cigarette smoking for example and purchase the same newfangled contraptions including more than one million bicycles a year in the 1890s.
selling to the world as the nations industrial production soared to unprecedented heights manufacturers searched for new markets for their goods.
the united states had long been an exporter of agricultural products like cotton and wheat but the leading trend after the civil war was the export of manufactured goods.
the total value of exports rose between 1870 and 1900 from 450 million to 1 5 billion with the percentage of manufactured goods rising from 15 to 32 percent.
in addition to selling produce and goods overseas american business interests also began to invest heavily in business ventures in foreign countries.
by 1897 americans had invested 635 million in overseas mines plantations oil wells and increasingly manufacturing plants 94 million.
by the 1890s the singer sewing machine co was an international corporation 16 9.
with factories in scotland and the united states singer sold its machines throughout the world.
note how the advertisements text the singer seam unites two continents and angelic female figures suggest that the company is pursuing humanitarian as well as capitalist goals.
farm equipment giant international harvester likewise opened factories in canada and sweden.
the globalization of the american economy brought many benefits to workers consumers and investors.
but it also contributed to the growing sentiment in the 1890s that the united states needed to become an imperial power to protect overseas investments and ensure that markets in asia africa and latin america remained open see chapter 19.
16 9 the globalization of american industry like many large american firms the singer sewing machine co became an international corporation by the 1890s selling its machines throughout the world.
how did advertising promote the development of a national consumer culture.
the world of work transformed the world of work transformed the huge industrial enterprises built by carnegie rockefeller and others ultimately depended not on their individual genius but on the collective labors of american workers.
as the number and size of factories grew in the late nineteenth century so did the industrial workforce expanding from 1 3 million workers in 1860 to 5 1 million in 1900.
many of them faced hardships long hours low pay dangerous conditions and frequent downturns in the economy.
workers responded by forming unions staging strikes and protesting the surging power of business as a threat to democracy.
the impact of new technology hard times for industrial workers new industrial technology greatly increased manufacturing output but it also changed the status of industrial workers.
new machines produced more goods in less time and required mostly low skilled labor to operate.
machinery transformed shoemaking for example from a skilled trade in the 1820s to a low skill factory occupation by the 1860s.
the same was true in the garment and textile industries.
because they could easily replace low skilled labor employers could pay low wages and demand long hours.
they could also simply fire or replace workers who complained or failed to keep up the pace with other unskilled workers.
this trend occurred unevenly across industrial america.
for example in building trades like carpentry and bricklaying new technology did little to undermine the position of skilled craftsmen.
in other settings new technology created new opportunities for some workers.
some found well paid skilled work as mechanics while others became foremen and floor managers who oversaw the work of unskilled operatives.
these more fortunate workers often enjoyed far higher wages shorter hours and better treatment than the unskilled.
nonetheless for many workers new industrial technology eliminated their skilled jobs in favor of unskilled ones.
just as shoemaking changed from a skilled trade in the 1820s to a low skill factory occupation by the 1860s so did the garment and textile industries.
in these settings employers enjoyed increasing power over their employees for the simple reason that unskilled workers were easily replaced.
new technology was but one of many difficulties confronting industrial workers in the age of industrialization.
most workers complained about long hours and low wages.
although averages for both varied by industry and region workers often toiled 12 hours a day six days a week for wages that barely covered basic living expenses.
by some estimates wage earners in the late nineteenth century made 400 500 per year when living decently required a minimum of 600 800.
working class families made up the difference by sending their children to work taking in boarders and bringing in home finishing work performed by women and children such as sewing buttons on new shirts.
compounding the precarious economic position of wage earners was the instability of the industrial economy.
severe depressions 1873 1877 and 1893 1897 and recessions interrupted periods of prosperity and economic growth and brought widespread business failure and high unemployment lasting years.
the severe depression of the 1870s for example resulted in the loss of more than a million jobs and nearly 50 000 businesses.
those who did keep their jobs often found their wages slashed and hours increased by employers desperate to remain solvent or ruthless enough to take advantage of rising job competition between the employed and the unemployed.
the monotony of industrial work also added to the difficulties wage earners faced.
many jobs required a laborer to perform the same task repeatedly such as pulling a lever on a metal stamping machine.
workers felt in the words of one machinist in 1883 that they were becoming part of read the document technology and the shoe industry in finchers trade review 1864 how did new technology weaken the independence of skilled workers.
chapter 16 16 10 the price of child labor because they could pay children less than one half the wages of an adult employers hired more children in the late nineteenth century depriving them of education and often exposing them to industrial hazards.
wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 the machinery a state of affairs they found very demoralizing the industrial workplace was also extremely dangerous.
every year between 1880 and 1900 35 000 workers on average were killed on the job and another 500 000 injured.
this carnage resulted in part from the monotony of factory work which led mind numbed workers to make mistakes or fall asleep.
but most injuries stemmed from the factory owners negligence.
with no laws compelling them to make their workplaces less lethal few industrialists were willing to pay for safety devices or procedures.
not until the early twentieth century did most states begin enacting laws requiring compensation be paid to injured workers or the families of killed workers see chapter 18.
another disturbing trend was the sharp rise in child labor.
before the industrial revolution children of farmers and artisans performed all sorts of work that contributed to the family economy but always under the supervision of a parent or relative.
children working in industry however left their homes to work in factories and mines under the supervision of a manager rather than a parent.
between 1870 and 1900 the number of children younger than 16 working for wages usually a fraction of those paid adults skyrocketed from 700 000 to 1 7 million.
children as young as seven toiled long hours in dangerous conditions in mines and factories at jobs that exposed them to dangerous and unhealthful conditions.
the boy in this photograph 16 10 lost his arm while operating a power saw in a box factory.
many states passed laws prohibiting child labor but they rarely enforced them.
exploitation intimidation and conflict of the end central to the transformation in the lives workers ushered in by industrialization was the increasing power exercised by employers in the workplace.
since profit was their paramount goal employers imposed strict discipline on their workers.
clock dominated the workplace as employers demanded workers begin and their day with a few short scheduled breaks at precise times.
workers who why were industrial workplaces so dangerous.
arrived late or took unauthorized breaks were fined or fired.
some factories forbade workers to talk to one another or even to whistle.
i make about three dollars a week and my sister she is only six years old she does not make as much sometimes a dollar a week sometimes more an eight year old child laborer new york 1871 enforcing these new rules was an increasingly important figure in the industrial workplace the manager or foreman.
in sharp contrast to the early nineteenth century preindustrial economy few workers now ever saw let alone spoke to their employer.
instead they dealt with managers or foremen hired to run a factory as efficiently and profitably as possible.
this meant pushing workers to meet production goals and firing those who could not keep up or caused trouble.
many foremen came from working class backgrounds and treated workers fairly but others could be abusive especially to workers of a different ethnic background.
female workers were particularly vulnerable to abuse.
in this drawing from 1888 the foreman in a garment factory shakes his fist at a weary woman urging her to work faster 16 11.
in the larger inset the overworked woman sprawls on a bed in a dingy tenement.
that this image ran under the sensational title the female slaves of new york in a popular newspaper that often expressed hostility toward workers indicates the notoriety the foreman had achieved in the garment industry by the late nineteenth century.
workers also found it difficult to organize labor unions.
the first major effort to build a national labor movement after the civil war began in 1866 when william sylvis a charismatic iron molder founded the national labor union nlu.
a federation of independent craft unions the nlu sought to unite skilled workers nationwide to secure demands such as a federal law establishing the eight hour day and a federal department of labor.
its membership topped 300 000 nearly all native born white men in skilled trades read the document massachusetts bureau of statistics of labor from the working girls of boston 1884 the world of work transformed 16 11 exploiting female workers shop floor foremen and managers became increasingly important as workplaces grew bigger.
as demands for productivity grew female workers were especially vulnerable to abusive foremen.
the threat of overwork to the health of women is emphasized in the two insets.
one depicts workers carrying heavy bundles of work home while another shows an exhausted laborer collapsed on her bed.
but sylviss sudden death that year weakened the nlu and the depression of the 1870s wiped it out.
most employers saw unions as threats to their profits and freedom to run their businesses as they wanted.
many hired spies to expose labor organizers so they could fire them and put them on blacklists lists of workers that employers in a town or industry refused to hire because they were considered trouble makers.
during strikes employers routinely hired replacement workers and enjoyed the support of local officials who ordered policemen to drive away or arrest pickets gathered outside a workplace.
if a labor dispute went to court an employer could normally count on a favorable ruling by a judge or jury.
on top of all this workers faced one over riding problem few unions had the resources to support striking workers for more than a few weeks.
strikers one worker attested have had nothing to combat capital with except their empty stomachs while the capitalists have had unlimited financial resources and have been able to starve the workingmen into submission rising worker frustration and anger led to more strikes and violence.
between 1881 and 1905 six million american workers participated in nearly 37 000 strikes.
one particularly bitter incident took place in pennsylvania.
in response to the abusive policies of coal mine bosses in the 1860s miners had formed a union called the workingmens benevolent association wba.
many of its members were irish immigrants some of whom drawing on the tradition of secret societies that resisted oppressive landlords in ireland formed a clandestine labor organization known as the molly maguires that carried out acts of intimidation vandalism violence and murder against foremen and managers.
in 1874 mine owners set out to destroy the wba by convincing the public that it was one and the same as the molly maguires.
within a year this campaign resulted in more than 50 arrests and numerous convictions many on questionable testimony and with little or no evidence.
twenty alleged molly maguires were hanged for murder including ten on a single day june 21 1877.
note how in this drawing 16 12 public officials created a powerful public spectacle to emphasize the mens guilt and aware that 16 12 the pageantry of execution on june 21 1877 black thursday pennsylvania officials staged carefully planned executions of ten convicted miners known as molly maguires.
why were employers so hostile to labor unions.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 most of the regions miners were catholic their sinfulness.
three weeks later on july 14 1877 the largest nineteenth century strike in the world erupted.
the great uprising of railroad workers began in martinsburg west virginia and quickly spread to baltimore philadelphia pittsburgh st louis chicago and other cities.
the strike involved thousands of workers and violence emanated from both sides.
in pittsburgh for example soldiers opened fire on striking workers and their families killing 25 and wounding 29.
enraged strikers and their supporters attacked the troops and destroyed all of the pennsylvania railroad terminals buildings and other property.
the mainstream press criticized the railroads for slashing workers wages but most dismissed labor activism as illegal ill informed and un american.
see competing visions the legitimacy of unions.
while workers faced hostility from employers politicians and journalists they also had to contend with animosity within the ranks of labor that often hindered their ability to organize.
deep hostility often existed between skilled and unskilled workers who frequently saw little in common with each other.
workers were also riven by disputes arising from different ideologies including varieties of socialism a theory that rejected capitalism and advocated common ownership of private property and greater social and economic equality.
they also argued the persistent question of whether workers interests were best served by pressuring the major political parties or by forming an independent labor party.
perhaps the most significant divisions among workers centered on race and ethnicity.
a rising tide of immigration in the late nineteenth century increased the ethnic racial and religious diversity of an already diverse workforce making it more difficult to unite them in common cause.
for example when hard times hit during the depression of the 1870s anti chinese sentiment among american workers soared leading to the chinese exclusion act in 1882 barring chinese immigration to the united states.
as the cartoon 16 13 from the wasp demonstrates chinese workers were blamed for taking jobs from americans.
the artist depicts a 12 armed chinese worker drawn in racist caricature laboring maniacally at a dozen tasks while young american born workers stand idly near a factory.
one of the workers is being hauled away by a policeman implying that unemployment has led him to a life of crime.
african american workers also faced racist hostility from white workers especially when they began moving to northern cities in the 1890s.
much of this hostility stemmed from the widely held racist beliefs of the day including the concept that all whites were superior to blacks.
but it also emanated from the fear that african americans would take jobs from white workers a fear exacerbated when employers occasionally used black workers as strikebreakers.
16 13 hard times fuel anti chinese racism during the depression of 1873 1878 workers blamed high unemployment on chinese immigrants whom they accused of working long shifts for low wages.
why were industrial workers so divided.
read the document chinese exclusion act the world of work transformed competing visions the legitimacy of unions although conflict between workers and their employers often centered on wages and hours it also occurred over the legitimacy of labor unions.
many americans denounced unions as illegal foolish and un american.
the editor of scribners monthly writing after the 1877 great uprising of railroad workers reflects this view as does the image from puck.
workers and their advocates like john swinton editor of a pro labor newspaper in new york offered a different vision of labor unions as vital organizations that protected workers from the exploitation.
why did employers find unions so objectionable even dangerous.
what benefits did workers see in unions.
scribners monthly october 1877 john swintons paper january 27 1884 and now that it is over it is a good time to ask once more what good has come from this strike and what good has come of any strike.
the laws of nature which after all govern the laws of trade can never be overcome or circumvented by a strike.
labor will always command its value no more no less strikes are always mistakes they are often crimes.
the day of the inauguration of trades unions and labor organizations in this country was a day the blackest and fullest of menace to the popular prosperity and peace that ever dawned upon the nation.
they have been an unmitigated curse to employers and employed alike.
the nature and purpose of these organizations are simply outrageous.
they have been despotic toward their own members oppressive toward the class in whose interest they pretend to have been established impertinent and intermeddling.
they have assumed the right to control property and business in which they had no more right than if they lived in the moon.
there should be in the good sense of the great mass of laborers a reaction against this wretched crime and this stupendous foolishness.
there are many who cannot understand why trades unions exist here.
they have heard them described as alien to the american craftsman causing strikes and raising ill feeling generally between employer and employe e.
in the present state of industry trade unions are a necessity recognized as such by the great majority of intelligent workmen and securing for their members a partial degree of protection without which they would sink into depths as yet unfathomed.
there is a hue and cry against the unions as agencies that provoke strikes.
in nine cases out of ten strikes are made necessary by circumstances over which the unions have no control whatever sometimes they are a protest against unendurable reductions in wages sometimes by unjust conduct on the part of bosses or corporations.
no union to day orders a strike that can be avoided by reasonable means no union orders a strike without full consideration of the subject and after a fair vote but we are told that no strike ever brings any advantage to the strikers this is a mistake that cannot be made by any one who has observed the results of strikes either in the united states or in any other country but strikes often fail yes it is true.
capital often triumphs in the conflict with labor true again.
yet capital would be even harsher and more exacting than it is if it were not for the protest of the strike and the warning that it gives.
the wages which in many industries are but little above the living point would be put down and kept down to the starvation point if the men accepted with submissive spirit every reduction of wages and all the severe terms that capital tries to enforce.
this puck magazine cartoon from the mid 1880s portrayed labor union officials as tyrants who hurt the interests of workers.
why did labor activists argue that unions were defensive in nature.

whereas just 13 percent of women worked outside the home in 1870 20 percent did so by 1900.
nearly all these women were single and younger than 25.
domestic service cooking cleaning and childcare in the homes of middleand upper class families remained the leading occupation for wage earning women in this period but many also took on factory work especially in the garment and textile industries.
like their male counterparts women factory workers labored at repetitive tasks for long hours in unsafe conditions but for only half or less the wages of men.
employers justified this disparity by claiming women worked merely for extra money whereas men worked to support whole families and therefore deserved higher pay.
in fact many working class families depended for their survival on the earnings of wives and daughters.
factory owners simply paid them less because women were powerless to prevent it.
the emergence of modern corporations requiring armies of secretaries clerks and stenographers combined with the invention of the telephone adding machine and typewriter created new opportunities for educated native born white women 16 14.
teaching social work and as indicated in the graduation photograph of the philadelphia school for nurses 16 15 nursing emerged in the late nineteenth century as almost exclusively female professions.
although these fields represented new opportunities for women they were deemed appropriate because they drew on what was widely believed to be womens natural role as nurturers.
the pageantry evident in this photograph especially the bright white and highly professional looking uniforms the elegant setting of the philadelphia academy of music and the presence of red cross founder clara barton seated at center indicates the high reputation the profession had achieved by 1900.
regardless of the level of work social custom dictated that women leave the paid workforce soon after they married only five percent of married women worked outside the home in 1900.
of necessity working class women continued to earn money to support their families.
only now they did so from within the home by taking in boarders laundry and piece work which paid by the piece rather than by the hour.
many more african american women more out of economic necessity than custom remained in the paid workforce even after marriage.
in urban areas in both the north and south many worked as domestic servants in white homes cooking cleaning doing the laundry and caring for children.
these jobs required long hours and paid low wages but racist hiring policies in industry and other sectors of the economy left african american women with few options.
16 15 women find opportunities in nursing these graduates of the philadelphia school for nurses with red cross founder clara barton at center were among the thousands of young women in the late nineteenth century who became nurses.

for many it was an age of wonder marked by a succession of new inventions ideas and possibilities.
yet one did not have to look far for signs of anxiety fear and discontent.
numerous critics offered a different vision of society emphasizing the growing poverty gaps between rich and poor and inequality.
capitalism championed many americans in the late nineteenth century celebrated industrial capitalism.
proponents noted that every year american industry produced more consumer goods from inexpensive clothing in a dizzying array of colors and styles to exciting new products like phonographs and bicycles.
it also generated new forms of transportation that allowed people including the poor to travel to new and different places.
in farming industrial technology led to stupendous annual harvests falling food prices and a more varied diet for the average american whose life expectancy rose from a mere 38 3 years for white men in 1850 to 50 years by 1910.
the telegraph telephone and steampowered printing press allowed for the unprecedented spread of information and literacy aided by an expanded public school system.
and despite unrest depressions and strikes real wages for the average worker rose 50 percent between 1860 and 1900 74 percent for skilled workers and 31 percent for unskilled.
to these optimists industrial capitalism meant progress.
of the enthusiastic champions of the new industrial order none was more fervent and influential than andrew carnegie.
he offset his harddriving corporate style with a carefully constructed public image designed to set him apart from many of his fellow industrialists who angered the public with arrogant pronouncements.
the shipping and railroad magnate cornelius vanderbilt for example once brushed aside the suggestion that his business practices violated the law by saying law.
what do i care about the law.
aint i got the power read the document andrew carnegie wealth in countless speeches and articles in prominent magazines carnegie defended the status quo and emphasized its virtues.
rejecting the claims of critics that industrialists like him were greedy abusive monopolists he insisted they were visionaries who built key industries that brought immeasurable benefits to americans including jobs for workers and products that improved the quality of life.
granted carnegie explained in what he came to call the gospel of wealth he and other entrepreneurs had grown fabulously rich but this was a necessary and beneficial result of a free economy.
without the hope of future riches business leaders would not have the incentive to seek new opportunities take risks and develop new products.
i can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half financier and railroad magnate jay gould carnegie and other champions of big business also emphasized that industrial fortunes could be and increasingly were used to fund philanthropic projects such as schools and libraries.
in the 1880s and 1890s he emerged as the nations most ostentatious philanthropist.
in 1901 he sold his steel empire to financier j p morgan for 400 million and then donated most of it to various causes including thousands of public libraries.
for a man who was both conservative and optimistic libraries appeared the perfect form of charity because they how did business leaders like carnegie defend industrial capitalism.
chapter 16 16 16 the carnegie library and floor plan in lincoln nebraska as a symbol of the virtue of industrial capitalism and the spirit of individual uplift steel magnate andrew carnegie funded nearly 1 700 public libraries in america.
the exterior designs reflected the popularity of classical styles circa 1900.
the interiors emphasized the industrial values of order and efficiency.
wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 provided ambitious hard working and intelligent people opportunities to better themselves instead of handouts.
this carnegie library 16 16 built in lincoln nebraska in 1901 typified the more than 2 500 1 689 in the united states libraries funded by carnegie between 1886 and 1929.
communities awarded a library were allowed to pick their own architectural style.
most like lincoln opted for some variation on the popular neoclassical style.
but carnegie and the staff that oversaw the program insisted that library interiors stress efficiency and order the values reflected in the design of his steel factories.
note how the floor plan allowed for a single centrally located librarian seated at the curved desk in the center to monitor all the neatly organized spaces devoted to reading children reference and stacks.
when carnegie and other defenders of industrial capitalism were asked about the growing problem of poverty amid such progress they pointed to what they claimed was the greatest virtue of a capitalist economy the self made man.
as carnegies own life story seemed to attest anyone regardless of birthplace family education or poverty could climb the ladder of success.
success was not guaranteed noted carnegie.
but for those who possessed self discipline intelligence frugality and diligence and who avoided liquor and debt the future was bright.
aiding andrew carnegie and other optimists in spreading this ideal of the self made man was horatio alger.
a former minister alger wrote more than 100 young adult books beginning with ragged dick in 1868.
all featured similar plots that told the story of a young boy often a bootblack or a delivery boy who lived a life of poverty and irresponsibility on the mean streets of a big city.
through the intervention why was the self made man idea so popular in the age of industry.
of a respectable man the boy discovers that he need only end his prodigal ways and pursue education and opportunity to enjoy the good life.
alger sold millions of books and imitators churned out similar publications including the popular fame and fortune magazine 16 17.
as this cover shows each issue offered dramatic stories of boys who make money by exhibiting honesty diligence and courage.
not all conservative defenders of industrial capitalism shared algers rosy vision of a society where anyone willing to work hard save money and avoid liquor could find success.
they subscribed to a theory known as social darwinism a corruption of charles darwins biological theory of natural selection later termed evolution.
british philosopher and sociologist herbert spencer took darwins central idea that in evolution plants and animals that are able to adapt to changing conditions survive while those that cannot become extinct and tailored it to fit his idea of modern industrial society as survival of 16 17 the promise of success taking their cue from the success of horatio algers success in writing scores of young adult novels many imitators published similar books and magazines preaching that reward and respectability could be won if only one worked hard told the truth and helped the less fortunate.

and the poor.
they were the unfit men and women consigned by nature to failure misery and early death.
to impose government regulation on business social darwinists argued was both immoral and impractical an affront to the laws of nature and god.
they also attacked any initiatives public or private to alleviate the plight of the poor because they would promote the survival and growth of the unfit population with devastating consequences for society.
parents fail to notice the shivering children as they pass.
many commentators in this period focused on the profound extremes of wealth and poverty found in two new york city neighborhoods fifth avenue and five points.
in the former neighborhood were the homes of the stewarts vanderbilts astors morgans and carnegies.
they patronized the opulent metropolitan opera house entertained each other at lavish balls and dinners and summered in their 50 room cottages in coastal retreats like newport rhode island.
just a few miles downtown was a notorious district called the five points.
in this neighborhood and the surrounding lower east side district nearly one million people lived in tiny airless tenement apartments with no running water or toilets.
their neighborhoods had no parks and the streets were filled with filth due to irregular street cleaning.
reformers ministers and social critics began to question whether american democracy with its ideals of equal rights and individual freedom could endure under such inequality and enslaving poverty.
for example a self taught political economist named henry george wrote progress and capitalism criticized despite these confident assertions on the morality and virtue of laissez faire industrial capitalism critics decried the widening chasm between rich and poor.
while some 4 000 americans had become millionaires by the early 1890s millions of others lived in poverty or perilously close to it.
a tour of any city provided ample evidence of what some called the haves and the have nots a concern vividly captured in this 1876 image 16 18 from a popular magazine.
its caption the hearth stone of the poor and accompanying article pointed out that many of the poor unlike the wealthy family on the left had no warm fireplace around which to gather on cold nights.
instead like these children they gathered around outdoor steam vents to keep warm.
note how the wealthy 16 18 the growing gap between the haves and have nots this image the hearth stone of the poor from the popular magazine harpers weekly february 12 1876 captured the growing concern among americans over the growth of poverty amid rising levels of wealth.
why was the theory of social darwinism so attractive to the wealthy and successful.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 poverty an influential book that addressed one of the central questions of the age must industrial and technological progress be accompanied by increased poverty.
if so he warned american democracy was doomed.
george claimed that the monopolization of resources especially of land by powerful elites was to blame for the eras growing social inequality and class conflict.
few people understood or supported georges unorthodox solution a single tax on land values but his vivid diagnosis of the rising clash between labor and capital and his vision of a more equitable social order gained him an enormous following in the 1880s and turned progress and poverty into a bestseller.
edward bellamy achieved similar fame as a critic of laissez faire capitalism with his novel looking backward 2000 1887.
published in 1887 it told the story of julian west who like rip van winkle in another era falls asleep in 1887 and awakens in 2000.
to his astonishment he finds american society transformed into a socialist utopia.
the class conflict poverty and economic inequality of the late nineteenth century are gone.
the government controlled the economy eliminating destructive competition and providing a comfortable living for all citizens.
bellamys book became a bestseller and his largely middle class followers established nearly 500 clubs to spread its message.
power in numbers organized labor less famous but more influential than critics like george and bellamy were the protests of those most buffeted by the industrial revolution workers.
through the pages of labor newspapers and in speeches at worker rallies and in actions such as strikes american workers articulated a sharp critique of the new industrial order.
a few were socialists but most supported the broad ideals of a free market economy.
their protest stemmed from the growing conviction that greedy monopolists in league with unscrupulous politicians had seized control of the economy and bent it toward their own advantage.
as a result argued workers they received a shrinking portion of the wealth they created while working longer hours in increasingly inhumane conditions.
try as they might these workers claimed the upward mobility celebrated by what conditions led to rapid membership growth in the knights of labor.
andrew carnegie and horatio alger was less and less attainable.
unsettled and angered by their declining power in the face of big business american workers renewed their efforts to organize labor unions.
in 1869 philadelphia garment cutters formed the noble and holy order of the knights of labor kol an organization that called for many of the same reforms as the nlu but added a long list of radical even utopian goals.
for example it advocated replacing the existing competitive industrial system with an economy based on cooperation.
in addition unlike the nlus emphasis on craft workers the kol was an industrial union open to all workers including unskilled wage earners immigrants and eventually women and african americans.
its leaders believed that fundamental social change was impossible unless this broad spectrum of workers joined forces.
to overcome employer hostility the organization adopted a policy of strict secrecy that necessitated holding meetings in clandestine locations.
this requirement however combined with the depression of 1873 1877 hindered its growth.
by 1879 it counted just 10 000 members most in pennsylvania.
but two key developments that year propelled the kol to become the worlds largest industrial union.
first the national economy recovered providing wage earners with a measure of economic security that allowed them to form and join local unions in huge numbers.
second a young machinist named terence powderly became the kols leader or grandmaster workman.
powderly was a superb organizer and gifted orator who in 1882 abolished the kols secrecy rule a decision that made it possible to recruit thousands of new members and fend off accusations from employers politicians and religious leaders that the kol was a sinister and conspiratorial organization.
membership soared to 42 000 in 1882 on its way to an eventual peak of more than 700 000 in late 1886.
what drew many workers to the organization was the kols sharp critique of laissez faire capitalism and emphasis on economic justice and democracy.
its constitution decried the recent alarming development and aggression of aggregated wealth by industrialists bankers and stock speculators warning that it would soon lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses see images as history why fear big business read the document henry george progress and poverty conflicting visions of industrial capitalism images as history why fear big business.
people retain its legitimacy when big business exercised so much power and answered to no public officials and no voters.
other americans focused on the plight of the worker under such a system.
how could workers resist the power of large employers to slash wages increase hours and ignore safety issues.
could the united states endure as a republic if these citizens were reduced to desperate poverty while a few wealthy families reveled in luxury.
these concerns are on full display in this vivid political cartoon from puck magazine.
as large corporations emerged in the gilded age the late nineteenth century period of rapid economic growth many americans grew concerned about their power and influence.
some focused on the fact that large corporations and the immensely powerful men that ran them people like john d rockefeller and william h vanderbilt operated beyond the control of laws and democratic institutions.
did this not mean they asked that the republic was in danger.
how could a democracy a society governed by the will of the the artist represents the horse of monopoly as a huge golden locomotive.
railroads were the original big businesses and the largest corporations.
they were also at the center of the eras biggest corruption scandals and strikes.
in contrast the shoeless american worker sits on a scrawny horse labeled poverty big business and monopoly are depicted as a knight a symbol of european aristocracy and the antithesis of republicanism.
his plume carries the word arrogance note how this figure stands in sharp contrast with the much smaller humble worker.
in a section labeled reserved for capitalists sits a collection of the nations most powerful businessmen including cyrus field william h vanderbilt and jay gould.
note the joy they seem to take in seeing the american worker destroyed.
this huge seemingly endless crowd symbolizes the american people who clearly outnumber the handful of capitalists on the left.
observe how small the people are compared to the industrialists.
note too how most of the crowd looks anxious or angry at what is happening some shake their fists and how some of the children appear malnourished.
one of the most significant aspects of this image is its source.
subscribers to puck were overwhelmingly middle and upper class.
this shows that the rising fear of big business in the gilded age was not confined to low wage factory workers.
it was shared by a large cross section of the american people.
the vast disparity in power is captured in the weapons brought to the fight.
the knight holds a shield labeled corruption of the legislature suggesting corporate titans ability to bribe state and federal elected officials to ensure laws favorable to business.
in his other hand he holds a lance labeled subsidized press indicating the power of big business to buy favorable coverage in the newspapers.
the lowly worker in contrast holds only one weapon the strike.
why did so many americans come to fear big business in the gilded age.
chapter 16 16 19 establishing labor day in 1882 workers in new york city held the first local labor day celebration.
it soon became a national holiday.
wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 these sentiments and spirit of protest inspired workers in new york city many of them kol members to establish the labor day holiday in september 1882.
the organizers took care to present workers as orderly and dignified marching in almost military fashion 16 19.
yet they also held aloft signs voicing their grievances abolish contract labor and 8 hours to constitute a days work and announcing their intent to reclaim their influence in the political system vote for the labor ticket.
others proclaimed the importance of workers labor creates all wealth and labor pays all taxes and in an age of growing economic inequality reminded the spectators of key american principles all men are created equal.
the annual labor day holiday quickly gained popularity.
by 1886 it was a national event and in 1894 president grover cleveland signed a law establishing labor day as a holiday for all federal workers.
another significant aspect of the kols vision albeit one that was not embraced in every part of the country especially the south was its inclusion of african american workers as members.
many in the kols leadership argued that the union why did so many workers find the knights of labor appealing.
must include all workers including blacks because employers would inevitably use them against organized labor to break strikes and lower wages.
this same argument for inclusion led the kol to allow women members.
as a result in an era when labor unions were almost exclusively the domain of white men in 1886 ten percent of the kols membership was women and another ten percent was african american.
many workers also joined the kol because it emphasized practical goals.
its constitution called for the eight hour workday equal pay for men and women the establishment of state bureaus of labor and the prohibition of child and convict labor.
the kol also gained enormous support among workers because it led successful strikes.
but the decision to strike was difficult and risky.
see choices and consequences to strike or not to strike.
most strikes in this period were small and local but on several occasions the kol enjoyed success on a grand scale.
in 1885 kol affiliated railroad workers won a strike against the wabash railroad owned by financier jay gould a man widely despised and view the map interactive map organizing american labor in the late nineteenth century conflicting visions of industrial capitalism choices and consequences to strike or not to strike.
most strikes in the late nineteenth century failed but the surge in labor activism and the emergence of the knights of labor in the 1880s boosted confidence among workers that strikes could succeed.
in the summer of 1881 the hundreds of male shoemakers in the knights local assembly 64 successfully opposed a wage reduction by the mundell company in philadelphia.
management then imposed a rate cut on its female shoemakers.
one of the workers mary stirling urged the workers men and women to strike until the company rescinded the wage cut.
the workers at the mundell company considered essentially three major options choices fearing for their jobs male and female workers refuse to strike.
seeking to protect their recent victory the men remain on the job while the women walk out.
recognizing their mutual interests in opposing wage cuts for all workers the male and female workers agree to strike together.
decision inspired by the kol motto an injury to one is the concern of all the 700 men and women of the mundell factory decided on option 3 walking out at mary stirlings urging.
the strike lasted weeks during which time the female workers formed their own kol local assembly even though the union did not yet enroll female members.
strikers organized pickets rallies and fundraisers to help pay for food and rent.
consequences the mundell company facing lost profits and pressure to settle from other factory owners who feared worker unrest rescinded the wage cut.
the victory boosted the confidence of the workers and the reputation of the kol locally.
within three years the shoe industry alone had 11 local assemblies that managed to win many struggles with employers over wages firings and work rules.
even more important later in 1881 mary stirling attended the national convention of the kol and convinced the organization to admit women.
by 1887 ten percent of the kols 700 000 members were women.
the mundell shoe company was one of the nations leading footwear manufacturers in the late nineteenth century continuing controversies how should organized labor deal with the rising number of women in the workforce.
the admission of women into the kol did not end the opposition of many american workers to the rights of women to work and join unions.
they continued to argue that keeping women out of the workforce would open up jobs for men and raise overall wages.
when the kol fell apart in the 1890s the status of women in the labor movement fell with it.
the american federation of labor the organization that succeeded the kol admitted few female members until well into the twentieth century.
what made strikes so risky for workers.
chapter 16 wonder and woe the rise of industrial america 1865 1900 feared by workers.
elsewhere the kol popularized the boycott the organized effort to discourage customers from patronizing a business engaged in antilabor activity as an effective labor tactic less costly and risky than a strike.
as the kols membership and influence grew in the mid 1880s it alarmed employers politicians and conservatives who feared its radical rhetoric of class conflict and demands for economic reform.
they denounced powderly and other kol leaders as radical socialists bent on promoting violence and class warfare.
although both accusations were false they made many americans including many wage earners leery of the kol and of organized labor.
the great upheaval of 1886 fear of the kol in particular and the labor movement in general peaked in 1886.
on may 1 340 000 workers across the country staged a one day work stoppage to bring attention to their demand for the eight hour day.
three days later a far more serious incident occurred that would hurt the labor movement for decades.
outraged by the killing of striking workers outside the mccormick reaper works in chicago the citys radical labor leaders called a mass meeting in haymarket square on may 4.
when 300 policemen moved in to disperse the crowd a bomb exploded amid their ranks.
the enraged police attacked the crowd with guns and batons.
in less than 20 minutes seven policemen lay dead most an investigation would show from shots fired by fellow officers along with four workers.
the press quickly dubbed the incident the haymarket riot and especially when accompanied by images such as this one 16 20 the incident stoked vehement opposition to organized labor.
note the placement of the dead policemen in a sort of martyrs pantheon above a riot scene depicting murderous rioters being gunned down.
the next day as hysterical headlines across the nation proclaimed that revolution was at hand chicago police arrested eight men all selfproclaimed anarchists and charged them with 16 20 the haymarket incident 1886 the haymarket incident sparked a nationwide backlash against organized labor.
newspapers ran images like this one in which martyred policemen hover over a scene where murderous rioters are gunned down.
what role did the press play in promoting a negative impression of labor unions.
read the document george engel address by a condemned haymarket anarchist 1886 conflicting visions of industrial capitalism murder.
after a hasty trial in which even the prosecution conceded that no one had seen the men throw a bomb all were convicted.
seven were sentenced to death and one to life imprisonment.
four were hanged one committed suicide in his cell.
in 1893 illinois elected a pro labor governor who pardoned the remaining three declaring they had not received a fair trial.
haymarket created a climate of fear and provided justification for officials across the nation to crack down on the labor movement.
throughout the spring and summer of 1886 hundreds of labor activists were arrested 100 in new york city alone.
in response workers across the nation formed labor parties and ran candidates for offices from city councilor to governor.
most candidates lacked the money or experience to win but there were notable surprises.
for example chicagos united labor party polled 25 000 votes of 92 000 cast and elected a state senator and seven state assemblymen.
in milwaukee the peoples party elected a mayor a state senator six state assemblymen and a congressman.
in one of the most widely watched contests henry george the reformer and author of progress and poverty finished a close second in the mayors race in new york city out polling republican theodore roosevelt who finished a distant third.
however the unity and hope expressed by workers at the polls in november 1886 were soon undermined.
first the tumult of 1886 brought to the fore the dissatisfaction of many skilled workers within the kol.
deeming the organization too strike prone and too influenced by socialists and radicals who after haymarket brought organized labor unwanted criticism 25 unions of skilled workers convened in columbus ohio in december 1886 and founded the american federation of labor afl.
the more radical activists within the kol also grew dissatisfied with powderlys leadership decrying his growing opposition to strikes and political action.
anti labor hysteria in the press and legal repression following haymarket further weakened the labor movement.
membership in the kol dwindled rapidly from 700 000 in 1886 to only 100 000 by 1890.
national leadership of the labor movement after 1886 fell to the new afl.
comprised exclusively of unions of skilled workers and led by cigar maker samuel gompers the afl shunned the kols idealistic goal of industrial cooperation.
instead it accepted capitalism and the wage system and focused on what it termed pure and simple goals higher wages shorter hours and job security.
the afl also refused to organize unskilled workers arguing that they were too weak and unreliable.
they similarly excluded with a few exceptions women african americans and recent immigrants.
the afl grew to 1 6 million members by 1904.
however its narrowed vision and conservative approach to the labor question would leave the growing numbers of less skilled industrial workers without a national voice until the 1930s.
these divisions within the labor movement reflected the dramatic and often controversial changes industrialization brought to the united states after 1865.
many americans prospered in this period but others found themselves working in dangerous factories for long hours and meager wages.
as a result this period was marked by vigorous debates about economic justice social equality and the proper role of government in regulating the economy and protecting the rights and well being of its most vulnerable citizens.
these debates that would continue into the next century.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 hundreds of thousands of people including president chester a arthur and countless dignitaries participated in the joyful ceremonies marking the opening of the brooklyn bridge on may 23 1883.
as this painting of the event demonstrates americans in the late nineteenth century celebrated the onset of the urban age.
an astonishing sight and the very embodiment of the modern age it was the worlds largest suspension bridge a style made possible by the one product that in many ways defined the industrial revolution steel.
the bridges designer german immigrant john roebling emphasized this transition to the modern age by using a stark contrast he constructed the bridges twin towers out of the ancient building material stone and formed them into gothic archways a style reminiscent of the great medieval cathedrals of europe.
the brooklyn bridge embodied the new urban and industrial era beyond its cutting edge technology and symbolic design.
workers who were either immigrants or the children of immigrants constructed the bridge.
by connecting the nations largest city new york and third largest city brooklyn a prelude to their consolidation into one city in 1898 the new bridge also symbolized rapid urban growth.
finally the bridge hinted at the emergence of a new more independent american woman.
when washington roebling who had succeeded his father as chief engineer fell gravely ill in 1872 his wife emily warren roebling spent the next 11 years as the projects onsite manager.
the enthusiasm that marked the bridges opening masked the grave problems that rampant urban growth entailed.
indeed the eras name the gilded age reflected this notion that the amazing achievements of the period were like a thin gold layer that covered many unresolved social problems.
the sections of new york and brooklyn connected by the bridge for example were vast working class immigrant districts beset by high rates of poverty crime and disease.
equally unseen in the glow of the fireworks was the rising discontent among american workers over exploitation by employers and alienation from an unresponsive political system.
indeed dozens of men had died during the bridges construction and more than once the workers went on strike.
these sentiments and those of hard pressed american farmers in the heartland would explode in the 1890s leading to the emergence of the peoples party.
the party eventually faded away but not before establishing a reform agenda that would shape the progressive era 1900 1920.
the day seems brought distinctly nearer when the nation equipped with the latest implements furnished by science shall master and use as never before its rich domain rev.
richard storrs speech at the opening of the brooklyn bridge chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 the rise of the city the united states experienced explosive urban growth in the second half of the nineteenth century.
industrialization and mass immigration transformed older cities such as new york and philadelphia and newer ones such as denver and chicago into major metropolises.
their growth was often chaotic and attended by significant increases in crime poverty and epidemics.
city political machines grew powerful providing relief to the vulnerable and promoting urban growth but earning a reputation for corruption.
to the cities the urban population of the united states grew at an astonishing rate between 1860 and 1900.
in 1860 one in five americans lived in urban areas by 1900 two in five.
in that same period the number of cities with populations greater than 100 000 soared from 9 to 38.
among these were new york 3 4 million chicago 2 7 million and philadelphia 1 3 million.
seventy eight other cities had 50 000 or more inhabitants by 1900.
much of this new urban population came from rural areas within the united states.
as agriculture became more mechanized see chapter 15 thereby lowering demand for farm labor men migrated to urban areas.
similarly the rise of american manufacturing eliminated the need for rural women to make clothes and other household goods leading many to seek economic opportunity in cities.
these men and women found an array of job opportunities in the city from low paid work as factory operatives laborers and servants to more desirable positions as skilled artisans and clerks.
they also were faced with the challenge of adjusting to an utterly new lifestyle.
1880 1889 17 1 immigration to the united states 1880 1920 before 1880 most immigrants to the united states came from northern and western europe but after 1880 most were from southern and eastern europe.

drawn by word of better jobs and greater freedoms some 300 000 migrated to northern cities between 1890 and 1910.
chicagos african american population jumped from 15 000 in 1890 to 110 000 in 1920.
this marked the beginning of what became known as the great migration the relocation of some 7 million african americans from the south to the north between 1890 and 1970.
however the greatest source of urban population growth was mass immigration from europe with significant numbers also from latin america the caribbean and asia.
before 1880 most immigrants to the united states came from britain ireland germany and scandinavia.
thereafter the sources of immigration shifted to nations in southern and eastern europe such as russia italy greece and austriahungary 17 1.

why did so many people flock to american cities.
read the document adna weber the growth of cities the rise of the city persecution and natural disasters.
but most were drawn by the promise of economic opportunity and upward mobility in america.
some migrated to rural areas and became farmers but most headed for americas cities with their ever expanding number of jobs in industry construction service and entrepreneurship.
cities already characterized by ethnic racial and religious diversity brought by earlier immigrants and african americans saw their diversity reach unprecedented levels.
by 1910 immigrants and their american born children comprised an astonishing 78 6 percent of new yorks 4 8 million residents.
chicago 77 5 percent milwaukee 78 6 percent san francisco 68 3 percent and most medium tolarge cities boasted similarly astoundingly numbers.
overall the foreign born comprised 14 8 percent of the national population in 1910.
emergence of ethnic enclaves these new immigrants like the irish and germans before them soon formed concentrated ethnic enclaves.
often they moved into neighborhoods previously dominated by immigrants who had arrived before the civil war.
as a result in new york for example the lower east side enclaves of little ireland little germany and little africa became by the 1890s little italy chinatown and the jewish east side.
this process of ethnic succession is captured in a world war i memorial plaque affixed to the faade of the church of the transfiguration on new yorks lower east side 17 2.
a community of native born americans built the church in 1801 as the english lutheran first church of zion but they sold it in the 1840s to irish catholics who renamed it church of the transfiguration.
in the 1890s a massive influx of italians and outflow of irish to other parts of the city turned the neighborhood into little italy and transfiguration into a mostly italian catholic church.
mother elizabeth cabrini later canonized a saint worked in the church caring for italian immigrants.
the plaque provides a snapshot of the transformation from little ireland to little italy.
of the twenty names of parishioners who died in world war i seventeen are italian and only three donahue durkin and kane are irish.
today the neighborhood is part of chinatown and most of the parishioners are chinese.
immigrant groups formed ethnic enclaves in part because they faced hostility and discrimination from americans and other immigrant groups.
but the primary cause was their recognition that grouping together enhanced their chances of success in america.
italian immigrants in chicagos little italy for example enjoyed the comfort and practical benefits of residing among people who spoke their language.
there they could find help getting a job from an immigrant aid association fellowship in an italian fraternal society or solace in an italian catholic church.
they also found things that reminded them of home italian food books newspapers churches theaters and opera houses.
a closer look at these enclaves revealed that they usually comprised smaller units composed of people from a particular region or village of their home country.
new yorks jewish east side for example included large concentrations of jews from hungary romania galicia russia and the eastern mediterranean.
italians in bostons north end clustered on certain streets depending on whether they came from sicily campania the 17 2 evidence of ethnic succession this 1919 plaque lists 17 italian and three irish names indicating that the neighborhood once known as little ireland had become little italy.

the troubled city many americans in the late nineteenth century saw cities as exciting places filled with opportunity cultural diversity entertainment and new technology such as electric lighting and skyscrapers.
yet many more viewed cities as places of crowding why was life in tenement districts so difficult.
turmoil filth and despair.
both images were accurate but the latter generated the most commentary and concern.
one of the most striking features of modern urban life was the emergence of densely packed slums in one ward on new yorks lower east side in 1890 population density reached 334 000 people per square mile numbers never seen before in history.
most people living in these densely packed districts were immigrants who worked for low wages as day laborers and factory operatives.
few men earned enough money to support their families.
so they relied on their wives and children to produce additional income see chapter 16.
squalid housing exacerbated the poverty of urban workers.
tenements or multiple family dwellings of four to six stories housing dozens of families became the most common form of housing for poor city dwellers by the 1860s.
most tenement the rise of the city apartments consisted of just two or three dimly lit and poorly ventilated rooms.
tenement districts in every city suffered from high rates of disease and death much of it caused when drinking water became contaminated by bacteria due to primitive sewage systems.
another source of disease was horses.
in 1900 new yorks 120 000 horses dropped six million pounds of manure on the streets every day.
in most cities as shown in this photograph 17 4 street cleaning was inadequate in working class neighborhoods.
note that in this filthy working class street in new york vendors sell all manner of goods on the sidewalks including food.
these conditions contributed to frequent epidemics.
in chicago in 1891 for example 2 000 people died from typhoid fever and 4 300 from bronchitis and pneumonia.
every year in chicago in the early 1890s 10 000 to 12 000 children under the age of five died.
despite the dreadful condition of many tenements the surging population of american cities kept the demand for housing high causing rents to rise continually.
in new york an 1883 survey of bricklayers among the citys best paid workers determined that they paid 28 percent of their annual income to their landlords.
another survey a few years later revealed that cloak makers another skilled group devoted 38 percent of their income to rent.
as a result evictions for falling behind in rent were common.
new york averaged more than 16 000 evictions per year in the early 1880s and more than 23 000 by 1892.
thousands of small houses and cottages arranged for one family are now packed with a family in each room chicago board of health report late nineteenth century cities also suffered from high rates of crime especially in the tenement districts.
some crime was driven by poverty or despair.
women for example usually turned to prostitution as a last resort to survive.
immigration also increased crime because it resulted in a disproportionately high population of young single men typically an age cohort with higher than average crime rates.
the overall growth diversity and mobility of urban populations also contributed to increased crime because these populations fostered anonymity and undermined the ability of communities to prevent potential criminal activity.
read the document george waring sanitary conditions in new york 1897 17 4 mired in muck late nineteenthcentury american cities especially in working class neighborhoods had public health problems because of inadequate street cleaning.
why were crime rates so high in cities.
chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 the political machine boss rule another unsettling feature of urban life in addition to poverty crime and disorder was the emergence of political machines.
most often associated with the democratic party these organizations became powerful in nearly every large american city by mobilizing large blocs of working class and immigrant voters while developing favorable relationships with real estate and business interests.
some machines controlled small sections of big cities.
martin lomasney for example was the boss of bostons eighth ward.
others such as new yorks tammany hall ruled the entire metropolis by the 1860s.
by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries several machines extended their power to the state level.
tammany hall bears the same relation to the penitentiary as the sunday school to the church a reformer 1876 17 5 winning by any means political machines often resorted to voter intimidation and election fraud.
as the motto in counting there is strength suggests vote counts were manipulated to ensure victory.
several trends coincided to account for the rise of political machines in american cities.
the spread of universal white male suffrage in the 1820s see chapter 8 meant that political success depended less on a candidates family name or wealth than on his ability to whip up enthusiasm and get out the vote on election day.
rapid urban growth also produced unprecedented opportunities for politicians and their machines to reward supporters with construction contracts and jobs such as police officers and building inspectors.
machines also garnered support from immigrants by denouncing nativism and stymieing anti immigrant legislation such as proposals to deny public jobs to the foreign born.
finally the growing numbers of the poor provided a needy constituency for which the machines supplied not only jobs but also a range of services and favors including cash handouts payments for funerals legal assistance and seasonal giveaways of turkeys at thanksgiving and bags of coal in winter.
recipients of machine how did political machines gain the support of working class and immigrant voters.
largesse and charity were expected to vote for its candidates.
the emergence of political machines horrified many wealthy and native born americans.
they found rule by the foreign born threatening and the rough and corrupt style of bosses offensive.
one aspect of machine politics however aroused especially bitter criticism the policy of no questions asked charity.
political machines acquired and retained power not only by providing services to their constituents but also as suggested by this political cartoon of boss william tweed the notoriously corrupt head of tammany hall by intimidating voters and engaging in election fraud 17 5.
this image shows that the ballot box in many cities was actually a transparent glass ball that allowed the political machines shoulder hitters to intimidate voters by letting them know they were watching to see how they voted.
the motto in counting there is strength refers to the machines tactic of using the police and boards of elections to manipulate the vote count to ensure victory for their party.
equally important was the money machines garnered by selling patronage jobs demanding kickbacks from city contractors and collecting protection fees from a vast economy of vice the machine controlled police allowed to flourish.
reformers railed against the machine but consistently failed to defeat it.
read the document lincoln steffens the shame of the cities view the closer look competing visions how best to help the poor.
a search for solutions a search for solutions the dark side of urbanization in the late nineteenth century prompted a wide range of competing views and responses.
some americans concluded that the real problem of urban poverty and the troubling crime disease disorder and corruption that accompanied it was the urban poor in particular the foreign born.
their solution was heightened nativism and a demand to restrict immigration.
other americans however worked to develop government agencies to address the emerging challenges of urban life.
still others established private institutions like settlement houses that reflected a new attitude toward the immigrant poor.
the nativist impulse the rise of the modern american city was accompanied by a revival of nativism or antiimmigrant views and sentiments.
suspicion of and hatred for the foreign born had flared up during the know nothing movement see chapter 12 in the 1850s which targeted irish and german immigrants especially those who were catholics.
in the gilded age nativism targeted the so called new immigrants or those coming from southern and eastern europe.
as this 1899 image 17 6 illustrates nativists decried newcomers as bearers of a wide range of unwanted habits and ideas.
the immigrant shown here in a racist caricature of eastern europeans carries according to his labels poverty anarchy superstition intemperance and sabbath desecration working or recreating on a sunday.
note uncle sams disdainful reaction and the sarcastic inscriptions on the gateway admittance free walk in and welcome meant to convey nativists anger over what they considered lax immigration laws.
as slums grew larger and strikes often involving many foreign born workers became more violent nativists called all the more loudly for the sharp restriction of immigration.
one of the most prominent was josiah strong a midwestern minister whose 1885 book our country read the document josiah strong anglo saxon culture under siege 1885 its possible future and present crisis warned the nation against the immigrant menace.
in 1882 congress responded to pressure by american workers and passed the chinese 17 6 fear of foreigners on the rise decrying the so called new immigrants from southern and eastern europe as bearers of unwanted habits and ideas nativism surged in the gilded age.
why did nativists oppose immigration.
chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 exclusion act see chapter 16 which barred chinese immigration to the united states.
in 1887 nativists who were especially fixated on the dangers posed by catholic immigration formed the american protective association apa to lobby for immigration restriction.
the organization grew to 500 000 members by the end of 1893.
its main base of strength was middle class protestants in the midwest but chapters also sprang up in most cities in the east.
the city has become a serious menace to our civilization.
it has a peculiar attraction for the immigrant here is heaped the social dynamite here roughs gamblers thieves robbers lawless and desperate men of all sorts congregate men who are ready on any pretext to raise riots for the purpose of destruction and plunder.
josiah strong our country its possible future and its present crisis 1885 in 1890 congress made oversight of immigration a federal responsibility and established immigration depots in most major ports to weed out and reject immigrants with incurable diseases radical beliefs criminal backgrounds or so little money and skills they seemed likely to swell the ranks of the urban poor.
the largest and most famous of these facilities ellis island in new york harbor opened in 1892.
many nativists considered this new system too lenient and called for additional restrictions on immigration.
in 1894 several harvard graduates founded the immigration restriction league to lobby for a literacy test for all would be immigrants requiring they demonstrate the ability to read and write in any language.
presidents cleveland taft and wilson vetoed immigrant literacy test bills but congress overrode wilsons veto and it became law in 1917.
how did urban reformers try to improve the safety and livability of cities.
a different view urban reforms while some americans believed urban poverty crime disease and overcrowding could be eliminated simply by restricting immigration others developed a range of innovative policies and institutions to solve or at least minimize these problems.
to meet the problem of rising crime most cities followed the lead of new york when in 1845 it replaced the traditional night watch of a few untrained and unarmed men with a paid professional police department.
large cities also disbanded their volunteer fire companies and invested in new fire fighting technology such as steam pumpers and adopted tougher building codes.
more dangerous to a city than fire at least to its inhabitants were the frequent outbreaks of cholera diphtheria typhoid fever and other maladies.
drawing on increasing knowledge about germ theory cities established boards of health and took steps to improve water quality waste removal and street cleaning.
the latter half of the nineteenth century also witnessed a movement to build urban parks to provide the beauty and serenity of nature and offer wholesome and healthy recreation space as opposed to alleys and saloons for all.
new yorks central park built in the 1850s and 1860s proved so successful that nearly every large city commenced its own park projects.
because most of the grand parks were located far from the slums however reformers in the 1890s pushed urban governments to condemn blocks of tenements and build parks within working class neighborhoods.
urban reformers also expanded public education.
compulsory education laws usually requiring schooling until age 14 and a massive building campaign saw public school enrollments surge from 6 9 million to 17 8 million between 1870 and 1910.
millions more students attended parochial schools established by the catholic church.
this effort reflected the traditional belief that education made for a productive and informed citizenry.
but as the photograph 17 7 of children reciting the pledge of allegiance illustrates advocates also saw expanded urban public schooling as a means of americanizing the immigrant masses teaching them english and respect for democracy and the law.
the pledge was first published in a youth magazine in 1892 to promote patriotism and civic pride among school children on the eve of the 400th anniversary of read the document proposal to buffalo new york park commission 1888 a search for solutions christopher columbuss arrival in the new world.
educators quickly made its recitation a daily ritual in schools across the country.
this earlier style which required people to end the pledge by extending their arms out straight was abolished in the 1930s because of its similarity to salutes used in fascist germany and italy.
capturing a new view of poverty reformers in the gilded age also developed a new way of thinking about poverty and its causes.
most americans held to the traditional view that poverty was caused by personal or moral failures such as laziness or drunkenness.
the poor as read the document jacob riis how the other half lives horatio alger and others argued so persuasively in popular literature see chapter 16 needed only to abandon their dissolute ways and seize the opportunities for success that abounded in american life.
but reformers began to challenge this view of poverty by arguing that factors beyond their control made people poor.
a key figure in this new outlook was photojournalist jacob a riis who emigrated from denmark to new york in 1870.
after spending his first years in america in poverty he gained a foothold in journalism.
by the mid 1880s he had earned a reputation as a reporter covering the citys crime beat.
but riis was troubled by the poverty and suffering he saw and decided to publicize it to gain public support for reforms.
in 1887 he started taking photographs of 17 7 promoting loyalty and patriotism advocates saw public education as a means of americanizing the urban immigrant masses.
soon after its introduction in 1892 educators made the pledge of allegiance a daily ritual in schools.
why was the pledge of allegiance adopted in the 1890s.
chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 slum life to spark public awareness and by 1888 1889 he began showing his photographs while giving lectures before reform societies and church groups.
spurred by the positive reaction to these talks especially to the photographs see images as history seeing the poor page 509 he wrote the book how the other half lives studies among the tenements of new york which he published in 1890.
books providing shocking accounts of prostitution drunkenness and violence in americas slums had appeared as early as the 1840s but riiss book was different and it caused a sensation.
living among the poor settlement houses riis was not alone in promoting a more progressive and sympathetic view of poverty and remedies to it.
in the early 1880s middle class and collegeeducated women began establishing in immigrant neighborhoods settlement houses or institutions dedicated to helping the urban poor by providing a wide range of social and educational services.
jane addams and ellen gates starr founded the most famous and influential settlement house hull house in chicago in 1889.
born to wealthy illinois families they had met in college and toured europe together in 1888 where they were inspired by a visit to toynbee hall a settlement house in londons poor east end.
there they saw educated wealthy young men enter the east end to assist the poor.
they vowed to establish a similar institution in chicago.
with financial backing from wealthy reformers addams and starr rented an old mansion on chicagos near west side.
the neighborhood was overwhelmingly foreign born see 17 3 and its residents lived in dreary run down tenements.
it also suffered from poor sanitation and high rates of crime.
unlike socially conscious elite women of earlier generations who simply raised money for the poor or lobbied the state legislature for laws against child labor addams starr and the many women workers they attracted to hull house chose to live among the poor to get to know them and understand their needs even learn from them.
the staff at hull house first offered educational classes in literature and art.
when these proved popular they began to teach more practical subjects such as cooking sewing hygiene civics the english what services did settlement houses provide the urban poor.
language and vocational training.
they also opened their doors to fledgling labor unions recognizing the vital role unions could play in raising the earnings of workers especially the foreign born.
within a decade hull house was a flourishing institution offering an array of services to the poor of chicago.
addams and other hull house workers like florence kelley also became activists to prod city authorities to improve tenement laws increase street cleaning and garbage removal and expand public education.
they also lobbied state officials for laws against child labor and for improved factory safety.
hull house was not the first settlement in america but it soon became its most famous inspiring hundreds of successful imitators 400 by 1910 including denison house in boston 1889 and henry street settlement in new york 1893.
the white city the optimistic vision of modern urban life articulated by reformers like jane addams and jacob riis found vivid expression in the city beautiful movement.
taking form in the late 1880s it brought together architects landscape architects and urban planners who believed the many problems afflicting american cities could be ameliorated even eliminated through the comprehensive planning and grand redesign of urban spaces.
city beautiful proponents like daniel burnham and frederick law olmsted argued for the creation of large parks and public squares linked by grand boulevards.
they also emphasized classical architectural styles for both public and private buildings.
burnham olmsted and others first demonstrated these ideas at the 1893 chicago worlds exposition a grand celebration of the 400th anniversary of christopher columbuss arrival in the new world in 1492 and of chicagos recovery from its devastating fire in 1871.
like the many worlds fairs that preceded it the chicago exposition celebrated technology culture and commerce.
it contained thousands of exhibits on science machinery art history ethnic heritage music and theater.
but its greatest significance was its impact on architecture design and urban planning.
given nearly 700 acres of waterfront property along lake michigan on which to erect buildings burnham and the extraordinary team he assembled including landscape architect read the document jane addams twenty years at hull house a search for solutions images as history seeing the poor in 1890 jacob riis published a shocking expos how the other half lives of the dreadful conditions in which the poor lived.
but unlike most americans writing about urban poverty in that era who attributed these problems to the moral failures of the poor riis argued that the poor were victims of unhealthy and unregulated tenements for which they were forced to pay most of their earnings.
adding to the books impact were his photographs and drawings made from photographs.
his carefully composed photograph an italian rag picker in jersey street shows the womans desperate situation.
riis convinced many of his readers that the growing numbers of impoverished slum dwellers were trapped in circumstances beyond their control largely due to unhealthy and expensive tenement housing.
he called for improved tenements that would free the poor from their debilitating circumstances and allow them the chance to succeed.
as a result of how the other half lives and other books not to mention magazine articles and speeches many cities passed tougher laws regulating room size windows running water and toilets.

riis presents her not as filthy or drunk despite the dreadful circumstances she and her baby wear clean clothes.
riis often included babies and innocentlooking children in his photographs to prompt the viewer to wonder and worry about their fate if the plight of the poor was not alleviated.
the mans hat on the wall prompts the viewer to wonder if this desperate woman has a husband or has been abandoned.

chapter 17 17 8 the white city designed by some of the nations leading architects chicagos white city consisted of 14 main buildings designed in the beauxarts style set in landscaped grounds featuring waterways and reflecting pools.
becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 frederick law olmsted and architect louis sullivan developed a master plan that called for landscaped grounds featuring waterways and reflecting pools.
around the waterways 17 8 burnham placed 14 main buildings designed in the beaux arts style which emphasized logic harmony and uniformity.
the court of honor buildings shown in the image lined the grand basin that formed the centerpiece of the exposition grounds.
covered in shimmering bright white stucco the buildings of the white city astonished the estimated 27 million visitors who entered through the main gates.
yet as this image indicates burnham and his team sought not simply to wow the public with grand architecture.
they wanted to showcase the potential glory of the modern city.
all cities could be should be as impressive as the white city.
all that was needed were civic leadership and enlightened urban planning.
this grand vision never fully caught on but many of the city beautiful ideals and concepts exhibited in the white city influenced a generation of urban planners and architects committed to making american cities more beautiful healthy and efficient.
how did the white city reflect an optimistic vision of urban life in the future.
new habits roles and lifestyles new habits roles and lifestyles the development of vast working class districts was but one aspect of a broad trend that reshaped urban life in the late nineteenth century.
urban and suburban growth also led to the development of middle class and elite residential neighborhoods and urban central business districts dedicated almost exclusively to commerce.
middle class neighborhoods increasingly reflected the new values of the urban middle class including a growing interest in leisure activities.
the growth of leisure time allowed women to take on significant roles in public life through memberships in socially and politically active clubs.
the new urban landscape the evolution of mass transit systems like horse cars steam railroads and trolleys led to explosive urban growth and specialized districts dedicated to specific functions.
most cities for example developed central business districts where almost no one lived.
instead the high value real estate in downtowns from baltimore to chicago to san francisco was dedicated to commerce banks department stores see chapter 16 and the offices of corporations accountants lawyers and other professionals.
each day mass transit systems carried thousands of shoppers and workers to central business districts from sections of cities now dedicated almost exclusively to residential use or from residential neighborhoods just beyond the city limits.
soaring real estate values and new technology led to another distinct feature in central business districts skyscrapers.
before the civil war few buildings exceeded six stories but the invention of the elevator and new building materials like cast iron and steel led to ten and twelve story buildings by the early 1880s.
the big breakthrough came in 1885 with the completion of the home insurance building in chicago.
it was remarkable not for its height ten stories but for its internal steel skeleton that allowed for thin walls and large windows.
this first true skyscraper led to a boom in tall building construction in downtowns across the country.
by 1900 lower manhattan alone featured 12 buildings of 300 feet or more in height.
equally significant although less dramatic than the upward reach of city skylines was the outward sprawl of urban areas due to mass transit.

given the prevalence of racist and nativist attitudes in gilded age american society suburbs also attracted people unwilling to live with immigrants and african americans.
dishonesty immorality and violence that threatened virtuous womanhood.
yet two trends in the late nineteenth century led directly to new more public roles for middleclass women.
the first was a rise in education especially at the college level.
by 1900 women constituted nearly 20 percent of college graduates up from just 13 percent in 1890.
education allowed women if only temporarily to leave the domestic sphere to interact with other young women and encounter emerging ideas about womens rights.
not surprisingly nearly every leader in the womens rights movement in the late nineteenth century had attended real estate columnist chicago tribune 1888 college.
the second was the inthe creation of middle class communities of creased involvement of women in clubs dedilike minded people of similar ethnic and religious cated to charity and social reform.
the general backgrounds fostered the development of new federation of womens clubs established in middle class values tastes and social patterns.

others were more substantial such as small voting rights for women.

the split into rival factions in 1869 in the debate over popularity of pianos in the late nineteenth century the fourteenth amendment see chapter 14 reflected not merely the rising wealth of middlebut in 1890 they reunited to form the national class families but also the increased leisure time american woman suffrage association they enjoyed and their desire to develop refined nawsa.

by the 1890s americans had begun to use the term new woman to describe middle class women who pursued higher education engaged in political activism delayed marriage and bore fewer children.
the new woman had a distinct look donning the clothing hair style and air of the so called gibson girl.
a creation of illustrator charles dana gibson in 1890s popular magazines the gibson girl was tall and beautiful with a tightly cinched waist that accentuated her bosom and with hair piled high on her head.
offsetting these traditionally feminine characteristics however was an outgoing even mischievous spirit that reflected the greater independence and activism of younger american women.
symbolic of this attitude was the degree to which young women took part in the great national enthusiasm for bicycling in the 1890s.
note the striking contrast between these two images.
the first from 1886 17 10 shows a traditional victorian era wife in formal attire being carried as a passenger by her husband.
the second image an 1896 advertisement poster for the stearns bicycle company 17 11 shows a self confident and carefree woman in the gibson girl style breezing along on her own bicycle.
many conservative americans condemned the bicycling craze as unnatural and immoral because it allowed young women and men the freedom to pedal off unchaperoned away from the watchful eyes of parents and other guardians of respectability.

it gives women a feeling of freedom and self reliance susan b anthony 1896 17 12 selling celebrity the booming tobacco industry created the original baseball cards to capitalize on the value of sports celebrity endorsements for their products.
new forms of leisure and popular culture as industrial life created sharp distinctions between time spent at work and time doing everything else americans in the gilded age developed the concept of leisure time.
this trend how did commercial interests shape the new forms of leisure in the gilded age.
was at the heart of the labor movements persistent demand for the eight hour day as both a call for shorter hours of toil and an insistence on the right to leisure time.
many city dwellers spent their leisure time in informal activities in their neighborhood such as walking about playing games in streets and local parks and socializing with their neighbors.
for many working class men the local saloon was the preferred place of leisure.
increasingly popular however were more formal leisure opportunities such as amusement parks and organized spectator sports.
amateur semiprofessional and professional baseball teams for example drew large crowds.
entrepreneurs soon saw baseball as a business despite its reputation as the national pastime they built large baseball stadiums near streetcar lines and sold patrons not merely tickets but also food beer trinkets and scorecards.
by the 1880s baseball stars like mike king kelly and adrian cap anson were high paid celebrities.
corporations especially the booming tobacco industry quickly realized the value of celebrity endorsements for their products and in the 1880s created the original baseball cards like the one shown here 17 12.
to legitimize tobacco use companies such as old judge portrayed players like kelly as ideal men the perfect blend of athletic masculinity and refined almost gentlemen like bearing.
in an era when the press rarely reported on the bad behavior of athletes or politicians few americans could have known that the real mike kelly was a violent alcoholic who would drink himself to death in 1894 at age 37.
other spectator sports also enjoyed great popularity in the late nineteenth century.
professional boxing horseracing track and field competitions and bicycle races drew large crowds to venues such as madison square garden in new york city the chicago coliseum and the boston arena.
by the 1890s college football games in boston new york read the document coney island frolics new habits roles and lifestyles philadelphia and chicago often drew more than 50 000 fans.
baseball football and other urban spectator sports proved consistent money makers for promoters but they also attracted criticism from ministers and public officials who decried the violence alcohol consumption and gambling associated with them and the trend to play them on sundays.
competing for the attention of the american with increased leisure time on his or her hands was a burgeoning theatrical entertainment industry.
by the late nineteenth century the typical city resident could choose from a vast array of entertainment forms on stage.
in ethnic neighborhoods for example old world productions like italian melodramas based loosely on operas and yiddish comedies drawn from eastern european traditions flourished.
elsewhere in the city in more mainstream venues people flocked to musical comedies a distinctly american innovation pioneered by the duo of edward harrigan and tony hart.
they were succeeded by others such as george m cohan and irving berlin whose popular songs like give my regards to broadway and alexanders ragtime band became enduring hits.
also popular was vaudeville a kind of variety show featuring a series of acts by entertainers from jugglers musicians acrobats and family routines to singers wild animal acts ribald comedians and scantily clad women.
with its low admission fees and democratic approach vaudeville was geared for the masses.
at its peak circa 1900 vaudeville shows drew two million patrons a day.
many of the great american stage and film performers from the early twentieth century such as james cagney mae west and al jolson began their careers in vaudeville.
wealthier and better educated city residents rejected vaudeville and the more raucous forms of musical comedy as undignified and coarse.
instead they went to opera houses to hear european music and to what they considered legitimate theater to see productions of shakespeare and the classics.
while these varied forms of entertainment were developed and popularized in large cities they quickly spread via published sheet music and touring companies to communities across the nation.
the result was the beginning of a national popular culture one that would flourish more fully with the arrival of movies radio and television in the twentieth century.
lifestyles of the rich and famous another feature of urban life that became a defining feature of the gilded age so much so that it gave the era its name was lavish displays of wealth.
dubbed conspicuous consumption by sociologist thorstein veblen in 1899 this trend featured the construction of opulent mansions in elite urban districts such as new yorks fifth avenue chicagos lake shore drive and san franciscos nob hill as well as in exclusive summer retreats like newport rhode island.
wealthy families like the vanderbilts and astors competed to see who could throw the most extravagant balls weddings and parties.
there is many a palace in europe that would hide its diminished roof beside the sheer luxury of fifth avenue homes edgar saltus one of the most famous was a ball hosted on march 26 1883 by alva vanderbilt wife of tycoon william k vanderbilt to celebrate the opening of their new 3 million mansion on upper fifth avenue.
the elite of new york arrived in costume 17 13.
many dressed as marie antoinette queen elizabeth and louis xv.
this choice of an ostentatious royal theme reflected the belief by the nations wealthy elite that they constituted an american aristocracy a notion that ran counter to the longstanding american fear and loathing for such undemocratic pretensions see chapters 4 and 5.
labor activists and social critics castigated the ball and high societys rejection of republican simplicity but mrs vanderbilts guests paid no heed.
they reveled past dawn in a party that cost 250 000 in an age when an average worker could expect to earn less than 700 per year.
by the mid 1880s most newspapers featured society columns that devoted extensive coverage to the lives of the wealthy.
while americans followed the exploits of the rich with a certain wonder the public would accept only so much extravagance before expressing how did varied forms of leisure reflect class differences.
chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 revulsion.
that finally occurred in february 1897 when the bradley martin family hosted a 400 000 party in which 800 guests arrived in costumes depicting european royalty.
one society reporter described a gorgeous superb and wonderful spectacle but in 1897 when the nation was suffering from a severe depression public criticism of the ball erupted including indignation from public officials clergymen and workers.
the bradley martins fled to europe and settled permanently in england ending the days of diamondnecklace party favors.

how did the great displays of wealth in the gilded age represent a break with americas republican traditions.
read the document thorstein veblen excerpt from the theory of leisure class the challenge from below the challenge from below the revulsion expressed over the bradley martin ball in 1897 reflected rising discontent.
many farmers and industrial workers felt exploited by powerful corporations.
when they turned to elected officials to address these problems they found them unresponsive.
most politicians remained committed to a laissez faire philosophy which argued against government intervention in the economy.
as a result the period was marked by some of the most bitter and violent strikes in american history and by the rise of a third party comprised mainly of farmers workers and reformers the peoples party to challenge the republicans and democrats.
out of touch politics popular enthusiasm for politics reached extraordinary heights in the gilded age.
indeed american voters turned out in astonishing numbers averaging 79 percent between 1876 and 1896 as compared with between 50 and 60 percent in recent decades.
despite such intense interest politicians made little progress in resolving the major issues that dominated national politics in this period.
this political stalemate stemmed from several factors.
first as indicated in 17 14 the electorate was evenly divided between the two major parties resulting in remarkably close presidential elections.
for example the five presidential elections between 1876 and 1892 were decided by tiny margins of 1 to 3 percent.
indeed in 1876 and 1888 the candidate with the highest popular vote total lost because his opponent tallied more electoral votes.
no incumbent president won reelection and only twice republicans 1889 1891 and democrats 1893 1895 year candidate party popular vote electoral vote rutherford b hayes republican 4 036 298 48 samuel j tilden democrat 4 300 590 51 james garfield republican 4 454 416 48 5 winfield s hancock democrat 4 444 952 48 1 grover cleveland democrat 4 874 986 48 5 james g blaine republican 4 851 334 48 2 benjamin harrison republican 5 439 853 47 9 grover cleveland democrat 5 540 309 48 6 grover cleveland democrat 5 556 918 46 benjamin harrison republican 5 176 108 43 james b weaver peoples 1 041 028 9 17 14 deadlocked presidential politics in the gilded age with an electorate evenly divided between the two major parties gilded age politics were often marked by stalemate on key issues.
winner in bold winner despite losing popular vote read the document mary elizabeth lease the popular crusader 1892 why were election results in the gilded age so close.
chapter 17 17 15 liberty suffocated by big business this 1889 thomas nast cartoon captured the concerns of many that trusts threatened democracy equality and liberty by monopolizing the necessities of life.
becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 did one party control both houses of congress and the presidency.
political inaction in the gilded age also reflected the conservatism of most politicians who clung to longstanding political traditions that celebrated small nonintrusive government especially at the federal level.
for many leaders government regulation of business appeared socialistic and harmful to both the economy and republican principles.
political paralysis stemmed from the power of corporate interests to use huge donations to political parties and bribery of lawmakers to stymie legislation they deemed harmful to their interests.
for example big business interests blocked efforts to lower the tariff because a high tariff protected their manufactures from foreign competition.
the record for 1890 the year congress took up the big issues of tariff currency reform and corporate regulation provides a particularly vivid example of this ineffective political system.
support for corporate regulation reflected rising concern from many why did congress in this period fail to address major social issues.
corners of american society.
industrial workers saw themselves as victims of corporate power that demanded long hours of dangerous toil for low wages.
many other americans as suggested by this 1889 thomas nast cartoon the rising of the usurpers and the sinking of the liberties of the people 17 15 viewed trusts as a threat to democracy and equality.
by monopolizing the necessities of life trusts literally threatened to smother american liberty.
the sherman antitrust act of 1890 promised to empower the federal government to crack down on business practices that diminished competition see chapter 16 but opposition from pro business legislators weakened the law to such a point that it did little to slow the growth of big business.
indeed the 1890s saw record numbers of mergers and big business used the sherman act to weaken labor unions by arguing that strikes amounted to restraint of trade.
in 1890 congress also took up the contentious issue of currency reform to determine what constituted the proper basis for american currency.
advocates of hard money which included most republicans businessmen and the wealthy argued for basing currency solely on the amount of gold in the u s treasury.
they opposed issuing paper money popularly known as greenbacks or minting more silver coinage arguing that it contributed to inflation and lowered interest rates.
soft money proponents like farmers workers and democrats however argued that the supply of gold and thus of a currency based exclusively on it was insufficient to meet the needs of an expanding commercial economy.
they advocated the issuance of greenbacks and expanded coinage of silver which was more plentiful than gold.
more money in circulation would lead to inflation but debtors especially farmers welcomed inflation because it promised to raise the prices of their goods and diminish the burden of their debts.
in 1890 they supported the sherman silver purchase act which required the treasury to purchase 4 5 million ounces of silver every month and issue notes paper money redeemable in either silver or gold.
republicans opposed the bill but wanted a higher tariff.
democrats opposed a higher tariff arguing that it amounted to a huge subsidy paid by american consumers to business.
both sides therefore compromised and both the silver act and a higher tariff became law.
neither bill however had the desired effect.
the higher tariff caused consumer prices to the challenge from below surge producing widespread discontent.
the silver program caused the price of silver to fall so most of the people holding the notes redeemed them for gold which depleted the nations gold reserves and contributed to the panic of 1893 and four years of severe depression.
the one notable exception to the politics of stalemate was a civil service law to open certain government jobs only to those who demonstrated their competency on a civil service exam rather than those who merely possessed strong political connections.
neither party favored the law since it threatened to undermine their ability to reward friends and campaign contributors.
it took the assassination of president james a garfield in 1881 by a frustrated and apparently deranged office seeker to pass the pendleton act in 1883 which placed ten percent of federal jobs under civil service.
the peoples party anger against the political systems corruption and failure to act on critical issues like corporate regulation and currency and tariff reform gradually produced a popular reaction.
in the late 1870s farmers alliances successors to the granger movement see chapter 15 formed to alleviate the plight of farmers beset by rising costs and falling prices for their products.
the southern farmers alliance 1877 and northern farmers alliance 1880 grew in the 1880s to a combined membership of more than five million.
excluded by the segregationist doctrines of the post reconstruction south black farmers formed the colored farmers alliance in 1886 and soon had more than 1 25 million members.
the alliances argued that the economic woes of the american farmer were due to exploitive bankers who charged farmers exorbitant interest rates for farm mortgages to railroads that charged them extortionate rates to transport farm produce to market and to commodity brokers on wall street who bought their crops at rock bottom prices and then resold them at many times the original price paid.
to combat this injustice the alliances promoted the establishment of cooperatives that combined the buying and selling power of farmers to gain them better prices for their produce and lower rates for loans and crop insurance.
they also promoted education on agricultural topics.
in 1889 the northern farmers alliance and southern farmers alliance united to form the read the document n a.
dunning ed alliances vision of community 1891 national alliance.
one year later convinced that the only way to combat the power of the monopolies and trusts was to transform the national alliance into a political movement to elect pro farmer candidates to office delegates gathered in ocala florida and drew up a manifesto listing their grievances and proposed reforms.
that fall national alliance backed candidates won complete or partial control of 12 state legislatures and elected 6 governors.
they also sent 50 representatives and 3 senators to congress.
because most of these men were democrats republicans lost control of the house.
these victories convinced many national alliance activists like ignatius donnelly of minnesota and tom watson of georgia that they needed to form a third party and run a slate of candidates in the 1892 presidential contest.
a national alliance convention in st louis in early 1892 led to the formal creation of the peoples party its followers would be known as populists and the adoption of a platform that emphasized the plight of the american farmer and worker at the hands of greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians see competing visions progress or peril.
by now the peoples party movement had begun to alarm the leaders of the mainstream political parties.
worried about the partys potential to determine the winner in 1892 by taking votes from them the major parties launched a campaign to discredit the populists.
in this political cartoon 17 16 which appeared on the cover of judge a pro republican magazine the artist ridicules the populists as a patchwork of strange and dangerous political and ideological movements like socialism and prohibition.
the balloons basket labeled platform of lunacy carried the party leaders depicted as eccentric fools.
in july 1892 the populists nominated union army veteran james b weaver for president and confederate veteran general james g field of virginia for vice president.
their convention adopted a platform aimed at the following eliminating monopolies abolition of national banks and government ownership of railroads and telegraphs protecting small producers free silver coinage and sub treasuries to store surplus farm produce during times of low prices and to allow farmers to borrow money against it at low interest strengthening democracy the popular election of u s senators and the referendum and initiative and promoting fairness a graduated income tax to make the rich pay more of the tax burden.
to create a national base of support among all struggling people not just what grievances led to the rise of farmers alliances.
chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 competing visions progress or peril.
americans in the gilded age interpreted the economic political and social developments of the era in very different ways.
some looked about them with enthusiasm at the sight of a nation growing in size wealth population and international prestige.
president benjamin harrison in his inaugural address in 1889 reflects this optimistic view.
other americans however especially many farmers and industrial workers who sympathized with the peoples party expressed alarm and dismay over the state of the nation.
what key signs of progress and national strength does president harrison cite.
what dangers to american ideals such as equality and democracy do the authors of the peoples party platform identify.
how do we account for these starkly different visions.
president benjamin harrison inaugural address march 4 1889 o ur growth has not been limited to territory population and aggregate wealth marvelous as it has been in each of those directions.
the masses of our people are better fed clothed and housed than their fathers were.
the facilities for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused.
the virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of our people.
the influences of religion have been multiplied and strengthened.
the sweet offices of charity have greatly increased we have not attained an ideal condition.
not all of our people are happy and prosperous not all of them are virtuous and law abiding.
but on the whole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were here one hundred years ago.
no other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love or a land so magnificent in extent so pleasant to look upon and so full of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor.
god has placed upon our head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond definition or calculation.
but we must not forget that we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins of power and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the people.
i do not mistrust the future.
dangers have been in frequent ambush along our path but we have uncovered and vanquished them all.
passion has swept some of our communities but only to give us a new demonstration that the great body of our people are stable patriotic and lawabiding the peaceful agencies of commerce are more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our communities and the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting mutual respect how did the peoples party platform reflect the concerns of farmers and industrial workers.

corruption dominates the ballot box the legislatures the congress and touches even the ermine of the bench.
the people are demoralized the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled public opinion silenced business prostrated homes covered with mortgages labor impoverished and the land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.
the urban workmen are denied the right to organize for self protection imported pauperized labor beats down their wages a hireling standing army unrecognized by our laws is established to shoot them down and they are rapidly degenerating into european conditions.
the fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few unprecedented in the history of mankind and the possessors of those in turn despise the republic and endanger liberty.
from the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed the two great classes tramps and millionaires.
a vast conspiracy against mankind has been organized on two continents and it is rapidly taking possession of the world.
if not met and overthrown at once it forebodes terrible social convulsions the destruction of civilization or the establishment of an absolute despotism.
we have witnessed for more than a quarter of a century the struggles of the two great political parties for power and plunder while grievous wrongs have been inflicted upon the suffering people.
we charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them.
neither do they now promise us any substantial reform the challenge from below 17 16 discrediting the populists concerned about the potential of the peoples party to determine the outcome of the 1892 presidential election the major parties ridiculed them as a patchwork of dangerous political and ideological movements like socialism and prohibition.
farmers the platform also expressed sympathy with industrial workers.
in the end the peoples party was no match for the established parties.
democrat grover cleveland won the election with 46 percent of the vote to republican incumbent benjamin harrisons 43 percent.
yet weaver garnered more than one million votes 9 percent and won kansas colorado idaho and nevada.
results on the local and state levels were even more impressive as populists elected almost 1 500 candidates to state legislatures three governors and five senators and ten representatives to congress.
peoples party leaders hoped to build on this achievement in 1896 but they faced severe challenges.
in 1892 the party had performed poorly among midwestern farmers and industrial workers who stayed with either the republicans or democrats.
in addition a campaign by conservatives to equate read the document the peoples party platform 1892 how did opponents try to discredit the populists.
chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 support for the peoples party with attacks on white supremacy severely weakened the party in the south.
industrial conflict and depression events soon highlighted the unchecked power of big business and the severe consequences of a laissez faire economy.
many peoples party activists hoped the anger and suffering produced by the homestead strike and panic of 1893 would prompt workers and farmers to reject the mainstream political parties and join the populists.
workers at the homestead steel works a mammoth plant near pittsburgh owned by andrew carnegie for years enjoyed a strong union the amalgamated association of iron and steel workers high wages and decent living conditions.
but in 1892 carnegie decided to rid the company of the union to cut costs by introducing labor saving machinery and reducing wages.
to protect the public persona of a benevolent capitalist that he had worked for years to develop see chapter 16 carnegie went on vacation in scotland leaving his hard nosed business partner henry clay frick to do the dirty work.
on june 29 frick announced a lockout and closed the mills.
after a week the standoff turned violent when workers exchanged gunfire with heavily armed professional strikebreakers of the pinkerton detective agency whom frick had brought by boat to the homestead complex.
six strikers and five pinkertons were killed.
the national press gave extensive coverage to the strike and its tone was surprisingly pro worker probably due in part to the pinkertons negative reputation.
carnegie despite his attempt to separate himself from the conflict drew some of the harshest criticisms.
his critics challenged his reputation as the great philanthropist who handed out libraries to communities in the united states and europe by depicting him as a two faced hypocrite who funded his philanthropic largesse by grinding down his workers with wage cuts 17 17.
but the tide of public opinion soon shifted against the strikers for on july 23 anarchist alexander berkman burst into fricks office and shot him.
remarkably frick survived the assassination attempt.
even though berkman had no connection to homestead workers his actions brought widespread condemnation upon the strikers.
in september state officials arrested 33 members of the unions leadership and charged them with treason against the state.
on november 20 1892 with nearly all the jobs at homestead filled by replacement workers the union ended the strike.
six months later on may 5 1893 a financial crisis rocked the nation leading to the most severe economic depression in american history 17 17 carnegies reputation takes a hit the homestead strike tarnished carnegies image as a benevolent capitalist and friend of labor.
this cartoon from the july 9 issue of the utica new york globe accuses him of being a two faced hypocrite who funded his philanthropy by cutting his workers salaries.
why did critics accuse carnegie of hypocrisy during the homestead strike.
the challenge from below to that time.
within a year the panic of 1893 led to the failure of thousands of farms and businesses including almost 200 railroads and 600 banks closed throwing millions out of work and pushing the unemployment rate to 20 percent.
the depression produced two vivid images of the widespread suffering endured by millions and the unwillingness of public officials to do much about it.
the first came from an ohio populist named jacob coxey who called for the government abandon laissez faire and create public works projects such as building roads to alleviate mass unemployment and stimulate the economy programs the federal government adopted in the great depression of the 1930s.
to draw attention to this idea he organized 100 unemployed men in massillon ohio to march to washington d c the first such march on the capital.
setting out on march 25 1894 coxeys army as it came to be known grew in size as as various groups joined along the route.
as this photograph 17 18 and nearly every other one taken of the march shows coxey and his followers sought to portray an image of patriotism earnestness and moderation.
dressing as decently as their poverty permitted and marching with dozens of american flags coxey and his men rejected the accusations of their critics that they were violent radicals determined to attack the government.
rather they asserted theirs was a campaign to save the republic from the trusts and laissez faire policies.
most of the men and women who joined coxey walked for only part of the march to washington.
nonetheless about 600 accompanied him when he entered the nations capital on april 30 1894.
denied entry into the capitol coxey delivered an impassioned address on its steps.
we stand here to day in behalf of millions of toilers whose petitions have been buried in committee rooms whose prayers have been unresponded to and whose opportunities for honest remunerative productive labor have been taken from them by unjust legislation which protects idlers speculators and gamblers.
coxey and other activists were arrested for disturbing the peace but convicted only for walking on the capitol lawns.
other groups of unemployed workers staged similar protest marches but all met with frustration and inaction.

17 20 for silver and the people the democratic party emphasized bryans commitment to workers and farmers through his advocacy of free silver and his promise to protect americans from being crucified on a cross of gold the election of 1896 and political realignment the turmoil caused by the depression and pullman strike greatly affected the 1894 off year elections.
dissatisfaction with clevelands administration hurt the democrats who lost their brief hold on both houses of congress.
the shift in power meant more stalemate for the next two years with a republican congress opposed by a democratic president.
the election of 1896 however led to a major realignment in political affiliations among the american people.
republicans nominated former congressman and governor of ohio william mckinley for president and affirmed their conservative commitment to the gold standard and a high tariff.
the democrats nominated a young and dynamic congressman from nebraska william jennings bryan.
just 36 years old bryan had earned a reputation for stirring oratory against the tariff and in support of free silver.
the latter issue held great symbolic importance in the middle of the depression.
silver was the metal of the common man argued its supporters while gold was the metal of elites.
in speeches pamphlets songs and images peoples party activists had convinced millions of americans that free coinage of silver putting more money into circulation and thus lowering the value of the dollar backed exclusively by gold would both end the depression and curb the monopolies and trusts.
recognizing the popularity of this policy delegates at the democratic party convention made free silver a key plank in the party platform.
bryan then delivered one of the most famous speeches in american history in which he argued that average americans were being crucified on a cross of gold forced upon them by wall street and big business.

chapter 17 becoming a modern society america in the gilded age 1877 1900 choices and consequences the pullman strike grover cleveland was not the first president to face the choice of whether to send federal troops to quell a labor dispute.
andrew jackson had dispatched troops in 1834 to end a strike by canal workers.
rutherford b hayes had sent troops to crush the great railroad strike of 1877.
despite these precedents cleveland was aware that many considered the use of the army against american citizens a violation of the key republican principles of limited federal power.
he also worried that the public would condemn such use of federal power if violence ensued as it had in 1877.
he spent days in late june and early july 1894 consulting with advisors and mulling over his options.
choices take no action allowing illinois and its pro labor governor to handle the matter.
continuing controversies when is using federal troops in a strike compatible with republican principles.
subsequent presidents including woodrow wilson also ordered military intervention during labor disputes.
in 1916 the national security act empowered the president to federalize a states national guard to quell a disturbance like a natural disaster riot or strike.
the two most notable uses of this law however came in 1957 little rock arkansas and 1963 tuscaloosa alabama to enforce federal desegregation orders.
intervene as a neutral and insist that both sides negotiate an equitable settlement.
send in the army to break the strike and allow the railroads to use strikebreakers to operate the trains.
decision despite misgivings cleveland was a pro business conservative.
he authorized attorney general richard olney a man with extensive ties to the railroad industry to obtain a court injunction declaring the aru boycott of pullman cars a conspiracy in restraint of trade that unlawfully blocked the u s mail.
when the union defied the injunction cleveland ordered the army to end the boycott and get the trains moving again.
debs and other aru leaders were arrested.
federal troops sent by president cleveland to break the pullman strike escort the first meat train out of the chicago stockyards.
consequences clevelands decision touched off violence.
workers destroyed railroad property and soldiers killed 13 workers and wounded scores more.
the boycott collapsed in mid july and with it the aru.
the pullman strike ended in early august in complete defeat for the workers.
public opinion however turned against pullman for his obstinate refusal to negotiate with his workers.
a government investigation later criticized him and argued that labor unions and government regulation were needed to curb corporate power.
yet in 1895 the supreme court in re debs upheld the use of injunctions to end strikes.
how did president cleveland justify using federal power to break the pullman strike.
the challenge from below lines you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns and you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold a youthful bryan flanked by his wife and children tops the poster while images of a worker and farmer flank the speech text.
that left the peoples party facing a dilemma.
most of its activists had expected the democrats to follow the republicans and support the gold standard leaving the silver issue to the populists.
now the peoples party had to decide whether to nominate their own candidate and divide support for the silver issue with the democrats or as was common practice among small parties in the nineteenth century to nominate bryan as their candidate a move that would diminish their standing as an independent party concerned with issues other than silver.
in july the peoples party nominated bryan.
but they nominated their own candidate for vice president populist leader tom watson of georgia.
rejecting a longstanding tradition that considered campaigning by presidential candidates unseemly bryan embarked on one of the most remarkable campaigns in american history traveling more than 18 000 miles through 27 states and delivering more than 600 stump speeches to three million people.
bryans campaign generated a lot of commentary and excitement but not enough votes on election day.
mckinley backed with an unprecedented amount of corporate money won with 51 percent of the vote to bryans 47 percent.
the most significant outcome of the contest was a new and enduring political alignment.
the republican party became dominant in the midwest and northeast and dominated national political power for the next three decades.
republicans would portray themselves as the party of economic prosperity the economy recovered under mckinley and international power.
the democrats became the party of the south and west.
they retained the populist belief that government needed to do more to secure the wellbeing of the average citizen and limit the power of big business.
given its base in the south however the democratic party also upheld a states rights philosophy that protected white supremacy.
the peoples party disintegrated after 1896 but many of its core ideas such as the graduated income tax and the direct election of u s senators remained popular and were eventually adopted during the next two decades a period known as the progressive era.
if they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing we will fight them to the uttermost.
having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world supported by the commercial interests the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 most americans envisioned the conquest and transformation of the west as a tale of triumph.
in john gasts 1872 painting american progress the goddess liberty glides westward stringing telegraph wire and holding a book symbols along with the distant railroad of the civilization and new technology that would soon tame the wilderness.
beneath her gast depicts farmers and pioneers intent on taking advantage of the wests bountiful resources.
turned into a lithograph it was advertised as worthy of hanging in both the miners humble cabin and the stately marble mansion of the capitalist publishers put the image on the cover of a popular guide to the west the new overland tourist and pacific coast guide.
before 1840 most americans viewed the lands west of the mississippi as a great untamed and dangerous wilderness of rugged terrain extreme temperatures wild animals and hostile native americans.
but beginning in the 1840s an ever growing number of farmers miners ranchers entrepreneurs and adventurers moved west aided after 1869 by the completion of the transcontinental railroad and soaring demand for western products and resources.
gasts celebratory scene reveals doubtless unintentionally the bitter conflict that accompanied the transformation of the west.
on the paintings left border a cluster of native americans flee before the advancing whites.
above them a herd of buffalo likewise make their escape.
gasts matter of fact portrayal of the seizure of indian land and the near extinction of the buffalo reflected the nations enthusiasm for progress and the inability or unwillingness to confront the human and environmental costs associated with it.
by 1900 the west had been radically transformed.
networks of railroads and telegraph lines crisscrossed the landscape as did millions of miles of fencing that marked the boundaries of farms and ranches.
western cities like san francisco and denver rivaled their eastern counterparts.
perhaps even more remarkable than the appearance of these new aspects of western life was the disappearance of others.
by 1900 the american government had confined hundreds of independent native american tribes that had once lived in virtually every corner of the west to reservations.
gone too were the millions of buffalo from the plains and in areas of intensive mining large sections of once pristine mountain landscape were defaced.
the conquest of the west between 1865 and 1900 included many stories of success achievement and undeniable progress but it was far more complex violent and tragic than gasts dreamy vision suggests.
the destiny of the american people is to subdue the continent to rush over this vast field to the pacific ocean.
to change darkness into light and confirm the destiny of the human race.
divine task.
immortal mission william gilpin the central gold region 1859 chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 natives and newcomers inspired by visions of unlimited opportunity and measures of congress like the homestead act westward migration increased dramatically after the civil war.
contrary to the popular notions of a vacant landscape much of the west was home to hundreds of thousands of native americans.
their many languages lifestyles and religious practices made for a rich cultural landscape but also conflict with the rising numbers of newcomers.
congress promotes westward settlement in 1862 congress passed three major bills to facilitate settlement of the trans mississippi west the vast region of the united states west of the mississippi river.
the morrill land grant college act of 1862 created a system whereby funds raised by the sale of public land went toward establishing colleges specializing in agricultural mechanical and technological education.
far more significant however was the homestead act.
it provided 160 acres of free land to any settler willing to live on it and improve it for five years.
farmers with more capital could buy the land for 1 25 per acre after living on it for only six months.
those who took advantage of the program included immigrants landless farmers from the east single women and ex slaves.
by making available more than 600 million acres of public land to be settled and farmed the homestead act touched off the largest migration of people ever within the united states.
advertisements and promotional literature produced by land companies and railroads convinced many people to head west to acquire homesteads.
like this image 15 1 which ap peared in a czech language magazine these enticements promised rapid success.
note the year by year progression that begins with a barren farm and humble house.
by the fourth year the landscape features not only a substantial house and flourishing farm but also trees a road and more homes suggesting that the loneliness of life on the plains will be short lived.
one year later a church steeple appears further suggesting the development of a community and all the blessings of civilization.
but the actual results of the homestead act varied widely by region.
on the great plains and the lands farther west regions with a harsh climate poor soil inconsistent supplies of water and limited access to transportation farmers who participated in the homestead act often went bankrupt.
by contrast the act worked well in the northern and central portions of the midwest where the soil and the climate were favorable to farming.
some people prospered from the homestead act in ways not intended by congress.
many homesteaders were actually speculators who claimed their 160 acres with the intention of selling them for a quick profit in a few years.
larger enterprises like railroads and real estate companies accumulated vast land holdings by buying out farmers who failed or paying people to file homestead claims and then buying the land from them.
the homestead act did indeed attract farmers to the west but by 1900 only 52 percent of original homestead claimants had acquired legal title to the land.
the third major piece of legislation passed by congress in 1862 to promote western development the pacific railway act created two corporations to build the transcontinental railroad spanning the continent.
the union pacific was to build west 15 1 homesteads and the promise of success in the west the b and m railroad paid for this advertisement which appeared in a czech magazine.
its six panels showing extraordinary year by year progress of a typical homesteading family were intended to draw settlers to nebraska.
why did the homestead act have uneven results.
read the document homestead act of 1862 natives and newcomers from omaha nebraska across the plains and the rockies to meet the central pacific which was to build from california through the sierra nevada mountains.
to help the railroad corporations raise capital to pay for the road congress granted them ten square miles of land in a checkerboard pattern with the federal government retaining ownership of the remaining sections for every mile of track completed.
the law also granted the railroads cheap loans and cash subsidies for each mile of track laid.
it took six years of low paid hard and dangerous work by huge gangs of workers especially irish and chinese to complete the project.
scores were killed.
on may 10 1869 a grand ceremony marking the union of the two lines took place at promontory point utah.
at the appointed moment leland stanford president of the central pacific drove a symbolic golden spike into place joining two rails one placed by a team of chinese workers and another by an irish crew.
telegraph wires attached to the sledge hammer and spike sent a signal across the nation announcing the long anticipated news the continent had been spanned.
keenly aware of the historic nature of the event railroad officials staged this iconic photograph 15 2 showing the workers and locomotives of the union pacific and central pacific.
it soon appeared in numerous publications often as a lithograph.
conspicuously absent from the photograph however are any of the thousands of chinese workers who labored on the central pacific.

devastating disease.
most indians had lived there as far back as anyone could remember while some had come from the east only decades earlier during the many forced removals see chapter 8.
before the arrival of europeans dozens of native american tribes in what is now california lived in villages as small bands of hunters and gatherers.
these include the hupa karok northern paiute pomo wintun and yuki peoples.
their way of life was first disrupted in the late eighteenth century when the spanish established a line of christian missions on the pacific coast running north from san diego.
while thousands of indians lived beyond the reach of the missions many were gradually transformed by the spanish into an exploited class of laborers converted to christianity and absorbed what was the impact of european contact with indians in the trans mississippi west before 1850.
into spanish colonial society.
even greater change followed the discovery of gold in northern california shortly after the u s government seized the territory in the mexican war.
waves of white fortune seekers soon arrived and drove the native americans off their lands.
this violence along with the starvation and disease that followed killed thousands of indians see chapter 12.
present day arizona new mexico and west texas also fell under spanish colonial rule in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
but because this region was dry and remote it attracted few europeans.
its native inhabitants therefore retained core elements of their culture despite spanish rule and the presence of catholic missionaries.
indeed missionaries managed to gain converts only natives and newcomers by blending christianity with local customs and traditions.
one major group descended from the ancient anasazi people included the hopi zuni and rio grande pueblo tribes.
they lived in settled farming communities in western new mexico and eastern arizona growing corn beans and cotton and herding sheep.
they also traded with neighboring mexican ranchers exchanging their decorative pottery and woven cloth for manufactured products such as hoes and tools.
eastern new mexico and western texas harbored more tribes including the jicarilla apache and navajo.
like the pueblo they lived in relative isolation from spanish missions and thus retained much of their traditional religion language and culture.
before the sixteenth century they had lived much like the pueblos but their adoption of horses and for the navajo sheep which had been brought to america by the spanish transformed them into more migratory peoples.
the navajo tended large flocks of sheep following them on their seasonal migrations.
sheep provided food but also wool which indian women wove into cloth.
navajo silversmiths also produced beautiful jewelry.
the pacific northwest comprising presentday washington oregon and northern california was home to thriving native societies such as the chinook salish yurok and shasta.
living in large villages they divided their time between growing vegetables hunting in the lush forests for bear deer and moose and fishing along rivers and the ocean shore.
highly skilled in woodworking the men produced excellent canoes for fishing and elaborate totem poles.
women wove intricate baskets that were both beautiful and practical.
many of these tribes enjoyed a rich material life that was offset by their custom of potlatch a ceremony during which rich tribe members gave away many of their possessions as an act of competitive benevolence and a demonstration of superior status.
native american tribes of the great plains while native american tribes could be found in virtually every corner of the west the largest group constituting nearly two thirds of all native americans in the west lived on the great plains.
this vast open territory stretched from present day missouri to the rocky mountains and from north dakota to texas.
in the northern half the dakotas idaho minnesota and montana lived tribes such as the flathead blackfeet crow arapaho northern cheyenne and sioux.
tribes in the southern great plains present day nebraska kansas oklahoma texas and new mexico included those relocated from the east during the so called trail of tears ordeal cherokee choctaw creek chickasaw and seminole see chapter 8 as well as pawnees comanches kiowas southern arapahos and cheyenne.
the plains tribes varied culturally but many shared a similar tribal structure.
most tribes consisted of bands of about 300 500 related men and women each governed by a council that welcomed community involvement in decision making.
the comanches for example divided their population of 7 000 ca.
1870 into 13 bands.
religious beliefs and practices varied among the plains tribes but most shared important fundamental elements beginning with the worship of one primary god whom the sioux called wakan tanka the great spirit.
plains indians also believed in spirits found in everything in creation from the earth itself to plants animals stars the moon and sun and they considered certain places such as burial grounds sacred.
a shaman deemed wakan or blessed led religious ceremonies healed the sick and even decided where to hunt.
many plains tribes lived in settled villages near rivers where they tended fields of corn beans and squash fished and hunted game including bear deer and buffalo.
trade with white settlers explorers and trappers since the eighteenth century had allowed them to procure guns kettles and tools.
these sedentary tribes included the wichitas of northern texas and oklahoma pawnees of western kansas the dakota sioux of minnesota the mandans of north dakota the omahas of nebraska the osages of western missouri and arkansas and the arikawas of south dakota.
although essential aspects of this plains lifestyle had changed little over the centuries some of the largest tribes took to using horses by the eighteenth century and adopted a migratory lifestyle.
these included the crow blackfeet cheyenne arapaho comanche and lakota sioux.
the horse allowed the plains tribes to follow the seasonal migrations of the buffalo whose what is significant about the diversity of native american life in the trans mississippi west.
chapter 15 15 4 plains indians hunting the buffalo this 1844 painting by george catlin shows native americans hunting the buffalo which they relied on as a major source of food clothing tools and fuel.
conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 population stood at 30 million in 1800.
this scene buffalo chase over prairie bluffs 15 4 painted in 1844 by george catlin who traveled extensively among indian tribes in the west from the 1830s to the 1850s reveals both the drama of the buffalo hunt and the extraordinary horsemanship of plains indians.
it also shows the centrality of the buffalo in plains indian culture for the hunters clothing jewelry spear tips and bridles are made from buffalo parts.
other uses for the buffalo included flesh for food skin for teepees and blankets horns and hooves for glue bones and tendons for weapons hair for rope teeth for ornaments and dried dung for fuel.
the military advantages of the horse and the material wealth provided by the buffalo led these migratory tribes to become the dominant powers on the plains allowing them to exact tribute from weaker sedentary tribes.
but reliance on the huge migratory beasts also meant that tribes such as the lakota sioux in the north and comanche in the central plains traversed enormous tracts of land during their annual migrations a practice that increasingly brought them into conflict with whites eager to acquire land.
it also increased conflict between rival tribes such as the lakota sioux and crow as white settlement forced tribes into closer contact.
while not all native americans were warlike the culture of most plains indians glorified battle.
warriors aspired to earn reputations as brave hunters and fighters.
warfare between tribes to control land and access to game consisted of small skirmishes where the goal was not so much to kill their opponents as to steal their horses a measure of a tribes how did the introduction of horses change the lifestyle of some plains indians.
i was famous as a hunter i gave the buffalo calves that i killed to the poor that had no horses.
i was considered a good man sitting bull wealth and power and drive them from the field.
individual warriors earned fame and respect by counting coup or touching an enemy with ones hand or weapon.
respect was also earned through acts of charity.
sitting bull of the lakota sioux for example became chief of his tribe both because of his success as a warrior and his generosity.
the great westward migration in the late 1840s after the mexican war and the discovery of gold in california a steady flow of settlers into the trans mississippi west commenced.
by the mid 1850s thousands annually traversed the 2 000 mile oregon trail that stretched from missouri to oregon.
what attracted them was a torrent of pamphlets books articles and photographs produced by publicists and boosters many employed by railroads and land companies celebrating the west as a region of wealth and opportunity.
several groups led this migration westward.
one was the recently freed slaves who hoped to secure new lives as independent farmers free of the poverty and violence in the south.
one of these ex slaves henry adams who became a land promoter after emancipation helped more than 20 000 other black exodusters move in the exodus of 1879 from the south to farms in kansas.
this image from harpers weekly 15 5 captures the hope this movement inspired.
note the contrast the artist draws between the old style of african american migration a desperate escaped slave hiding from a passing steamboat and the new well dressed ex slaves arriving at their destination by steamboat.
the name exodusters reflected the belief that like the israelites in the bibles book of exodus they were heading view the map atlas map western migration 1850 1880 natives and newcomers for a promised land the inclusion of a black veteran of the union army symbolizes the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation won during the war.
unfortunately many exodusters settled on poor land and lacked the capital to establish successful farms.
as a result only about one third stayed.
the rest moved on or returned to the south.
native born whites constituted a second much larger segment of the westward migration.
many were eastern and midwestern farmers who sought larger plots of land either through purchase or by the homestead act and opportunities for upward mobility.
others came to work in railroad construction or mining.
in addition many westward migrants were white soldiers who had been stationed in the west and elected to stay and settle after their terms of service expired.
one distinct subgroup of native born whites migrants were the mormons.
joseph smith had founded this religious sect in upstate new york in 1830.
but violent persecution smith was killed by a mob in illinois in 1844 prompted the mormons to head west in 1846 in search of an isolated homeland that could ensure their security and survival.
they eventually chose a valley in utah near the great salt lake territory then under mexican rule.
after the united states acquired the region following the mexican american war congress created the utah territory in 1850 see chapter 12 and by 1865 some 20 000 mormons lived in the region under a form of theocratic local rule where the church controlled most property businesses and public services.
gradually as more non mormons moved to utah and federal officials condemned the sects practice of polygamy a practice the mormons officially banned in 1896 the church took a less prominent role in public life.
joining exodusters mormons and nativeborn americans in the great migration into the trans mississippi west were more than two million immigrants.
they were drawn by the same desire for free or at least inexpensive farmland or to find work in mines on railroads or in the rapidly expanding economies of western towns and cities.
over time large concentrations of particular ethnic groups emerged.
for example 30 percent of minnesotas population in 1880 was foreign born including more than 66 000 germans 62 000 norwegians and 39 000 swedes.
drawn by jobs in the copper mines thousands of irish immigrants settled in butte montana.
by 1900 it was the most irish city in america.
15 5 seeking a better life in the west in response to poverty and mounting violence in the south more than 20 000 african americans known as exodusters migrated to kansas in 1879 1880 to acquire homesteads and start new lives as independent farmers.

why did different groups migrate to the west.
chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 as in the east increased ethnic and racial diversity and economic competition in the west led to tension and conflict that occasionally exploded into raw violence.
frequently victims of the violence were chinese immigrants.
by 1880 california was home to 75 132 chinese while 30 000 more lived elsewhere in the west.
but as this drawing 15 6 from harpers weekly shows anti chinese racism surged in the 1870s and 1880s as white laborers accused the chinese of taking jobs and lowering wages.
in this attack in 1885 at rock springs wyoming whites killed 28 chinese miners.
two years later white laborers massacred at least 34 chinese miners in hells canyon oregon.
railroads and land companies played a key role in promoting immigration to the west sending agents to europe and advertising there to encourage migration sometimes by entire villages directly to the west.
railroads brought more than two million immigrants to the trans mississippi west between 1870 and 1900.
california cornucopia of the world 1883 was one of countless posters that railroads placed in eastern seaports to attract newly arrived immigrants 15 7.
the competition among western states for settlers is indicated in the phrase without cyclones or blizzards a clear attempt to make california more appealing than the plains states like kansas.
also significant is the claim of room for millions of immigrants since only one year earlier congress with heavy lobbying from california passed the chinese exclusion act that barred chinese immigration to the united states.
15 7 the railroads promote westward settlement railroads placed promotional posters such as this one from 1883 in eastern cities to entice settlers to head west to settle on land owned by the railroads much of it acquired in land grants from the federal government.
why did railroads promote the migration of immigrants to the west.
15 6 anti chinese violence surges in the west in the 1870s and 1880s chinese workers in the american west faced hostility and violence from whites.
in this incident at rock springs wyoming in 1885 whites killed 28 chinese miners.
the economic transformation of the west the economic transformation of the west while many americans were inspired to migrate westward by notions of manifest destiny the primary motivation was economic a search for land and work.
as a result economic development was the chief driving force behind the profound transformations of the west after 1865.
by 1900 four major industries the railroad farming ranching and mining had fundamentally reshaped the region.
these industries employed millions of workers and supplied some of the essential needs of consumers and industry in the east and internationally.
such progress however was accompanied by labor exploitation environmental damage and conflict with indians.
the railroad fuels western development 15 8 shows the transcontinental railroad marked only the beginning of a vast transportation network of both major east west railroad lines such as the atlantic and pacific railroad and the northern pacific railroad and countless smaller feeder railroads.
this growing network opened up more and more western lands for farming allowing farmers in once remote areas to sell their grain in the national market.
the railroad also benefited many non farmers opening up western lands for mining and ranching and providing employment for thousands who built the lines 15 8 the spread of the railroad government loans and land grants helped spread a railroad network across the nation facilitating economic development and settlement in the west.
canada pac i f i c o c e a n between 1860 and 1900 the countrys agricultural output soared.
the number of farms in the united states grew from two million to six million with most of the growth taking place in the west.
agricultural output increased from 1 6 billion in 1860 to 4 3 billion in 1900.
several factors account for this agricultural boom.
new technologies such as the steel plow and mechanical reaper dramatically increased the acreage a farmer seattle could till.
the establishment of portland many agriculture schools most funded by states promontory and the federal point government led sacramento salt lake to advances in city denver san fertilization irfrancisco rigation crop rotation seed selection and the los angeles care of livestock.
one of the biggest factors el paso underlying this mexico boom in agriculture was the railroads in operation spread of the railby 1870 road.

chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 and later gained employment as firemen engineers switchmen mechanics dispatchers and clerks.
railroads also transformed the west by promoting urban growth.
many western cities like san francisco portland and denver were significant centers of trade before the arrival of the railroad.
once connected to the national rail network however they boomed into major metropolises.
their economies diversified as demand for construction food transportation and retail opened up new opportunities for entrepreneurs.
by 1890 the west was more urbanized than any region in the united states except the northeast.
between 1860 and 1890 for example denvers population rose from 2 600 to over 100 000 while omaha nebraskas soared from less than 2 000 to over 140 000.
like their eastern counterparts western cities struggled with urban problems including crime disorder corruption poor public health inadequate water and ethnic tensions.
hard times for farmers while the overall trend in this period was one of expansion and profit the reality for many farmers was struggle frustration and failure.
to begin with farmers faced unpredictable weather patterns.
farmers on the plains for example enjoyed unusually high levels of rainfall between 1878 and 1886 leading them to think this was the norm and encouraging still more farmers to acquire homesteads.
but a return to dry conditions and occasional drought after 1886 caused widespread hardship and failure.
other threats came from swarms of insects such as grasshoppers that attacked crops.
farmers also struggled with wild fluctuations in prices for their crops from year to year.
a plentiful harvest of wheat or corn often meant a glutted market and low prices.
in the 1880s wheat farmers on the plains saw prices fall due to competition with less expensive wheat grown in russia south america canada and australia.
sudden drops in prices pushed many farmers into foreclosure because most carried high levels of debt to finance the purchase of land and equipment such as harvesters plows and windmills.
these conditions favored larger farms revealing a significant flaw in the original homestead act in the more arid regions of the west the 160 acre allotment was too small for profitable farming.
by the 1880s so called bonanza farms of 1 000 acres or more became increasingly common in the dakotas and california.
with more capital these large enterprises could better afford the expensive equipment needed for plowing sowing and harvesting.
on top of all these challenges were the loneliness and drudgery of life on the plains.
as this photograph 15 9 of the four chrisman sisters standing by their sod house in custer county nebraska illustrates life on a western farm was often spartan.
sod houses and dugouts cut into hills lacked even the most basic amenities like running water and glass windows.
apart from occasional trips to town church court sessions and harvest fairs opportunities for social interaction were rare since farmers usually situated their homesteads far apart.
the chrisman sisters developed a strategy that diminished their isolation and allowed them to fulfill the homestead acts requirement that they live on their land to receive full title to it.
beginning with lizzies homestead claim in 1887 and luties in 1888 the two younger sisters took turns living on the homesteads keeping their sisters company helping on the farm and waiting until they were old enough to file their own claims.
hattie eventually did but all the homestead plots were gone by the time jennie ruth came of age.
to improve the lot of american farmers a former clerk in the department of agriculture named oliver 15 9 homesteading on the plains western farmers received 160 acres of free land through the homestead act but success required years of hard work and sacrifices such as living in crude sod houses.
this one in nebraska was owned by one of the four chrisman sisters shown here.
what challenges did western farmers face.
view the closer look thirty three horse team harvester watch the video video lectures the urban west the economic transformation of the west h kelley founded in 1867 the patrons of husbandry or grange.
this social and educational society was dedicated to alleviating the problems faced by farmers by promoting fellowship fraternity and education.
grangers as they were called shared ideas about farming through a newsletter and attended lectures by traveling experts.
local chapters opened across the nation and by the early 1870s the organization had several hundred thousand loyal members.
the grange was transformed into a powerful political movement during the economic depression triggered by the panic of 1873.
hundreds of thousands of farmers faced ruin as prices plummeted while their creditors demanded payment for loans and railroads charged high prices to transport their produce to market.
in their desperation they created granger parties which in 1874 won control of the legislatures of illinois wisconsin iowa and minnesota and gained significant influence in others.
they enacted granger laws some of the earliest regulations of banks and corporations especially railroads.
these measures set maximum rates for transporting or storing grain and banned abusive practices such as offering preferred customers special rates.
grangers tried as this 1873 cartoon 15 10 indicates to convince americans not involved in farming to recognize the threat posed to them by uncontrolled railroad power.
as a consolidation train a name suggesting monopoly pulls cars labeled extortion bribery usurpation and oppression a granger warns unsuspecting citizens of their impending doom.
railroad magnates denounced these limitations on their power and profit as unconstitutional and sued.
the supreme court however in two key cases in 1876 munn v illinois and peik v chicago and northwestern railway ruled that state legislatures had the legal authority under the constitution to regulate commerce including especially commerce between states.
despite this legal victory the granger movement faded when the depression lifted and farm product prices rose in the late 1870s.
the democratic and republican parties also added pro farmer planks to their platforms that made the granger parties seem less necessary.
the cattle kingdom another key emerging sector of the western economy was cattle ranching.
when the united states annexed texas in 1845 millions of longhorn cattle introduced to central america in the sixteenth century by the spanish roamed the range raised mainly for their skins and tallow.
but as americans developed a taste view the closer look railroad routes cattle trails gold and silver rushes 15 10 warning of the perils of monopoly the grangers saw themselves as reformers trying to warn the american public about the growing danger of powerful railroads to the survival of democracy and individual liberties.
for beef in the 1860s ranchers envisioned the great profits to be made if they could get their cattle to northern markets.
a longhorn that cost 4 in texas could be sold for 40 on the northern market.
beginning in 1866 and lasting two decades texas ranchers began the first of the annual long drives of more than 1 000 miles to bring the cattle to market.
ranchers charles goodnight and oliver loving drove thousands of cattle from texas to colorado prompting many imitators.
in 1867 another cattle entrepreneur joseph mccoy established a stockyard hotel bank and office in a small kansas town along the kansas pacific railroad.
advertising heavily he quickly turned abilene kansas for a time into the premier cattle drive destination.
by the late 1870s more than 600 000 longhorns arrived per year to be sold and transported by rail to chicago and other destinations for slaughter.
over time the need for the drives diminished as rail lines were extended from kansas into texas and entrepreneurs established large cattle ranches close to railroads in states such as kansas nebraska wyoming and colorado.
the period of the great cattle drives lasted only 20 years but it established the cowboy as an enduring icon of the old west.
nineteenth century dime novels paintings books and plays and in the twentieth century films depicted cowboys as paragons of manliness independence and courage who spent most of their days battling fierce indians and driving cattle see 15 21 on page 464 and nights in raucous saloons playing poker brawling and gun fighting.
but the life of a cowboy was far more difficult and why did western farmers resent the railroads.
chapter 15 15 11 african american cowboys despite the popular image of cowboys as white men many were african american and hispanic.
conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 complicated.
cattle drives exposed them to harsh weather that included searing heat flash floods and deadly blizzards.
cowboys wages averaged only about 1 a day or less if the price of beef fell and they survived on a relentless diet of meat beans and coffee.
they worked from dawn until dusk and then served a shift guarding the cattle at night against rustlers and indians.
moreover american cowboys were a far more diverse lot than the popular images depicting them as exclusively white men would indicate.
approximately one third of cowboys in the american west were nonwhite the largest group being mexican vaqueros.
indeed much of the equipment clothing techniques and culture of the american cowboy derived from mexican and spanish traditions.
this borrowing is evident in the many items associated with cowboys that bear names derived from spanish.
for example the word cowboy itself is a direct translation of the spanish term vaquero while other terms such as lariat la reata chaps chaparejos and wrangler catallerango are anglicized versions of spanish words.
african americans comprised the second largest group of nonwhite cowboys.
the eight black cowboys shown in this 1880s photograph 15 11 worked on the ranch of thomas jones shown standing in texas.
one of the most famous black cowboys was bose ikard.
born a slave in mississippi in 1847 he was taken to texas where he became a skilled cowboy.
freed by the civil war he played a key role in the first long drive led by goodnight and loving.
ranching held out the prospect of great profits but ranchers faced big challenges.
in the early 1870s how did the reality of cowboy life differ from that presented in popular culture.
the invention of barbed wire soon ended open range ranching and the long drives as farmers enclosed their land to protect crops from cattle hooves.
cattle ranchers also clashed with other livestock enterprises such as sheep herders over access to water and grazing lands.
these conflicts frequently led to violence and even widespread hostilities known as range wars ranchers like farmers also were vulnerable to extremes of weather losing cattle to scorching heat and drought and freezing cold and snow.
they also suffered from rapid expansion of the ranching industry in the mid 1880s and consequent flooding of the cattle market that caused a collapse of beef prices bankrupting many ranchers.
fortunes beneath the ground the mining booms while many western adventurers found fortune and failure in railroads farms and ranches still others tried their luck underground in the many mining districts that emerged in the west.
the second great western mining boom after california in 1849 see chapter 12 began in 1859 with the discovery of gold in colorado and silver in nevada.
the comstock lode as the nevada site was called yielded an astonishing 400 million in silver in the next 20 years.
as with most mining booms the initial wave of small time prospectors garnered only modest profits.
the real fortunes came in the succeeding years as heavily capitalized and incorporated enterprises established mining operations to extract the ore that lay deep underground.
among the titans who view the map atlas map the new economy of the west 1850 1893 the economic transformation of the west accrued stupendous fortunes were four irishmen john mackay jim fair james flood and william obrien known collectively as the silver kings they bought a controlling interest in a mine many declared spent and virtually worthless.
yet in 1873 their miners hit the greatest silver vein of them all the big bonanza that eventually yielded more than 100 million.
most fortune seekers however earned modest livings as wage earners working in the mines while others flocked to the resulting boomtown virginia city to work in construction dry goods stores and saloons.
thousands of women in virginia city found work in hotels laundries and restaurants.
unfortunately low wages and a lack of a family network to fall back upon forced many women to become prostitutes.
other discoveries of gold silver copper lead and zinc followed in colorado montana idaho wyoming and the dakotas.
as in nevada the initial prospectors eventually gave way to larger more sophisticated industrial operations that possessed the capital to invest in the technology needed to dig deep shafts extract the ore from rocks process it on site and ship it by rail to market.
like eastern industrialists such as andrew carnegie and john d rockefeller these corporations often integrated their resources with the means and methods of production to maximize profits see chapter 16.
the industrial revolution was not merely an eastern phenomenon.
the environmental legacy economic development in the trans mississippi west led to countless success stories of enterprising and risk taking individuals who established farms ranches mines and small businesses or who simply found lucrative employment in the regions many urban centers.
but such development often came at the expense of the natural environment.
mining for example came in many forms but in nearly every case it left behind a badly scarred landscape.
open pit mining of the mahoning iron ore mine in minnesotas mesabi range eliminated vast tracts of forest and created massive gouges in the land 15 12.
these changes shattered the local ecosystem and choked surrounding waterways with muddy runoff water.
hydraulic mining or the use of high pressure water streams to wash away soil and gravel created similar problems.
ore processing often used toxic chemicals to separate ore from rock or other materials.
miners simply dumped them into rivers or open fields where they eventually seeped into the water table and throughout the ecosystem.
the arrival of ever growing numbers of humans in the west altered the delicately balanced western ecosystems.
on the great plains for example hunting and other human activity led to the eradication or near eradication of elk bear wolf and buffalo populations.
conversely settlers introduced foreign animals and plants that lacking natural predators spread rapidly and disrupted the balance of the ecosystem.
for example cheatgrass accidentally introduced to the west from asia in the 1890s quickly spread over millions of acres wiping out or diminishing other flora and greatly increasing the incidence of wildfires.
farming in arid areas of the west through the use of deep cutting steel plows that loosened hard packed dry soil contributed to significant topsoil erosion.
vast herds of livestock had a similar effect as their grazing eliminated the grass whose roots held the soil in place.
likewise the practices of the timber industry led to deforestation the loss of habitat for many animal and plant species and without trees to shield the soil from heavy rainfall erosion.
some americans decried this environmental damage but most viewed the west through the lens of manifest destiny seeing it as a place of limitless resources provided by god for the enjoyment and enrichment of human beings.
view the closer look competing visions preservation versus exploitation 15 12 the price of unchecked economic development western states bowed to the powerful and profitable mining industry leaving its practices unregulated.
as a result methods such as open pit mining led to serious environmental damage.
how did human settlement and economic development alter the western environment.
chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 native americans under siege westward expansion benefited many americans but it devastated native americans.
they faced a relentless tide of white settlers who possessed both superior weaponry and a belief that they had a higher claim to western land.
white settlers also enjoyed the support of the federal government and army.
the result for native americans in the last third of the nineteenth century was broken treaties devastating wars relocation to reservations and forced assimilation.
15 13 promoting an image of indian savagery this 1853 sculpture by horatio greenough promoted the idea among white americans that native americans were violent savages.
15 14 seeing savagery greenoughs image became so widely known that a dime novel artist easily adapted it to a daniel boone story.
mounting problems for native americans in 1851 as it became clear that the traditional government policy of simply forcing tribes into the west was no longer viable because of increased white migration into the region congress passed the indian appropriations act.
it set aside vast tracts of the oklahoma territory as reservations for dozens of native american tribes.
that same year the u s government the sioux and other plains tribes signed the first treaty of fort laramie.
in exchange for declaring nearly all of the central and northern great plains off limits to white settlement the tribes agreed to allow whites to pass unmolested along the oregon trail as they moved westward.
but the lasting peace that government officials and tribal leaders hoped the treaty would secure did not materialize.
tension and violence between white settlers and native american tribes only increased in the coming years.
one of the most serious problems native americans faced in resisting euro american incursion onto their lands was the racism of white americans that characterized indians as backward pagan violent savages who lacked a rightful claim to why did the government sign treaties with native american tribes.
the lands they occupied.
as competing visions inevitable progress or unjust invasion.
makes clear many americans believed their own culture was vastly superior and viewed native americans as obstacles to national progress that must be removed.
these notions originated in the colonial period but greater contact and conflict between whites and indians after 1850 led to a proliferation of largely negative depictions of native americans in newspapers magazines songs plays and works of art like the rescue by sculptor horatio greenough 15 13.
commissioned by the federal government and placed at the entrance to the u s capitol in 1853 the scene drew on the many sensationalized stories and paintings of white settlers especially women being kidnapped raped and murdered by native americans.
but greenough departed from the traditional depictions and introduced a towering dominant white settler.
note the contrasts in the mens size demeanor and clothing.
i have endeavoured greenough explained to convey the idea of the triumph of the whites over the savage tribes by 1874 the scene had merged with the life of the famous pioneer and icon of frontier masculinity daniel boone 15 14.
both images proclaim indian savagery and justify white domination a message that eventually resulted in the sculptures removal from public view in 1958.

as you read these documents from 1877 the first by an englishman william blackmore and the second by the famous sioux chief sitting bull consider the sharply different ideas expressed over which group had the higher claim to the land and which culture brought a more moral and enlightened notion of how to treat it.
how does blackmore make the extinction of native americans seem natural and inevitable.
what message does this notion convey to white americans.
how does sitting bull express the native american vision of nature and access to resources.
how does he criticize the vision of whites like blackmore.
william blackmore introduction to richard irving dodge the plains of the great west and their inhabitants 1877 all authorities who have investigated the subject are unanimous in predicting that the red men are a doomed race.
the indians will as surely disappear before the progress of the more energetic and aggressive anglo saxon as sure as the snows of winter melt away before the summer sun.
but sad as the fate of the red man is yet even as philanthropists we must not forget that under what appear to be one of immutable laws of progress the savage is giving place to a higher and more civilized race.
three hundred thousand red men at the present time require the occupation of an entire continent as large as europe in order that they may obtain an uncertain and scanty subsistence by the chase.
ought we then to regret if in the course of a few generations their wigwams tepees and mud lodges rarely numbering more than one hundred in a village are replaced by new cities of the west each equaling perhaps in magnificence in stately structures and population exceeding that of all the indians either in st louis or chicago.
or if in supplanting less than 300 000 wandering debased and half naked savages we can people the self same district with a population of many tens of millions of many prosperous and highly civilized whites.
in a few years the only reminiscence of the red men will be the preservation of the names of some of the extinct tribes and dead chiefs in the nomenclature of the leading cities counties and states of the great west.

chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 women and children were killed and scalped children shot at their mothers breasts and all the bodies mutilated in the most horrible manner.
colonel j m chivington all the time inciting his troops to their diabolical outrages major edward wynkoop testimony before congressional committee investigating the sand creek massacre white hostility to native americans shaped government policy especially when it came to signing and honoring treaties.
invariably it seemed federal officials negotiated treaties with tribes that promised to permanently fix the boundaries of their hunting grounds and places of habitation only to find soon thereafter that whites hungry for land had begun settling there.
rather than enforce the terms of the treaty and force the removal of white settlers the government inevitably revised the treaty to further shrink designated native american lands.
this combination of white settlers desire for land and disregard for native americans rights and the efforts of native americans to resist white encroachment led to repeated outbreaks of violence.
one of the worst incidents was the sand creek massacre.
on november 29 1864 angered by sporadic attacks on settlers by native american tribes in colorado a military outfit under colonel john m chivington raided a peaceful encampment of 800 cheyenne at sand creek.
with most of the cheyenne men off hunting chivingtons force slaughtered more than 200 indians mostly defenseless women and children mutilated their bodies and returned to denver with their scalps.
native americans also confronted epidemics of diseases such as smallpox and measles diseases that they possessed little or no resistance to.
while the worst devastation had taken place in previous centuries during initial european contact see chapter 1 epidemics continued to kill thousands.
for example a smallpox outbreak in the pacific northwest in 1862 killed some 12 000 indians.

how did negative stereotypes of native americans influence government policy.
view the closer look railroad and buffalo native americans under siege through trade with whites further compromised native american health.
additionally long standing animosities among tribes prevented native americans from developing a united front against the u s army.
white officials took advantage of these divisions to obtain help from one tribe in the form of guides and even soldiers against another.
disunity within tribes also contributed to this problem as individual bands guarded their autonomy and resisted the idea of centralized tribal authority.
for example in 1863 leaders of the nez perce tribe split over whether to sign a treaty that would confine them to a reservation.
the plains tribes dependence on the buffalo left them particularly vulnerable in the 1870s.
railroad companies disdainful of the large herds that occasionally disrupted the passage of trains hired gunmen to kill buffalo.
entrepreneurs made buffalo robes fashionable in the east thereby encouraging hunters to kill still more buffalo.
the army soon recognized the strategic value of wiping out the great herds to undermine the independence of the plains tribes and force them to stay on reservation lands.
the scale of extermination was staggering.
in this photograph 15 15 workers at the michigan carbon works prepare thousands of buffalo skulls for processing into fertilizer glue and other products.
the buffalo population estimated at 30 million in 1800 plunged to only a few thousand by the early 1880s creating a crisis for the plains indians who depended on them.
the technological disparity between indians and white settlers left the latter at a great disadvantage.
euro american settlers and soldiers alike were heavily armed with modern rifles.
the army also had early machine guns called gatling guns and heavy artillery.
while many native american tribes had long ago acquired firearms they never produced guns and ammunition and remained dependent on whites for them.
the telegraph also allowed the army to communicate over great distances about troop movements and native american military activity and request supplies and reinforcements.
wars on the plains despite its lack of commitment to honoring them the federal government nonetheless signed many treaties in the late 1860s hoping to bring peace to the west and allow continued settlement by whites.
treaties were drawn up and signed with the apache cheyenne and arapaho in read the document chief red clouds speech 1865 the kiowa comanche and apache in 1867 the medicine lodge treaty and the sioux the second fort laramie treaty in 1868.
the latter treaty ended red clouds war 1866 1868 a conflict that erupted when the army announced plans to build forts along the bozeman trail in the wyoming and montana territories to protect white migrants drawn by the discovery of gold in montana.
it guaranteed to the sioux ownership of the black hills and land and hunting rights in south dakota wyoming and montana.
it also explicitly barred white people from these lands.
from this day forward all war between the parties to this agreement shall forever cease declared the treaty in words that would soon prove false.
the government of the united states desires peace and its honor is hereby pledged to keep it despite these measures continued violation of treaties by white settlers who ventured onto indian lands and bands of indians who refused to accept confinement on reservation lands led to increased bloodshed.
the red river war broke out in 1874 on the southern plains in present day texas oklahoma and kansas when bands of kiowa comanche southern cheyenne and southern arapaho angered over the federal governments failure to uphold its obligation to provide adequate supplies and keep whites off the reservation land the army actually organized buffalo hunting parties that devastated local herds left the reservation and raided white settlements.
led by general philip sheridan the army crushed the rebellion by the spring of 1875 thereby ending native american resistance on the southern plains.
by then the primary conflict had shifted to the northern plains.
the discovery of gold in the black hills of south dakota in 1874 touched off a flood of white fortune seekers into the region that was indisputably as stipulated in the 1868 fort laramie treaty territory granted exclusively to native american tribes.
rather than keep white trespassers out however the federal government demanded the sioux vacate their red river hunting grounds and return to their reservations.
when the tribes refused to comply the army launched an offensive.
in the late spring 1876 the seventh cavalry led by a young and vainglorious lieutenant colonel named george armstrong custer closed in on a large band of cheyenne sioux and arapaho warriors including the well known crazy horse and sitting bull near the little bighorn river in how did the dependence of the plains indians on the buffalo weaken their ability to resist the loss of their lands.
chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 montana.
eager to earn fame and believing there were only a few hundred indian warriors when in fact the number was closer to 2 000 custer attacked before the rest of the army and other officers who might overshadow him arrived.
the battle of little bighorn quickly disintegrated into one of the most devastating defeats ever suffered by the u s military as custer and more than 250 of his men were killed.
although the battle was an overwhelming triumph for the sioux cheyenne and arapaho it quickly proved a hollow victory.
as this cartoon 15 16 published in the new york graphic a few weeks after the battle demonstrates the eastern media ignored custers blundering and instead depicted him and his men as valiant victims and demanded vengeance.
note the artists blunt depiction of indians as savage semi animal beings in stark contrast to the two white soldiers one a heroic victim and the other a coolheaded executioner.
the caption the right way to dispose of sitting bull and his braves what the country expects of general sheridan was a not so subtle assertion of the popular belief that the government was showing too much leniency toward native americans who resisted white expansion.
responding to this pressure the government expanded military action in the black hills and forced the sioux and other defiant tribes onto reservations.

this image appeared in the new york graphic august 15 1876 with the caption the right way to dispose of sitting bull and his braves what the country expects of general sheridan how did the victory over custer and his men ultimately prove costly to the plains indians.
farther west native tribes encountered similar problems.
during the last third of the nineteenth century the states and territories west of the rockies also were growing.
the mining and railroad industries the economic centerpieces of that native americans under siege region required a great deal of land land long occupied by native americans.
just as on the great plains the tribes on the west coast and in the intermountain west faced an encroaching white population that considered the land theirs for the taking.
in 1876 following the massacre of custer and the seventh cavalry army and government officials increased pressure on tribes to move to reservations.
one such group targeted was a portion of the nez perce tribe that lived on the northwestern plateau of idaho oregon and washington.
in 1863 most of the nez perce had agreed to move onto a reservation but about a quarter had refused.
led by chief joseph about 750 nez perce 500 of them women children and elderly non combatants fled the region to escape the army.
over the ensuing four months they engaged in an epic flight of 1 400 miles hoping to cross into canada.
despite their small numbers and dwindling supplies they defeated the army in several battles and came within 40 miles of the canadian border before they were forced to surrender to the army and to life on a reservation.
similar scenes of final military resistance played out in the southwest.
an apache warrior named geronimo had emerged in the 1860s and 1870s as a fearless opponent to encroaching euro american and mexican settlers.
captured in 1874 geronimo and some 4 000 apaches were sent to a reservation at san carlos arizona.
the grim life on the reservation led him to escape and resume his campaign of resistance.
he surrendered in 1884 but in 1885 and again in 1886 geronimo escaped with a few warriors and their families and eluded capture for months.
these escapades added to his already legendary status but he eventually surrendered for good in 1886 ending the last significant native american resistance.
in the 1880s and 1890s resistance to exploitation and abuse also erupted in the southwest among hispanos descendants of spanish colonists and mexicans.
euro american settlers who arrived in new mexico in the mid nineteenth century eventually gave rise to a powerful ruling class of politicians landowners and ranchers.
many allied themselves with powerful gangs that provided protection and intimidated and sometimes killed their rivals.
poor hispano and mexican farmers often bore the brunt of these ruling euro americans ruthless tactics and hunger for read the document helen hunt jackson from a century of dishonor 1881 land.
when officials began to sell off to speculators and ranchers what had long been used as common grazing lands the poor farmers resisted.
the most famous of these resistors were las gorras blancas or the white caps a secret militant vigilante group of mexican men who in the late 1880s and early 1890s wore white masks and cut fences on lands taken over by speculators.
they also destroyed railroad bridges buildings and crops.
in pursuit of a solution while most americans expressed little concern over the fate of native americans in the west a few did protest.
one of the first was helen hunt jackson.
inspired by an 1879 lecture by susette la flesche and her uncle chief standing bear relating the plight of the ponca tribe to an audience in connecticut she began speaking and lobbying on behalf of native americans.
in 1881 she published a century of dishonor a book that chronicled in searing detail the misguided and murderous treatment of native americans by the u s government.
the book prompted congress to appoint a commission to study indian affairs and seek a new and more humane policy.
hear me my chiefs.
i am tired.
my heart is sick and sad.
from where the sun now stands i will fight no more forever chief joseph shortly after his surrender in 1877 another influential reformer garnered a wide audience as an authentic spokesperson for the native americans.
sarah winnemucca the granddaughter of a northern paiute chief had received some education from white families in nevada and california and worked as a translator for the army.
in the late 1870s her lectures in the east demanding more humane treatment of the paiutes and other tribes brought her to the attention of reformers.
winnemucca tried to gain credibility among whites by presenting herself as an indian princess an image firmly established in american popular why did native americans resist the governments demand that they settle on reservations.
chapter 15 15 17 speaking out for nativeamerican rights sarah winnemucca a member of the paiute tribe in california drew attention to the injustices being suffered by native americans through a speaking tour of the eastern united states and the publication of a book.
conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 culture by the mid nineteenth century notably in the story of pocahontas see chapter 2.
in her posed portrait 15 17 hardly anything in her costume especially the crown and bag embroidered with a cupid and bow and arrow resembles traditional paiute clothing and jewelry.
nonetheless in an era when the political and social opinions of women especially native american women were largely ignored winnemuccas strategy brought extensive and respectful press coverage of her speeches and eventually her book life among the paiutes their wrongs and claims 1883.
in the history of the indians wrote one reporter in 1885 she and pocahontas will be the principal female characters both jackson and winnemucca promoted education for native americans but with different goals in mind.
jackson represented the reformers who believed it the duty of the government to elevate native americans from savagery by educating and assimilating them into white euro american society.
in particular they advocated the establishment of boarding schools for indian children and the eventual dissolution of reservations see choices and consequences forced assimilation versus cultural preservation.
in contrast winnemucca believed in formal education but not at the expense of eliminating native american culture.
she believed that indian children could become educated and productive americans while retaining the core of their culture and traditions.
jacksons ideas prevailed among reformminded legislators in congress concerned about the plight of native americans especially senator henry l dawes.
in 1887 congress passed the dawes severalty act to break up the reservations why did reformers like dawes believe the break up of reservations would benefit native americans.
you dare to cry out liberty when you hold us in places against our will driving us from place to place as if we were beasts sarah winnemucca life among the paiutes their wrongs and claims 1883 and assimilate native americans into the dominant white christian american culture.
the plan offered native american heads of household allotments of 160 acres of reservation land with smaller amounts going to those unmarried or under age 18 to encourage them to become independent family farmers.
remaining reservation lands would be sold off and the profits set aside for tools and education.
native americans who accepted these terms could apply for u s citizenship.
to prevent speculators from defrauding indians land allotments would be held in trust for 25 years before full ownership was conferred.
the dawes severalty act and subsequent related laws was born of high ideals and good intentions but it proved devastating to the native americans it was intended to help.
the program was rife with flaws beginning with the allotment of land that was often of poor quality making successful farming difficult if not impossible.
it also included restrictions on read the document autobiographical narrative by zitkala sa on her first days at boarding school in indiana 1900 native americans under siege choices and consequences forced assimilation versus cultural preservation the dawes severalty act of 1887 stipulated that revenue generated from the sale of reservation lands be applied to the education of native american children.
as with the land allotment plan the principal motivation of people like dawes and reformer helen hunt jackson was to assimilate indians into american society which they believed would be facilitated by providing vocational training to enhance their job prospects.
but the act did not specify what kind of education ought to be provided and so congress and the bureau of indian affairs faced a choice.
choices establish reservation based schools offering a traditional public school curriculum while allowing native americans to maintain their culture and language.
establish reservation based schools offering a traditional public school curriculum while requiring a higher degree of assimilation especially learning english.
establish off reservation boarding schools committed to eliminating all vestiges of native american culture.
decision the government chose to establish off reservation boarding schools.
the model was the carlisle indian industrial school in carlisle pennsylvania.
established in 1879 it operated on the simple but brutal principle of kill the indian save the man as the before and after photographs indicate native american children sent to boarding schools were required to cut their hair wear american clothing take an american name and speak only english.
some schools made conversion to christianity a top priority.
consequences removal from families and fellow native americans on their reservations caused many children to suffer psychological trauma.
many also suffered from physical abuse malnutrition and poor health care.
about one in seven ran away and many committed suicide.
still by 1902 25 federally funded boarding schools and many more private ones operated in 15 states with 6 000 students.
continuing controversies what was the long term impact of the boarding schools.
along with the trauma inflicted on generations of children it hastened the demise of native american culture including the disappearance or near disappearance of many languages.
native american groups have filed lawsuits against the government and the churches that ran the schools and demanded formal apologies.

chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 hunting further limiting options for participants.
despite safeguards white speculators and scammers found ways to con native americans out of their allotted land long before the 25 year term.
the act also allowed as indicated by the poster 15 18 the government to sell land deemed surplus to white settlers.
this poster touts the high quality of the estimated 350 000 acres being offered for sale in 1910.
as the map 15 19 shows by the time the dawes act was replaced in 1934 two thirds of native american reservation land had been lost.
15 18 selling off reservation lands this advertisement issued by the federal government in 1911 vividly illustrates the dawes severalty act in action as it exuberantly proclaims a sale of 350 000 acres of indian land.
land transferred from indians to whites land held by or returned to indians 15 19 the loss of native american lands native american land possessions shrank steadily in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries through treaties sales and forced expulsion by white settlers and soldiers.
in 1887 the dawes severalty act accelerated this trend by encouraging the breakup of reservations.
how did the dawes act play a key role in the loss of native american land.
resistance and romanticism resistance and romanticism the surrender of geronimo in 1886 symbolized the end of significant armed resistance by native americans to the euro american settlement of the trans mississippi west.
nonetheless a revival movement called the ghost dance offered one final chance to reverse the fortunes of native americans.
when that effort was brutally crushed by the army at a place called wounded knee native americans turned to more subtle and enduring efforts to preserve their tribes families and culture.
at the same time white americans continued to fashion a pleasing image of the west as a place of adventure heroism individualism and opportunity.
this image found its way into art literature music and popular culture in the twentieth century.
yet historians and activists have offered a corrective to this romantic image that takes into account the experiences of native americans mexicans and women and the impact on the environment.
persecution and persistence the last major form of resistance to the euroamerican conquest of the west emerged in the late 1880s.
the ghost dance movement originated in the 1870s but did not become widely popular until a northern paiute shaman named wovoka began preaching a message of native american revival based on a vision he had experienced during a total eclipse of the sun in 1889.
in this vision which he related to his followers a great flood scoured the land clean of all white settlers leaving behind indians who had remained true to traditional teachings and a renewed herd of buffalo.
wovoka told his followers to perform the ghost dance a ritual ceremony where participants donned special shirts and danced in a circle until brought to an ecstatic state that they believed drew to them the spirits of ancestors who would protect them from the white mans bullets.
the hopeful message of the ghost dance spread rapidly among native americans from the rocky mountains to the great plains alarming federal officials who feared it contained the seeds of rebellion.
the director of the pine ridge reservation in south dakota ordered sitting bull arrested.
when he resisted the police shot him dead.
two weeks later on december 29 1890 the army confronted about 300 sioux ghost dancers at wounded knee creek in south dakota.
when one of the indians accidentally fired his gun the soldiers attacked and massacred more than 200.
this photograph 15 20 the medicine man taken at wounded knee s d conveyed the brutality of the event.
the date of january 1 1891 on the photograph indicates that bodies were left unattended for days before being interred in a mass grave.
note the rifle placed on the body by a soldier so that the photographer could present an image of a hostile indian.
it was not the bloodiest clash between native americans and the u s army but the wounded knee massacre symbolized the brutality associated with the conquest of the west.
the end of armed conflict did not mean an end to resistance for native americans.
in the coming read the document accounts of the wounded knee massacre 15 20 massacre at wounded knee in an incident that symbolized american brutality toward native americans soldiers killed between 200 and 300 sioux at wounded knee south dakota after a tense standoff over the ghost dance movement.
why was wovokas message so appealing to indians and so frightening to military officials.
chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 decades as they struggled with the loss of tribal lands the cultural erosion caused by the boarding schools and high levels of poverty and alcoholism native americans found ways to preserve their culture including languages artistic forms and religious beliefs.
they did so by maintaining traditions within families and establishing informal methods of passing on traditions from one generation to the next.
as a result when a native american rights movement emerged in the 1960s and 1970s it included a commitment to reaffirming and strengthening traditional native american cultures.
creating mythical heroes and images the story of the american west has long been the object of romanticism and myth.
the image of the west as a place of high adventure heroism rugged individualism and endless opportunity developed with the first enthusiastic reports of western explorers such as lewis and clarke see chapter 7.
but this image really flourished after 1850 as more migrants and journalists headed west and sent back to the east countless letters and dispatches describing the wests wide open lands roaring rivers and majestic mountains as well as the heroic struggles of pioneers against weather and hostile indians.
eventually writers turned to fiction especially a new genre known as the dime novel the first western dime novels appeared in the 1860s and their subjects characters like cowboy deadwood dick and his rough and ready girlfriend calamity jane soon became pop heroes.
so too did buffalo bill.
stories based on the legendary exploits of a real western scout buffalo hunter and pony express rider named william buffalo bill cody first appeared in a newspaper and then in dime novel form as buffalo bill king of the border men.
when it sold well its author and many imitators wrote hundreds more buffalo bill stories.
cody grew famous but he earned no royalties from the novels.
to capitalize on his fame he created in 1883 buffalo bills wild west a circus like production that purported to show audiences the thrilling and harrowing life on the frontier replete with huge reenactments of cattle drives and clashes between indians and cowboys and exhibitions of marksmanship why did the west become such a popular topic in entertainment and literature.
cattle roping and riding.
immensely popular it grew more elaborate every year eventually topping out at 400 horses and 650 cowboys indians musicians and support staff.
over time cody added big name stars like the famous sharpshooter annie oakley and even the sioux chief sitting bull.
most americans indeed much of the western world viewed the west through buffalo bills performances as a place of heroism optimism gallantry and success see images as history annie oakley.
the west in art and literature western imagery and ideas also shaped american art and literature.
mark twain whose real name was samuel langhorne clemens emerged in the late nineteenth century as one of the first american novelists generally unaffected by european mores.
twain headed west in the early 1860s seeking adventure and wealth in nevadas comstock lode mines.
the result was his classic book roughing it 1872.
based on his experiences of the wild life in virginia city nevada the book fit in with the evolving western tradition of the yarn or tall tale.
twains major works the adventures of tom sawyer 1876 and the adventures of huckleberry finn 1884 were set along the earlier frontier of the mississippi river and both contained western themes of adventure individualism and a desire to escape the constraints of modern society for a purer more authentic world.
when huck finn sets out at the end of the book to start life anew he heads for the west.
many subsequent writers like owen wister and zane grey popularized this vision of the west especially the figure of the cowboy as the embodiment of american manliness decency courage and common sense.
in addition to writers artists popularized a heroic image of the west.
one of the most famous was frederic remington.
raised in the east remington eventually made his way west where he worked a variety of jobs before becoming a newspaper artist covering battles between the army and native americans.
drawing upon earlier western artists like george catlin see 15 4 he painted drew and sculpted vivid scenes of western life.
most were vignettes of the lives of unknown cowboys native americans and soldiers.
resistance and romanticism images as history annie oakley two years after william cody launched his wild west show he hired a woman who became one of his most celebrated performers.
born and raised not in the west but in ohio annie oakley was a gifted sharpshooter.
she had been taught to shoot at a young age and killed game to earn money for her struggling family.
at age 16 she beat a professional in a sharpshooting match.
she soon married the man and joined him on stage.
in 1885 they joined buffalo bills wild west.
for 16 seasons oakley thrilled audiences with her marksmanship.
she shot cigarettes from her husbands mouth and coins from his fingers.
she blasted an endless succession of glass balls thrown in the air.
she hit a target behind her by holding a mirror in one hand and shooting over her shoulder with the other.
no one could match the peerless lady wing shot but as this photograph and virtually every one she posed for show an essential part of oakleys appeal lay in her image as an ideal frontier woman who combined victorian femininity and rugged almost masculine strength.
oakleys adoring public was not put off by her entry into the traditionally male world of guns and horses because she presented a pleasing and reassuring feminine persona.
in so doing annie oakley the woman from ohio played a key role in shaping the evolving mythical image americans held of the old west.
oakleys dual image as both feminine and tough is captured in her facial expression.
in all of her studio portraits she presents herself as beautiful and composed but unsmiling to emphasize her grit and fearlessness.
while oakley radiated a beguiling feminine charm she entered the show ring skipping and blowing kisses to the audience this hand on hip pose was masculine and expressive of the manly self assuredness that audiences associated with cowboys.
oakleys outfit was modeled on the cowboys but with exceptions to emphasize her femininity.
unlike the oblong cowboy hat hers had a broad round brim.
she set it on the back of her head to reveal her face and ladylike curls.
conforming to victorian mores about proper behavior for women oakley always wore a dress and rode side saddle.
she always appeared with a gun a central icon of how americans in the late nineteenth century understood the west.
it was a symbol they associated almost entirely with men.
her many medals were intended to lend her authenticity as if to say that although she was a performer her skills as a shooter were real.
annie oakley poses for one of her many studio portraits depicting an idealized image of a frontier woman.
what traits did annie oakley portray to present an ideal woman of the west.
chapter 15 conflict and conquest the transformation of the west 1860 1900 one exception was lt col george a custer whom remington helped make into a hero after the battle of little bighorn.
charles russell a cowboy turned artist also emerged as a leader of western art producing works that often depicted more sensational and imaginative scenes than remingtons.
both men played a central role in creating the iconic image of the american cowboy.
russells 1897 painting 15 21 is typical of most depictions showing skilled and fearless cowboys roping a bull.
historians reinterpret the american west 15 21 the making of an american icon artists such as charles russell who painted this scene the herd quitters in 1897 played a central role in promoting the cowboy as a symbol of the west and the west as a place of heroism daring and manly individualism.
another key influence on the way americans came to develop a particular image of the west was the work of historian frederick jackson turner.
in 1893 he published an essay the significance of the frontier in american history that focused on a recent announcement by the census bureau based on data compiled from the 1890 census that the american frontier was closed that is the united states was essentially settled from coast to coast.
he argued in what historians came to call the frontier thesis that the frontier had played a vital role in shaping the american character and american institutions.
the frontiers importance began with the first settlers along the eastern seaboard during the colonial period and continued in every succeeding generation as it pushed farther and farther west.
this seemingly endless supply of land created how have new western historians changed the way many americans understand the history of the west.
widespread opportunity for upward mobility.
the demands of the frontier turner argued forced americans to develop a spirit of rugged individualism and innovation.
frontier life also fostered values such as equality and democracy because success was determined not by ones background but rather by ones ability to work hard sacrifice and command the respect of others.
turners thesis proved enormously influential.
generations of western historians based their writing and research on his ideas about the frontier.
his influence also spread well beyond western history indeed well beyond the study of history itself.
some american politicians and policy makers reacted to the apparent closing of the frontier in the 1890s by embracing imperialism to acquire new lands and markets that might make up for the absence of new places to conquer within the united states see chapter 19.
during the second half of the twentieth century a new generation of historians challenged turners thesis.
one of the leading figures in this new western history movement is patricia nelson limerick who in 1987 published the legacy of conquest the unbroken past of the american west.
just as turners article was a product of the optimism and anxiety of late nineteenth century american society limericks book offered an interpretation that reflected the fact that she was a woman raised in the 1960s a time of social ferment when historians began to focus more on racial ethnic and gender issues.
consequently she brought a far more critical eye to her study of the west than turner.
while turner had depicted white euroamerican settlers as triumphing over such obstacles as a stubborn landscape and a fierce race of savages historians like limerick present a far more complicated story.
they emphasize for example that native americans had inhabited the west for thousands of years before the arrival of europeans and thus had a legitimate claim to the land.
viewed from this perspective the story of westward migration was one of violence exploitation and conquest.
new western historians also stress the diversity of the west seeing it as a meeting place of native americans euro americans immigrants from europe and asia african americans mexicans and hispanos who contributed to and shaped a western read the document frederick jackson turner the significance of the frontier in american history 1893 resistance and romanticism 15 22 reinterpreting the history of the west after more than 125 years of commemorating only custer and his men in 2003 the site of the battle of little bighorn added an indian memorial to honor the native americans who fell there.
culture that was not simply white finally these historians study the environmental impact of westward economic development.
this new way of seeing the history of the west in recent years has had an impact beyond the history books.
hollywood films on western themes also began to change.
in the classic western epics of the 1940s and 1950s cowboys were heroes fighting indians who terrorized innocent white settlers.
beginning in the 1990s filmmakers began to present a more complicated view of westward settlement lawlessness and white indian conflict.
dances with wolves 1990 for example presented native americans in sympathetic terms.
unforgiven 1992 presented the west as a place of violence lawlessness failure desperation and corruption where the line between good and evil is not at all clear.
many more such films followed.
this reassessment of the wests history has also changed the way museums and public memorials present key chapters in american history.
nowhere is this more apparent than at the site of the 1876 battle of little bighorn.
for more than a century following the battle the site memorialized custer and his men as heroic martyrs who died in the cause of western settlement.
named the custer battlefield national cemetery it featured a memorial to the seventh cavalry and some indian scouts on last stand hill.
native americans who of course won the battle were ignored.
but the influence of new western history and native american activism led to the renaming in 1991 of the site as the little bighorn battlefield national monument and in 2003 the unveiling of the native american memorial shown here 15 22.
only 100 yards from the seventh cavalry monument it features three bronze outline sculptures representing sioux cheyenne and arapaho warriors who participated in the battle.
its official theme is peace through unity but it also represents a growing awareness that for far too long americans relied on an incomplete and overly simplistic understanding of the history of the american west.
why are native americans so committed to reshaping the interpretation of historic sites like little bighorn.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 the civil war ended in april 1865 concluding the bloodiest and most divisive conflict in american history.
the period that followed came to be known as reconstruction for several reasons.
most obviously the name called to mind the need to rebuild the war torn south.
it also referred to the effort to reestablish the union torn apart by secession.
finally it indicated the need to remake southern society in the wake of slaverys destruction.
the complexities and challenges of this last goal are evident in winslow homers 1876 painting a visit from the old mistress which depicts ex slaves being visited by their former owner.
the elegant clothing worn by the old mistress suggests she has money but clearly the relationship between the women has changed significantly in the wake of emancipation.
to begin with the mistress has come to visit the former slaves in their home suggesting a diminishing of her status and power relative to them.
the scene also lacks any sense of the affection that plantation owners always assured themselves existed between slaves and masters.
indeed the three african american women eye the mistress warily.
one of them even chooses to remain seated in what surely would have been considered a show of contempt.
the old order was gone but what would replace it remained unclear in the aftermath of the war.
americans entered the reconstruction period facing the profound questions raised by war and emancipation.
could whites and former slaves live together in peace and mutual respect.
what rights were the freedmen entitled to and who would guarantee these rights.
the different answers articulated by freedmen and white southerners revealed sharply divergent visions of the future and led to a bitter struggle to define the meaning of freedom.
verily observed ex slave frederick douglass the work does not end with the abolition of slavery but only begins never before had i a word of impudence from any of our black folk but they are not ours any longer susan bradford observing the defiant attitude among former slaves on her florida plantation 1865 chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 preparing for reconstruction long before the emancipation proclamation took effect on january 1 1863 countless thousands of enslaved africans took advantage of the chaos produced by the war to liberate themselves.
their actions raised a host of questions about what rights the freedmen would be entitled to including land ownership and voting.
lincoln and his advisers preferred to wait until the war was won before addressing these questions but actions taken by the freedmen to assert their rights and secure their liberty forced the lincoln administration to develop policies during the war that ultimately shaped postwar reconstruction.
emancipation test cases even before the emancipation proclamation took effect the federal government realized that it needed to enact policies regarding the growing numbers of freedmen in areas of the south occupied by the union army.
these policies varied by region and were shaped by local customs and the attitudes of freedmen and white officials.
as such they amounted to test cases for the coming debate over reconstruction.
three of these test cases revealed both the promise and the conflict surrounding emancipation.
the first test case began when federal forces seized the sea islands off the coast of south carolina in november 1861.
they found a vast system of cotton plantations but no planters.
the latter had fled leaving behind 10 000 slaves who moved quickly to establish new lives based on their understanding of freedom.
while clearly posed planting sweet potatoes 14 1 shot by a new hampshire photographer visiting a regiment from his state stationed on one of the islands captured one fundamental way in which ex slaves expressed their freedom.
rejecting cotton a crop they associated with slavery they planted crops of their own choosing such as sweet potatoes and corn for local consumption.
freedom for the african americans of the sea islands meant a future as independent farmers living free of white control.
many northern whites who arrived after the military takeover however brought with them a different vision of the future for the sea islands.
convinced that sea island blacks should resume their labors on cotton plantations not as slaves but as paid wage earners federal officials chose not to grant land to the freedmen.
this decision was driven in part by the sincere belief that subsistence farming on small tracts of land was backward harmful to the long term 14 1 freedmen in the sea islands cultivating sweet potatoes 1862 most freedmen refused to grow cotton considering it a symbol of slavery.
they grew sweet potatoes and other crops such as corn primarily for their own consumption.
how did freedmen define freedom in the sea islands.
read the document charlotte forten life on the sea islands preparing for reconstruction interests of the freedmen and also by the racist notion that african americans could not handle freedom responsibly without the guidance of white employers.
consequently they auctioned the land off to the highest bidder.
northern investors bought most of the land hired freedmen as wage laborers and resumed cotton cultivation.
a second test case unfolded on davis bend the mississippi plantations owned by confederate president jefferson davis and his brother joseph.
before the civil war they had tried to make davis bend a model slave labor community where slaves received better food and were granted considerable autonomy.
the davis brothers hoped other planters would follow their example and thus refute the abolitionist argument that slavery was inhumane.
instead davis bend became a model of a very different sort of ideal one that vividly demonstrated what freedmen could achieve if granted land and autonomy.
when general ulysses s grant arrived and found the former slaves running the plantations he ordered federal officials to lease land to the freedmen.
unlike the freedmen of the sea islands the african american residents of davis bend did not have to contend with northerners seeking to reassert white control over the land and impose a wage labor system.
as a consequence by 1865 davis bend residents had established their own local government and cleared a profit of 160 000 in cotton sales.
a third and far larger test case for emancipation policy began in louisiana and was eventually extended up the mississippi valley affecting some 700 000 former slaves.
soon after union forces seized new orleans in april 1862 army officers established a policy to guide the transition from slavery to emancipation.
as in the sea islands the policy reflected the racist belief among northern whites that african americans could not responsibly handle their freedom and therefore needed strict rules of conduct and work.
blacks were required to remain on their plantations working as wage laborers bound by one year contracts.
those wishing to travel even for short distances required a pass from the plantation owner.
runaways and resisters as depicted in this 1864 drawing 14 2 would be forcibly returned to their plantations.
offsetting these harsh provisions was a ban on corporal punishment for plantation labor.
freedmen bitterly opposed the new system arguing that it rendered them nearly 14 2 freedmen forcibly returned to their plantations violators of the reconstruction plan were deemed vagrants and forcibly returned to their plantations.
why did union officials define freedom for former slaves so narrowly in louisiana.
chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 powerless under the authority of their former masters.
in new orleans home to the souths largest free black population before the war african americans began to demand equal rights for all freedmen including the right to vote and hold office.
although their efforts failed they sparked a national debate over freedmens rights that would dominate reconstruction.
the experiences in the sea islands davis bend louisiana and elsewhere during the war created conflicting visions regarding the rights of freedmen land redistribution and the authority of exslave owners.
yet emancipation also revealed the optimism of the freedmen and their commitment to defend their newly won freedom and make the most of it.
lincolns ten percent plan even as the civil war raged president lincoln had begun to formulate an official reconstruction policy.
in keeping with his moderate political views before the war lincoln proposed a moderate reconstruction policy.
as he suggested so eloquently in his second inaugural address he intended to deal with the defeated south with malice toward none and charity for all to achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves he believed that extending lenient terms to the south would convince confederates to surrender sooner and speed the healing process necessary for the good of the union.
vengeance he held would only delay reconstruction.
it might even inspire defeated confederate soldiers to form renegade bands of insurgents to wage a war of terrorism for years to come.
a more studied outrage on the legislative authority of the people has never been perpetuated wade davis manifesto denouncing lincolns veto of the wade davis bill in december 1863 lincoln issued his proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction also known as the ten percent plan.
intended to establish southern state governments the plan pardoned all southerners except high ranking military officers and confederate officials who what advantages did lincoln see in a moderate reconstruction policy.
took an oath pledging loyalty to the union and support for emancipation.
as soon as 10 percent of a states voters took this oath they could call a convention establish a new state government and apply for federal recognition.
radical republicans offer a different vision lincolns lenient plan enraged many radical republicans.
in july 1864 radical republican leaders senator benjamin wade of ohio and congressman henry w davis of maryland cosponsored the wade davis bill a reconstruction program designed to punish confederate leaders and destroy the souths slave society.
southerners could reestablish new state governments only after a majority of a states voters signed an ironclad oath declaring they never aided the confederate army or government.
southerners who served as high ranking army officers or government officials would be stripped of their citizenship including the right to vote and hold office.
the former confederate states would be readmitted only after a long period of punishment and a clear demonstration of their commitment to the union emancipation and freedmens rights.
lincoln quietly pocket vetoed the bill.
furious radicals sought to replace him as the republican party presidential nominee in 1864.
although the effort failed it exposed the deeply divided opinions regarding reconstruction.
lincoln and his fellow republicans did manage to find common ground on two issues.
in late january 1865 at the urging of lincolns administration congress passed the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery.
the measure ended any ambiguity over the emancipation proclamation abolishing slavery everywhere in the united states and offering no compensation to former slaveholders.
by years end 27 states including eight former confederate states would ratify the amendment.
in march 1865 congress established the bureau of refugees freedmen and abandoned lands.
known simply as the freedmens bureau it became an all purpose relief agency in the war ravaged south distributing food providing emergency services building schools and managing confiscated lands.
it represented the first attempt by the federal government to provide social welfare services and quickly became the bedrock institution for implementing reconstruction policy.
read the document carl schurz report on the condition of the south 1865 the fruits of freedom the fruits of freedom many southerners were stunned by the response of their slaves to freedom.
clinging to self serving paternalistic notions of the plantation as one big family under the benign authority of the master and planter they were taken aback when their slaves refused to obey their orders or exhibited anger or disrespect toward them.
susan bradford a young woman living on a florida plantation wrote in her diary that she was hurt and dazed when one of her former slaves refused to prepare a dinner for her mother.
tell her if she want any dinner sneered the free woman she kin cook it herself i believed that these people were content happy and attached to their masters wrote one south carolina planter in 1865 unable to comprehend why slaves abandoned their masters in their moment of need it would be the first of many such shocking experiences for whites who never imagined that slavery might one day be abolished.
freedom of movement even before the guns of the civil war went silent african americans had begun to explore the meaning of their freedom and formulate their own vision of a reconstructed postwar south both of which included unrestricted mobility.
under slavery movement was sharply limited and few slaves ventured far from their plantations.
in the chaos of war however and later with official emancipation african americans hit the road.
many did so to escape the plantations that were home to their former masters and countless bitter memories.
others simply reveled in free and unfettered movement.
they wandered for the pleasure of it with no particular destination in mind.
as these advertisements 14 3 from the colored tennessean tennessees only african american owned newspaper indicate many freedmen also journeyed in search of loved ones sold away years before.
african american mobility led to a sharp rise in the black population of southern cities.
in contrast to rural life black settlements in cities offered more varied job opportunities albeit nearly always menial difficult and low paid.
urban life also provided freedmen access to strong black institutions such as churches charities and newspapers.
southern whites reacted to black mobility with both alarm and disdain.
just as former slaves equated freedom with mobility their former masters saw in it a shocking reminder that the old order was gone.
as a consequence in one of the first expressions of resistance to black freedom white southerners passed vagrancy laws intended to restrict african american mobility.
read the document james c beecher report on land reform 1865 1866 forty acres and a mule many freedmen also tried to become landowners.
if travel was a symbolic expression of their new freedom land was freedom in concrete form.
land the freedmen believed would give their freedom meaning by providing an independent living free of planter control.
the idea that freedmen would receive land in addition to their freedom originated during the war.
as southerners abandoned their plantations before the advancing union army ex slaves often took control partitioned land and planted crops.
freedmen defended these extralegal actions as simple justice citing the generations of unpaid labor that they and their ancestors had performed on farms and plantations.
the property which they former slaveholders hold asserted a group of freedmen was nearly all earned by the sweat of our brows 14 3 freedmen searching for loved ones sold away during slavery these classified advertisements in the august 12 1865 colored tennessean were just two of thousands published in mainly black owned newspapers during reconstruction.
they vividly highlight the efforts of freed men to overcome one of slaverys harshest legacies.

chapter 14 14 4 the misses cookes school room freedmans bureau 1866 the cooke sisters moved from the north to richmond virginia to run one of hundreds of freedmens bureau schools established across the south.
now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 1865 special field order no.
it announced that 400 000 acres of abandoned land from northern florida to the south carolina sea islands would be distributed to freedman in 40 acre plots.
weeks later congress established the freedmens bureau authorizing it to rent to freedmen 40 acre plots of confiscated and abandoned land along with a mule.
by june some 40 000 freedmen lived on land distributed by sherman while thousands more rented plots under control of the freedmens bureau.
whether they owned land or worked as farm laborers for wages african americans used their freedom to change the way they worked.
they often refused to work in gangs under overseers because it reminded them of slavery.
instead they preferred working independently under the direction of elder family members.
many african american women left the field to work in their homes and care for children.
african americans and radical republicans wanted land redistribution programs popularly known as forty acres and a mule enacted across the south.
before long however their optimism would give way to bitter disappointment as nearly all the land was returned to its original white owners.
uplift through education along with land freedmen sought education as an essential element of their freedom.
laws prohibiting the education of slaves had left most freedmen illiterate.
but if they learned to read and write they could conduct their own legal and business affairs acquire better paying jobs read newspapers and participate more fully in politics.
general o o howard the first head of the freedmens bureau also viewed education as an essential goal of reconstruction.
working with charitable societies and african american leaders the freedmens bureau helped build 3 000 schools across the south that by 1870 served 150 000 students of all ages.
by 1875 literacy among freedmen jumped from 10 percent to 30 percent and 52 percent by 1900.
in the early years of reconstruction educated single white women from the north like the cooke sisters 14 4 made up the majority of the teachers in these schools.
often sponsored by northern charitable societies they saw themselves as missionaries dedicated to the uplift of the freedmen.
the journal that published this image in 1866 frank leslies illustrated weekly shared this vision.
note how the artist depicted the children in spotless attire with all of them focused on their studies.
that the vision of these teachers and their sponsors went beyond merely teaching ex slaves to read is shown in this image 14 5 of a brief biography of african american poet phillis wheatley.
published in 1866 by a boston christian organization it demonstrates an effort to inspire ex slaves quest for education and independence by instilling pride in african american achievement.
educating freedmen however proved no easy job.
southern whites often put up fierce resistance 14 5 education and inspiration some northern charitable societies like the boston tract society published and distributed books to both teach reading and inspire african americans.
why did education become such a priority for african americans.
watch the video video lectures the schools that the civil war and reconstruction created the fruits of freedom to african american education especially in more remote areas.
one report in 1865 described the hardships teachers faced compelled to live on the coarsest diet subjected to the jeers and hatred of her neighbors swamped in mud the school shed a drip and her quarters little better raided occasionally by rebels her school broken up and herself insulted banished or run off the freedmens bureau and northern aid societies also established more than a dozen black colleges including howard in washington d c and hampton in virginia.
one of their most immediate goals was to train black teachers.
by 1870 african american teachers outnumbered white teachers in freedmens schools.
many freedmen teachers became community leaders and ran for political office.
at least 70 former teachers won seats in southern state legislatures during reconstruction.
the black church the vast network of black churches established during reconstruction provided an even greater source of community leadership.
black churches had existed in the south before the civil war but most were part of larger white congregations and subject to strict white control.
southern whites usually insisted that white ministers lead black congregations to ensure that preaching never challenged slavery and white domination.
when the war ended countless african american congregations of methodists baptists presbyterians and other sects separated from white ones.
they resented their inferior status in white controlled churches and longed to practice a more emotional expressive worship style disdained by whites.
most important they wanted black clergymen who could address their spiritual and social needs.
often churches assumed a central place in the lives of freedmen.
religious services provided spiritual and psychological support for blacks daily struggles.
churches also ran schools and provided charitable services to the community.
as this illustration 14 6 of a freedmen community at trent river north carolina demonstrates african americans built a church in the center that doubled as a schoolhouse and meeting place.
churches also offered african americans a degree of self government electing members to serve as trustees and on committees overseeing parish life and budget management.
african american women in particular filled numerous roles planning events raising money and running programs such as temperance societies.
like their white counterparts african american churches also sponsored countless initiatives such as burial societies fraternal organizations and youth groups.
with the church taking so prominent a place in african american life black ministers like black teachers assumed major leadership roles.
white hostility convinced most ministers to concentrate on building up their communities from within.
still many ministers entered politics to advance the cause of black equality including more than 100 elected to southern state legislatures during reconstruction.
reverend richard h cain for example went to charleston south carolina in 1865 where he assisted at a black church.
two years later he served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention followed by terms in the state senate and u s house of representatives.
african americans response to emancipation showed that they understood freedom as more than simply an end to slavery.
freedom included the right to free movement and travel to labor for themselves under conditions of their own choosing on land granted to them by the government.
it meant self improvement through education and self help organizations.
it meant establishing their own institutions and building their own communities.
it also meant full civil and social equality with whites including the right to vote and hold office.
14 6 the black church anchors freedmen communities african americans organized thousands of churches across the south to address both their spiritual and social needs.
in the freedmen settlement of trent river north carolina a simple structure served as a church school and meetinghouse from harpers weekly june 9 1866.
how did the black church become such a vital institution in freedmen communities.
chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 the struggle to define reconstruction as freedmen in the south worked to define protect and extend their freedoms political leaders in washington d c debated how to reconstruct the south.
the debate revealed sharply divergent visions of the postwar souths social political and economic order.
radical republicans wanted to replace the old slavocracy with an interracial democracy protected by federal authority.
conservatives sought to limit reconstruction to granting ex slaves freedom and opposed proposals to distribute land and grant full equality to ex slaves.
moderates held the balance of power in deciding most of these questions but they lacked a clear vision of the postwar south and made their decisions in response to events as they unfolded.

johnsons actions outraged northern republicans including moderates.
this political cartoon 14 7 shows johnson accepting bags of cash from a former confederate depicted as the devil in exchange for a pardon while a pardoned reconstruction rebel in the lower left kills union men and freedmen three developments in the supposedly reconstructed south stoked republican discontent.
first many of the state constitutional conventions had failed explicitly to ratify the thirteenth amendment some even demanded financial compensation for the loss of their slaves.
second and even more galling in the state elections in november 1865 southern voters elected dozens of ex confederate officials and army officers.
among them was alexander stephens former vice president of the confederacy chosen to represent georgia in the senate.
third new southern state governments beginning in late 1865 with mississippi and south carolina passed laws known as black codes to limit the civil and economic rights of freedmen and create an exploitable workforce.
observing these developments less than a year after the end of the civil war many northerners wondered if the great conflict had been fought in vain.
had hundreds of thousands died to defeat the confederacy only to see its leaders quickly resume power.
had slavery been abolished only to be replaced with a similar system of unfree labor.
one of the most common black codes first established in mississippi in 1865 and then replicated across the south established the vague charge of vagrancy having no regular home or employment as a pretext for controlling freedmen.

chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 competing visions demanding rights protecting privilege in the aftermath of the civil war one question dominated the minds of americans north and south now that slavery was abolished what would be the status of the freedmen.
while newspaper editors clergymen and members of congress debated the issue white and black southerners set out to answer the question themselves.
as you read the following documents one from a convention of freedmen and the other from the state legislature of mississippi consider the starkly contrasted visions for the future of southern society.
why do the freedmen feel compelled to say they bear no ill will toward their former oppressors why do mississippi legislators define vagrancy in such vague terms.
address to the loyal citizens and congress of the united states of america proceedings of the convention of the colored people of virginia held in the city of alexandria august 2 3 4 5 1865.
we the delegates of the colored people of the state of virginia solemnly declaring that we desire to live upon the most friendly and agreeable terms with all men we feel no ill will or prejudice toward our former oppressors are willing and desire to forgive and forget the past and so shape our future conduct as shall promote our happiness and the interest of the community in which we live we must on the other hand be allowed to aver and assert that we believe that we have among the white people of this state many who are our most inveterate enemies who hate us as a class who feel no sympathy with or for us who despise us simply because we are black and more especially because we have been made free by the power of the united states government we claim then as citizens of this state the laws of the commonwealth of virginia shall give to all men equal protection that each and every man may appeal to the law for his equal rights without regard to the color of his skin and we believe this can only be done by extending the franchise which we believe to be our inalienable right as freemen and which the declaration of independence guarantees to all free citizens of this government and which is the privilege of this nation.
we claim the right of suffrage mississippi legislators in december 1865 enacted the first black codes to limit the freedoms of african americans.
defining vagrancy in such vague terms allowed white southerners to arrest freedmen at will and to curtail their freedom of movement.
these measures were quickly copied in the remaining ex confederate states.
all rogues and vagabonds idle and dissipated persons persons who neglect their calling or employment misspend what they earn or do not provide for the support of themselves or their families or dependents shall be deemed and considered vagrants and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars with all accruing costs and be imprisoned not exceeding ten days section 5 in case of any freedman free negro or mulatto shall fail for five days after the imposition of any or forfeiture upon him or her for violation of any of the provisions of this act to pay the same that it shall be and is hereby made the duty of the sheriff of the proper county to hire out said freedman free negro or mulatto to any person who will for the shortest period of service pay said fine and forfeiture and all costs colored mens convention 1869.
because we can see no other safeguard for our protection.
because we are citizens of the country and natives of this state.
because we are as well qualified to vote who shall be our rulers as many who do vote for that purpose who have no interest in us and do not know our wants.
what is significant about the freedmens use of the term citizen.
read the document address of the colored state convention to the people of the state of south carolina 1865 the struggle to define reconstruction hit the road seeking new opportunities could be arrested as a vagrant and fined.
if a freedman could not pay his fine he could be hired out for a time to a local plantation owner willing to pay his fine.
as this drawing 14 8 dramatically shows in some cases the contracts for such labor were auctioned off to local planters.
the artist intended to conjure in the minds of northerners a grim scene reminiscent of a slave auction suggesting that one of the wars chief accomplishments emancipation was being undermined.
some black codes required that the children of vagrant freedmen be forced to accept apprenticeships that bound them to an employer until age 21.
others coerced blacks to sign long term work contracts as proof of employment a practice that left them at the mercy of employers who were not required to pay them for work performed if they quit before the contract expired.
other laws restricted freedmen to renting land only in rural areas to keep them on plantations prohibited ministers from preaching without a license outlawed interracial marriages and barred blacks from serving on juries.
congressional reconstruction and the fourteenth amendment republicans in congress vowed to block johnsons rapid and lenient reconstruction program for both idealistic and practical reasons.
excepting emancipation none of the republicans goals for changing southern society had been accomplished and the former slavocracy appeared poised to resume power a result certain to revive the democratic party.
a slower process of reconstruction would allow the republican party to take root in the south especially if african americans were granted the right to vote as many radicals like congressman thaddeus stevens of pennsylvania demanded.
the confrontation began in january 1866 when congress reconvened.
republicans first refused read the document affidavit of former slave enoch braston 1866 14 8 the black codes in action unable to pay his fine for vagrancy as defined in the black codes of florida a freedman is auctioned off.

how did black codes calling for freedmen to sign labor contracts curtail their freedom.
chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 14 9 race riot in memphis white mobs unrestrained by police killed 46 blacks in memphis tennessee on may 1 2 1866.
news of the atrocities conveyed in images such as this one stoked northern opinion against johnsons lenient reconstruction policies.
to admit the senators and representatives from the former confederate states johnson had declared reconstructed.
next they established the joint committee on reconstruction a body that gathered evidence and testimony from hundreds of witnesses detailing widespread lawlessness and violence against freedmen and their white allies in the south.
to counteract southern resistance and the oppression of freedmen congress passed two bills.
the first expanded the powers of the freedmens bureau and authorized it to continue operations for two more years.
the second the civil rights act declared african americans and all persons born in the united states except native americans citizens.
it also defined the rights of all citizens regardless of race for example the right to sue and to make contracts.
taking direct aim at the black codes the law prohibited state how did the civil rights act promote equal rights for all americans regardless of race.
governments from depriving any citizen of these fundamental rights johnson infuriated at congresss rejection of his reconstruction program and determined to thwart efforts to establish racial equality vetoed both bills.
congress overrode the vetoes and the bills became law but by june 1866 republicans decided bolder action was necessary.
johnson remained opposed to freedmens rights and violence against blacks was on the rise in the south.
the worst incident 14 9 was a race riot in memphis tennessee on may 1 2 that left 46 blacks many of them union army veterans and two whites dead.
this drawing from harpers weekly a widely read publication that favored freedmens rights was intended to arouse anger in the north over southern intransigence and support for congressional action.
the civil rights act was an unprecedented piece of legislation read the document charles f johnson and t w gilbreth the memphis riot 1866 the struggle to define reconstruction but its supporters knew that it could easily be overturned by a future congress.
an amendment on the other hand became a permanent part of the constitution.
on june 13 1866 republicans passed the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.
its five main provisions radically redefined the role of the federal government as the guarantor of individual civil rights.
first it declared all persons born or naturalized in the united states as citizens a definition that necessarily included all freedmen.
second all citizens were entitled to equal protection of the laws of the states where they lived.
third states that denied adult male citizens including african americans the right to vote would have their representation in congress reduced.
fourth all highranking former confederates were prohibited from holding public office unless pardoned by act of congress.
fifth it repudiated the confederate debt thus punishing those who lent money to the confederacy and prohibited financial compensation for ex slave owners.
johnson greeted the unprecedented amendment with an unprecedented response he went on the campaign trail to urge its defeat.
hoping to make the midterm state and congressional elections in november 1866 a referendum on the amendment johnson and his allies played on white racism conjuring up images of racial equality and racial intermarriage to alarm northern whites.
republicans responded in kind portraying johnson and the democrats as traitors who waged war on the union.
republicans won a sweeping victory in november.
northern voters although still leery of racial equality rejected johnsons lenient form of reconstruction because it required too little of southerners and restored planter rule.
republicans take control emboldened by their legislative and electoral success congressional republicans moved to take complete control of reconstruction policy.
in march 1867 congress passed the first of four reconstruction acts.
they divided the south except tennessee into five military districts each governed by a military commander empowered to restore peace and protect individuals especially freedmen.
as soon as order was established the ex confederate states could begin a new stricter readmission process.
the act called for elections to select delegates to state constitutional conventions elections that permitted african american men to vote but barred southerners who had served in the confederate government and army.
the new state constitutions drawn up by these conventions had to allow universal male suffrage regardless of race.
as soon as a states voters approved the new constitution the state could hold elections to fill government offices.
finally if congress approved the states constitution and the state legislature ratified the fourteenth amendment the state would be readmitted to the union.
two years after the end of the civil war the federal government had finally adopted a clear reconstruction plan.
the delay was understandable given lincolns assassination and the lack of precedent.
yet delay granted southerners time to recover from the war and mount an effective resistance to federal intervention.
the president has no power to control or influence anybody and legislation will be carried on entirely regardless of his opinion or wishes republican senator james w grimes iowa january 1867 president johnson promptly vetoed the reconstruction acts but the republican congress passed them again over his veto.
some of the more radical republicans grew so embittered by the presidents actions and words that they attempted to remove him from office.
when johnson dismissed secretary of war edwin stanton in august 1867 republicans charged him with violating the tenure of office act a constitutionally dubious measure they had passed in march.
it required the president to seek congressional approval before removing a cabinet official.
the house voted to impeach the president charging him with 11 offenses.
the trial began in march 1868 and after two months of heated debate and accusation the senate failed by one vote to convict johnson and remove him from office.
johnson was saved by some moderate republicans who feared setting a bad precedent if a politically motivated campaign succeeded in removing a president from office.
many moderate republicans also considered johnsons likely replacement senator benjamin wade far too radical.
they also knew johnson had less than a year left in office.

chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 implementing reconstruction as congress engaged in its impeachment struggle with president johnson in 1867 1868 the reconstruction acts took effect.
a coalition of african americans poor up country whites and economically ambitious merchants many originally from the north and white planters formed the republican party in the south.
they seized the opportunity presented by the congressional reconstruction program and dominated the process of electing state governments and gaining readmission to the union.
the task would not be easy especially as their different goals conflicted with each other and with those of most white southerners who would clearly oppose politically economically and violently any attempt to establish what they called negro rule 14 10 the hated scalawag scalawags became despised figures in the popular southern mind.
here a scalawag is depicted as an opportunist seeking political power by manipulating the black vote.

and former slaves.
northerners who moved south after the war were derided as carpetbaggers by white southerners.
the term suggested they were poor opportunists who carried to the south only a cheap suitcase or carpetbag which they intended to fill with plunder garnered from southerners still reeling from the war.
in reality most were middle class often former union soldiers or merchants ministers artisans and professionals who viewed the south as a region of opportunity where they planned to settle permanently.
others came as idealistic relief workers sent by northern charitable and religious societies intent upon aiding ex slaves in their transition to freedom.
the republican party in the south also contained many white southerners.
most white southerners referred to them derisively as scalawags and considered them traitors to their region and race men eager to accrue riches and power by manipulating black voters 14 10.
most scalawags came from the less developed backcountry regions of the south especially eastern tennessee and kentucky northern alabama and georgia and western north carolina.
like carpetbaggers they believed that the republican party offered them and their region the best chance for economic betterment.
most did not however embrace on the idea of racial equality.
former slaves made up the largest about 80 percent most significant segment of the souths republican party.
empowered with the vote by the civil rights act of 1866 and reconstruction act of 1867 african americans turned out in huge numbers in late 1867 to vote in elections held to select delegates to state constitutional conventions.

the dignified scene depicts three voters who symbolically represent a spectrum of blacks that includes common laborers educated blacks who were free before the war and union army veterans.
most african american republican leaders came from the second group.
they tended to come from the north and possessed more wealth and education than the average freedman.
the three factions of the republican party carpetbaggers scalawags and freedmen formed an uneasy alliance as they came together to reestablish southern state governments.
nonetheless their combined votes in the 1867 elections for delegates to state constitutional conventions led to a sweeping republican victory.
white republicans even though they comprised only 20 percent of party membership won most of the seats.
but freedmen won 265 seats overall and a majority of seats in south carolina and louisiana.
creating reconstruction governments in the south republican delegates soon drafted new constitutions for former confederate states according to the guidelines established by the reconstruction acts.
in a few states notably virginia and texas conservatives delayed the process for more than a year.
but by the end of 1868 seven southern states had ratified new constitutions created new governments and been readmitted to the union.
these republican governments achieved remarkable results.
to begin with they represented a revolutionary advance in the status of the freedmen.
held as slaves and denied citizenship only a few years before african americans now enjoyed view the closer look first vote 14 11 casting their first votes for supporters of racial equality like the northern publication harpers weekly whose cover featured this drawing the large turnout of black voters in the 1867 elections was exhilarating.
the right to vote and hold office.
between 1869 and 1901 22 african americans would serve in congress 20 representatives and 2 senators.
more than 600 would win seats in state legislatures and to other state offices.
while embittered white southerners decried what they termed negro rule statistics show that white republicans held a far greater share of offices than blacks.
no african american was elected governor and no state legislature ever had a black majority the south carolina lower house briefly had a black majority.
what white southerners really objected to was republican rule how did african american voting affect the political situation in the south in 1867 1868.
chapter 14 14 12 linking the democrats to secession and civil war this political cartoon from a pro republican periodical sought to demonize democrats horatio seymour and francis blair by reminding voters that their democratic party was the party of southern secessionists.
now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 and what it stood for african american equality and empowerment.
republican controlled southern state governments also achieved several significant reforms.
in contrast to the tightfisted governments of the antebellum era they funded public works projects built hospitals and orphanages and founded public school systems.
they also enacted more equitable tax codes and passed laws to help indebted farmers keep their land.
opponents of republican rule denounced these initiatives and the higher taxes needed to fund them as wasteful and poorly managed.
fundamentally they objected to their social and racial implications since many of the projects were designed to aid the poor and freedmen.
but the charges of corruption mismanagement and debt lodged by the opponents of reconstruction governments were not entirely groundless.
the rapid expansion of government services and expenditures caused many states to run up large deficits.
it also created opportunities for graft and bribery which some reconstruction legislators took advantage of.
democratic opponents railed against these abuses as alleged evidence that blacks were incapable of holding office and that their white allies were interested only in plunder.
in reality the corruption in southern state governments paled in comparison to that found in the north.
new yorks tammany hall political machine for example under william boss tweed stole more than 20 million from 1869 to 1871.
moreover the spending by southern state governments on social programs looked large only compared to the paltry expenditures on education health care and public works before the war.
nonetheless charges of corruption and excessive spending coupled with increased taxes diminished support for the southern republican governments and created an unfavorable impression in the north.
we cannot vote without all sorts of threats and intimidations.
freedmen are shot with impunity report of a republican official 1868 the election of 1868 by summer 1868 there was little doubt whom the republican party would nominate for president.
general ulysses s grant enjoyed widespread popularity across the north and among southern republicans for defeating robert e lee and ending the civil war.
grant conveyed a tone of moderation in a time of partisan and sectional acrimony.
let us have peace became his campaign slogan.
democrats still weak in the aftermath of the war and the disenfranchisement of many exconfederates faced an uphill battle against grant.
note how this political cartoon 14 12 tis but a change of banners from a pro republican journal sought to link the democratic nominees for president governor horatio seymour of new york and for vice president francis blair of maryland with both secession and postwar racial violence.
but as this racist democratic campaign song makes clear 14 13 seymour ran an aggressive campaign designed to arouse fears that the republican party and black suffrage threatened the rights of white americans.
republicans his campaign claimed must be prevented from spreading the disastrous experiment in black political empowerment to the north.
running on a message of political moderation fiscal responsibility and an even handed approach why did southerners charge that reconstruction governments were corrupt.
implementing reconstruction 14 13 the politics of racism the campaign of democratic party nominees horatio seymour and francis blair appealed to white voters racism though the nominees speeches campaign literature and songs such as this one the white mans banner to reconstruction grant won 214 electoral votes to seymours 80.
the popular vote however was much closer 53 percent for grant 47 percent for seymour 14 14.
this outcome reflected three things.
first it indicated the wide appeal of seymours blatantly racist message to conservative whites in both north and south.
second it showed how vital the freedman vote was for the republican party.
grant received nearly 500 000 african american votes but won by only 300 000 votes.
third it revealed the effectiveness of violence as a weapon in electoral politics.
a reign of terror unleashed by violent whites before the election especially in georgia and louisiana kept thousands of black voters away from the polls.
on the rise many republicans argued that another amendment was necessary to guarantee unequivocally the right of african americans to vote.
womens rights activists agreed but many also argued for universal suffrage the vote for all adult citizens regardless of race or gender.
bitterly disappointed over the reference to only male citizens in the fourteenth amendment feminists such as elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony demanded that any subsequent amendment include women.
this demand was opposed by former abolitionists and radical republicans including fellow feminists like lucy stone and frances harper who argued that gaining the vote for african american men was a higher priority.
including women they argued would doom the amendment because the nation was not ready for such radical change.
the cause of womens suffrage could be taken up immediately after black suffrage was secured.
stanton and anthony rejected this reasoning leading to a twenty year split in the womens rights movement.
most republicans in congress however agreed with frederick douglasss assertion that this was the negros hour and they drafted the fifteenth amendment to read succinctly the right of citizens of the united states shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude passed by congress in late 1869 and ratified in 1870 the fifteenth amendment presented a striking contradiction.
it established a revolutionary experiment in interracial democracy something no other slave society such as those in the caribbean or 3 013 421 53 2 706 829 popular vote 47 electoral vote the fifteenth amendment after the 1868 election congressional republicans decided that black suffrage required an explicit constitutional guarantee.
black male suffrage was implied in the fourteenth amendments phrase all male citizens but with southern resistance ulysses s grant republican horatio seymour democrat 14 14 the election of 1868 votes from nearly 500 000 recently enfranchised african americans proved crucial to grants victory in the election.
ex confederate states not yet reconstructed did not participate.
why did some womens rights activists oppose ratification of the fifteenth amendment.
chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 latin america did so soon and so completely after emancipation.
yet its spare wording left wide open the possibility that states could devise clever ways to deny blacks the right to vote that did not directly invoke race color or previous condition of servitude the rise of white resistance 14 15 another victim of the klan terrorist violence by white vigilante groups soared in the early 1870s.
in this scene from moore county north carolina a freedman pleads for his life surrounded by klansmen in full regalia.
the secret white terrorist organizations that first arose in 1866 and that wrought havoc in parts of the south during the 1868 election grew bolder and more violent by 1870 1871 especially during election season.
known by various names including the white brotherhood knights of the white camelia and especially the ku klux klan they functioned in much the same manner.
as illustrated in a popular northern newspaper 14 15 klansmen often operated at night wearing hoods robes and other regalia to hide their identities and terrify their victims.
blacks and occasionally carpetbaggers and scalawags targeted for punishment were beaten and frequently killed.
some had their crops or homes burned or their mules killed.
klansmen also targeted symbols of black self improvement and independence such as black churches businesses and schools.
why did groups like the klan indulge in anti black violence.
klan terrorism served many purposes.
for the poor whites who made up the bulk of klansmen the violent suppression of african americans provided the psychological reassurance that they were not at the bottom of the social order.
for white elites who approved of and often assisted the violence it prevented a political alliance between poor whites and blacks.
it also maintained a large exploitable workforce for plantations and industry by keeping african americans powerless and poor.
klan violence also discouraged african american voting and thus threatened the republican party in the south.
in response to surging violence in the south republicans in congress with strong support from the grant administration passed several enforcement acts in 1870 and 1871 outlawing armed combinations that deprived anyone of their civil or political rights.
the justice department vigorously enforced these laws across the south arresting and prosecuting thousands and weakening significantly the klan and similar organizations by 1872.
although the enforcement acts demonstrated that federal authority could effectively protect the rights of freedmen they also revealed the vulnerability of freedmen should the federal commitment to reconstruction ever wane.
read the document hannah irwin describes ku klux klan ride late 1860s reconstruction abandoned reconstruction abandoned by the end of grants first term in office in 1873 supporters of reconstruction and freedmens rights could look with satisfaction at the many extraordinary changes that had taken place in the south.
yet ominous signs suggested reconstruction was in trouble.
despite the crackdown on the klan white southerners increasingly demonstrated their commitment to seizing power and imposing a new form of servitude on african americans.
northerners by contrast seemed less and less willing to support a vigorous reconstruction policy.
slowly from 1872 to 1877 the extraordinary experiment in interracial democracy and progressive government in the south was dismantled in favor of oligarchy and white supremacy.
corruption and scandal a major factor in the pullback from reconstruction was a series of corruption scandals that plagued the grant administration.
grant himself was honest but also politically naive and given to a hands off style of leadership that gave officials in his administration unusual independence.
many of them took advantage of grants trust to enrich themselves through illegal schemes.
for example in the 1869 black friday scandal wall street titans jay gould and jim fisk conspired with grants brother in law to corner the gold market.
the plan failed but not before hundreds of innocent investors were ruined.
in the credit mobilier scandal grants vice president and several high ranking members of congress took bribes from the company involved in the completion of the government subsidized union pacific railroad.
in the so called whiskey ring scandal treasury secretary orville e babcock made a fortune by illegally allowing whiskey distillers to avoid paying excise taxes.
in yet another scandal secretary of war william w belknap accepted bribes from companies engaged in corrupt activities on indian reservations.
with so much negative publicity stirred up by corruption scandals grants administration took steps to minimize political controversies.
to secure his reelection and keep the republican party in power grant adopted a more conservative approach to reconstruction by now a frequent source of rancor in washington.
in summer 1872 for example grant lobbied congress for and then signed into law the amnesty act granting a general pardon to all but a few hundred former confederate leaders.
now eligible to vote and hold office these planters and ex confederate army officers and officials wasted little time in reasserting their authority.
republican disunity the retreat from reconstruction in the 1870s was also hastened by growing dissention within the republican party.
many republicans including some former radicals began to question the wisdom of maintaining a strong federal role in the affairs of southern states.
some argued the fundamental goals of reconstruction citizenship civil rights and suffrage for the freedmen had been accomplished.
there was they believed a constitutional and moral limit to what the federal government could do for the freedmen.
now was the time for freedmen to use their new rights to elevate themselves economically socially and politically.
other republicans argued for an end to reconstruction for less idealistic reasons.
even though some of them had been abolitionists before the war and advocates of freedmens rights in the first years that followed they now considered reconstruction a failure.
these liberal republicans as they came to be called had grown tired of the political strife produced by debates over freedmens rights.

scandals and economic turmoil soon undermined his popularity and power.
now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 they also worried about the growing power of the 2 834 761 federal government.

blacks he wrote in 1870 were a worthless race who would rather accept charity than help themselves.
their reconstruction governments were based on ignorance and degradation a similar transformation from a progressive to a reactionary view of reconstruction was revealed in the political cartoons of thomas nast see images as history political cartoons reflect the shift in public opinion.
the election of 1872 the dissatisfaction of liberal republicans reached full bloom in summer 1872.
disturbed by the prospect of grant being renominated for a second term they broke with the republican party and held their own convention in cincinnati where they nominated greeley for president.
a divided democratic party also endorsed greeley.
but the election of 1872 proved disastrous for greeley and his backers.
the public viewed greeley as an eccentric who during his long career in public life had supported many fringe causes such as vegetarianism spiritualism and utopianism.
greeleys call for an end to reconstruction and reconciliation between north and south also repelled many northern voters who still associated southerners and the democratic party with secession and civil war.
in grants sweeping victory over greeley 14 16 republicans had good reason to cheer.
the democrats and liberal republicans call for ending reconstruction and returning the south to white rule had been rejected.
moreover the grant administrations crackdown on the klan had allowed african americans unprecedented freedom to vote.
still northerners and republicans in congress were not prepared to support federal intervention in the south indefinitely.
as new pressing issues emerged after 1872 support for reconstruction rapidly eroded.
hard times the american economy had boomed after the civil war.
hundreds of thousands of new businesses were established.
these included massive factories that employed hundreds in some cases thousands of workers.
aiding this economic growth was the dramatic expansion of the railroad and telegraph systems and increased availability of capital through banks and stock sales.
the booming economy encouraged businesses to expand and investors to take bigger risks.
when these trends reached a critical point in late1873 a panic on wall street ensued.
some of the nations most prominent financial houses and banks went bankrupt.
as credit became scarce businesses began to fail.
hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs.
by early 1874 the nations economy had plunged into a deep depression that lasted until 1877.
the panic of 1873 directly affected reconstruction.
as hard times set in the fate of the freedmen became less of a concern to northerners.
economic issues like currency reform and the tariff took precedence over civil rights and white vigilante violence against freedmen.
the public declared one republican is tired of hearing about southern violence against the freedmen hard times and heavy taxes make them wish the everlasting nigger were in hell or africa the public expressed its discontent in the congressional elections of 1874 by voting in a democratic majority in the house for the first time since the war.
the return of terrorism reconstruction was also undone by a resumption of violence waged by white terrorist groups like the klan.
as the grant administration bowed to political pressure to reduce federal intervention in southern affairs advocates of white supremacy seized the opportunity.
in one notorious incident in 1873 a large band of heavily armed whites overran why did liberal republicans lose faith in reconstruction by the early 1870s.
reconstruction abandoned images as history political cartoons reflect the shift in public opinion one of the nations most skilled and popular political cartoonists in the reconstruction era was thomas nast.
an immigrant from germany he landed a job in 1861 at harpers weekly the nations leading journal of politics and society.
nasts artistic talent combined with harpers vast circulation soon turned him into one of the most influential illustrators of his day.
as a staunch republican and unionist his drawings during the civil war were as intensely patriotic and prolincoln as they were anti confederate.
after the war nasts widely distributed cartoons continued to shape northern opinion about reconstruction and freedmens rights.
cartoons like and not this man.

in this is a white mans government september 5 1868 he stressed the violent intent of white southerners to reclaim power and the necessity of federal authority in carrying out the goals of reconstruction.
nevertheless nasts cartoons eventually reflected the growing disillusionment of northern republicans regarding reconstruction.
while he rejected the liberal republican call to end reconstruction nast nonetheless expressed the fear that african americans were incapable of responsible government.

here a freedman is threatened with death unless he votes for the democratic party.
now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 colfax louisiana and slaughtered over 100 african americans.
just as in the late 1860s white vigilante violence had two goals to strip away the freedmens hardwon rights and prevent them from voting and holding office.
this effort peaked in mississippi in 1875 when armed groups of whites closely allied with the democratic party waged a campaign of terror that came to be known as the mississippi plan.
through threats beatings and killings they delivered an unambiguous message blacks and their white allies who dared vote republican risked their lives.
but the grant administration rejected governor adelbert amess request to send troops to keep the peace and protect the polls.
not surprisingly more than 60 000 mississippi voters nearly all black and republican stayed away from the polls on election day.
democrats swept to victory and took control of the state legislature for the first time since the civil war.
immediately they threatened governor ames with impeachment and forced him to resign.
the success of the mississippi plan in intimidating black voters and demolishing the republican party is indicated in this 1876 image of course he wants to vote the democratic ticket 14 17.
the artist shows the ruthless character of the white supremacy movement and the vulnerability of freedmen left without federal protection.
other southern states soon employed their own version of the mississippi plan.
one by one the remaining reconstruction governments what was the political impact of the resurgence of white vigilante violence.
fell to a new class of political leaders known as redeemers.
as the name suggests they cast themselves in almost biblical terms as saviors of southern society.
by 1876 only south carolina louisiana and florida remained under republican control largely because of the presence of federal troops.
the removal of these troops in 1877 opened the way for the complete redemption of the former confederacy and the restoration of white supremacy.
defenders of reconstruction and the rights of freedmen in congress were appalled at the rising tide of redeemer oppression.
in response they managed one final measure to bolster the rights of freedmen the civil rights act of 1875.
it required that state governments provide equal access in public facilities such as schools and allow african americans to serve on juries.
the law was largely ignored and in 1883 the supreme court ruled it unconstitutional.
the end of reconstruction the final blow to reconstruction occurred as the result of the presidential election of 1876.
with the democratic party reinvigorated by gaining a majority in the house in 1874 and control of most southern state governments by 1876 a close election was expected.
the democrats nominated samuel j tilden governor of new york and a well known reformer.
republicans nominated ohio governor and civil war veteran rutherford b hayes.
the issues centered on political corruption the failed economy and of course reconstruction.
on election day tilden received 250 000 more popular votes than hayes 14 18.
but the electoral vote which actually determines the victor was unclear.
voting irregularities in south carolina louisiana and florida left both sides claiming victory and the 19 electoral votes at stake in those states one electoral vote was also in dispute in oregon.
tilden needed to be declared the winner in only one of these four states to win a majority of electoral votes and thus the presidency.
hayes needed to win all three southern states plus the oregon vote to put him one electoral vote ahead of tilden and into the white house.
both sides refused to budge and a constitutional crisis loomed.
eventually they agreed read the document blanche k bruce speech in the senate 1876 reconstruction abandoned 4 284 020 4 036 572 popular vote 51 47 9 electoral vote rutherford b hayes republican samuel j tilden democrat to abide by the decision of a bipartisan commission.
the commission authorized an investigation and heard testimony.
behind the scenes members of congress and party leaders conducted intense negotiations.
on 14 18 the election of 1876 in one of the most controversial presidential elections in u s history samuel b tilden won the popular vote 4 284 020 to 4 036 572 but lost the electoral vote to rutherford b hayes 185 to 184.
march 2 1877 the commission issued its decision known as the compromise of 1877.
by a vote of eight to seven the 15 member commission awarded all 20 disputed electoral votes to hayes giving him a 185 to 184 electoral vote victory over tilden.
democrats denounced the stolen election yet the result proved beneficial to the party.
hayess presidency was weakened by the aura of illegitimacy detractors referred to him as his fraudulency.
more important as part of a behindthe scenes deal he oversaw the final steps in the dismantling of reconstruction.
by the end of 1877 the last federal troops were removed from the south and as the map 14 19 indicates the last reconstruction governments fell to democratic redeemers.
14 19 the readmission of southern states and return of white rule most former confederate states were readmitted to the union under the direction of republicancontrolled state governments.
but as the dates in parentheses indicate in most cases conservative white democratic governments soon seized control.

chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 the new south the optimism with which white southerners greeted the end of reconstruction gave rise to the term new south.
it reflected the souths development of a new system of race relations based on segregation and white supremacy.
even more so the new south pointed to a profound economic transformation that swept across the region bringing with it a boom in manufacturing railroad construction and urbanization.
redeemer rule the lost cause the redeemer governments that took control of southern states by 1877 represented a new ruling oligarchy.
before the war a small and powerful class of planters dominated southern politics.
now in the aftermath of reconstruction a new elite took control.
although some were planters and former planters most were men who drew their wealth and power from a new southern economy based on industry finance commerce and railroad construction.
as men of business their politics reflected the dominant conservative economic theory of the era which argued that the best form of government was small frugal and pro business.
accordingly redeemer governments slashed taxes and spending on social programs and public education created during reconstruction.
redeemer politics also championed a return to white supremacy.
the return of one party democratic rule in most southern states resulted in a steady decline in office holding by african americans and republicans.
intimidation and violence also led to a marked decrease in black voting across the south.
despite these setbacks however african americans in many southern states managed to vote and hold office in appreciable numbers into the 1880s and 1890s.
redeemer rule did not go unchallenged.
in several states anger among poor farmers coalesced into full fledged political challenges to oligarchic rule inequitable taxation and cuts to social programs.
these insurgents denounced the new elite as bourbons the name of the former french royal family a derogatory term that implied aristocratic ambitions.
in virginia for example a coalition of republicans and disaffected democrats called readjusters turned out the redeemer government in 1879.
all of these challenges to redeemer rule however ultimately failed.
southerners after 1877 embraced not only redeemer rule but also an image of the prewar south as an ideal society and the confederate bid for independence a valiant lost cause.
southerners clung to this image because it provided them with a psychologically soothing explanation for why they lost the war.
according to the lost cause idea confederate society was more virtuous than the north and its soldiers braver but the south lost because the yankees possessed overwhelming advantages in population industry arms and ruthlessness.
defeat while bitter and painful was also a glorious martyrdom for a people and a way of life.
southerners expressed this interpretation of the war as a glorious yet ill fated campaign in poems plays songs speeches sermons and books.
one of the most popular lost cause poets was rev.
abram ryan a catholic priest from norfolk virginia.
many of his poems such as the conquered banner became required recitations among white southern schoolchildren for decades.
these works by ryan and others stressed courage glory duty sacrifice and the need for true southerners to honor their confederate heroes forever.
as ryan put it in one of his poems what groups constituted the political leadership of the new south.
but their memories eer shall remain for us and their names bright names without stain for us the glory they won shall not wane for us in legend and lay our heroes in gray shall forever live over again for us.
the lost cause carried with it an obligation to keep alive the memory of confederate glory.
southerners built elegant battlefield cemeteries to inter the war dead and monuments to celebrate confederate victories.
white southern women many widowed by the war played a major role in these efforts read the document r b buckley confederate song im a good old rebel 1866 the new south founding organizations such as the ladies memorial association 1867 and the united daughters of the confederacy 1894.
southerners also erected thousands of statues honoring confederate soldiers including legends like generals robert e lee stonewall jackson and nathan bedford forrest.
the photograph 14 20 demonstrates how enthusiasm for the lost cause only grew the further the civil war receded into history.
lee had discouraged efforts to raise monuments to the confederate cause but soon after he died in 1870 they sprang up across the south including this monumental rendering unveiled in richmond in 1890.
thousands turned out for the dedication of the heroic statue by french sculptor antonin mercie and to hear colonel archer anderson laud lee for his courage will energy fortitude hopefulness joy in battle and unconquerable soul nothing that day certainly not the speeches or lees triumphant pose recalled the fact that lee had lost the war.
but the lost cause legend served a second purpose beyond helping southerners cope with their defeat in the war.
it celebrated a nostalgic vision of the prewar south that supported their arguments for a resumption of white rule and african american subservience.
through literature art and music southerners and some northerners fashioned romantic depictions of the old south as a harmonious paradise where benevolent masters treated loyal contented slaves with kindness where chivalrous southern gentlemen protected delicate charming women and where everyone revered tradition family and the bible.
yet even as they glorified slavery the proponents of the lost cause downplayed its importance as a cause of secession.
the real issue they insisted was states rights and attempts by northerners to run roughshod over them in the 1850s.
the lost cause thus presented southerners as victims of misguided and unjustified yankee aggression who in the wake of devastating war and humiliating reconstruction ought to be left alone to run their own affairs.
the overt racism and self serving depictions of slavery in lost cause rhetoric and imagery served to justify a resumption of white rule and the return of african americans to the status of powerless exploitable laborers.
the new south economy even as southerners revered the lost cause and old south their new leadership steered the regions economy into an industrial future.
in the 1870s and 1880s they joined with northern entrepreneurs who settled in the south during reconstruction to develop a modern market oriented and diversified economy.
this effort entailed not simply the establishment of banks textile mills and railroads but also the celebration and spreading of capitalist values such as hard work risk taking thrift and the profit motive.
view the image cotton plantation united states of america 14 20 celebrating the lost cause as the commemorative ribbon indicates this monument to robert e lee was erected in the former confederate capital of richmond virginia in 1890.
it was one of thousands of monuments to the confederacy erected across the south.
how was the lost cause a useful myth for southerners.
chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 14 21 celebrating the new south the atlanta exposition of 1895 offered a great opportunity for boosters of the new south to showcase the regions newly diversified economy.
the leading figure in this movement to establish a new south economy was henry grady editor of the atlanta constitution.
beginning in the mid1870s in editorials and speeches he proclaimed industrialization as the solution to the souths devastated postwar economy.
his message inspired many southerners especially those who had never been part of the planter elite to start businesses invest and support pro business policies.
grady also convinced many northerners to invest in new south enterprises.
the vast expansion of manufacturing represented the most stunning change in the new south.
drawn by low taxes cheap labor ample water power proximity to cotton supplies and the absence of unions textile manufacturers moved their operations from new england to the south what weaknesses limited the success of the new south economy.
especially the carolinas.
by 1900 the south had become the nations leading producer of textiles.
a similar transformation occurred in the tobacco industry as the south went from merely producing raw tobacco to become the nations leading producer of finished tobacco products like cigarettes.
another significant aspect of the new south economy was the lumber and furniture industry.
new south entrepreneurs took advantage of the regions tremendous forest reserves and new technologies such as rotary saws and dry kilns and an expanded railroad system and soon made the south the leading producer of lumber.
in mississippi alone the number of lumber mills jumped from 295 in 1880 to 608 in 1899.
the furniture industry likewise boomed in the new south especially in places like high point north carolina where a single factory opened in 1889 followed by 30 more over the next decade.
industry also flourished in the lower south.
birmingham alabama had only a few hundred residents when founded in 1871 but its position at the junction of two major railroads and nearby deposits of coal iron and limestone soon attracted iron and steel factories and the nickname pittsburgh of the south by 1890 the south produced 20 percent of u s iron and steel.
as this promotional poster 14 21 makes clear the booming and increasingly diverse economy of the new south was the central theme of the 1895 atlanta exposition.
here liberty carries in her left arm a cornucopia filled with symbols of traditional southern products like cotton and sugar but also steel and iron.
note the imagery at the bottom that suggests the civil war and all its destruction and lingering controversies is long gone.
as in the north the expansion of industry in the south relied on the existence of a large pool of cheap labor.
but unlike the north where millions of immigrants made up much of the workforce the south relied on a rising population of poor white farming families pushed off the land by indebtedness falling crop prices and crop failure.
in the rare the growth of the iron interests of the south during the last few years has been the marvel of the age attracting the attention of the entire business world new south booster m b hillyard 1887 the new south instances where african americans secured industrial employment it was usually in the most menial dangerous and poorly paid jobs.
southern workers earned wages 50 percent lower than their northern counterparts revealing the limited success of the new south economy in overcoming the regions poverty and social problems.
despite decades of impressive growth in industry mining and railroads the south in 1900 lagged far behind the north in virtually every category of economic and social progress.
most southern industry for example was small scale and focused on lowskilled labor including growing numbers of child laborers.
per capita incomes in the south remained stagnant from 1880 to 1900.
other indications of backwardness and underdevelopment abounded.
the infant mortality rate far exceeded the national average.
and because redeemer governments had slashed per pupil spending in public education to half the average in the north the south led the nation in illiteracy its high school graduation rate was one third that in the midwest.
the rise of sharecropping the limitations of the new south economy was most vividly revealed in the preponderance of southerners engaged in agriculture.
the regions economy remained fundamentally tied to the production of cash crops particularly tobacco sugar rice and of course cotton.
only 6 percent of the southern workforce in 1900 was employed in manufacturing.
the condition of southern farmers both white and black deteriorated sharply between 1875 and 1900.
while cotton production soared the price plummeted from 18 cents per pound in the early 1870s to 5 cents per pound in 1894.
shrinking profits forced many southern farmers to forfeit title to their land and became tenant farmers.
some 14 22 poverty and independence sharecropping condemned most african americans to poverty but it also helped to free them of immediate white control.
no longer confined to slave cabins they also worked on their own free of white oversight and coercion.
rented land for a set fee which left them free to grow whatever crops they desired.
but most tenant farmers resorted to the sharecropping system whereby they received the right to farm a plot of land in exchange for rent paid in the form of a share generally one third to one half of the harvest.
by 1900 more than 70 percent of the souths farmers white and black earned their living in this manner.
sharecropping granted african americans a measure of independence.
white landlords generally allowed their tenants to control their own time and to set their own work routines.
the people in this photograph 14 22 are poor and live in a ramshackle house but like most sharecroppers they work as families free of direct white supervision.
freedmen cherished this independence given their experience in slavery of gang labor under the brutal control of overseers.
and yet as a closer look at this image shows a well dressed white man is in the background probably the landlord who arranged for the photograph to be taken.
sharecroppers were not slaves but as this photograph makes clear they lived under the control of their white landlords.
read the document james t rapier testimony before u s senate regarding the agricultural labor force in the south 1880 how did sharecropping provide limited independence to freedmen.

the directors of the aforementioned north carolina mutual and provident insurance company for example used their financial resources to support schools and establish a hospital bank and library to serve the black community of durham.
as heroes of the colored race 14 24 suggests middle class blacks also cultivated pride in the accomplishments of african americans after emancipation.
this lithograph was published in 1881 for sale to african americans.
note its emphasis on education and the role of african americans in the civil war and later as members of congress.
but in the late 1870s and early 1880s southern political leaders began to create a social and legal system of segregation and disenfranchisement that came to be called jim crow named for a derogatory black character in a popular minstrel show.
they understood that as long as some african americans possessed civil economic and political rights especially the right to vote white supremacy was called into question.
redeemer politicians also recognized that stoking racial animosity protected their privileged status as a ruling elite by deflecting the frustration and anger of poor southern whites away from them and onto african americans.
the jim crow system consisted of three main elements segregation disenfranchisement and violence.
the goal of segregation was to foment racial divisions by separating african americans from as many aspects of everyday life as possible.
initial efforts focused on barring african americans from hotels restaurants and railroad cars.
blacks denounced these violations of their constitutional rights especially the fourteenth amendment and challenged them in court.
but a conservative supreme court sharply restricted the authority of the fourteenth amendment and its guarantee of equal protection.
in hall v decuir 1878 for example the court hear the audio the black laws by bishop b w.
arnett pamphlet excerpt declared unconstitutional a louisiana law prohibiting racial discrimination on steamboats because the vessel was engaged in interstate commerce running routes between louisiana and mississippi which only congress could regulate.
five years later in the civil rights cases the court declared the 1875 civil rights act unconstitutional asserting that the fourteenth amendment did not empower congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals and organizations.
the ruling cleared the way for private individuals such as hotel owners and institutions such as mens clubs to bar african americans but left standing the right of congress to prohibit discrimination by state government institutions.
as explained in choices and consequences sanctioning separation page 434 this issue came before the court in an 1896 case plessy v ferguson.
hand in hand with segregation came the effort to eradicate black political power by circumventing the fifteenth amendment.
violence and intimidation in the 1870s had reduced black voting and office holding significantly but not completely.
in mississippi for example black voter turnout averaged 39 percent in the 1880s.
but rising fears over the voting power of both blacks and disgruntled poor whites led redeemer 14 24 heroes of the colored race african americans kept alive their hopes for a better future by cultivating an appreciation for their history.
what role did the black middle class play in the jim crow south.
chapter 14 now that we are free reconstruction and the new south 1863 1890 choices and consequences sanctioning separation in 1890 louisiana required separate cars for black and white passengers on all railroads in the state.
to challenge the law an african american carpenter named homer a plessy bought a first class ticket on the east louisiana railroad and sat in the whites only first class car.
as expected he was arrested.
plessy argued before a local judge named john h ferguson that the law violated the thirteenth amendments prohibition of slavery and the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause.
ferguson ruled in favor of the railroad stating that separation did not violate plessys rights a decision upheld by the states supreme court.
when plessy appealed to the u s supreme court the justices considered three major options choices refuse to hear the case and thus not render a judgment on the constitutionality of segregation letting stand the louisiana state supreme court decision.
rule in favor of plessy and declare louisianas segregation law unconstitutional.
continuing controversies how should african americans respond to the imposition of jim crow laws.
black leaders in the 1890s were divided over the best strategy to oppose segregation.
booker t washington the nations most prominent african american leader argued that efforts to overturn segregation were doomed to failure due to black americans lack of political and economic power see chapter 18.
instead he recommended blacks focus their energy and resources on selfimprovement especially in education a strategy that would one day empower them to challenge segregation.
founding member of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp w e b dubois rejected this policy and insisted that african americans keep up a sustained legal and political effort to end segregation.
ultimately it was duboiss vision and naacp attorneys that ended legalized segregation.
in brown v board of education of topeka in 1954 the supreme court overturned plessy and rejected the concept of separate but equal reject plessys appeal and uphold louisianas segregation law as constitutional.
decision on may 18 1896 the supreme court by a vote of 7 to 1 chose the third option and rejected plessys claim that the law violated his constitutional rights.
the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments argued the majority were never intended to establish full social equality of the races.
furthermore legal separation of the races a doctrine subsequently known as separate but equal was constitutional so long as states provided equal facilities.
the lone dissenting justice john marshall harlan blasted the majority opinion declaring the law a racist violation of the nations color blind constitution.
consequences in sharply limiting the fourteenth amendments equal protection provisions the court allowed state governments to establish separate schools hospitals parks theaters restaurants and public transportation across the south.
the decision also opened the way for segregation laws aimed at mexicans in the southwest and asians in california.
in practice separate but equal proved only half accurate as segregated facilities were indeed separate but never equal in terms of funding staffing and supplies.
how did the supreme court play a role in the imposition of segregation.
the new south politicians to commence a program of disenfranchisement.
given the sparse and direct language of the fifteenth amendment the proponents of disenfranchisement needed to devise laws that deprived african americans of the right to vote without making specific mention of race color or previous condition of servitude in 1889 tennessee became the first of many southern states to enact a poll tax an annual tax imposed on all adult citizens in the state.
those who failed to pay it could not vote.
as the image 14 25 of a florida poll tax receipt for 1900 shows the tax of 1 was low enough so that most white voters like henry r nicks could pay it but high enough to disenfranchise thousands of impoverished african americans.
most states also required that all unpaid poll taxes from previous years be paid off before a citizen could vote meaning that a black man who had fallen behind in his taxes for five years would need to pay 5 before entering a polling place.
in 1890 mississippi enacted a poll tax and an additional measure to facilitate disenfranchisement the literacy test.
it allowed state and local officials to bar from voting anyone who failed a literacy test.
it usually required a potential voter to read a complicated section of the state constitution and explain its meaning a provision aimed at excluding african americans given their low levels of education.
most southern states soon adopted similar tests.
in the mid 1890s southern states added a third disenfranchisement policy the so called grandfather clause.
it guaranteed the vote to anyone even if they could not pass a literacy test if their grandfather had been eligible to vote before 1867.
since no african americans could vote before 1867 they were the only ones subject to literacy tests.
hear the audio a georgia lynch law 14 25 disenfranchisement through the poll tax because h r nicks a white man in hernando county florida in 1900 could pay his poll tax of 1 he was eligible to vote.
mired in poverty many african americans could not afford the fee and lost their right to vote.
adding to the effectiveness of the segregation and disenfranchisement movements was a stepped up campaign of violence against african americans.
vigilante groups across the south composed largely of poor whites but often aided by local law officers and prominent citizens launched an unprecedented wave of beatings humiliations and murders intended to intimidate blacks and put them in their place often an unsubstantiated accusation of rape or murder brought out a communitys lynch mob but many killings were prompted by minor incidents of alleged disrespect such as arguing with a white man.
lynchings in the 1890s soared to an average of 187 per year or roughly one killing every two days.
by 1900 these disenfranchisement policies had reduced overall black voting in the south by 62 percent.
in some states black voting was effectively eliminated.
in louisiana for example the number of black voters dropped from 130 334 in 1896 to 1 342 in 1904 a reduction of 99 percent.
thousands of poor whites were also disenfranchised reducing the total white vote by 27 percent by 1900 white supremacy had triumphed.
how did the poll tax and literacy test allow southerners to circumvent the fifteenth amendment.
