the north had to invade and control the south.
to accomplish this the union army had to travel huge distances.

because of distances such as this the north had to maintain long supply lines.
in addition wilderness covered much of the south.
armies found this land difficult to cross.
also in virginia many of the rivers ran from east to west.
because of this they formed a natural defense against an army that attacked from the north to the south.

the civil war 51 history and geography ideals ot me north and the south one of the most basic disagreements that led to the civil war was whether or not individual states had the legal right to secede.
this issue was debated repeatedly.
in congress state legislatures the press and speeches by politicians the presidents of the two sides abraham lincoln of the union and jefferson davis of the confederacy used speeches to explain their governments goals.
comparing the speeches the speeches of lincoln and davis revealed the dramatic difference of opinions between the north and the south.
lincoln spoke of the importance of the union and the unbreakable bond among states belonging to the government of the united states.
davis s words displayed the view that the idea of states rights allowed the south to leave the union because the federal government no longer protected its interests.
when lincoln spoke of liberties and equality he included those of african americans.
davis did not touch upon the topics knowing how divisive the moral issue of slavery was even among southerners.
f ideas j lincoln 1 davis liberty the united states was a nation founded on the belief of liberty for everyone including african americans.
the freedom to own slaves was protected under the declaration of independence and the constitution but had been violated by recent congressional actions.
equality equality was also guaranteed to everyone by the ideals of the nation.
equality was one of the south s ideals but did not include equality among races.
union the union was an agreement of many states and all of them had to agree for it to be broken.
preserving it was his primary goal.
the union of states was based on an agreement and states could choose to leave if they wanted.
government in the form of government under the constitution the south should work for an amendment instead of seceding.
governments rest on the consent of the governed so states can secede if they disagree with government actions or policies.

515a chapter 16 primary source speech jefferson davis s inaugural address j in his inauguration speech jefferson davis gave the reasons southern leaders 5 believed they had a right to secede and he stated that they would do so peace l fully if allowed the south s right to secede is based on the american idea that governments rest on the consent of the governed and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish them at will whenever they become destructive of the ends for which they were established actuated solely by the desire to preserve our own.
rights and promote our own welfare the separation by the confederate states has been marked by no aggression upon others and followed by no domestic convulsion1.
h he claimed that the liberties guaranteed to citizens and states in the declaration of independence the u s constitution and the bill of rights had been violated by attempts to limit the spread of slavery.
he compared the constitution of the new government with that of the united states saying that they were similar.
the main difference was the clear protection of slavery in the confederate constitution.
mutual interest will invite to good will and kind offices on both parts.
if however passion or lust of dominion should cloud the judgment or inflame the ambition of those states we must prepare to meet the emergency and to maintain by the final arbitrament2 of the sword the position which we have assumed among the nations of the earth but davis also spoke of the urgent need for an army and a navy.
davis speech only mentions equality once in a list of ideals that he counts as the south s ideals.
davis did not mention equality between the races even in reference to the lack of equal rights for african americans.
he also did not directly discuss the nature of the confederate government and union.
even leaders that strongly supported the confederate cause could not answer whether or not a southern state would have the rightto secede from the confederacy if it chose to in the future.
the issue would soon become hotly debated in virginia.
residents of western virginia wanted to remain part of the union and seceded from eastern virginia only a few months after the south s secession.

primary source speech w lincoln s first inaugural address lincoln s first inaugural address on march 4 1861 described his desire to maintain the union and prevent war with the southern states.
although slavery was a huge issue in the debate over secession lincoln did not say that he would work to free the slaves.
he stated that preserving the union was his primary goal even if that meant that slavery remained legal.
lincoln suggested that in a democratic government the correct course of action for the south was to work toward an amendment to the constitution instead of rejecting the union.
he stated his reasons for disagreeing with southern leaders on the issue of whether or not secession was legal.
no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union and that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void lincoln knew that southern leaders had already considered this argument and that some were calling for armed rebellion.
they believed the constitution protected their liberty to own slaves.
in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war.
the government will not assail you.
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors he pointed out that because the union was agreed to by every state all of them had to agree in order to break it.
lincoln warned that any revolutionary actions would be met with union military force.

speech gettysburg address after the bloody battle of gettysburg lincoln gave a speech that supported the union s goal of continuing the fight for the union.

neither side he implied was entirely blameless.
lincoln said that the entire country had suffered in the war because it had allowed slavery for so long.
he closed his speech with these words with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations t he wanted the entire nation to put the struggle behind it for j give others and work to repair s the union of states.

i fe war in virginia the troops that met in the first major battle of the civil war found that it was no picnic.
in july 1861 lincoln ordered general irvin mcdowell to lead his 35 000 man army from the union capital washington to the confederate capital richmond.
the soldiers were barely trained.
mcdowell complained that they stopped every moment to pick blackberries or get water they would not keep in the ranks.
the first day s march covered only five miles.
bull run manassas mcdowell s army was headed to manassas virginia an important railroad junction.
if mcdowell could seize manassas he would control the best route to the confederate capital.
some 22 000 confederate troops under the command of general pierre g t beauregard were waiting for mcdowell and his troops along a creek called bull run.
for two days union troops tried to find a way around the confederates.
during that time beauregard requested assistance and 516 chapter 16 general joseph e johnston headed toward manassas with another 10 000 confederate troops.
by july 21 1861 they had all arrived.

it is a new strange unanticipated experience to the soldiers of both armies far different from what they thought it would be.
charles coffin quoted in voices of the civil war by richard wheeler the battle raged through the day with rebel soldiers still arriving.
finally the weary union troops gave out.
they tried to make an orderly retreat back across the creek but the roads were clogged with the fancy carriages of panicked spectators.
the union army scattered in the chaos.
the confederates lacked the strength to push north and capture washington d c.
but clearly the rebels had won the day.
the first battle of bull run was the first major battle of the civil war and the confederates victory.
the battle is also known as the first battle of manassas.
it shattered the north s hopes of winning the war quickly.
more battles in virginia the shock at bull run persuaded lincoln of the need for a better trained army.
he put his hopes in general george b mcclellan.
the general assembled a highly disciplined force of 100 000 soldiers called the army of the potomac.
the careful mcclellan spent months training.
however because geography skills.

he overestimated the size of the confederate army mcclellan hesitated to attack.
lincoln grew impatient.
finally in the spring of 1862 mcclellan launched an effort to capture richmond called the peninsular campaign.
instead of marching south for a direct assault mcclellan slowly brought his force through the peninsula between the james and york rivers.
more time slipped away.
the south feared that mcclellan would receive reinforcements from washington.
to prevent this stonewall jackson launched an attack toward washington.
although the attack was pushed back it prevented the union from sending reinforcements to mcclellan.
the impact today many americans continue to be fascinated by the civil war.
some history buffs regularly stage re enactments of famous battles complete with uniforms guns and bayonets.
the civil war 51 in june 1862 with mcclellan s force poised outside richmond the confederate army in virginia came under the command of general robert e lee.
a graduate of the u s military academy at west point lee had served in the mexican war and had led federal troops at harpers ferry.
lee was willing to take risks and make unpredictable moves to throw union forces off balance.
during the summer of 1862 lee strengthened his positions.
on june 26 he attacked launching a series of clashes known as the seven days battles that forced the union army to retreat from near richmond.
confederate general d h hill described one failed attack.
it was not war it was murder he said.
lee saved richmond and forced mcclellan to retreat.
a frustrated lincoln ordered general john pope to march directly on richmond from washington.
pope told his soldiers let us look before us and not behind.
success and glory are in the advance.
jackson wanted to defeat pope s army before it could join up with mcclellan s larger army of the potomac.
jackson s troops met pope s union forces on the battlefield in august in 1862.
the three day battle became known as the second battle of bull run or the second battle of manassas.
the first day s fighting was savage.
captain george fairfield of the 7th wisconsin regiment later recalled what a slaughter.
no one appeared to know the object of the fight and there we stood for one hour the men falling all around.
the fighting ended in a stalemate.
on the second day pope found jackson s troops along an unfinished railroad grade.
pope hurled his men against the confederates.
but the attacks were pushed back with heavy casualties on both sides.
on the third day the confederates crushed the union army s assault and forced it to retreat in defeat.

on september 4 1862 some 40 000 confederate soldiers began crossing into maryland.
general robert e lee decided to divide his army.
he sent about half of his troops under the command of stonewall jackson to harpers ferry.
there they defeated a union force and captured the town.
meanwhile lee arrived in the town of frederick and issued a proclamation to the people of maryland urging them to join the confederates.

the confederates endured more than 13 000 casualties.
union officer a h nickerson later recalled it seemed that everybody near me was killed.
the battle of antietam also known as the battle of sharpsburg was the bloodiest single day battle of the civil war and of u s history.
more soldiers were killed and wounded at the battle of antietam than the deaths of all americans in the american revolution war of 1812 and mexican american war combined.
during the battle mcclellan kept four divisions of soldiers in reserve and refused to use them to attack lee s devastated army.
mcclellan was convinced that lee was massing reserves for a counterattack.
those reserves did not exist.

the north had most of the u s navy s small fleet and many experienced naval officers had remained loyal to the union.
the north also had enough industry to build more ships.
the confederacy turned to british companies for new ships.
academic vocabulary innovation a new idea or way of doing something the union s naval strategy the union navy quickly mobilized to set up a blockade of southern ports.
the blockade largely prevented the south from selling or receiving goods and it seriously damaged the southern economy.
the blockade was hard to maintain because the union navy had to patrol thousands of miles of coastline from virginia to texas.
the south used small fast ships to outrun the larger union warships.
most of these blockade runners traveled to the bahamas or nassau to buy supplies for the confederacy.
these ships however could not make up for the south s loss of trade.
the union blockade reduced the number of ships entering southern ports from 6 000 to 800 per year.
clash of the ironclads hoping to take away the union s advantage at sea the confederacy turned to a new type of warship irondads or ships heavily armored with iron.
the british government neglected to stop these ships from being delivered in violation of its pledge of neutrality.
the confederates had captured a union steamship the merrimack and turned it into an ironclad renamed the virginia.
one union sailor described the innovation as a huge half submerged crocodile.
in early march 1862 the ironclad sailed into hampton roads virginia an important waterway guarded by union ships.
before nightfall the virginia easily sank two of the union s wooden warships while it received minor damage.

the union navy had already built its own ironclad the monitor designed by swedish born engineer john ericsson.
ericsson s ship had unusual new features such as a revolving gun tower.
one confederate soldier called the monitor a tin can on a shingle.
although small the monitor carried powerful guns and had thick plating.
when the virginia returned to hampton roads later that month the monitor was waiting.
after several hours of fighting neither ship was seriously damaged but the monitor forced the virginia to withdraw.
this success saved the union fleet and continued the blockade.

farragut had his wooden ships wrapped in heavy chains to protect them like ironclads.
sailors slapped mississippi mud on the ships hulls to make them hard to see.
trees were tied to the masts to make the ships look like the forested shore.
before dawn on april 24 1862 the warships made their daring dash.
the confederates fired at farragut s ships from the shore and from gunboats.
they launched burning rafts one of which scorched farragut s own ship.

farragut sailed up the mississippi river taking baton rouge louisiana and natchez mississippi.
he then approached the city of vicksburg mississippi.
the siege of vicksburg vicksburg s geography made invasion all but impossible.
perched on 200 foot high cliffs above the mississippi river the city could rain down firepower on enemy ships or on soldiers trying to scale the cliffs.
deep gorges surrounded the city turning back land assaults.

abolitionists urged president lincoln to free them.
in an 1858 speech lincoln declared there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights numerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
yet as president lincoln found emancipation or the freeing of slaves to be a difficult issue.
he did not believe he had the constitutional power.
he also worried about the effects of emancipation.
lincoln issues the proclamation northerners had a range of opinions about abolishing slavery.
the democratic party which included many laborers opposed emancipation.
laborers feared that freed slaves would come north and take their jobs at lower wages.
abolitionists argued that the war was pointless if it did not win freedom for african americans.
they warned that the union would remain divided until the problem was resolved.

interpreting maps place in which places was slavery still legal after the emancipation proclamation.
lincoln worried about losing support for the war.
previous wartime confiscation acts that had attempted to free the slaves had been unpopular in the border states.
others including secretary of war edwin stanton agreed with lincoln that the use of slave labor was helping the confederacy make war.
therefore as commander in chief the president could free the slaves in all rebellious states.
freed african americans could then be recruited into the union army.
for several weeks in 1862 lincoln worked intensely thinking writing and rewriting.
he finally wrote the emancipation proclamation the order to free the confederate slaves.
the proclamation declared that m all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free.
emancipation proclamation 1862 the emancipation proclamation was a military order that freed slaves only in areas controlled by the confederacy.
in fact the the cl 529 proclamation had little immediate effect.
it was impossible for the federal government to enforce the proclamation in the areas where it actually applied the states in rebellion that were not under federal control.
the proclamation lj not stop slavery in the border states where the federal government would have had the power to enforce it.
the words written in the emancipation proclamation were powerful but the impact of the document was more symbolic than real.
it defined what the union was fighting against and discouraged britain from aiding the confederacy.
lincoln wanted to be in a strong position in the war before announcing his plan.
the battle of antietam gave him the victory he needed.
he issued the emancipation proclamation on september 22 1862.
the proclamation went into effect on january 1 1863.
reaction to the proclamation new year s eve december 31 1862 in night watch meetings at many african american churches worshippers prayed sang and gave thanks.

frederick douglass called january 1 1863 the great day which is to determine the destiny not only of the american republic but that of the american continent.
william lloyd garrison was quick to note however that slavery as a system continued to exist in the loyal slave states.
yet where slavery remained the proclamation encouraged many enslaved africans to escape when the union troops came near.
they flocked to the union camps and followed them for protection.
the loss of slaves crippled the south s ability to wage war.

the war department also gave contrabands or escaped slaves the right to join the union army in south carolina.
free african americans in louisiana and kansas also formed their own units.
by the spring of 1863 african american army units were proving themselves in combat.
they took part in a union attack on port hudson louisiana in may.
one unit stood out above the others.
the 54th massachusetts infantry consisted mostly of free african americans.
in july 1863 this regiment led a heroic charge on south carolina s fort wagner.
the 54th took heavy fire and suffered huge casualties in the failed operation.
about half the regiment was killed wounded or captured.
edward l pierce a correspondent for the new york tribune wrote the fifty fourth did well and nobly they moved up as gallantly as any troops could.
william camey a sergeant in the regiment became the first african american to receive the congressional medal of honor after he was shot several times while keeping the u s flag aloft during the battle.
the bravery of the 54th regiment made it the most celebrated african american unit of the war.
about 180 000 african americans served with the union army.
they received 10 a month while white soldiers got 13.
they were usually led by white officers some from abolitionist families.
african americans faced special horrors on the battlefield.
confederates often killed their black captives or sold them into slavery.
in the 1864 election lincoln suggested rewarding african american soldiers by giving them the right to vote.
fnwfhnrow analyzing information how did african americans support the union.
thecivilwar 53 growing opposition the deepening shadows in lincoln s face reflected the huge responsibilities he carried.
besides running the war he had to deal with growing tensions in the north.
copperheads as the months rolled on and the number of dead continued to increase a group of northern democrats began speaking out against the war.
led by u s representative clement l vallandigham of ohio they called themselves peace democrats.
their enemies called them copperheads comparing them to a poisonous snake.
the name stuck.
many copperheads were midwest erners that sympathized with the south and opposed abolition.
they believed the war was not necessary and called for its end.
vallandigham asked what the war had gained and then said let the dead at fredericksburg and vicksburg answer.
lincoln saw the copperheads as a threat to support of the war effort.
to silence them he suspended the right of habeas corpus.
habeas corpus is a constitutional protection against unlawful imprisonment.
ignoring this protection union officials jailed their enemies including some copperheads without evidence or trial.
lincoln s action greatly angered democrats and some republicans.
northern draft in march 1863 war critics erupted again when congress approved a draft or forced military service.
for 300 men were allowed to buy their way out of military service.
for an unskilled laborer however that was nearly a year s wages.
critics of the draft called the civil war a rich man s war and a poor man s fight.
in july 1863 riots broke out when african americans were brought into new york city to replace striking irish dock workers.
the city happened to be holding a war draft at the same time.
the two events enraged rioters who attacked african americans and draft offices.
more than 100 people died.
in this tense situation the northern democrats nominated former general george mcclellan for president in 1864.
they called infantry family while wealthy civilians could avoid military service poorer men were drafted to serve in the union army.
this member of the 31st pennsylvania infantry brought his family along with him.
his wife probably helped the soldier with many daily chores such as cooking and laundry.
why would soldiers bring their families to live with them in camp.

identifying cause and effect who opposed the war and how did lincoln respond to the conflict.
life for soldiers and civilians young fresh recruits in both armies were generally eager to fight.
experienced troops however knew better.
on the battlefield civil war armies fought in the ancient battlefield formation that produced massive casualties.
endless rows of troops fired directly at one another with cannonballs landing amid them.
when the order was given soldiers would attach bayonets to their guns and rush toward their enemy.
men died to gain every inch of ground.
doctors and nurses in the field saved many lives.
yet they had no medicines to stop infections that developed after soldiers were wounded.
many soldiers endured the horror of having infected legs and arms amputated without painkillers.
infections from minor injuries caused many deaths.
despite the huge battlefield losses the biggest killer in the civil war was not the fighting.
it was diseases such as typhoid pneumonia and tuberculosis.
nearly twice as many soldiers died of illnesses as died in combat.
prisoners of war military prisoners on both sides lived in unimaginable misery.
in prison camps such as andersonville georgia and elmira new york soldiers were packed into camps designed to hold only a fraction of their number.
soldiers had little shelter food or clothing.
starvation and disease killed thousands of prisoners.
linking to jqday modern battlefield communications analysis skill.
analyzing information battlefield communications the drummer was an essential member of every civil war unit.
drummers served army commanders by drumming specific beats that directed troop movements during battle.
different beats were used to order troops to prepare to attack to fire to cease fire and to signal a truce.
drummers had to stay near their commanders to hear orders.
this meant that the drummers some as young as nine years old often saw deadly combat conditions.
the civil war gave birth to the signal corps the army unit devoted to communications.
today battlefield communications are primarily electronic.
radio e mail facsimile and telephone messages often relayed by satellites enable orders and other information to be transmitted nearly instantaneously all over the globe.

economy in the north boomed as production and prices soared.
the lack of workers caused wages to rise by 43 percent between 1860 and 1865.
women were the backbone of civilian life.
on the farms women and children performed the daily chores usually done by men.
one visitor to iowa in 1862 reported that he met more women at work in the fields than men.

fredericksburg and chancellorsville frustrated by mcclellan s lack of aggression lincoln replaced him with general ambrose e burnside as leader of the army of the potomac.
burnside favored a swift decisive attack on richmond by way of fredericksburg.
in november 1862 he set out with 120 000 troops.
burnside s tactics surprised general lee.
the confederate commander had divided his force of 78 000 men.
neither section of the confederate army was in a good position to defend fredericksburg.
however burnside s army experienced delays in crossing the rappahannock river.
these delays allowed lee s army to reunite and entrench themselves around fredericksburg.
finally the union army crossed the rappahannock and launched a series of charges.
these attacks had heavy casualties and failed to break the confederate line.
eventually after suffering about 12 600 casualties burnside ordered a retreat.
the confederates had about 5 300 casualties.
soon burnside stepped down from his position.
lincoln made general joseph hooker the commander of the army of the potomac.
at the end of april 1863 hooker and his army of about 138 000 men launched a frontal attack on fredericksburg.
then hooker 536 chapter 16 ordered about 115 000 of his troops to split off and approach the confederate s flank or side.
hooker s strategy seemed about to work.
but for some reason he hesitated and had his flanking troops take a defensive position at chancellorsville.
this town was located a few miles west of fredericksburg.
the following day lee used most of his army about 60 000 men to attack hooker s troops at chancellorsville.
stonewall jack son led an attack on hooker s flank while lee commanded an assault on the union front.
the union army was almost cut in two.
they managed to form a defensive line which they held for three days.
then hooker ordered a retreat.
lee s army won a major victory.
but this victory had severe casualties.
during the battle lee s trusted general stonewall jackson was accidentally shot by his own troops.
he died a few days later.
comparing what did generals mcclellan burnside and hooker have in common.
reading check battle of gettysburg general lee launched more attacks within union territory.
as before his goal was to break the north s will to fight.
he also hoped that a victory would convince other nations to recognize the confederacy.
first day in early june 1863 lee cut across northern maryland into southern pennsylvania.
his forces gathered west of a small town called gettysburg.
lee was unaware that union soldiers were encamped closer to town.
he had been suffering from lack of enemy information for three days because his cavalry chief jeb stuart was not performing his duties.
stuart and his cavalry had gone off on their own raiding party disobeying lee s orders.
another confederate raiding party went to gettysburg for boots and other supplies.
there lee s troops ran right into union general george g meade s cavalry triggering the battle of gettysburg a key battle that finally turned the tide against the confederates.
the battle began on july 1 1863 when the three days at gettysburg gettysburg was the largest and bloodiest battle of the civil war.
in three days more than 51 000 soldiers were killed wounded captured or went missing.
it was an important victory for the union and it stopped lee s plan of invading the north.
confederate raiding party and the union forces began exchanging fire.
the larger confederate forces began to push the union troops back through gettysburg.
the union soldiers regrouped along the high ground of cemetery ridge and culp s hill.
general lee wanted to prevent the union forces from entrenching themselves.
he therefore ordered general ewell to attack immediately.
however ewell hesitated and thereby gave the federals time to establish an excellent defensive position.
in fact confederate general james longstreet thought that the union position was almost impossible to overrun.
instead of attacking he felt that the confederate army should move east take a strong defensive position themselves and wait for the union forces to attack them.
however general lee was not convinced.
he believed that his troops were invincible.
the confederates camped at seminary ridge which ran parallel to the union forces.
both camps called for their main forces to reinforce them and prepare for combat the next day.
second day on july 2 lee ordered an attack on the left side of the union line.
lee knew that he could win the battle if his troops captured little round top from the union forces.
from this hill lee s troops could easily fire down on the line of union forces.
union forces and confederate troops fought viciously for control of little round top.
the fighting was particularly fierce on the south side of the hill.
there the 20th maine led by colonel joshua chamberlain battled the 15th alabama led by colonel william oates.
later when describing the conflict oates said the blood stood in puddles in some places in the rocks.
eventually the union forced the confederates to pull back from little round top.
then the confederates attacked cemetery hill and culp s hill.
the fighting lasted until nightfall.
the assault on cemetery hill was unsuccessful.
the confederates did manage to take a few trenches on culp s hill.
even so the union forces still held a strong defensive position by the day s end.
inrlim h rnrihii 538 chapter 16 pickett s charge on the third day of battle longstreet again tried to convince lee not to attack.
but lee thought that the union forces were severely battered and ready to break.
because of this he planned to attack the center of the union line on cemetery ridge.
such a tactic he felt would not be expected.
indeed general meade left only about 5 750 troops to defend the center.
for over an hour the confederates shelled cemetery ridge with cannon fire.
for a while the union cannons fired back.
then they slacked off.
the confederates assumed that they had seriously damaged the union artillery.
in reality the confederate barrage did little damage.
the task of charging the union center fell to three divisions of confederate soldiers.
general george pickett commanded the largest unit.
in late afternoon nearly 15 000 men took part in pickett s charge.
for one mile the confederates marched slowly up toward cemetery ridge.
showered with cannon and rifle fire they suffered severe losses.
but eventually some of them almost reached their destination.
then union reinforcements added to the barrage on the rebels.
soon the i sd pickett s charge july 3 1863 general george pickett led his troops across emmitsburg road to attack the union position.
he lost more than half of his men in the 50 minute battle.

in one of its frequently quoted lines lincoln referenced the declaration of independence and its ideals of liberty equality and democracy.
he reminded listeners that the war was being fought for those reasons.

union troops launched the wilderness campaign a series of battles designed to capture the confederate capital at richmond virginia.
the first battle took place in early may in woods about 50 miles outside of richmond.
grant then ordered general meade to spotsylvania where the fighting raged for five days.
over the next month union soldiers moved the confederate troops back toward richmond.
however grant experienced his worst defeat at the battle of cold harbor in early june just 10 miles northeast of richmond.
in only a few hours the union army suffered 7 000 casualties.
the battle delayed grant s plans to take the confederate capital.
union forces had suffered twice as many casualties as the confederates had yet grant continued his strategy.
he knew he would be getting additional soldiers and lee could not.
grant slowly but surely advanced his troops through virginia.
he told another officer i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.
after cold harbor general grant moved south of richmond.
he had hoped to take control of the key railroad junction at petersburg virginia.
lee s army however formed a solid defense and grant could not execute his attack.
grant was winning the war but he still had not captured richmond.

the federal system the framers of the constitution wanted to create a government powerful enough to protect the rights of citizens and defend the country against its enemies.
to do so they set up a federal system of government a system that divided powers between the states and the federal government.
this system is also known as federalism.
the constitution assigns certain powers to the national government.
these are called delegated powers.
among them are the rights to coin money and to regulate trade.
reserved powers are those kept by the states.
these powers include creating local governments and holding elections.
concurrent powers are those shared by the federal and state governments.
they include taxing borrowing money and enforcing laws.
sometimes congress has had to stretch its delegated powers to deal with new or unexpected issues.
a clause in the constitution states that congress may make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying out its duties.
this clause called the elastic clause because it can be stretched like elastic provides flexibility for the government.
the federal government has used this clause to provide public services such as funding for the arts and humanities.

this separation balances the branches and keeps any one of them from growing too powerful.
the first branch of government is the legislative branch or congress.
it makes the nation s laws.
article i of the constitution divides congress into the house of representatives and the senate.
with 435 members the house of representatives is the larger congressional house.
the u s census a population count made every 10 years determines how many members represent each state.
a system called apportionment keeps total membership at 435.
if one state gains a member another state loses one.
members must be at least 25 years old live in the state where they were elected and have been u s citizens for seven years.
they serve two year terms.
the senate has two members or senators per state.
senators represent the interests of the whole state not just a district.
they must be at least 30 years old have been u s citizens for nine years and live in the state they represent.
they serve six year terms.
the senior senator of a state is the one who has served the longer of the two.
members of congress can serve an unlimited number of terms in office.
the political party with more members in each house is the majority party.
the one with fewer members is the minority party.
the leader of the house of representatives or speaker of the house is elected by house members from the majority party.
the u s vice president serves as president of the senate.
he takes no part in senate debates but can vote to break ties.
if he is absent the president pro tempore pro tern for short leads the senate.
there is no law for how the senate must choose this position but it traditionally goes to the majority party s senator who has served the longest.
congress begins sessions or meetings each year in the first week of january.
both houses do most of their work in committees.
each committee studies certain types of bills or suggested laws.
for example all bills about taxes begin in the house ways and means committee.

the president must also have been a u s resident for 14 years.
americans elect a president and vice president every four years.
franklin d roosevelt who won four times was the only president to serve more than two terms.
now the twenty second amendment limits presidents to two terms.
if a president dies resigns or is removed from office the vice president becomes president for the rest of the term.
the house of representatives can impeach or vote to bring charges of serious crimes against a president.
impeachment cases are tried in the senate.
if a president is found guilty congress can remove him from office.
in 1868 andrew johnson was the first president to be impeached.
president bill clinton was impeached in 1998.
however the senate found each man not guilty.
working with congress the president and congress are often on different sides of an issue.
however they must still work together.
congress passes laws.
the president however can ask congress to pass or reject bills.
the president also can veto or cancel laws congress has passed.
congress can try to override or undo the veto.
however this is difficult since it takes a two thirds b4 chapter 6 majority vote.
to carry out laws affecting the constitution treaties and statutes the president issues executive orders.
these commands have the power of law.
the president also may grant pardons or freedom from punishment to persons convicted of federal crimes or facing criminal charges.
the president also commands the armed forces.
in emergencies the president can call on u s troops.
only congress however can declare war.
other executive duties include conducting foreign relations and creating treaties.
executive departments do most of the executive branch work.
as of 2004 there were 15 such departments.
the president chooses department heads who are called secretaries and the senate approves them.
the heads make up the cabinet which advises the president.

reading check judicial branch the third branch of government the judicial branch is made up of a system of federal courts headed by the u s supreme court.
the constitution created the supreme court but the judiciary act of 1789 created the system of lower district and circuit courts.
article iii generally outlines the courts duties.
federal courts can strike down a state or federal law if the court finds a law unconstitutional.
congress can then try to revise the law to make it constitutional.
district courts the president makes appointments to federal courts.
in an effort to keep federal judges free of party influence the judges are given life appointments.
the lower federal courts are divided according to cases over which they have jurisdiction or authority.
each state has at least one of the 94 district courts.
the impact today the office of homeland security was established in 2002 to address the increased threat of terrorism following september 11 2001.
in 2003 the office became the department of homeland security the newest executive department.
background of the court the rest of the supreme court decisions you see in this book will highlight important cases of the court.
but in this first one well discuss the history of the court.
the first supreme court met in 1790 at the royal exchange in new york city.
the ground floor of this building was an open air market.
when the national government moved to philadelphia the court met in basement rooms in independence hall.
once in washington the court heard cases in the capitol building until the present supreme court building was completed in 1932.
circuit riding today the supreme court holds court only in washington d c.
in the past however the justices had to travel through assigned circuits hearing cases together with a district judge in a practice known as riding circuit.
the justices complained bitterly about the inconvenience of travel which was often over unpaved roads and in bad weather.
this system was not just inconvenient to the justices however.
some people worried about the fairness of a system that required justices who had heard cases at trial to rule on them again on appeal.
other people however thought that the practice helped keep the justices in touch with the needs and feelings of the average citizen.
eventually circuit riding interfered so much with the increased amount of business of the supreme court that congress passed a law ending the practice in the late 1800s.
path to the supreme court when a case is decided by a state or federal court the losing side may have a chance to appeal the decision to a higher court.
under the federal system this higher court is called the court of j appeals.
a person who loses in that court s may then appeal to the supreme court to review the case.
but the supreme court does not have to accept all appeals.
it usually chooses to hear only cases in which there is an important legal principle to be decided or if two federal courts of appeals disagree on how an issue should be decided.
analysis skillfa alyziwc information 1.
what are two reasons why the practice of circuit riding ended.
why do you think the supreme court does not hear every case that is appealed to it.
citizenship and the constitution 185 the impact today supreme court rulings can have dramatic effects on the nation as in bushv.
gore which decided the outcome of the 2000 presidential election.
courts of appeals if someone convicted of a crime believes the trial was unfair he or she may take the case to the court of appeals.
there are 13 courts of appeals.
each has a panel of judges to decide if cases heard in the lower courts were tried appropriately.
if the judges uphold or accept the original decision the original outcome stands.
otherwise the case may be retried in the lower court.
supreme court after a case is decided by the court of appeals the losing side may appeal the decision to the supreme court.
thousands of cases go to the supreme court yearly in the hope of a hearing but the court has time to hear only about 100.
generally the cases heard involve important constitutional or public interest issues.
if the court declines to hear a case the court of appeals decision is final.
nine justices sit on the supreme court.
the chief justice of the united states leads the court.
unlike the president and members of congress there are no specific constitutional requirements for becoming a justice.
in recent decades the supreme court has become more diverse.
in 1967 thurgood marshall became the first african american justice.
sandra day o connor became the first female court justice after her 1981 appointment by president ronald reagan.

some of the amendments specifically address complaints mentioned in the declaration of independence.
the protection of individual liberties is important in a representative democracy.
without safeguards people s rights would not always be protected because of majority rule.
this is the idea that the greatest number of people in society can make policies for everyone.
while this means that most people agree on what the law should be it also means that smaller groups or minorities might lose their rights.
the bill of rights ensures that the rights of all citizens are protected.
16 chapter 6 the ideas spelled out in the first amendment form the most basic rights of all u s citizens.
these rights include freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of speech freedom of assembly and the right to petition.
in the spirit of thomas jefferson s virginia statute for religious freedom the first amendment begins congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
in other words the government cannot support or interfere with the practice of a religion.
this amendment keeps the government from favoring one religion over any other or establishing an official religion.
the first amendment also guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.
this means that americans have the right to express their own ideas and views.
they also have the right to hear the ideas and views of others.
former senator margaret chase smith discussed why these freedoms are important.
the key to security she once said is public information.
freedom of speech does not mean that people can say anything they want to how 1 amendment i congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
the constitution does not protect slander false statements meant to damage someone s reputation.
libel or intentionally writing a lie that harms another person is not protected either.
the supreme court has also ruled that speech that endangers public safety is not protected.
for example justice oliver wendell holmes declared in 1919 that falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater is not protected as free speech.
americans also have freedom of assembly.
any group may gather peacefully.
as long as they do not engage in illegal activities the government cannot interfere.
the right to petition or make a request of the government is another right of the american people.
any american can present a petition to a government official.
this right lets americans show dissatisfaction with a law.
they can also suggest new laws.
one of the reasons the declaration of independence gave for breaking with britain was king george ill s refusal to respond to petitions sent by colonists.
reading check the impact.
today free speech protection has also been applied to symbolic speech or nonverbal communication that expresses an idea such as wearing a protest button.
summarizing what rights does the first amendment guarantee to americans.
workers use the right of assembly to protest a proposed budget in new york city.
amendment ii a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
amendment iii no soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner nor in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
amendment iv the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
to having their property searched for illegal goods.
anger over such actions led to the fourth amendment rule against unreasonable searches and seizures.
before a citizen s property can be searched authorities must now get a search warrant.
this order gives authorities permission to search someone s property.
a judge issues this order only when it seems likely that a search might uncover evidence relating to a crime.
in emergencies however police can make an emergency search.
this may preserve evidence needed to prove possible illegal activity.
reading check finding main ideas why were the third and fourth amendments matters of great importance to americans when the bill of rights was written.
protecting citizens the second third and fourth amendments relate to colonial disputes with britain and reflect many of the ideals outlined in the declaration of independence.
the second amendment deals with state militias and the right to bear arms.
colonial militias played a big role in the revolutionary war.
the framers of the constitution thought that the states needed their militias for emergencies.
today the national guard has largely replaced organized state militias.
supporters of gun control laws have generally argued that the second amendment was intended to protect the collective right of states to maintain well regulated militia units.
opponents hold that the amendment was meant to protect an individual s right of self defense.
the meaning of the amendment continues to be debated.
the third amendment prevents the military from forcing citizens to house soldiers.
before the revolution the british pressured colonists to shelter and feed british soldiers a practice colonists protested in the declaration of independence.
british leaders also forced colonists to submit rights of the accused the fifth sixth seventh and eighth amendments provide guidelines for protecting the rights of the accused.
according to the fifth amendment the government cannot punish anyone without due process of law.
this means that the law must be fairly applied.
a grand jury decides if there is enough evidence to indict en dyt or formally accuse a person.
without an indictment the court cannot try anyone for a serious crime.
the fifth amendment also protects people from having to testify at their own criminal trial.
to keep from testifying a person need only take the fifth.
in addition anyone found not guilty in a criminal trial cannot face double jeopardy.
in other words he or she cannot be tried again for the same crime.
the final clause of the fifth amendment states that no one can have property taken without due process of law.
there is one exception the government s power of eminent domain.
this is the power to take personal property to benefit the public.
one example would be taking private land to build a public road.
however the government must pay the owners a fair price for the property.
chapter 6 the sixth amendment protects the rights of a person who has been indicted.
under british rule colonists were sometimes held in jail for long periods or taken to britain before being brought to trial.
the british government also prevented some accused of crimes from having a jury trial.
the declaration of independence listed these and other interferences with trials as a reason for rebelling against britain.
the sixth amendment guarantees an indicted person a speedy public trial.
public trials ensure that laws are followed by allowing the public to witness the proceedings.
accused people have the right to know the charges against them and can hear and question witnesses who testify against them.
accused people have the right to an attorney.
if they cannot pay for one the government must provide it.
sometimes accused persons refuse their sixth amendment rights.
for example some defendants refuse the services of an attorney while others choose to have a trial in front of a judge alone instead of before a jury.
in many cases defendants can forgo trial and agree to a plea bargain.
this means that a defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge and avoids risking conviction for a crime with a greater sentence.
the seventh amendment states that juries can decide civil cases.
it is possible to harm another person without committing a crime.
in such cases the injured party may sue or seek justice in a civil court.
civil cases usually involve disputes over money or property.
for example someone might bring a civil suit against a person who refuses to repay a debt.
amendment v no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.
amendment vi in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed which district shall have been previously ascertained by law and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation to be confronted with the witnesses against him to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.
amendment vii in suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars the right of trial by jury shall be preserved and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the united states than according to the rules of the common law.
a judge and jury listen to attorneys and witnesses from each side of a court case to determine a verdict.
citwiship and the constitution 219 amendment viii excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
a right to bail the eighth amendment allows for bail.
bail is a set amount of money that defendants promise to pay the court if they fail to appear in court at the proper time.
by posting or paying bail a defendant can avoid staying in jail before and during a trial.
if a defendant does not show up in court for trial the court demands the bail money be paid and issues a warrant for arrest.
the eighth amendment keeps courts from setting unfairly high bail.
however in cases of very serious crimes a judge may refuse to set bail altogether.
this can be the case for example if the court regards a j defendant as being potentially dangerous to the public by j being left free.
a judge can also deny bail if he or she thinks the defendant will not show up for trial.
in such cases the defendant must remain in jail through the trial.
focus on reading summarize the bill of rights.
cruel and unusual punishments the eighth amendment also bans cruel and unusual punishments against a person convicted of a crime.
for many years americans have debated the question of what exactly constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
the debate has often centered on the issue of capital punishment.
in 1972 the supreme court ruled that the way in which most states carried out the death penalty was cruel and unusual.
the court also found that the ways in which many states sentenced people to death were unfair.
however a few years later the court ruled that not all executions were in themselves cruel and unusual.
most states still allow the death penalty.
those that do must follow the supreme court s rules.
to do so many states have changed the ways in which they carry out the death penalty.
reading check summarizing what is the purpose ofthe eighth amendment.
rights of states and citizens the final two amendments in the bill of rights give a general protection for other rights not addressed by the first eight amendments.
these amendments also reserve some governmental powers for the states and the people.
ninth amendment the ninth amendment says that the rights listed in the constitution are not the only rights that citizens have.
this amendment has allowed the courts and congress to decide other basic rights of citizens.
the constitution does not address the question of education.
however most americans believe that it is a basic and essential right.
this seems especially true in view of the fact that american citizens must be able to vote for the people who represent them in government.
education is not just another amendment ix the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
amendment x the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.
0 chapter 6 consumer item.
it is the bedrock foundation of our democracy explained educational leader mary hatwood futrell.
today state governments offer free education from elementary to high school to all citizens.
tenth amendment the tenth amendment recognizes that the states and the people have additional powers.
these powers are any ones that the constitution does not specifically give to congress the delegated powers.
the tenth amendment makes it clear that any powers not either delegated to the federal government or prohibited to the states belong to the states and the people.
thus the last amendment in the bill of rights protects citizens rights and helps keep the balance of power between the federal and state governments.

citizenship and the constitution 221 on september 17 constitution day americans celebrate the signing of the united states constitution in 1787.
in texas social studies classrooms also observe celebrate freedom week.
this important celebration focuses on the meaning and significance of the two foundational documents in united states history the declaration of independence and the u s constitution.
the declaration of independence one of the most eloquent and influential documents ever written the declaration of independence gave the reasons the american colonies were willing to fight for independence.
thomas jefferson the main author of the document began by explaining the purpose of government.
part of this first section known as the preamble must be recited by texas students during celebrate freedom week.
it is perhaps the most famous statement from the document these powerful words established the idea that governments exist to serve their citizens and that people have basic natural rights that government cannot take away.
throughout our history these words have inspired americans to fight for and expand the definitions of freedom equality and basic rights.
for example women s rights advocates echoed the language of the declaration of independence in 1848 when they demanded the right to vote by declaring that all men and women are created equal.
abolitionists and civil rights leaders also looked to the declaration of independence in their struggles to end slavery and ensure that african americans were guaranteed equal rights.
even beyond america the declaration of independence has inspired independence and prodemocracy movements around the world.
it continues to inspire us today.
independence day each 4th of july americans celebrate the adoption of the declaration of independence with parades fireworks picnics fairs and ceremonies honoring our freedoms and government.
we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

another truly groundbreaking document the constitution established the rule of law and made clear that no one including the highest government official is above it.
the document s opening words the preamble elegantly state its purpose i ve the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america.
united states constitution the three opening words ive the people which were written so much larger than the others announced dramatically that in the united states the people are the source of all government power and authority.
to protect people s rights and to balance power the constitution set up a system that divides power among federal and state governments.
federal power is supreme and certain powers are shared or reserved for the states.
a system of checks and balances further divides power among three equal branches of government legislative executive and judicial.
the constitution also includes a process by which it can be amended or changed.
it is sometimes referred to as a living document for this reason it can be added to and improved by the people to reflect changes in society.
since it was adopted in 1787 the constitution has been amended 27 times.
these amendments have abolished slavery guaranteed women and minorities the right to vote and to receive equal treatment under the law changed voting and election procedures and made other improvements to our government.
one of the most important parts of the constitution is the bill of rights the first 10 amendments.
the bill of rights helps protect the rights described in the declaration of independence.
for example the bill of rights protects such basic rights as freedom of speech press and religion as well as due process rights such as the right to a fair trial.
the bill of rights was an important early addition to the constitution because it stated in writing some of the specific individual rights and protections guaranteed for all americans.

citizenship people become u s citizens in several ways.
first anyone born in the united states or a territory it controls is a citizen.
people born in a foreign country are u s citizens if at least one parent is a u s citizen.
foreign born people whose parents are not citizens must move to the united states to become naturalized citizens.
once in the united states they go through a long process before applying for citizenship.
if they succeed they become naturalized citizens giving them most of the rights and responsibilities of other citizens.
in the united states legal immigrants have many of the rights and responsibilities of citizens but cannot vote or hold public office.
the u s government can deport or return to the country of origin immigrants who break the law.
legal immigrants over age 18 may request naturalization after living in the united states for five years.
all legal immigrants have to 2 chapter 6 support themselves financially.
if not someone must assume financial responsibility for them.
immigrants must be law abiding and support the u s constitution.
they must demonstrate understanding of written and spoken english.
they also must show basic knowledge of u s history and government.
when this is done candidates take an oath of allegiance to the united states.
they then get certificates of naturalization.
only two differences between naturalized and native born citizens exist.
naturalized citizens can lose their citizenship and they cannot become president or vice president.
many famous americans have been naturalized citizens including german jewish scientist albert einstein and former secretary of state madeleine albright originally from czechoslovakia.

responsibilities of citizenship for a representative democracy to work americans need to fulfill their civic duties.
the stakes are too high for government to be a spectator sport former texas congresswoman barbara jordan once said.
civic duties citizens elect officials to make laws for them.
in turn citizens must obey those laws and respect the authorities who enforce them.
obeying rules and laws includes knowing them and staying informed about any changes.
ignorance of a law will not prevent a person from being punished for breaking it.
another duty is paying taxes for services such as public roads police and public schools.
people pay sales taxes property taxes and tariffs.
many americans also pay a tax on their income to the federal and sometimes state government.
becoming a citizen for many people around the world becoming a citizen ofthe united states is a lifelong dream.
the highlight ofthe naturalization process is the ceremony where candidates promise to support and defend the constitution and laws ofthe united states of america.
citizens have the duty to defend the nation.
men 18 years or older must register with selective service.
in the event of a draft or required military service those able to fight are already registered.
although women do not register many serve in the armed forces.
americans have the right to a trial by jury under the sixth amendment.
to protect this right citizens should be willing to serve on a jury when they are called.
otherwise fulfilling each person s sixth amendment rights would be difficult.
citizenship and the constitution 223 responsibilities of citizens for representative democracy to work citizens must do their part.
each activity pictured here serves an important role in the community.
military service civic responsibilities in addition to duties which are required by law citizens also have responsibilities to fulfill.
these are not required by law but are necessary for american democracy to work.
civic responsibilities are often considered to be an important part of the character of the country itself.
the most important of these responsibilities is voting.
voting is also one of our most important rights because it shapes government policies.
if citizens do not vote they are not taking part in choosing who represents them in government.
elected representatives respond to the opinions of the voters who elect them.
if only a small portion of constituents vote the policies of the representative may not reflect the true opinion of the majority of people he or she represents.
to make the best choices in voting people have a responsibility to stay informed on public issues and candidates.
information is available from many sources the internet newspapers television other media and from attending public meetings or listening to speeches.
however voters should also be aware that some material may be deliberately biased to support or discredit a particular viewpoint.
comparing many sources of information and opinions can help voters make the decision that best represents what they want the government to do.
society benefits when people fulfill their personal responsibilities because it means that people take responsibility for the consequences of their behavior whether good or bad.
these responsibilities are different for everyone but might include supporting one s family attending school working at a job or caring for a pet.
when people fulfill their personal responsibilities it puts less strain on the resources of other people and the government.
the responsibilities of u s citizens are some of the most basic aspects of the national identity.
the united states was founded on the principles of democracy and the idea that each citizen should have a voice in the nation s government.
some other nations have used these ideas as a template for their own democracies so that the u s today is known for its citizens responsibility and right to vote.
keeping informed about issues is also part of the national identity.

first amendment rights many of the rights enjoyed by u s citizens are specifically protected by the constitution.
as you have read the 27 amendments are especially important tools to protect these rights.
many of the amendments protect voting rights and the rights of people accused of crimes.
the rights protected by the first 10 amendments or the bill of rights were so important to the founders that they were included before the government went into effect.
the rights protected by the first amendment are considered by many people to be the most fundamental to the identity of the nation.
the first amendment reads congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
this amendment prevents the government from making policies that support one religion over another.
it also allows people to practice any religion they want or no religion at all.
the freedom of religion has shaped the american way of life since colonial times.
several colonies were founded to protect religious freedom.
the freedom of religion has led to the existence of a wide variety of kinds of worship in the united states.
having many choices for religious worship is one part of the american national identity.
the right to free speech and a free press allow citizens to express their viewpoints even if they are critical of the government or elected officials.
these rights are necessary for a constitutional republic because citizens need to be informed about the government elected officials policies and issues so that people can hear important facts and opinions when making voting decisions.
they are also valuable for sharing new information and stories that can educate entertain or promote invention.
the final two rights mentioned in the first amendment the right to assemble and the right to petition the government are directly related to british policies toward the colonies.
british authorities tried to stop the revolutionary movement by arresting people who gathered to discuss the issues.
they also ignored petitions for change by claiming the colonists were not following the correct rules in asking for different laws.
recall what kinds of rights are described in the first amendment.

political participation is part of our nation s identity and tradition.
when colonists protested british rule in the 1700s they formed committees and presented their views to political leaders.
influencing government as the new american nation grew so did political participation.
french diplomat alexis de tocqueville visited the united states in 1831 to study american democracy.
he was amazed at the large number of political groups americans participated in.
he wrote about them what political power could ever carry on the vast multitude large number of lesser undertakings which the american citizens perform every day with the assistance ofthe principle of association joining a group.
nothing in my opinion is more deserving of our attention than the intellectual and moral associations of america alexis de tocqueville democracy in america u s citizens sometimes work with interest groups.
these groups of people share a common interest that motivates them to take political action.
interest groups organize speeches and rallies to support their cause.
however citizens need not join a group to influence government.
they can write letters to leaders of government or attend city council meetings.
active political participation is an important duty for u s citizens and immigrants alike.
in addition to voting many americans choose to campaign for candidates or issues.
anyone can help campaign even if he or she is not eligible to vote.
many people also help campaigns by giving money directly or through political action committees pacs groups that collect money for candidates who support certain issues.
helping the community commitment to others moves many americans to volunteer in community service groups.
some small communities rely on volunteers for services such as fire protection and law enforcement.
the american red cross helps citizens in times of natural disasters or other emergencies.
the boy scouts and girl scouts plan many projects such as planting trees to improve the environment.
even simple acts such as picking up trash in parks or serving food in shelters help a community.

i citizenship andthe constitution 225b social studies skills analysis critical thinking civic participation study understanding historical interpretation define the skill historical interpretations are ways of explaining the past.
they are based on what is known about the people ideas and actions that make up history.
two historians can look at the same set of facts about a person or event of the past and see things in different ways.
their explanations of the person or event and the conclusions they reach can be very different.
the ability to recognize understand and evaluate historical interpretations is a valuable skill in the study of history.
learn the skill when people study the past they decide which facts are the most important in explaining why something happened.
one person may believe certain facts to be important while other people may believe other facts are more important.
therefore their explanation of the topic and the conclusions they draw about it may not be the same.
in addition if new facts are uncovered about the topic still more interpretations of it may result.
asking the following questions will help you to understand and evaluate historical interpretations.
what is the main idea in the way the topic is explained.
what conclusions are reached.
be aware that these may not be directly stated but only hinted at in the information provided.
on what facts has the writer or speaker relied.
do these facts seem to support his or her explanation and conclusions.
is there important information about the topic that the writer or speaker has dismissed or ignored.
if so you should suspect that the interpretation may be inaccurate or deliberately slanted to prove a particular point of view.
just because interpretations differ one is not necessarily right and others wrong.
as long as a person considers all the evidence and draws conclusions based on a fair evaluation of that evidence his or her interpretation is probably acceptable.
remember however that trained historians let the facts lead them to conclusions.
people who start with a conclusion select only facts that support it and ignore opposing evidence produce interpretations that have little value for understanding history.
practice the skill historians have different views on which documents and ideas were most influential on the framers of the constitution.
some believe that enlightenment writers provided the strongest reason for writing the constitution while others think that the practice of self government in the colonies influenced the writing of the constitution the most.
review the documents and ideas that influenced the framing of the constitution.
then answer the following questions.

understanding predicting likewise when you study history you can use your knowledge of the past to predict a likely outcome of an event.
if you see a pattern to historical events the same pattern could apply to future events.
you have learned about the ways that americans have moved into new lands and the economic and political changes that have occurred in u s history.
recognizing a pattern to these changes can give you a better understanding of the past and help you make a prediction about how people responded or might respond to similar occurrences.
notice how one reader uses prior knowledge to predict what may happen.
by 1870 only small portions of the great plains remained unsettled.
for s most of the next two decades this land remained open range.
in march 1889 government officials announced that homesteaders could file claims j on land in what is now the state of oklahoma.
this land had belonged to creek and seminole indians.
within a month about 50 000 people rushed to oklahoma to stake their claims.
in all settlers claimed more than 2 million acres of former indian land in the famous oklahoma land rush and another 9 million over the next several years.
this huge wave of pioneers was the last chapter of the westward movement.
by the early 1890s the frontier had largely ceased to exist in the united states.
after reading this section one reader thought i have read about the ways in which previous waves of settlers changed the areas into which they moved.
colonists founded towns and cities and population increased.
new economic opportunities were created.
what happened in those regions that might happen in the rest of the united states once the west was settled.
550 chapter 17 you try it.
the following passage is from the chapter you are getting ready to read.
as you read the passage look for the facts that can help you predict what might happen in the future.
redeemers set up the poll tax in an effort to deny the vote to african americans.
the poll tax was a special tax people had to pay before they could vote.
some states also targeted african american voters by requiring them to pass a literacy test.
a so called grandfather clause written into law affected men whose fathers or grandfathers could vote before 1867.
in those cases a voter did not have to pay a poll tax or pass a literacy test.
as a result almost every white man could escape the voting restrictions.
from chapter 17 p 568 after you read the passage answer the following questions.
what do you know about african americans right to vote prior to and during reconstruction.
what do you know about the importance of the right to vote.

building background when the civil war ended much of the south lay in ruins.
like the young soldier above many people returned to destroyed homes and farms.
harvests of corn cotton rice and other crops fell far below normal.
many farm animals had been killed or were roaming free.
these were some of the challenges in restoring the nation.
reconstruction begins after the civil war ended in 1865 the u s government faced the problem of dealing with the defeated southern states.
the challenges of reconstruction the process of readmitting the former confederate states to the union lasted from 1865 to 1877.
552 chapter 17 damaged south tired southern soldiers returned home to find that the world they had known before the war was gone.
cities towns and farms had been ruined.
because of high food prices and widespread crop failures many southerners faced starvation.
the confederate money held by most southerners was now worthless.
banks failed and merchants had gone bankrupt because people could not pay their debts.
former confederate general braxton bragg was one of many southerners who faced economic hardship.
he found that all all was lost except my debts.
in south carolina mary boykin chesnut wrote in her diary about the isolation she experienced after the war.
we are shut in here all rr s railroads destroyed bridges gone.
we are cut off from the world.
lincoln s plan president abraham lincoln wanted to reunite the nation as quickly and painlessly as possible.
he had proposed a plan for readmitting the southern states even before the war ended.
called the ten percent plan it offered southerners amnesty or official pardon for all illegal acts supporting the rebellion.
to receive amnesty southerners had to do two things.
they had to swear an oath of loyalty to the united states.
they also had to agree that slavery was illegal.
once 10 percent of voters in a state made these pledges they could form a new government.
the state then could be readmitted to the union.
louisiana quickly elected a new state legislature under the ten percent plan.
other southern states that had been occupied by union troops soon followed louisiana back into the united states.
wade davis bill some politicians argued that congress not the president should control the southern states return to the union.
they believed that congress had the power to admit new states.
also many republican members of congress thought the ten percent plan did not go far enough.
a senator from michigan expressed their views.
the people of the north are not such fools as to turn around and say to the traitors all you have to do to return is take an oath that henceforth you will be true to the government.
senator jacob howard quoted in reconstruction america s unfinished revolution 1863 1877 by eric foner two republicans senator benjamin wade and representative henry davis had an alternative to lincoln s plan.
following procedures of the wade davis bill a state had to meet two conditions before it could rejoin the union.
first it had to ban slavery.
second a majority of adult males in the state had to take the loyalty oath.
war destroyed richmond virginia once the capital of the confederacy.
academic vocabulary procedure a series of steps taken to accomplish a task under the wade davis bill only southerners who swore that they had never supported the confederacy could vote or hold office.
in general the bill was much stricter than the ten percent plan.
its provisions would make it harder for southern states to rejoin the union quickly.
president lincoln therefore refused to sign the bill into law.
he thought that few southern states would agree to meet its requirements.
he believed that his plan would help restore order more quickly.
reading check contrasting how was the ten percent plan different from the wade davis bill.
freedom for african americans one thing republicans agreed on was abolishing slavery.
the emancipation proclamation had freed slaves only in areas that had not been occupied by union forces not in the border states.
many people feared that the federal courts might someday declare the proclamation unconstitutional.
slavery ends on january 31 1865 at president lincoln s urging congress proposed the thirteenth amendment.
this amendment made slavery illegal throughout the united states.
554 chapter 17 the amendment was ratified and took effect on december 18 1865.
when abolitionist william lloyd garrison heard the news he declared that his work was now finished.
he called for the american anti slavery society to break up.
not all abolitionists agreed that their work was done however.
frederick douglass insisted that slavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot vote.
freedom brought important changes to newly freed slaves.
many couples held ceremonies to legalize marriages that had not been recognized under slavery.
many freedpeople searched for relatives who had been sold away from their families years earlier.
others placed newspaper ads seeking information about their children.
many women began to work at home instead of in the fields.
still others adopted children of dead relatives to keep families together.
church members established voluntary associations and mutual aid societies to help those in need.
now that they could travel without a pass many freedpeople moved from mostly white counties to places with more african americans.
other freedpeople traveled simply to test their new freedom of movement.
a south carolina woman explained this need.
i must go if i stay here i ll never know i m free.
for most former slaves freedom to travel was just the first step on a long road toward equal rights and new ways of life.
adults took new last names and began to insist on being called mr or mrs as a sign of respect rather than by their first names or by nicknames.
freedpeople began to demand the same economic and political rights as white citizens.
henry adams a former slave argued that if i cannot do like a white man i am not free.
forty acres to farm.
many former slaves wanted their own land to farm.
near the end of the civil war union general william tecumseh sherman had issued an order to break up plantations in coastal south carolina and georgia.
he wanted to divide the land into 40 acre plots and give them to former slaves as compensation for their forced labor before the war.
many white planters refused to surrender their land.
some freedpeople pointed out that it was only fair that they receive some of this land because their labor had made the plantations prosper.
in the end the u s government returned the land to its original owners.
at this time many freedpeople were unsure about where they would live what kind of work they would do and what rights they had.
freedoms that were theirs by law were difficult to enforce.
reconstruction 55 freedmen s bureau in 1865 congress established the freedmen s bureau an agency providing relief for freed people and certain poor people in the south.
the bureau had a difficult job.
at its high point about 900 agents served the entire south.
bureau commissioner oliver o howard eventually decided to use the bureau s limited budget to distribute food to the poor and to provide education and legal help for freed people.
the bureau also helped african american war veterans.
the freedmen s bureau played an important role in establishing more schools in the south.
laws against educating slaves meant that most freedpeople had never learned to read or write.
before the war ended however northern groups such as the american missionary association began providing books and teachers to african americans.
the teachers were mostly women who were committed to helping freedpeople.
one teacher said of her students i never before saw children so eager to learn.
it is wonderful how they can have so great a desire for knowledge and such a capacity for attaining reaching it.
after the war some freedpeople organized their own education efforts.
for example freedmen s bureau agents found that some african americans had opened schools in abandoned buildings.
many white southerners continued to believe that african americans should not be educated.
despite opposition by 1869 more than 150 000 african american students were attending more than 3 000 schools.
the freedmen s bureau also helped establish a number of universities for african americans including howard and fisk universities.
students quickly filled the new classrooms.
working adults attended classes in the evening.
african americans hoped that education would help them to understand and protect their rights and to enable them to find better jobs.
both black and white southerners benefited from the effort to provide greater access to education in the south.
reading check analyzing how did the freedmen s bureau help reform education in the south.

the bureau assisted people by providing supplies and medical what role did the freedmen s bureau play during reconstruction.
fww rui establishing schools supervising contracts between freedpeople and employers taking care of lands abandoned or captured during the war j 1 i 1 president johnson s reconstruction plan while the freedmen s bureau was helping african americans the issue of how the south would rejoin the union was unresolved.
soon however lincoln s dream of peacefully reuniting the country ended tragically.
a new president on the evening of april 14 1865 president lincoln and his wife attended a play at ford s theater in washington d c during the play john wilkes booth a southerner who opposed lincoln s policies sneaked into the president s theater box and shot him.
lincoln was rushed to a boardinghouse across the street where he died early the next morning.
lincoln his leadership remembered for its honesty deep intelligence and high morals became a symbol for the nation of the struggle of the civil war.
vice president andrew johnson was sworn into office quickly.
reconstruction had now become his responsibility.
he would have to win the trust of a nation shocked at its leader s death.
johnson s plan was similar to lincoln s.
however he decided that wealthy southerners and former confederate officials would need a presidential pardon to receive amnesty.
johnson shocked radical republicans by eventually pardoning more than 7 000 people by 1866.
new state governments johnson was a democrat whom republicans had put on the ticket to appeal to the border states.
a former slaveholder he was a stubborn man who would face a hostile congress.
johnson offered a mild program for setting up new southern state governments.
first he appointed a temporary governor for each state.
then he required that the states revise their constitutions.
next voters elected state and federal representatives.
the new state government had to declare that secession was illegal.
it also had to ratify the thirteenth amendment and refuse to pay confederate debts.
by the end of 1865 all the southern states except texas had created new governments.
johnson approved them all and declared that the united states was restored.
newly elected representatives came to washington from each reconstructed southern state.
however republicans complained that many new representatives had been leaders of the confederacy.
congress therefore refused to readmit the southern states into the union.
clearly the nation was still divided.

opposition to president johnson in 1866 congress continued to debate the rules for restoring the union.
meanwhile new state legislatures approved by president johnson had already begun passing laws to deny african americans civil rights.
this is a white man s government and intended for white men only declared governor benjamin f perry of south carolina.
black codes soon every southern state passed black codes or laws that greatly limited the freedom of african americans.
they required african americans to sign work contracts creating working conditions similar to those under slavery.
in most southern states any african americans who could not prove they were employed could be arrested.
their punishment might be one year of work without pay.
african americans were also prevented from owning guns.
in addition they were not allowed to rent property except in cities.
the black codes alarmed many americans.
as one civil war veteran asked if you call this freedom what do you call slavery.
558 chapter 17 african americans organized to oppose the codes.
one group sent a petition to officials in south carolina.
we simply ask that the same laws which govern white men shall govern black men that in short we be dealt with as others are in equity equality and justice petition from an african american convention held in south carolina quoted in there is a river the black struggle for freedom in america by vincent harding radical republicans the black codes angered many republicans.
they thought the south was returning to its old ways.
most republicans were moderates who wanted the south to have loyal state governments.
they also believed that african americans should have rights as citizens.
they hoped that the government would not have to force the south to follow federal laws.
radical republicans on the other hand took a harsher stance.
they wanted the federal government to force change in the south.
like the moderates they thought the black codes were cruel and unjust.
the radicals however wanted the federal government to be much more involved in reconstruction.
they feared that too many southern leaders remained loyal to the former confederacy and would not enforce the new laws.

military governments established for an indefinite period would have divided the people into the vanquishers and the vanquished and would have envenomed made poisonous hatred rather than have restored affection andrew johnson thaddeus stevens believed that congress had the power to treat the south as conquered territory.
the future condition of the conquered power depends on the will of the conqueror.
they must come in as new states or remain as conquered provinces.
congress is the only power that can act in the matter thaddeus stevens skill.
identifying points of view how did johnson s and stevens s views on the south differ.
of pennsylvania and charles sumner of massachusetts were the leaders of the radical republicans.
a harsh critic of president johnson stevens was known for his honesty and sharp tongue.
he wanted economic and political justice for both african americans and poor white southerners.
sumner had been a strong opponent of slavery efore the civil war.
he continued to argue tirelessly for african americans civil rights including the right to vote and the right to fair laws.
both stevens and sumner believed that president johnson s reconstruction plan was a failure.
although the radicals did not control congress they began to gain support among moderates when president johnson ignored criticism of the black codes.
stevens believed the federal government could not allow racial inequality to survive.
academic vocabulary principle basic belief rule or law reading check comparing and contrasting how were radical republicans and moderate republicans similar and different.
fourteenth amendment urged on by the radicals in 1866 congress proposed a new bill.
it would give the freed men s bureau more powers.
the law would allow the freedmen s bureau to use military courts to try people accused of violating african americans rights.
the bill s supporters hoped that these courts would be fairer than local courts in the south.
johnson versus congress surprising many members of congress johnson vetoed the freedmen s bureau bill.
he insisted that congress could not pass any new laws until the southern states were represented in congress.
johnson also argued that the freedmen s bureau was unconstitutional.
republicans responded with the civil rights act of 1866.
this act provided african americans with the same legal rights as white americans.
president johnson once again used his veto power.
he argued that the act gave too much power to the federal government.
he also rejected the principle of equal 560 chapter 17 rights for african americans.
congress however overrode johnson s veto.
many republicans worried about what would happen when the southern states were readmitted.
fearing that the civil rights act might be overturned the republicans proposed the fourteenth amendment in the summer of 1866.
the fourteenth amendment included the following provisions.
it defined all people born or naturalized within the united states except native americans as citizens.
it guaranteed citizens the equal protection of the laws.
it said that states could not deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law.
it banned many former confederate officials from holding state or federal offices.
it made state laws subject to federal court review.
it gave congress the power to pass any laws needed to enforce it.
1866 elections president johnson and most democrats opposed the fourteenth amendment.
as a result civil rights for african americans became a key issue in the 1866 congressional elections.
to help the democrats johnson traveled around the country defending his reconstruction plan.
johnson s speaking tour was a disaster.
it did little to win votes for the democratic party.
johnson even got into arguments with people in the audiences of some of his speaking engagements.
two major riots in the south also hurt johnson s campaign.
on may 1 1866 a dispute in memphis tennessee took place between local police and black union soldiers.
the dispute turned into a three day wave of violence against african americans.
about three months later another riot took place during a political demonstration in new orleans.
during that dispute 34 african americans and three white republicans were killed.
reaping check j summarizing what issue did the fourteenth amendment address and how did it affect the congressional elections of 1866.
congress takes control of reconstruction the 1866 elections gave the republican party a commanding two thirds majority in both the house and the senate.
this majority gave the republicans the power to override any presidential veto.
in addition the republicans became united as the moderates joined with the radicals.
together they called for a new form of reconstruction.
reconstruction acts in march 1867 congress passed the first of several reconstruction acts.
these laws divided the south into five districts.
a u s military commander controlled each district.
the military would remain in control of the south until the southern states rejoined the union.
to be readmitted a state had to write a new state constitution supporting the fourteenth amendment.
finally the state had to give african american men the right to vote.
thaddeus stevens was one of the new reconstruction acts most enthusiastic supporters.
he spoke in congress to defend the acts.
have not loyal blacks quite as good a right to choose rulers and make laws as rebel whites.
every man no matter what his race or color.
the reconstruction amendments facf jiblll j n i i c v snffj has an equal right to justice honesty and fair play with every other man and the law should secure him those rights.
thaddeus stevens quoted in sources of the american republic edited by marvin meyers et al.
president on trial president johnson strongly disagreed with stevens.
he argued that african americans did not deserve the same treatment as white people.
the reconstruction acts he said used powers not granted to the federal government or any one of its branches.
knowing that johnson did not support its reconstruction policies congress passed a law limiting his power.
this law prevented the president from removing cabinet officials without senate approval.
johnson quickly broke the law by firing edwin stanton the secretary of war.
for the first time in united states history the house of representatives responded by voting to impeach the president.
impeachment is the process used by a legislative body to bring charges of wrongdoing against a public official.
the next step under article i of the constitution was a trial in the senate.
a two thirds majority was required to find johnson guilty and remove him from office.
although johnson was unpopular with republicans some of them believed he was being judged unfairly.
others did not trust the president pro tempore of the senate benjamin wade.
he would become president if johnson were removed from office.
by a single vote senate republicans failed to convict johnson.

he had no political experience but supported the congressional reconstruction plan.
he ran under the slogan let us have peace.
shortly after grant was nominated congress readmitted seven southern states alabama arkansas florida georgia louisiana north carolina and south carolina.
tennessee had already been readmitted in 1866.
under the terms of readmission these seven states approved the fourteenth amendment.
they also agreed to let african american men vote.
however white southerners used violence to try to keep african americans away from the polls.
despite such tactics hundreds of thousands of african americans voted for grant and the party of lincoln.

also some radical republicans argued that it was not fair that many northern states still had laws preventing african americans from voting.
after all every southern state was required to grant suffrage to african american men.
in 1869 congress proposed the fifteenth amendment which gave african american men the right to vote.
abolitionist william lloyd garrison praised what he saw as this wonderful quiet sudden transformation of four millions of human beings from the auction block to the ballot box.

however many farmers like the family above wentthrough i hard times.
reconstruction governments after grant became president in 1869 the republicans seemed stronger than ever.
they controlled most southern governments partly because of the support of african american voters.
however republican officeholders were unpopular with white southerners.
carpetbaggers and scalawags some of these office holders were northern born republicans who had moved south after the war.
many white southerners called them carpetbaggers.
supposedly they had rushed south carrying all their possessions in bags made from carpeting.
many southerners resented these northerners accusing them often unfairly of trying to profit from reconstruction.
because the south needed both physical and economic rebuilding there were many business opportunities.
northerners who had not been devastated by the war had more money to invest and could therefore profit from these opportunities.
564 chapter 17 1.
location which state had the most african american state legislators.
region which states had the least african american representation.
southern democrats cared even less for white southern republicans.
they referred to them as scalawags or greedy rascals.
democrats believed that these southerners had betrayed the south by voting for the republican party.
many southern republicans were small farmers who had supported the union during the war.
others like mississippi governor james alcorn were former members of the whig party.
they preferred to become republicans rather than join the democrats.
african american leaders african americans were the largest group of southern republican voters.
during reconstruction more than 600 african americans won election to state legislatures.
some 16 of these politicians were elected to congress.
other african americans held local offices in counties throughout the south.
african american politicians came from many backgrounds.
hiram revels was born free in north carolina and went to college in illinois.
he became a methodist minister and served as a chaplain in the union army.
in 1870 after many debates at the national and state levels about his eligibility and citizenship revels became the first african american in the u s senate.
he took over the seat previously held by confederate president jefferson davis.
revels held a moderate view of the readmission of former confederates.
education and employment for african americans were two of his top priorities.
revels helped display the ability of african americans to take part in governing.
unlike revels blanche k bruce grew up in slavery in virginia.
bruce became an important republican in mississippi and served one term as a u s senator.
he worked to integrate the military while in office.
after completing his term he became the first president of alcorn university.
reconstructed state governments the new reconstruction state governments made policies that increased civil and voting rights for african americans.
they passed laws that ensured african americans were allowed to vote in every community.
in focus on reading what might you predict would change with african americans serving as elected representatives.
reconstruction 56.
many places however there was still resistance by whites.
because former confederates could usually not vote they struggled to maintain political influence.
reconstruction governments provided money for many new programs and organizations in the south.
lawmakers hoped that these organizations would help southerners adjust to the new economic and social structure.
they helped to establish some of the first state funded public school systems in the south.
they also built new hospitals prisons and orphanages and passed laws prohibiting discrimination against african americans.
many of these programs improved the lives of african americans and whites in the south and gave people economic opportunities and access to political offices.
however racism and the dramatically different culture of groups led to conflicting expectations and sometimes tensions led to violence.
southern states under republican control spent large amounts of money.
they aided the construction of railroads bridges and public buildings.
these improvements were intended to help the southern economy recover from the war.
to get the money for these projects the reconstruction governments raised taxes and issued bonds.
although some people protested the increased taxes the improved infrastructure helped the south to increase its trade and production capabilities.
reading check summarizing what reforms did reconstruction state governments carry out.
ku klux kian as more african americans took office resistance to reconstruction increased among white southerners.
democrats claimed that the reconstruction governments were corrupt illegal and unjust.
they also disliked having federal soldiers stationed in their states.
many white southerners disapproved of african american officeholders.
one democrat noted a white man s government is the most popular rallying cry we have.
in 1866 a group of white southerners in tennessee created the ku klux kian.
this secret society opposed civil rights particularly suffrage for african americans.
the kian used reading check.
violence and tenor against african americans.
the group s membership grew rapidly as it spread throughout the south.
kian members wore robes and disguises to hide their identities.
they attacked and even murdered african americans white republican voters and public officials usually at night.
local governments did little to stop the violence.
many officials feared the kian or were sympathetic to its activities.
in 1870 and 1871 the federal government took action.
congress passed laws that made it a federal crime to interfere with elections or to deny citizens equal protection under the law.
within a few years the kian was no longer an organized threat.
but groups of whites continued to assault african americans and republicans throughout the 1870s.
drawing conclusions why did southerners join the ku klux kian.
reconstruction ends the violence of the ku klux kian was not the only challenge to reconstruction.
republicans slowly lost control of southern state governments to the democratic party.
the general amnesty act of 1872 allowed former confederates except those who had held high ranks to serve in public office.
many of these former confederates most of whom were democrats were soon elected to southern governments.
the republican party also began losing its power in the north.
although president grant was re elected in 1872 financial and political scandals in his administration upset voters.
in his first term a gold buying scheme in which grant s cousin took a leading role led to a brief crisis on the stock market called black friday.
during his second term his personal secretary was involved in the whiskey ring scandal in which whiskey distillers and public officials worked together to steal liquor taxes from the federal government.
furthermore people blamed republican policies for the panic of 1873.
panic of 1873 this severe economic downturn began in september 1873 when jay cooke and company a major investor in railroads and the largest financier of the union s civil war effort declared bankruptcy.
the company had lied about the value of land along the side of the northern pacific railroad that it owned and was trying to sell.
when the truth leaked out the company failed.
the failure of such an important business sent panic through the stock market and investors began selling shares of stock more rapidly than people wanted to buy them.
companies had to buy their shares back from the investors.
soon 89 of the nation s 364 railroads had failed as well.
the failure of almost 18 000 other businesses followed within two years leaving the nation in an economic crisis.
by 1876 unemployment had risen to 14 percent with an estimated 2 million people out of work.
the high unemployment rate set off numerous strikes and protests around the nation many involving railroad workers.
in 1874 the democrats gained control of the house of representatives.
northerners were becoming less concerned about southern racism and more concerned about their financial well being.
election of 1876 republicans could tell that northern support for reconstruction was fading.
voters attention was shifting to economic problems.
in 1874 the republican party lost control of the house of representatives to the democrats.
the republicans in congress managed to pass one last civil rights law.
the civil rights act of 1875 guaranteed african americans equal rights in public places such as theaters and public transportation.
but as americans became increasingly worried about economic problems and government corruption the republican party began to abandon reconstruction.
reconstruction 56 plessy v ferguson 1896 background of the case in 1892 homer plessy took a seat in the whites only car of a train in louisiana.
he was arrested put on trial and convicted of violating louisiana s segregation law.
plessy argued that the louisiana law violated the thirteenth amendment and denied him the equal protection of the law the court s ruling the court ruled that the louisiana separate but equal law was constitutional.
the court s reasoning the court stated that the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments did not apply.
the court decided that the case had nothing to do with the abolition of slavery mentioned in the thirteenth amendment.
the justices also ruled that the fourteenth amendment was not designed to eliminate social barriers to equality between the races only political barriers.
justice john marshall harlan disagreed with the court s ruling.
in a dissenting opinion he wrote that in respect of civil rights all citizens are equal before the law.
why it matters plessy was important because it approved the idea of separate but equal facilities for people based on race.
the doctrine of separate but equal led to segregation in trains buses schools restaurants and many other social institutions.
i the separate but equal doctrine led to unequal treatment of minority groups for decades.
it was finally struck down by another supreme court ruling brown v board of education in 1954.
analysis skill analyzing information 1.
why did the court reject plessy s arguments.
why was plessyv.
ferguson an important supreme court case.
republicans selected ohio governor rutherford b hayes as their 1876 presidential candidate.
he believed in ending federal support of the reconstruction governments.
the democrats nominated new york governor samuel j tilden.
during the election democrats in the south again used violence at the polls to keep republican voters away.
the election between hayes and tilden was close.
tilden appeared to have won.
republicans challenged the electoral votes in oregon and three southern states.
a special commission of members of congress and supreme court justices was appointed to settle the issue.
the commission narrowly decided to give all the disputed votes to hayes.
hayes thus won the presidency by one electoral vote.
in the compromise of 1877 the democrats agreed to accept hayes s victory.
in return they wanted all remaining federal troops removed from the south.
they also asked for funding for internal improvements and the appointment of a southern democrat to the president s cabinet.
shortly after he took office in 1877 president hayes removed the last of the federal troops from the south.
redeemers gradually democrats regained control of state governments in the south.
in each state they moved quickly to get rid of the reconstruction reforms.
democrats who brought their party back to power in the south were called redeemers.
they came from a variety of backgrounds.
for instance u s senator john t morgan of alabama was a former general in the confederate army.
newspaper editor henry grady of georgia was interested in promoting southern industry.
redeemers wanted to reduce the size of state government and limit the rights of african americans.
they lowered state budgets and got rid of a variety of social programs.
the redeemers cut property taxes and cut public funding for schools.
they also succeeded in limiting african americans civil rights.
african americans rights restricted redeemers set up the poll tax in an effort to deny the vote to african americans.
the poll tax was a special tax people had to pay before they could vote.
568 chapter 17 some states also targeted african american voters by requiring them to pass a literacy test.
a so called grandfather clause written into law affected men whose fathers or grandfathers could vote before 1867.
in those cases a voter did not have to pay a poll tax or pass a literacy test.
as a result almost every white man could escape the voting restrictions.
redeemer governments also introduced legal segregation the forced separation of whites and african americans in public places.
jim crow laws laws that enforced segregation became common in southern states in the 1880s.
african americans challenged jim crow laws in court.
in 1883 however the u s supreme court ruled that the civil rights act of 1875 was unconstitutional.
the court also ruled that the fourteenth amendment applied only to the actions of state governments.
this ruling allowed private individuals and businesses to practice segregation.
ferguson in 1896 the u s supreme court returned to the issue of segregation.
when homer plessy an african american refused to leave the whites only louisiana train car he was riding on he was arrested and accused of breaking a state law requiring separate cars for blacks and whites.
plessy sued the railroad company and lost.
his lawyers argued that the law violated his right to equal treatment under the four teenth amendment.
he then appealed to the u s supreme court.
the supreme court ruled against plessy in plessy v ferguson.
segregation was allowed said the court if separate but equal facilities were provided.
among the justices only john marshall harlan disagreed with the court s decision.
he explained his disagreement in a dissenting opinion in the eye of the law there is in the country no superior dominant controlling ruling class of citizens our constitution is color blind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.
in respect of civil rights all citizens are equal before the law john marshall harlan quoted in plessyv.
ferguson a brief history with documents edited by brook thomas despite harlan s view segregation became widespread across the country.
african americans were forced to use separate public schools libraries and parks.
when they existed these facilities were usually of poorer quality than those created for whites.
in practice these so called separate but equal facilities were separate and unequal.
neither congress nor the president would make significant actions to overturn the doctrine until the 1900s.
farming in the south few african americans in the south could afford to buy or even rent farms.
moving west also was costly.
many african americans therefore remained on plantations.
others tried to make a living in the cities.
hopes raised and denied slavery no rights forced labor i no freedom of movement i without permission i family members sold away from one another no representation in government freedom slavery banned free to work for wages could move and live anywhere many families reunited could serve in political office rights denied sharecropping system putin place ability to vote and hold office restricted white leadership regained control of southern state governments reconstruction 5 pressure from banks and others to keep raising cotton.
african americans who stayed on plantations often became part of a system known as sharecropping or sharing the crop.
land owners provided the land tools and supplies and sharecroppers provided the labor.
at harvest time the sharecropper usually had to give most of the crop to the land owner.
whatever remained belonged to the sharecropper.
many sharecroppers hoped to save enough money from selling their share of the crops to one day be able to buy a farm.
unfortunately only a few ever succeeded.
instead most sharecroppers lived in a cycle of debt.
when they needed food clothing or supplies most families had to buy goods on credit because they had little cash.
when sharecroppers sold their crops they hoped to be able to pay off these debts.
however bad weather poor harvests or low crop prices often made this dream impossible.
sharecroppers usually grew cotton one of the south s most important cash crops.
when too many farmers planted cotton however the supply became excessive.
as a result the price per bale of cotton dropped.
many farmers understood the drawbacks of planting cotton.
however farmers felt reading check finding main ideas how were african americans rights restricted.
rebuilding industry the southern economy suffered through cycles of good and bad years as cotton prices went up and down.
some business leaders hoped industry would strengthen the southern economy and create a new south.
southern industry henry grady an atlanta newspaper editor was a leader of the new south movement.
the new south presents a diversified varied industry that meets the complex needs of this complex age he wrote.
grady and his supporters felt that with its cheap and abundant labor the south could build factories and provide a workforce for them.
the most successful industrial development in the south involved textile production.
businesspeople built textile mills in many small towns to produce cotton fabric.
many 570 chapter 17 the new south is stirred with the breath of a new life.
henry grady atlanta rebuilt quickly after the war becoming a leading railroad and industrial center.
newspaper editor henry grady gave stirring speeches about the need for industry in the south.
he became one of the best known spokesmen of the new south why might grady point to atlanta as a model for economic change.
people from rural areas came to work in the mills but african americans were not allowed to work in most of them.
southern mill life work in the cotton mills appealed to farm families who had trouble making ends meet.
as one mill worker explained it was a necessity to move and get a job rather than depend on the farm.
recruiters sent out by the mills promised good wages and steady work.
entire families often worked in the same cotton mill.
mills employed large numbers of women and children.
many children started working at about the age of 12.
some children started working at an even earlier age.
women did most of the spinning and were valued workers.
however few women had the opportunity to advance within the company.
many mill workers were proud of the skills they used but they did not enjoy their work.
one unhappy worker described it as the same thing over and over again.
the more you do the more they want done.
workers often labored 12 hours a day six days a week.
cotton dust and lint filled the air causing asthma and an illness known as brown lung disease.
fast moving machinery caused injuries and even deaths.
despite the long hours and dangerous working conditions wages remained low.
however mill work did offer an alternative to farming.
reading check finding main ideas what did southern business leaders hope industry would do.
reconstruction in the north although most federal reconstruction policies were designed to reform the south they affected groups in the north as well.
there were many groups who worked to advance their own rights and interests during this time.
women and northern african americans the radical republicans passed many federal laws that required southern states to allow african american men to vote.
they based their cause on the ideal of equality found in the declaration of independence and the constitution.
women s suffragists began using these same arguments to support their own suffrage.
wyoming and utah granted women the vote in 1869 but their motivations were not just to ensure equal rights for women.
wyoming leaders hoped to attract more women residents while utahans hoped to counteract the rising number of non mormon voters.
african americans in the north faced less social discrimination than they did in the south but still faced racism and segregation.
in response some state governments passed laws that made segregation illegal.
some integrated their school systems.
still most states upheld the principle of separate but equal facilities.
a changing economy during the war and reconstruction the economy of the north and the west grew rapidly.
manufacturing commerce and rail transportation generated tremendous reconstruction 57 as the economy grew unions such as the united mine workers of america grew in membership and influence.
large companies grew by buying smaller companies and railroads made huge profits transporting goods and people.
tax revenue increased as well and governments were able to provide more services and make more investments.
between 1865 and 1873 almost 3 million immigrants arrived in the united states.
they provided a new pool of labor for the growing industrial economy.
the number of labor unions increased and they began to push for policies that protected workers.
reformers pressed for eight hour workday and fair pay laws.
in addition the increase in commercial and trading businesses led to a shift in the make up of the working class.
it now included a majority of professionals and white collar workers.
eventually the focus of the republican party began to move away from civil rights for african americans and toward reducing government corruption.
the acceptance of the compromise of 1877 signaled the end of the republican focus on reforming racial politics in the south.

building background before the civil war most americans thought of the great plains and other western lands as the great american desert.
but in the years following the war the u s population grew and settlement spread throughout the west new lives on the plains the frontier changed dramatically as more and more people moved westward.
settlers built homes fenced off land and set up ranches and farms.
miners ranchers and farmers remade the landscape of the west as they adapted to their new surroundings.
the geography of the west was further changed by the development and expansion of a large and successful railroad industry that moved the region s natural resources and goods to eastern markets.
in 1862 congress passed two important land grant acts that helped open the west to settlers.
the homestead act gave government owned land to small farmers.
any adult who was a u s citizen or planned to become one could receive 160 acres of land.
in exchange homesteaders promised to build a house live on the land for five years and grow crops.
after five years the homesteader could file for his or her title to the land.
former union soldiers could get land even more quickly.
people could also buy the land after six months if they had the money to do so.
the system of dividing the land into lots was the same system of townships sections and acres that was authorized by the land ordinance of 1785.
the u s government encouraged the settlement of the great plains.
farms ranches and railroads were the basis of the economy that developed on the plains.
economic challenges led to the creation of farmers political groups.
native americans and the u s government came into conflict over land in the west.
the great plains provided new opportunities for americans but also caused conflict with native americans in the region.

the morrill act granted more than 17 million acres of federal land to the states.
the act required each state to sell this land and use the money to build colleges to teach agriculture and engineering.
eventually these 69 universities were the first in most western states and still exist today.
iowa state purdue and texas a m are all land grant colleges.
in 1890 a second morrill act was passed that required states to also provide university facilities for african americans.
the acts made living in western states much more attractive to people and created more educated voters and leaders.
the promise of land and a life free of discrimination drew a large number of african americans to the west.
in 1879 some 20 000 reading check to 40 000 southern african americans moved to kansas.
known as exodusters these african americans made an exodus or mass departure from the south.
a number of black communities soon developed.
western homesteads also were attractive to immigrants.
norwegian swedish danish german and czech immigrants formed many small communities on the great plains.
in addition many single women moved west.
the homestead act allowed unmarried women to own land which was unusual for the time.
analyzing information how did the government encourage westward expansion.
the plains economy most new residents planned to farm.
but farmers from the eastern and midwestern states as well as those from other countries were not accustomed to the growing conditions in the plains.
many struggled to survive.
they faced unique challenges.
weather could be extreme and destroy crops.
also the root filled sod or dirt beneath the plains grass was very tough.
the hard work of breaking up the sod earned plains farmers the nickname sodbusters.
the cattle industry also grew rapidly.
following the civil war a growing economy and population created a greater demand for beef in the east.
as the cattle business boomed ranchers faced more competition for use of the open range.
farmers began to buy the rangeland on the great plains where cattle had once grazed freely.
the railroad empire as more americans moved west the need to send goods and information between the east and west increased.
some wanted to build a transcontinental railroad a railroad that would cross the continent and connect the east to the west.
to encourage construe 571c chapter 17 tion congress passed the pacific railway acts in 1862 and 1864.
these acts gave railroad companies loans and large land grants that could be sold to pay for construction costs.
railroad companies sold this land to settlers which encouraged people to move west.
railroad companies also encouraged people to put their money into the railroad business which they did sometimes unwisely.
occasionally companies would lie about the value of the land they sold to hopeful settlers.
by the 1880s many small western railroads were deeply in debt.
despite such setbacks americans remained interested in railroad investments.
by 1890 there were about 164 000 more miles of track in operation than in 1865.
railroads had become one of the biggest industries in the united states.
railroad companies offered better shipping rates to large companies causing small farmers and businesses to complain about unfair business practices.
in february 1887 congress passed the interstate commerce act providing national regulation over trade between states and creating the interstate commerce commission to ensure fair railroad rates.
however the commission lacked power to enforce its regulations.
farm incomes fall by the 1880s mechanical farming became more common.
using machines farmers could work much more quickly on large fields with fewer workers.
farmers shipped their harvest east by train and from there overseas.
the great plains became known as the breadbasket of the world.
the combination of more farms and greater productivity led to the overproduction of some crops.
overproduction resulted in lower prices.
as profits decreased many farmers found it difficult to pay bills.
farmers who could not make their mortgage payments lost their farms and homes.
many of these homeless farmers became tenant farmers who worked land owned by others.
by 1880 one fourth of all farms were rented by tenants and the number continued to grow.
reading check finding main ideas what kinds of businesses supported the western economy.
clashes for the west as miners and settlers began crossing the great plains in the mid 1800s they pressured the federal government for more access to western lands.

the dawes general allotment act of 1887 tried to lessen traditional influences on indian society by making land ownership private rather than shared.
the act also promised but failed to deliver u s.
citizenship to native americans.
after breaking up reservation land and giving parcels to individuals the government sold the remaining acreage.
the act took about two thirds of indian land.
end of the frontier by 1870 only small portions of the great plains remained unsettled.
for most of the next two decades this land remained open range.

in a research report you find answers to v questions like these and share what you leam with your reader.
z narrowing the task the key i to a successful research report is picking a topic that is broad enough that you can find information but narrow enough that you can cover it in detail.
to narrow a subject focus on one aspect of the larger subject.
then think about whether that one aspect can be broken down into smaller parts.
here s an example of howto narrow a topic too broad civil war leaders less broad civil war generals narrower robert e lee s role in the civil war 1.
prewrite choosing a subject since you will spend a lot of time researching and writing about your topic pick one that interests you.
first think of several topics related to the civil war.
narrow your list to one topic by thinking about what interests you and where you can find information about the topic.
developing a research question a guiding question related to your topic will help focus your research.
for example here is a research question for the topic robert e lee s role in the civil war how did lee s decision to turn down the leadership of the union army affect the civil war.
the answer to this question becomes the thesis or the big idea of your report.
finding historical information use at least three sources of historical information besides your textbook.

the nation breaks apart 5 epilogue paegg america became a global power in the 1900s as u s troops fought in two world wars.
america since 1877 the united states of america is a very different place today than it was in 1877.
the nation is now bigger more powerful and more involved in world affairs.
it has changed from a nation where most people lived in small towns to one in which most people live in cities many with populations of more than 1 million people.
the nation is also a more democratic place today more americans have access to the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship than at any other time in the country s history.
despite these differences america faces many of the same challenges that it faced in 1877.
for example americans still debate questions about civil rights religion taxes and the role of government in their lives.
they also worry about the health of the environment children and the poor.
americans do not always agree on these issues.
but they do believe strongly in their right to debate and to disagree.
the debates are usually led by elected leaders from the two major political parties.
almost all of the elected representatives in the nation belong to either the republican or the democratic party.
the republican party tends to support more conservative policies such as low taxes and few regulations on businesses.
the democratic party on the other hand usually supports more liberal policies such as environmental protection and government supported social programs.
the two sides must work together towards compromises that work best for the entire nation.
one of the most important and heavily debated issues today is health care reform.
in an effort to extend health insurance coverage to all americans the democrats passed the affordable care act in 2010.
many republicans initially voted against it and the law has remained controversial.
different interest groups support each side of the debate.
the american medical association for example supports the law while the conservative group americans for prosperity opposes it.
the freedom to disagree and debate in peaceful and productive ways is an indication of the fundamental health of the nation.
america as a global power after the civil war the united states increasingly came into conflict with native americans in the west.
after the massacre at wounded knee in 1890 american settlers began moving west in even greater numbers.

the experience forever changed the united states.
america had stepped onto the world stage with its military and industrial might.
war tore europe apart again in the 1930s and 1940s during world war ii.
when japan attacked the united states at pearl harbor in late 1941 the nation entered the global struggle.
the civil rights era after the allied victory in world war ii millions of veterans returned home ready to start new lives.
they enrolled in college in record numbers settled into the nation s cities and new suburbs and started families.
soldiers who had fought on the side of democracy abroad also fought for democracy at home.
this was especially true of the nation s african american and mexican american soldiers.
their efforts to seek greater access to the rights of citizenship helped invigorate the civil rights movement.
they were joined in these efforts by americans from all walks of life people who believed that america worked best when the promises of freedom were open to all.
by the 1960s the push for greater civil rights had become a true social movement in america.
it was a grassroots effort on the part of ordinary americans to change both people s attitudes and federal laws.
cesar chavez for example led the fight to win more rights for migrant workers.
this movement for greater civil educational and political rights among racial and ethnic groups helped spur the women s rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s as well.
women began entering the workforce in larger numbers.
more enrolled in college and they began to have access to higher paying jobs.
linking pastto present 58 economic changes and challenges the u s economy has also changed dramatically since 1877.
changes in technology led to a second industrial revolution.
in the 1930s millions of americans were affected by the huge economic collapse known as the great depression.
after world war ii the u s economy recovered and the nation enjoyed a long period of prosperity.
many americans joined the middle class for the first time buying homes televisions and appliances and cars in record numbers.
since the 1970s the u s economy has had more ups and downs.
many american companies have moved their factories overseas where wages are lower causing hardship for many american workers.
technology and housing booms during the 1990s and early 2000s created prosperity.
in the late 2000s however a severe economic crisis emerged.
the banking system nearly collapsed houses and stocks plummeted in value and millions of people lost their jobs.
the economic downturn resulted in a series of protests by a movement known as occupy wall street.
groups met in cities across the nation to support the movement.
many economists think it may take a decade or more for the u s economy to fully recover.
immigration and democracy immigration has always been important to the united states.
since 1877 this strong tradition of immigration has continued.
during the 1900s people from every comer of the world came to america to settle.
these new immigrants were buddhists christians muslims and sikhs.
they came from latin america africa asia and europe.
many have moved away from their home countries in order to experience democracy and to take part in america s booming economy.
they came in search of a brighter future greater freedom and a chance to start their lives over again and they came to become americans.
the decade between 2000 and 2010 saw the highest number of immigrants in the nation s history nearly 14 million.
the united states has become a place with many different cultures living side by side.
our national identity includes aspects of a variety of races and cultures.
the nation s popular music for example is often based on an african american style of music called the blues.
we are recognized for our acceptance of different religions and our landscape is full of a variety of places of worship.
american food has been influenced by that of nations ranging from germany and italy to england and mexico.
america then and now in the years since 1877 the united states has faced challenges and experienced triumphs.
the threat of terrorism made clear by the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 remains an ongoing challenge.
another challenge came in 2005 when hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast and new orleans causing the city s levees to fail.
the disaster displaced hundreds of thousands of people and caused more than 80 billion in damage to the gulf coast region.
but for many americans especially those who toiled for the civil rights a triumph came with the election of barack obama our nation s first african american president in 2008.
challenges and triumphs alike highlight the importance of our nation s founding principles.
more than 200 years ago the founding fathers insisted that the united states was an experiment a new nation devoted to the possibility that the ideals of equality and freedom could be supported by democracy justice and the rule of law.
today just as then this experiment works best when americans exercise their rights seriously.

though a lower court ruled in dred scott v sandford 1857 background of the case born a slave in virginia dred scott moved with his slaveholder to the free state of illinois and then to the wisconsin territory.
after returning to the south scott sued for his freedom.
he claimed that because he had lived in a state that banned slavery he was no longer a slave.
the court s ruling the court ruled that african americans whether free or slave were not considered citizens of the united states and therefore had no right to sue in federal court.
it also decided that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional.
the court s reasoning chief justice roger b taney wrote in the majority opinion that the court did not believe that african americans were included in the constitution s definition of citizens and that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.
addressing a side issue in the case the opinion also stated that v congress could not outlaw slavery in the territories.
this struck down the missouri compromise which had made slavery illegal in territories north of the 3630 dividing line.
why it matters the dred scott case was seen as a setback to abolitionist ideas against slavery.
it reduced the status of free african americans and upheld the view of slaves as property without rights or protection under the constitution.
it also took from congress the power to ban slavery in its territories which would aid the spread of slavery in new states.
because of its pro slavery decision the reputation of the court suffered greatly in parts of the north.

scott s case reached the u s supreme court 11 years later in 1857.
the justices a majority of whom were from the south had three key issues before them.
first the court had to rule on whether scott was a citizen.
only citizens could sue in federal court.
second the court had to decide if his time living on free soil made him free.
third the court had to determine the constitutionality of prohibiting slavery in parts of the louisiana purchase.
the supreme court s ruling chief justice roger b taney taw nee himself from a slaveholding family in maryland wrote the majority opinion in the dred scott decision in march 1857.
first he addressed the issue of dred scott s citizenship.
taney said the nation s founders believed that african americans had no rights which a white man was bound to respect.
he therefore concluded that all african americans whether slave or free were not citizens under the u s constitution.
thus dred scott did not have the right to file suit in federal court.
taney also ruled on the other issues before the court.
as to whether scott s residence on free soil made him free taney flatly said it did not.
because scott had returned to the slave state of missouri the chief justice said his status as free or slave depended on the laws of missouri.
finally taney declared the missouri compromise restriction on slavery north of 3630 to be unconstitutional.
he pointed out that the fifth amendment said no one could be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law.
because slaves were considered property congress could not prohibit someone from taking slaves into a federal territory.
under this ruling congress had no right to ban slavery in any federal territory.
most white southerners cheered this decision.
it covers every question regarding slavery and settles it in favor of the south reported a georgia newspaper.
another newspaper the new orleans picayune assured its readers that the ruling put the whole basis of the republican organization under the ban of law.
the ruling stunned many northerners.
the republicans were particularly upset because their platform in 1856 had argued that congress held the right to ban slavery in the federal territories.
now the nation s highest court had ruled that congress did not have this right.
indeed some northerners feared that the spread of slavery would not stop with the federal territories.
illinois lawyer abraham lincoln warned that a future court ruling or what he called the next dred scott decision would prohibit states from banning slavery.

lincoln talked about the dred scott decision.
he said that african americans were entitled to all the natural rights listed in the declaration of independence specifically mentioning the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

hoping to cost lincoln votes douglas charged that lincoln thinks that the negro is his brother douglas also criticized lincoln for saying that the nation could not remain half slave and half free.
douglas said that the statement revealed a republican desire to make every state a free state.
this he warned would only lead to a dissolution destruction of the union and warfare between the north and the south.

meanwhile a new political party emerged.
the constitutional union party recognized no political principles other than the constitution of the country the union of the states and the enforcement of the laws.
their platform was a reaction against the idea of states rights.
members of this new party met in baltimore maryland and selected john bell of tennessee as their candidate.
