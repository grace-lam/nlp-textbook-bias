228 chapter 10 know nothing soap this illustrated advertising label for soap manufactured in boston alludes to the knownothing or nativist movement.
the indian depicted in the foreground and teepees and camp in the background symbolize the movements prejudice against new arrivals.
the library of congress the first was the native american association founded in 1837 which in 1845 became the native american party.
in 1850 it joined with other groups supporting nativism to form the supreme order of the star spangled banner whose demands included banning catholics or aliens from holding public office enacting more restrictive naturalization laws and establishing literacy tests for voting.
the order adopted a strict code of secrecy which included a secret password i know nothing ultimately members of the movement came to be known as the know nothings after the 1852 elections the know nothings created a new political organization that they called the american party.
it scored an immediate and astonishing success in the the know nothings elections of 1854.
the know nothings did well in pennsylvania and new york and actually won control of the state government in massachusetts.
outside the northeast however their progress was more modest.
after 1854 the strength of the know nothings declined and the party soon disappeared.
native american party transportation and communications revolutions just as the industrial revolution required an expanding population it also required an efficient system of transportation and communications.
the first half of the nineteenth century saw dramatic changes in both.
americas economic revolution 229 the canal age from 1790 until the 1820s the so called turnpike era the united states had relied largely on roads for internal transportation.
but roads alone were not adequate for the nations expanding needs.
and so in the 1820s and 1830s americans began to turn to other means of transportation as well.
the larger rivers became increasingly important as steamboats replaced the slow barges that had previously dominated water traffic.
the new riverboats carried the corn and wheat of northwestern farmers and the cotton and tobacco of southwestern planters to new orleans where oceangoing ships took the cargoes on to eastern ports or abroad.
but this roundabout river sea route satisfied neither western farmers nor eastern merchants who wanted a way to ship goods directly to the urban markets and ports of the atlantic coast.
new highways across the mountains provided a partial advantages of canals solution to the problem.
but the costs of hauling goods overland although lower than before were still too high for anything except the most compact and valuable merchandise.
and so interest grew in building canals.
the job of financing canals fell largely to the states.
new york was the first to act.
it had the natural advantage of a good land route between the hudson river and lake erie through the only break in the appalachian chain.
but the engineering tasks were still imposing.
the more than 350 mile long route was interrupted by high ridges and thick woods.

atla n tic ocean 100 mi 200 km canals in the northeast 1823 1860 the great success of the erie canal which opened in 1825 inspired decades of energetic canal building in many areas of the united states as this map illustrates.
but none of the new canals had anything like the impact of the original erie canal and thus none of new yorks competitors among them baltimore philadelphia and boston were able to displace it as the nations leading commercial center.
what form of transportation ultimately displaced the canals.
230 chapter 10 the erie canal was the greatest construction project americans had ever undertaken.
the canal itself was basically a simple ditch forty feet wide and four feet deep with towpaths along the banks for the horses or mules that were to draw the canal boats.
but its construction involved hundreds of difficult cuts and fills to enable the canal to pass through hills and over valleys stone aqueducts to carry it across streams and eighty eight locks of heavy masonry with great wooden gates to permit ascents and descents.
still the erie canal opened in october 1825 amid elaborate ceremonies and celebrations and traffic was soon so heavy that within about seven years tolls had repaid the entire cost of construction.
by providing a route to the great lakes the canal gave new york access to chicago and the growing markets of the west.
the erie canal also contributed to the decline of agriculture in new england.
now that it was so much cheaper for western farmers to ship their crops east people farming marginal land in the northeast found themselves unable to compete.
the system of water transportation extended farther when ohio and indiana inspired by the success of the erie canal provided water connections between lake erie and the ohio river.
these canals made it possible to ship goods by inland waterways all the way from new york to new orleans.
one of the immediate results of these new transportation routes was increased white settlement in the northwest because it was now easier for migrants to make the westward journey and to ship their goods back to eastern markets.
much increased westward migration of the western produce continued to go downriver to new orleans but an increasing proportion went east to new york.
and manufactured goods from throughout the east now moved in growing volume through new york and then to the west via the new water routes.
rival cities along the atlantic seaboard took alarm at new yorks access to and control over so vast a market largely at their expense.
but they had limited success in catching up.
boston its way to the hudson river blocked by the berkshire mountains did not even try to connect itself to the west by canal.
philadelphia baltimore richmond and charleston all aspired to build water routes to the ohio valley but never completed them.
some cities however saw opportunities in a different and newer means of transportation.
even before the canal age had reached its height the era of the railroad was beginning.
the erie canal the early railroads railroads played a relatively small role in the nations transportation system in the 1820s and 1830s but railroad pioneers laid the groundwork in those years for the great surge of railroad building in the midcentury.
eventually railroads became the primary transportation system for the united states as well as critical sites of development for innovations in technology and corporate organization.
railroads emerged from a combination of technological and entrepreneurial innovations the invention of tracks the creation of steam powered locomotives and the development of trains as public carriers of passengers and freight.
by 1804 both english and american inventors had experimented with steam engines for propelling land vehicles.
in 1820 john stevens ran a locomotive and cars around a circular track on his new jersey estate.
and in 1825 the stockton and darlington railroad in england became the first line to carry general traffic.
americas economic revolution 231 racing on the railroad peter cooper designed and built the first steam powered locomotives in america in 1830 for the baltimore and ohio railroad.
on august 28 of that year he raced his locomotive the tom thumb against a horse drawn railroad car.
this sketch depicts the moment when coopers engine overtook the horse drawn railroad car.
universal images group getty images american entrepreneurs quickly grew interested in the english experiment.
the first company to begin actual operations was the baltimore and ohio which opened a thirteen mile stretch of track in 1830.
in new york the mohawk and hudson began running trains along the sixteen miles between schenectady and the baltimore and ohio albany in 1831.
by 1836 more than a thousand miles of track had been laid in eleven states.
the triumph of the rails railroads gradually supplanted canals and all other forms of transport.
in 1840 the total railroad trackage of the country was under 3 000 miles.
by 1860 it was over 27 000 miles mostly in the northeast.
railroads even crossed the mississippi at several points by great iron bridges.
chicago eventually became the rail center of the west securing its place as the dominant city of that region.
the emergence of the great train lines diverted traffic from the main water routes the erie canal and the mississippi river.
by lessening the dependence of the west on the mississippi the railroads also helped weaken further the connection between the northwest and the south.
railroad construction required massive amounts of capital.
some came from private sources but much of it came from government funding.
state and local governments invested in railroads but even greater assistance came from importance of government funding the federal government in the form of public land grants.
by 1860 congress had allotted over 30 million acres to eleven states to assist railroad construction.
it would be difficult to exaggerate the impact of the rails on the american economy on american society even on american culture.
where railroads went towns ranches and farms grew up rapidly along their routes.
areas once cut off from markets during winter found that the railroad could transport goods to and from them year round.
most of all the railroads cut the time of shipment and travel.
in the 1830s traveling from new york to chicago by lake and canal took roughly three weeks.
by railroad in the 1850s the same trip took less than two days.
the railroads were much more than a fast and economically attractive form of transportation.
they were also a breeding ground for technological advances a key to the nations economic growth and the birthplace of the modern corporate form of organization.
they became a symbol of the nations technological prowess.
to many people railroads were the most visible sign of american advancement and greatness.

note the particularly extensive increase in mileage in the upper midwest known at the time as the old northwest.
note too the relatively smaller increase in railroad mileage in the south.
railroads forged a close economic relationship between the upper midwest and the northeast and weakened the midwests relationship with the south.
how did this contribute to the souths growing sense of insecurity within the union.
railroad growth 1850 1860 the telegraph what the railroad was to transportation the telegraph was to communication a dramatic advance over traditional methods and a symbol of national progress and technological expertise.
before the telegraph communication over great distances could be achieved only by direct physical contact.
that meant that virtually all long distance communication relied americas economic revolution 233 on the mail which traveled first on horseback and coach and later by railroad.
there were obvious disadvantages to this system not the least of which was the difficulty in coordinating the railroad schedules.
by the 1830s experiments with many methods of improving long distance communication had been conducted among them a procedure for using the sun and reflective devices to send light signals as far as 187 miles.
in 1832 samuel f b morse a professor of art with an interest in science began experimenting with a different system.
fascinated with the possibilities of electricity morse code morse set out to find a way to send signals along an electric cable.
technology did not yet permit the use of electric wiring to send reproductions of the human voice or any complex information.
but morse realized that electricity itself could serve as a communication device that pulses of electricity could themselves become a kind of language.
he experimented at first with a numerical code in which each number would represent a word on a list available to recipients.
gradually however he became convinced of the need to find a more universal telegraphic language and he developed what became the morse code in which alternating long and short bursts of electric current would represent individual letters.
the telegraph the telegraph provided rapid communication across the country and eventually across oceans for the first time.
samuel f b morse was one of a number of inventors who helped create the telegraph but he was the most commercially successful of the rivals.
the library of congress 234 chapter 10 in 1843 congress appropriated 30 000 for the construction of an experimental t elegraph line between baltimore and washington in may 1844 it was complete and morse succeeded in transmitting the news of james k polks nomination for the presidency over the wires.
by 1860 more than 50 000 miles of wire connected most parts of the country a year later the pacific telegraph with 3 595 miles of wire opened between new york and san francisco.
by then nearly all the independent lines had joined in one western union telegraph company organization the western union telegraph company.
the telegraph spread rapidly across europe as well and in 1866 the first transatlantic cable was laid allowing telegraphic communication between america and europe.
one of the first beneficiaries of the telegraph was the growing system of rails.
wires often ran alongside railroad tracks and telegraph offices were often located in railroad stations.
the telegraph allowed railroad operators to communicate directly with stations in cities small towns and even rural hamlets to alert them to schedule changes and warn them about delays and breakdowns.
among other things this new form of communication helped prevent accidents by alerting stations to problems that engineers in the past had to discover for themselves.
new technology and journalism another beneficiary of the telegraph was american journalism.
the wires delivered news in a matter of hours not days weeks or months as in the past across the country and the world.
where once the exchange of national and international news relied on the cumbersome exchange of newspapers by mail now it was possible for papers to share their reporting.
in 1846 newspaper publishers from around the nation formed the associated press to promote cooperative news gathering by wire.
other technological advances spurred the development of the american press.
in 1846 richard hoe invented the steam powered cylinder rotary press making it possible to print newspapers much more rapidly and cheaply than had been possible in the past.
among other things the rotary press spurred the dramatic growth of mass circulation newspapers.
newspaper circulation growth the new york sun the most widely circulated paper in the nation had 8 000 readers in 1834.
by 1860 its successful rival the new york herald benefiting from the speed and economies of production the rotary press made possible had a circulation of 77 000.
commerce and industry by the mid nineteenth century the united states had developed the beginnings of a modern capitalist economy and an advanced industrial capacity.
but the economy had developed along highly unequal lines benefiting some classes and some regions far more than others.
the expansion of business 1820 1840 american business grew rapidly in the 1820s and 1830s in part because of important innovations in management.
individuals or limited partnerships continued to operate most businesses and the dominant figures were still the great merchant capitalists who generally had sole ownership of their enterprises.
in some larger businesses however the rise of corporations individual merchant capitalist was giving way to the corporation.
americas economic revolution 235 corporations which had the advantage of combining the resources of a large number of shareholders began to develop particularly rapidly in the 1830s when some legal obstacles to their formation were removed.
previously a corporation could obtain a charter only by a special act of a state legislature by the 1830s states began passing general incorporation laws under which a group could secure a charter merely by paying a fee.
the laws also permitted a system of limited liability in which individual stockholders risked losing only the value of their own investment and not the corporations larger losses as in the past if the enterprise failed.
these changes made possible much larger manufacturing and business enterprises.
the emergence of the factory the most profound economic development in mid nineteenth century america was the rise of the factory.
before the war of 1812 most manufacturing took place within households or in small workshops.
later in the nineteenth century however new england textile manufacturers began using new water powered machines that allowed them to bring their operations together under a single roof.
this factory system as it came to be known soon penetrated the shoe industry and other industries as well.
between 1840 and 1860 american industry experienced particularly dramatic growth.
for the first time the value of manufactured goods was roughly dramatic industrial growth equal to that of agricultural products.
more than half of the approximately 140 000 manufacturing establishments in the country in 1860 including most of the larger enterprises were located in the northeast.
the northeast thus produced more than two thirds of the manufactured goods and employed nearly three quarters of the men and women working in manufacturing.
advances in technology even the most highly developed industries were still relatively immature.
american cotton manufacturers for example produced goods of coarse grade fine items continued to come from england.
but by the 1840s significant advances were occurring.
among the most important was in the manufacturing of machine tools the tools used to make machinery parts.
the government supported much of the research and development of machine tools often in connection with supplying the military.
for example a government armory in springfield massachusetts developed two important tools the turret lathe used for cutting screws and other metal parts american designed machine tools and the universal milling machine which replaced the hand chiseling of complicated parts and dies early in the nineteenth century.
the precision grinder which became critical to among other things the construction of sewing machines was designed in the 1850s to help the army produce standardized rifle parts.
by the 1840s the machine tools used in the factories of the northeast were already better than those in most european factories.
one important result of better machine tools was that the principle of interchangeable parts spread into many industries.
eventually interchangeability would revolutionize watch and clock making the manufacturing of locomotives the creation of steam engines and the making of many farm tools.
it would also help make possible bicycles sewing machines typewriters cash registers and eventually the automobile.
industrialization was also profiting from new sources of energy.
the production of coal most of it mined around pittsburgh in western pennsylvania leaped from 50 000 tons 236 chapter 10 in 1820 to 14 million tons in 1860.
the new power source which replaced wood and water power made it possible to locate mills away from running streams and thus permitted the wider expansion of the industry.
the great industrial advances owed much to american inventors.
in 1830 the number american inventors of inventions patented was 544 in 1860 it stood at 4 778.
several industries provide particularly vivid examples of how a technological innovation could produce major economic change.
in 1839 charles goodyear a new england hardware merchant discovered a method of vulcanizing rubber treating it to give it greater strength and elasticity by 1860 his process had found over 500 uses and had helped create a major american rubber industry.
in 1846 elias howe of massachusetts constructed a sewing machine isaac singer made improvements on it and the howe singer machine was soon being used in the manufacture of ready to wear clothing.
coal production soars rise of the industrial ruling class the merchant capitalists remained figures of importance in the 1840s.
in such cities as new york philadelphia and boston influential mercantile groups operated shipping lines to southern ports or dispatched fleets of trading vessels to europe and asia.
but merchant capitalism was declining by the middle of the century.
this was partly because british competitors were stealing much of americas export trade but mostly because there were greater opportunities for profit in manufacturing than in trade.
that was one reason why industries developed first in the northeast an affluent merchant class with the money and the will to finance them already existed there.
they supported the emerging industrial capitalists and soon became the new aristocrats of the northeast with far reaching economic and political influence.
men and women at work in the 1820s and 1830s factory labor came primarily from the native born population.
after 1840 the growing immigrant population became the most important new source of workers.
recruiting a native workforce recruiting a labor force was not an easy task in the early years of the factory system.
ninety percent of the american people in the 1820s still lived and worked on farms.
many urban residents were skilled artisans who owned and managed their own shops and the available unskilled workers were not numerous enough to meet industrys needs.
but dramatic improvements in agricultural production particularly in the midwest meant that each region no longer had to feed itself it could import the food it needed.
as a result rural people from relatively unprofitable farming areas of the east began leaving the land to work in the factories.
two systems of recruitment emerged to bring this new labor supply to the expanding textile mills.
one common in the mid atlantic states brought whole families from the farm to work together in the mill.
the second system common in massachusetts enlisted young women mostly farmers daughters in their late teens and early twenties.
it was lowell system known as the lowell or waltham system after the towns in which it first americas economic revolution 237 emerged.
many of these women worked for several years saved their wages and then returned home to marry and raise children.
others married men they met in the factories or in town.
most eventually stopped working in the mills and took up domestic roles instead.
labor conditions in these early years of the factory system hard as they often were remained significantly better than they would later become.
the lowell workers for example were well fed carefully supervised and housed in clean boardinghouses and dormitories which the factory owners maintained.
see consider the source handbook to lowell wages for the lowell workers were relatively generous by the standards of the time.
the women even published a monthly magazine the lowell offering.
yet even these relatively well treated workers found the transition from farm life to factory work difficult.
forced to live among strangers in a regimented environment many women had trouble adjusting to the nature of factory work.
however uncomfortable women may have found factory work they had few other options.
work in the mills was in many cases virtually the only alternative to returning to farms that could no longer support them.
the factory system of lowell did not in any case survive for long.
in the competitive textile market of the 1830s and 1840s manufacturers found it difficult to maintain the high living standards and reasonably attractive working conditions of before.
wages declined the hours of work lengthened the conditions of the boardinghouses deteriorated.
in 1834 mill workers in lowell organized a union the factory girls association which staged a strike to protest a 25 percent wage cut.
two years later the association struck again against a rent increase in the boardinghouses.
both strikes failed and a recession in 1837 virtually destroyed the organization.
eight years later the lowell women led by the militant sarah bagley created the female labor reform association sarah bagley which agitated for a ten hour day and for improvements in conditions in the mills.
the new association also asked state governments for legislative investigation of conditions in the mills.
by then however the character of the factory workforce was changing again lessening the urgency of their demands.
many mill girls were gradually moving into other occupations teaching domestic service or homemaking.
and textile manufacturers were turning to a less demanding labor supply immigrants.
the immigrant workforce the increasing supply of immigrant workers after 1840 was a boon to manufacturers and other entrepreneurs.
these new workers because of their growing numbers and their unfamiliarity with their new country had even less leverage than the women they displaced and thus they often experienced far worse working conditions.
poorly paid construction gangs made up increasingly of irish immigrants performed the heavy unskilled work on turnpikes canals and railroads.
many of them lived in flimsy shanties in grim conditions that endangered the health of their families and reinforced native prejudices toward the shanty irish.
irish workers began to predominate in the new england textile mills as well in the 1840s.
employers began paying piece rates rather than a daily wage and used other devices to speed up production and exploit the labor force more efficiently.
the factories themselves were becoming large noisy unsanitary and often dangerous places to work the average workday was extending to twelve often fourteen hours and wages were declining.
women and children whatever their skills earned less than most men.
co ns ider t he s o urc e handbook to lowell 1848 strict rules governed the working life of the young women who worked in the textile mills in lowell massachusetts in the first half of the nineteenth century.
equally strict rules regulated their time away from work what little leisure time they enjoyed in the company supervised boardinghouses in which they lived.
the excerpts from the handbook to lowell from 1848 that follow suggest the tight supervision under which the lowell mill girls worked and lived.
factory rules regulations to be observed by all persons employed in the factories of the hamilton manufacturing company.

the factory system and the artisan tradition factories were also displacing the trades of skilled artisans.
artisans were as much a part of the older republican vision of america as sturdy yeoman farmers.
independent craftsmen clung to a vision of economic life that was very different from that promoted by the new capitalist class.
the artisans embraced not just the idea of individual acquisitive success but also a sense of a moral community skilled artisans valued their independence their stability and their relative equality within their economic world.
240 chapter 10 some artisans made successful transitions into small scale industry.
but others found themselves unable to compete with the new factory made goods.
in the face of this competition skilled workers in cities such as philadelphia baltimore boston and new york formed societies for mutual aid.
during the 1820s and 1830s these craft societies began to combine on a citywide basis and set up central organizations known as trade unions.
in 1834 delegates from six cities founded the national trades union and in 1836 printers and cordwainers makers of high quality shoes and boots set up their own national craft unions.
hostile laws and hostile courts handicapped the unions as did the panic of 1837 and the depression that followed.
but some artisans managed to retain control over their productive lives.
fighting for control industrial workers made continuous efforts to improve their lots.
they tried with little success to persuade state legislatures to pass laws setting a maximum workday and regulating child labor.
their greatest legal victory came in massachusetts in 1842 when the commonwealth v hunt state supreme court in commonwealth v hunt declared that unions were lawful organizations and that the strike was a lawful weapon.
other state courts gradually accepted the principles of the massachusetts decision but employers continued to resist.
virtually all the early craft unions excluded women.
as a result women began establishing their own new protective unions in the 1850s.
like the male craft unions the female unions had little power in dealing with employers.
they did however serve an important role as mutual aid societies for women workers.
many factors combined to inhibit the growth of better working standards.
among the most important obstacles was the flood into the country of immigrant laborers who were usually willing to work for lower wages than native workers.
because they were so numerous manufacturers had little difficulty replacing disgruntled or striking workers with eager immigrants.
ethnic divisions often led workers to channel their resentments into internal bickering among one another rather than into their shared grievances.
another obstacle was the sheer strength of the industrial capitalists who possessed not only economic but also political and social power.
patterns of society the industrial revolution was making the united states both dramatically wealthier and increasingly unequal.
it was transforming social relationships at almost every level.
the rich and the poor the commercial and industrial growth of the united states greatly elevated the average income of the american people.
but this increasing wealth was being distributed highly unequally.
substantial groups of the population slaves indians landless farmers and many of the unskilled workers on the fringes of the manufacturing system shared hardly at all in the economic growth.
but even among the rest of the population disparities of income were growing.
merchants and industrialists were accumulating enormous fortunes and in the cities a distinctive culture of wealth began to emerge.
income gap grows americas economic revolution 241 daily carriage rides allowed the wealthy to take in fresh air while showing off their finery to their neighbors.
private collection bridgeman images central park in large cities people of great wealth gathered together in neighborhoods of astonishing opulence.
they founded clubs and developed elaborate social rituals.
they looked increasingly for ways to display their wealth in great mansions showy carriages lavish household goods and the elegant social establishments they patronized.
new york developed a particularly elaborate high society.
the construction of central park which began in the 1850s was in part a result of pressure from the members of high society who wanted an elegant setting for their daily carriage rides.
a significant population of genuinely destitute people also emerged in the growing urban centers.
these people were almost entirely without resources often the urban poor homeless and dependent on charity or crime or both for survival.
substantial numbers of people actually starved to death or died of exposure.
some of these paupers as contemporaries called them were recent immigrants.
some were widows and orphans stripped of the family structures that allowed most working class americans to survive.
some were people suffering from alcoholism or mental illness unable to work.
others were victims of native prejudice barred from all but the most menial employment because of race or ethnicity.
the irish were particular victims of such prejudice.
the worst victims in the north were free blacks.
most major urban areas had significant black populations.
some of these african americans harsh life for free blacks were descendants of families who had lived in the north for generations.
others were former slaves who had escaped or been released by their masters.
in material terms at least life was not always much better for them in the north than it had been in slavery.
most had access to very menial jobs at best.
in most parts of the north blacks could not vote attend public schools or use any of the public services available to white residents.
even so most african americans preferred life in the north however arduous to life in the south.
242 chapter 10 social and geographical mobility despite the contrasts between conspicuous wealth and poverty in antebellum america there was relatively little overt class conflict.
for one thing life in material terms at least was better for most factory workers than it had been on the farms or in europe.
a significant amount of mobility within the working class also helped limit discontent.
a few workers a very small number but enough to support the dreams of others managed to move from poverty to riches by dint of work ingenuity and luck.
and a much larger number of workers managed to move at least one notch up the ladder for example becoming in the course of a lifetime a skilled rather than an unskilled laborer.
more important than social mobility was geographical mobility.
some workers saved money bought land and moved west to farm it.
but few urban workers and even fewer poor ones could afford to make such a move.
much more common was the movement of laborers from one industrial town to another.
these migrants often the victims of layoffs looked for better opportunities elsewhere.
their search seldom led to marked improvement in their circumstances.
the rootlessness of this large and distressed segment of the workforce made effective organization and protest difficult.
middle class life despite the visibility of the very rich and the very poor in antebellum society the fastestgrowing group in america was the middle class.
economic development opened many rapidly expanding middle class more opportunities for people to own or work in shops or businesses to engage in trade to enter professions and to administer organizations.
in earlier times when landownership had been the only real basis of wealth society had been divided between those with little or no land people europeans generally called peasants and a landed gentry which in europe usually became an inherited aristocracy.
once commerce and industry became a source of wealth these rigid distinctions broke down many people could become prosperous without owning land but by providing valuable services.
middle class life in the antebellum years rapidly established itself as the most influential cultural form of urban america.
solid substantial middle class houses lined city streets larger in size and more elaborate in design than the cramped functional rowhouses in working class neighborhoods but also far less lavish than the great houses of the very rich.
middle class people tended to own their homes often for the first time.
workers and artisans remained mostly renters.
middle class women usually remained in the household although increasingly they were also able to hire servants usually young unmarried immigrant women.
in an age when doing the familys laundry could take an entire day one of the aspirations of middle class women was to escape from some of the drudgery of housework.
new household inventions altered and greatly improved the character of life in invention of cast iron stove middle class homes.
perhaps the most important was the invention of the cast iron stove which began to replace fireplaces as the principal vehicle for cooking in the 1840s.
these wood or coal burning devices were hot clumsy and dirty by later standards but compared to the inconvenience and danger of cooking on an open hearth they seemed a great luxury.
stoves gave cooks greater control over food preparation and allowed them to cook several things at once.
middle class diets were changing rapidly and not just because of the wider range of cooking that the stove made possible.
the expansion and diversification of american americas economic revolution 243 agriculture and the ability of distant farmers to ship goods to urban markets by rail greatly increased the variety of food available in cities.
fruits and vegetables were difficult to ship over long distances in an age with little refrigeration but families had access to a greater variety of meats grains and dairy products than in the past.
a few wealthy households acquired iceboxes which allowed them to keep meat and dairy products fresh for several days.
most families however did not yet have any refrigeration.
for them preserving food meant curing meat with salt and preserving fruits in sugar.
diets were generally much heavier and starchier than they are today and middleclass people tended to be considerably stouter than would be considered healthy or fashionable now.
middle class homes came to differentiate themselves from those of workers and artisans in other ways as well.
the spare simple styles of eighteenth century homes gave way to the much more elaborate even baroque household styles of the victorian era styles increasingly characterized by crowded even cluttered rooms dark colors lush fabrics and heavy furniture and draperies.
middle class homes also became larger.
it became less common for children to share beds and for all members of a family to sleep in the same room.
parlors and dining rooms separate from the kitchen once a luxury became the norm among the middle class.
some urban middle class homes had indoor plumbing and indoor toilets by the 1850s a significant advance over outdoor wells and privies.
the changing family the new industrializing society produced profound changes in the nature of the family.
among them was the movement of families from farms to urban areas.
sons and daughters family time 1842 this illustration for godeys ladys book a magazine whose audience was better off white women offers an idealized image of family life.

what does this image communicate about the roles of the household members.
archive photos getty images 244 chapter 10 in urban households were much more likely to leave the family in search of work than they had been in the rural world.
this was largely because of the shift of income earning work out of the home.
in the early decades of the nineteenth century the family itself had been the principal unit of economic activity.
now most income earners left home each day to work in a shop mill or factory.
a sharp distinction began to emerge between the p ublic world of the workplace and the private world of the family.
the world of the family was now dominated not by production but by housekeeping child rearing and other primarily domestic concerns.
there was a significant decline in the birthrate particularly in urban areas and in middle class families.
in 1800 the average american woman could be expected to give birth to approximately seven children.
by 1860 the average woman bore five children.
the cult of domesticity the growing separation between the workplace and the home sharpened distinctions between the social roles of men and women.
those distinctions affected not only factory workers and farmers but also members of the growing middle class.
with fewer legal and political rights than men most women remained under the virtually absolute authority of their husbands.
they were seldom encouraged to pursue education above the primary level.
women students were not accepted in any college or university until 1837.
for a considerable time after that only oberlin in ohio offered mount holyoke for women education to both men and women and mount holyoke in massachusetts was founded by mary lyon as an academy for women.
however unequal the positions of men and women in the preindustrial era those positions had generally been defined within the context of a household in which all members played important economic roles.
in the middle class family of the new industrial society by contrast the husband was assumed to be the principal usually the only income producer.
the image of women changed from one of contributors to the family economy to one of guardians of the domestic virtues middle class women learned to place a higher value on keeping a clean comfortable and well appointed home on entertaining and on dressing elegantly and stylishly.
within their own separate sphere middle class women began to develop a distinctive womens separate sphere female culture.
a ladys literature began to emerge.
romantic novels written for female readers focused on the private sphere that middle class women now inhabited as did womens magazines that focused on fashions shopping homemaking and other purely domestic concerns.
this cult of domesticity as some scholars have called it provided many women greater material comfort than they had enjoyed in the past and placed a higher value on their female virtues at the same time it left women increasingly detached from the public world with fewer outlets for their interests and energies.
except for teaching and nursing work by women outside the household gradually came to be seen as a lower class preserve.
working class women continued to work in factories and mills but under conditions far worse than those that the original more respectable women workers of lowell and waltham had experienced.
domestic service became another frequent source of female employment.
americas economic revolution 245 leisure activities leisure time was scarce for all but the wealthiest americans.
most people worked long hours and vacations were rare.
for most people sunday was the only respite from work and sundays were generally reserved for religion and rest.
for many working class and middle class people therefore holidays took on a special importance importance of holidays as suggested by the strikingly elaborate celebrations of the fourth of july in the nineteenth century.
the celebrations were not just expressions of patriotism but a way of enjoying one of the few nonreligious holidays from work available to most americans.
compared to the relentless working schedules of city residents the erratic pattern of farmwork provided occasional relief to people in rural america.
for urban people however leisure was something to be seized in what few free moments urban leisure activities they had.
men gravitated to taverns for drinking talking and game playing after work.
women gathered in one anothers homes for conversation and card games.
for educated people reading became one of the principal leisure activities.
newspapers and m agazines proliferated rapidly and books became staples of affluent homes.
a vigorous culture of public leisure emerged especially in larger cities.
theaters became increasingly popular and increasingly attracted audiences that crossed class lines.
much of the popular theater of the time consisted of melodrama based on novels or american myths.
also popular were shakespeares plays reworked to appeal to american audiences.
tragedies were given happy endings comedies were interlaced with regional humor lines were rewritten with american dialect and scenes were abbreviated or cut so that the play could be one of several in an evenings program.
so familiar were many shakespearean plots that audiences took delight in seeing them parodied in productions such as julius sneezer and hamlet and egglet.
minstrel shows in which white actors wearing blackface mimicked and ridiculed african american culture became increasingly popular.
public sporting events boxing horse racing cockfighting already becoming controversial and others often attracted considerable audiences.
baseball not yet organized into professional leagues was beginning to attract large crowds when played in city parks or fields.
a particularly exciting event in many communities was the arrival of the circus.
popular tastes in public spectacle tended toward the bizarre and the fantastic.
relatively few people traveled and in the absence of film radio television or even much photography americans hungered for visions of unusual phenomena.
people going to the theater or the circus or the museum wanted to see things that amazed and even frightened them.
the most celebrated provider of such experiences was the famous and unscrupulous showman p t barnum who opened the american museum in new york in 1842 not a showcase for art or nature but as an exhibit of human curiosities that included people with dwarfism siamese twins magicians and ventriloquists.
barnum was a genius in publicizing his ventures with garish posters and elaborate newspaper announcements.
later in the 1870s he launched the famous circus for which he is still best remembered.
lectures were one of the most popular forms of entertainment in nineteenth century america.
men and women flocked in enormous numbers to lyceums churches schools and auditoriums to hear lecturers explain the latest advances in science describe their visits to exotic places provide vivid historical narratives or rail against the evils of alcohol or slavery.
messages of social uplift and reform attracted rapt audiences particularly among women.
246 chapter 10 p t barnum stands next to his star charles stratton whose stage name was general tom thumb after the fairy tale character.
stratton joined barnums touring company as a child singing dancing and playing roles such as cupid and napoleon bonaparte.
the adult stratton and barnum became business partners.
bettmann corbis p t barnum and tom thumb the agricultural north even in the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing northeast and more so in what nineteenth century americans called the northwest most people remained tied to the agricultural world.
but agriculture like industry and commerce was becoming increasingly a part of the new capitalist economy.
northeastern agriculture the story of agriculture in the northeast after 1840 is one of decline and transformation.
farmers of this section of the country could no longer compete with the new and richer soil of the northwest.
in 1840 the leading wheat growing states were new york americas economic revolution 247 pennsylvania ohio and virginia.
in 1860 they were illinois indiana wisconsin ohio and michigan.
illinois ohio and missouri also supplanted new york pennsylvania and virginia as growers of corn.
in 1840 the most important cattle raising areas in the country were new york pennsylvania and new england.
by the 1850s the leading cattle states were illinois indiana ohio and iowa in the northwest and texas in the southwest.
some eastern farmers responded to these changes by moving west themselves and establishing new farms.
still others moved to mill towns and became laborers.
some farmers however remained on the land and turned to what was known as truck f arming supplying food to the growing cities.
they raised vegetables or fruit and sold their produce in truck farming nearby towns.
supplying milk butter and cheese to local urban markets also attracted many farmers in central new york southeastern pennsylvania and various parts of new england.
the old northwest life was different in the states of the old northwest now known as the midwest.
in the two decades before the civil war this section of the country experienced rise of chicago steady industrial growth particularly in and around cleveland on lake erie and cincinnati the center of meatpacking in the ohio valley.
farther west chicago was emerging as the national center of the agricultural machinery and meatpacking industries.
most of the major industrial activities of the old northwest either served agriculture as in the case of farm machinery or relied on agricultural products as in flour milling meatpacking whiskey distilling and the making of leather goods.
some areas of the old northwest were not yet dominated by whites.
indians remained the most numerous inhabitants of large portions of the upper third of the great lakes states until after the civil war.
in those areas hunting and fishing along with some sedentary agriculture remained the principal economic activities.
for the settlers who populated the lands farther south the old northwest was primarily an agricultural region.
its rich lands made farming highly lucrative.
thus the typical citizen of the old northwest was not the industrial worker or poor marginal farmer but the owner of a reasonably prosperous family farm.
industrialization in both the united states and europe provided the greatest boost to agriculture.
with the growth of factories and cities in the northeast the domestic market for farm goods increased dramatically.
the growing national and worldwide demand for farm products resulted in steadily rising farm prices.
for most farmers the 1840s and early 1850s were years of increasing prosperity.
the expansion of agricultural markets also had profound effects on sectional alignments in the united states.
the old northwest sold most of its products to the northeast and became an important market for the products of eastern economic ties between northeast and midwest industry.
a strong economic relationship was emerging between the two sections that was profitable to both and that was increasing the isolation of the south within the union.
by 1850 the growing western white population was moving into the prairie regions on both sides of the mississippi.
these farmers cleared forest lands or made use of fields the indians had cleared many years earlier.
and they developed a timber industry to make use of the remaining forests.
although wheat was the staple crop of the region other crops corn potatoes and oats and livestock were also important.
the old northwest also increased production by adopting new agricultural techniques.
farmers began to cultivate new varieties of seed notably mediterranean wheat which was hardier than the native type and they imported better breeds of animals such as hogs 248 chapter 10 cyrus mccormicks automatic reaper hulton archive getty images and sheep from england and spain.
most important were improved tools and farm machines.
the cast iron plow remained popular because of its replaceable parts.
in 1847 john deere established at moline illinois a factory to manufacture steel plows which were more durable than those made of iron.
two new machines heralded a coming revolution in grain production.
the automatic mccormick reaper reaper the invention of cyrus h mccormick of virginia took the place of sickle cradle and hand labor.
pulled by a team of horses it had a row of horizontal knives on one side for cutting wheat the wheels drove a paddle that bent the stalks over the knives which then fell onto a moving belt and into the back of the vehicle.
the reaper enabled a crew of six or seven men to harvest in a day as much wheat as fifteen men could harvest using the older methods.
mccormick who had patented his device in 1834 established a factory at chicago in 1847.
by 1860 more than 100 000 reapers were in use.
almost as important to the grain grower was the thresher a machine that separated the grain from the wheat stalks which appeared in large numbers after 1840.
before that farmers generally flailed grain by hand or used farm animals to tread it.
the jerome i.
case factory in racine wisconsin manufactured most of the threshers.
modern harvesters later combined the functions of the reaper and the thresher.
the old northwest was the most self consciously democratic section of the country.
but its democracy was of a relatively conservative type capitalistic property conscious middle class.
abraham lincoln an illinois whig voiced the optimistic economic opinions of many of the people of his section.
i take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can said lincoln.
when one starts poor as most do in the race of life free society is such that he knows he can better his condition he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor for his whole life americas economic revolution 249 rural life life for farming people varied greatly from one region to another.
in the more densely populated areas east of the appalachians and in the easternmost areas of the old northwest farmers made extensive use of the institutions of communities churches schools stores and taverns.
as white settlement moved farther west farmers became more isolated and had to struggle to find any occasions for contact with people outside their own families.
religion drew farm communities together more than any other force in remote communities.
town or village churches were popular meeting places both for rural gatherings services and for social events most of them dominated by women.
even in areas with no organized churches farm families and women in particular gathered in one anothers homes for prayer meetings bible readings and other religious activities.
weddings baptisms and funerals also brought communities together.
but religion was only one of many reasons for interaction.
farm people joined together frequently to share tasks such as barn raising.
large numbers of families gathered at harvesttime to help bring in crops husk corn or thresh wheat.
women came together to share domestic tasks holding bees in which groups of women made quilts baked goods preserves and other products.
despite the many social gatherings farm families managed to create they had much less contact with popular culture and public life than people who lived in towns and cities.
most rural people treasured their links to the outside world letters from relatives and friends in distant places newspapers and magazines from cities they had never seen catalogs advertising merchandise that their local stores never had.
yet many also valued the relative autonomy that a farm life gave them.
one reason many rural americans looked back nostalgically on country life once they moved to the city was that they sensed that in the urban world they had lost some control over the patterns of their daily lives.
conclusion between the 1820s and the 1850s the american economy experienced the beginnings of an industrial revolution a change that transformed almost every area of life in fundamental ways.
the american industrial revolution was a result of many things population growth advances in transportation and communication new technologies that spurred the development of factories and mass production the recruiting of a large industrial labor force and the creation of corporate bodies capable of managing large enterprises.
the new economy expanded the ranks of the wealthy helped create a large new middle class and introduced high levels of inequality.
culture in the industrializing areas of the north changed too as did the structure and behavior of the family the role of women and the way people used their leisure time and encountered popular culture.
the changes helped widen the gap in experience and understanding between the generation of the revolution and the generation of the mid nineteenth century.
they also helped widen the gap between north and south.

how did slavery shape the southern economy and society and how did it make the south different from the north.
what was the myth and what was the reality of white society in the south.
why was the myth so pervasive and widely believed.
how did slaves resist their enslavement.
how successful were their efforts.
what was the response of whites.
the south like the north experienced significant growth in the middle years of the nineteenth century.
southerners fanned out into the southwest.
the southern agricultural economy grew increasingly productive and prosperous.
trade in such staples as sugar rice tobacco and above all cotton made the south a major force in international commerce.
it also tied the south securely to the emerging capitalist world of the united states and its european trading partners.
yet despite all these changes the south experienced a much less fundamental transformation in these years than did the north.
it had begun the nineteenth century as a primarily agricultural region it remained overwhelmingly so in 1860.
it had begun the century with few important cities and little industry and so it remained sixty years later.
in 1800 a plantation system dependent on slave labor had dominated the southern economy by 1860 that system had only strengthened its grip on the region.
as one historian has written the south grew but it did not develop 251 the cotton economy time line gabriel prossers unsuccessful slave revolt slave importation banned 1820s the rise of king cotton depression in tobacco prices begins high cotton production in southwest denmark veseys conspiracy nat turner slave rebellion john randolph frees 400 slaves cotton prices plummet de bows commercial review founded cotton production boom 252 the most important economic development in the mid nineteenth century south was the shift of economic power from the upper south the original southern states along the atlantic coast to the lower south the expanding agricultural regions in the new states of the southwest.
that shift reflected above all the growing dominance of cotton in the southern economy.
much of the upper south continued to rely on the cultivation of tobacco.
but the market for that crop was notoriously unstable and tobacco rapidly exhausted the land on which it grew.
by the 1830s therefore many farmers in the old tobacco growing regions of virginia maryland and north carolina were shifting to other crops while the center of tobacco cultivation was moving westward into the piedmont area.
the southern regions of the coastal south south carolina georgia and parts of florida continued to rely on the cultivation of rice a more stable and lucrative crop.
but rice demanded substantial irrigation and needed an exceptionally long growing season nine months so its cultivation remained restricted to a relatively small area.
sugar growers along the gulf coast similarly enjoyed a reasonably profitable market for their crop.
but sugar cultivation required intensive and debilitating labor and a long growing time only relatively wealthy p lanters could afford to grow it.
in addition p roducers faced major competition from the great sugar plantations of the caribbean.
sugar cultivation therefore did not spread much beyond a small area in southern louisiana and eastern texas.
long staple sea island cotton was another lucrative crop but like rice and sugar it could grow only in a limited area the coastal regions of the southeast.

both maps show the areas of cotton cultivation the greencolored areas as well as areas with large slave populations the brown dotted areas.
note how in the top map which represents 1820 cotton production is concentrated largely in the east with a few areas scattered among alabama mississippi louisiana and tennessee.
slavery is concentrated along the georgia and south carolina coast areas in which long staple cotton was grown with only a few other areas of highly dense slave populations.
by 1860 the south had changed dramatically.
cotton production had spread throughout the lower south from texas to northern florida and slavery had moved with it.
slavery was much denser in the tobacco growing regions of virginia and north carolina which had also grown.
how did this economic shift affect the white souths commitment to slavery.
298 chapter 13 offered cheap land and a four year exemption from taxes to any american willing to move into texas.
thousands of americans flocked into the region the great majority of them white southerners and their slaves intent on establishing cotton plantations.
by 1830 there were about 7 000 americans living in texas more than twice the number of mexicans there.
most of the settlers came to texas through the efforts of american intermediaries who received sizable land grants from mexico in return for bringing new residents stephen f austin into the region.
the most successful was stephen f austin a young immigrant from missouri who established the first legal american settlement in texas in 1822.
austin and others created centers of power in the region that competed with the mexican government.
not surprisingly in 1830 the mexican government barred any further american immigration into the region.
but americans kept flowing into texas anyway.
friction between the american settlers and the mexican government was already growing in the mid 1830s when instability in mexico itself drove general antonio lpez de santa anna seizes power santa anna to seize power as a dictator.
he increased the powers of the mexican government at the expense of the state governments a measure that texans from the united states assumed was aimed specifically at them.
sporadic fighting between americans and mexicans in texas erupted in 1835.
in 1836 the american settlers defiantly proclaimed their independence from mexico.
santa anna led a large army into texas where the american settlers were divided into several squabbling factions.
mexican forces annihilated an american garrison at the the alamo alamo mission in san antonio after a famous if futile defense by a group of texas patriots that included among others the renowned frontiersman and former tennessee congressman davy crockett.
another garrison at goliad suffered substantially the same fate.
by the end of 1836 the rebellion appeared to have collapsed.
but general sam houston managed to keep a small force together.
and on april 21 1836 at the battle of san jacinto he defeated the mexican army and took santa anna prisoner.
santa anna under pressure from his captors signed a treaty giving texas independence.
a number of mexican residents of texas tejanos had fought with the americans status of tejanos in the revolution.
but soon after texas won its independence their texas was an independent republic for nine years.
the tattered banner pictured here was one of the republics original flags.
granger nyc all rights reserved.
the lone star flag the impending crisis 299 positions grew difficult.
the americans did not trust them feared that they were agents of the mexican government and in effect drove many of them out of the new republic.
most of those who stayed had to settle for a politically and economically subordinate status.
one of the first acts of the new president of texas sam houston was to send a delegation to washington with an offer to join the union.
but president jackson fearing that adding a large new slave state to the union would increase sectional tensions blocked annexation and even delayed recognizing the new republic until 1837.
spurned by the united states texas cast out on its own.
england and france concerned about the surging power of the united states saw texas as a possible check on its growth and began forging ties with the new republic.
at that point president tyler persuaded texas to apply for statehood again in 1844.
but northern senators fearing the admission of a new slave state defeated it.
oregon control of what was known as oregon country in the pacific northwest was also a major political issue in the 1840s.
both britain and the united states claimed sovereignty in the region.
unable to resolve their conflicting claims diplomatically they agreed in an 1818 treaty to allow citizens of each country equal access to the territory.
joint occupation this joint occupation continued for twenty years.
at the time of the treaty neither britain nor the united states had established much of a presence in oregon country.
white settlement in the region consisted largely of scattered american and canadian fur trading posts.
but american interest in oregon grew substantially in the 1820s and 1830s.
by the mid 1840s white americans substantially outnumbered the british in oregon.
they had also devastated much of the indian population in part through a measles epidemic that spread through the cayuse indians.
american settlements were sprouting up along the pacific coast and the new settlers were urging the united states government to take possession of the disputed oregon country.
the westward migration the migrations into texas and oregon were part of a larger movement that took hundreds of thousands of white and black americans into the far western regions of the continent between 1840 and 1860.
the largest number of migrants were from the old northwest.
most were relatively young people who had traveled in family groups.
few were wealthy but many were relatively prosperous.
poor people who could not afford the trip on their own usually had to join other families or groups as laborers men as farm or ranch hands women as domestic servants teachers or in some cases prostitutes.
groups heading for areas where mining or lumbering was the principal economic activity consisted mostly of men.
those heading for farming regions traveled mainly as families.
migrants generally gathered in one of several major depots in iowa and missouri independence st joseph or council bluffs joined a wagon train led by hired guides and set off with their belongings piled in covered wagons livestock trailing behind.
the major route west was the 2 000 mile oregon trail which stretched from the oregon trail independence across the great plains and through the south pass of the rocky mountains.
from there migrants moved north into oregon or south along the california trail to 300 chapter 13 the northern california coast.
other migrations moved along the santa fe trail southwest from independence into new mexico.
however they traveled overland migrants faced an arduous journey.
most lasted five or six months from may to november and travelers always felt the pressure to get through the rockies before the snows began often not an easy task given the very slow pace of most wagon trains.
to save their horses for pulling the wagons they walked most of the way.
diseases including cholera decimated and slowed many groups traveling west.
the women who did the cooking and washing at the end of the day generally worked harder than the men who usually rested when the caravan halted.
despite the traditional image of westward migrants as rugged individualists most travelers found the journey a communal experience.

note how many of the trails led to california and how few of them led into any of the far northern regions of united states territory.
note too the important towns and cities that grew up along these trails.
what forms of transportation later performed the functions that these trails performed prior to the civil war.
the impending crisis 301 expeditions consisted of groups of friends neighbors or relatives who had decided to pull up stakes and move west together.
and it was also because of the intensity of the journey.
it was a rare expedition in which there were not some internal conflicts before the trip was over but those who made the journey successfully generally learned the value of cooperation.
only a few expeditions experienced indian attacks.
in the twenty years before the civil war fewer than 400 migrants slightly more than one tenth of 1 percent died in conflicts with the tribes.
in fact indians were usually more helpful than dangerous to the white migrants.
they often served as guides and they traded horses clothing and fresh food with the travelers.
expansion and war the growing number of white americans in the lands west of the mississippi put great pressure on the government in washington to annex texas oregon and other territory.
and in the 1840s these expansionist pressures helped push the united states into war.
the democrats and expansion in preparing for the election of 1844 the two leading candidates henry clay of the whig party and martin van buren of the democratic party both tried to avoid taking a stand on the controversial annexation of texas.
sentiment for expansion was mild within the whig party and clay had no difficulty securing the nomination despite his noncommittal position.
but many southern democrats strongly supported annexation and the party passed over van buren to nominate james k polk who shared their enthusiasm.
polk had represented tennessee in the house of representatives for fourteen years four of them as speaker and had subsequently served as governor.
but by 1844 he had been out of public office for three years.
what made his victory possible was his support for the position expressed in the democratic platform that the re occupation of oregon and the re annexation of texas at the earliest practicable period are great american measures by combining the oregon and texas questions the democrats hoped polk elected to appeal to both northern and southern expansionists and they did.
polk carried the election 170 electoral votes to 105.
polk entered office with a clear set of goals and with plans for attaining them.
john tyler accomplished the first of polks ambitions for him in the last days of his own presidency.
interpreting the election returns as a mandate for the annexation of texas the outgoing president won congressional approval for it in february 1845.
that december texas became a state.
polk himself resolved the oregon question.
the british minister in washington brusquely rejected a compromise that would establish the united compromise over oregon states canadian border at the 49th parallel.
incensed polk again asserted the american claim to all of oregon.
there was loose talk of war on both sides of the atlantic talk that in the united states often took the form of the bellicose slogan fifty four forty or fight a reference to where the americans hoped to draw the northern boundary of their part of oregon.
but neither country really wanted war.
finally the british government accepted polks original proposal to divide the territory at the 49th parallel.
on june 15 1846 the senate approved a treaty that fixed the boundary there.

for years america and britain had overlapping claims on the territory.
the british claimed land as far south as the present state of oregon while the americans claimed land extending well into what is now canada.
tensions over the oregon border at times rose to the point that many americans were demanding war some using the slogan fifty four forty or fight referring to the latitude of the northernmost point of the american claim.
how did president james k polk defuse the crisis.
the southwest and california one of the reasons the senate and the president had agreed so readily to the british offer to settle the oregon question was that their attention was turning to new tensions emerging in the southwest.
as soon as the united states admitted texas to statehood in 1845 the mexican government broke diplomatic relations with washington.
mexican american relations grew still worse when a dispute developed over the boundary between texas texas boundary disputed and mexico.
texans claimed the rio grande as their western and southern border.
mexico although still not conceding the loss of texas argued nevertheless that the border had always been the nueces river to the north of the rio grande.
polk accepted the texas claim and in the summer of 1845 he sent a small army under general zachary taylor to texas to protect the new state against a possible mexican invasion.
the impending crisis 303 part of the area in dispute was new mexico whose spanish and indian residents lived in a multiracial society that by the 1840s had endured for nearly a century and a half.
in the 1820s the mexican government had invited american traders into the new mexico region hoping to speed development of the province.
but new mexico like texas soon became more american than mexican particularly after a flourishing commerce developed between santa fe and independence missouri.
americans were also increasing their interest in california.
in this vast region lived members of several western indian tribes and perhaps 7 000 mexicans.
gradually however white americans began to arrive first maritime traders and captains of pacific whaling ships who stopped to barter goods or buy supplies then merchants who established stores imported goods and developed a profitable trade with the mexicans california and indians and finally pioneering farmers who entered california from the east and settled in the sacramento valley.
some of these new settlers began to dream of bringing california into the united states.
president polk soon came to share their dream and committed himself to acquiring both new mexico and california for the united states.
at the same time that he dispatched the troops under taylor to texas he sent secret instructions to the commander of the pacific naval squadron to seize the california ports if mexico declared war.
representatives of the president quietly informed americans in california that the united states would respond sympathetically to a revolt against mexican authority there.
the mexican war having appeared to prepare for war polk turned to diplomacy by dispatching a special minister to try to buy off the mexicans.
but mexican leaders rejected the american offer to purchase the disputed territories.
on january 13 1846 as soon as he heard the news polk ordered taylors army in texas to move across the nueces river where war declared it had been stationed to the rio grande.
for months the mexicans refused to fight.
but finally according to disputed american accounts some mexican troops crossed the rio grande and attacked a unit of american soldiers.
on may 13 1846 congress declared war by votes of 40 to 2 in the senate and 174 to 14 in the house.
whig critics charged that polk had deliberately maneuvered the country into the conflict and had staged the border incident that had precipitated the declaration.
many opponents also claimed that polk had settled for less than he should have because he was preoccupied with mexico.
opposition intensified as the war continued and as the public became aware of the rising casualties and expense.
victory did not come as quickly as polk had hoped.
the president ordered taylor to cross the rio grande seize parts of northeastern mexico beginning with the city of monterrey and then march on to mexico city itself.
taylor captured monterrey in september 1846 but he let the mexican garrison evacuate without pursuit.
polk now began to fear that taylor lacked the tactical skill for the planned advance against mexico city.
he also feared that if successful taylor would become a powerful political rival as in fact he did.
in the meantime polk ordered other offensives against new mexico and california.
in the summer of 1846 a small army under colonel stephen w kearny captured santa fe with no opposition.
he then proceeded to california where he joined a conflict already in progress that was being staged jointly by american settlers a well armed exploring party led by john c frmont and the american navy the so called bear flag revolt.

note the american use of its naval forces to facilitate a successful assault on mexico city and others on the coast of california.
note too how unsuccessful the mexican forces were in their battles with the united states.
mexico won only one battle a relatively minor one at san pasqual near san diego in the war.
how did president polk deal with the popular clamor for the united states to annex much of present day mexico.
brought the disparate american forces together under his command and by the autumn of 1846 he had completed the conquest of california.
but mexico still refused to concede defeat.
at this point polk and general winfield scott the commanding general of the army and its finest soldier launched a bold new campaign.
scott assembled an army at tampico which the navy transported down the mexican coast to veracruz.
with an army that never numbered more than 14 000 scott advanced 260 miles along the mexican national highway toward mexico city kept american casualties low and never lost a battle before finally seizing the mexican c apital.
a new mexican government took power and announced its willingness to negotiate a peace treaty.
president polk continued to encourage those who demanded that the united states annex much of mexico itself.
at the same time he was growing anxious to get the war finished quickly.
polk sent a special presidential envoy nicholas trist to negotiate a settlement.
on february 2 1848 he reached agreement with the new mexican government treaty of guadalupe hidalgo on the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo by which mexico agreed to cede california and new mexico to the united states and acknowledge the rio grande as the boundary of texas.

what great event shortly after the mexican war contributed to a rapid settlement of california by migrants from the eastern united states.
southwestern expansion 1845 1853 claims its new citizens had against mexico and to pay the mexicans 15 million.
trist had obtained most of polks original demands but he had not satisfied the new more expansive dreams of acquiring additional territory in mexico itself.
polk angrily claimed that trist had violated his instructions but he soon realized that he had no choice but to accept the treaty to silence a bitter battle growing between ardent expansionists demanding the annexation of all mexico and antislavery leaders charging that the expansionists were conspiring to extend slavery to new realms.
the president submitted the trist treaty to the senate which approved it by a vote of 38 to 14.
the sectional debate james polk tried to be a president whose policies transcended sectional divisions.
but conciliating the sections was becoming an ever more difficult task and polk gradually earned the enmity of northerners and westerners alike who believed his policies favored the south at their expense.
slavery and the territories in august 1846 while the mexican war had been still in progress polk had asked congress to appropriate 2 million for purchasing peace with mexico.
immediately arising was the question of whether slavery would be allowed in any newly acquired territory.
co ns ider t he s o urc e wilmot proviso august 8 1846 to counter rising tensions over the question of whether territory acquired from mexico would be slave or free representative david wilmot of pennsylvania spearheaded an effort to ban slavery from that territory forever.
his amendment passed the house twice but failed in the senate because of heated opposition from northern pro slavery politicians.

where do they later reappear.
representative david wilmot of pennsylvania an antislavery democrat introduced an amendment to the appropriation bill prohibiting slavery in any territory acquired from wilmot proviso mexico.
the so called wilmot proviso passed the house but failed in the senate.
see consider the source wilmot proviso august 8 1846 southern militants contended that all americans had equal rights in the new territories including the right to move their slaves which they considered property into them.
as the sectional debate intensified president polk supported a proposal to extend the missouri compromise line through the new territories to the pacific coast banning slavery north of the line and permitting it south of the line.
others supported a plan originally known as squatter sovereignty and later by the more dignified phrase popular sovereignty that would allow the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery there.
the debate over these various proposals dragged on for many months.
the presidential campaign of 1848 dampened the controversy for a time as both democrats and whigs tried to avoid the slavery question.
when polk in poor health declined to run again the democrats nominated lewis cass of michigan a dull aging party regular.
the whigs nominated general zachary taylor of louisiana hero of the mexican war but a man with no political experience.
opponents of slavery found the choice of candidates unsatisfying and out of their discontent emerged the new free soil party whose candidate was former president martin van buren.
taylor won a narrow victory.
but while van buren failed to carry a single state he polled an impressive 291 000 votes 10 percent of the total and the free soilers elected free soil party ten members to congress.
the emergence of the free soil party as an important political force signaled the inability of the existing parties to contain the political passions slavery was creating.
it was also an early sign of the coming collapse of the second party system in the 1850s.
306 the impending crisis 307 the california gold rush by the time taylor took office the pressure to resolve the question of slavery in the far western territories had become more urgent as a result of dramatic events in california.
in january 1848 a foreman working in a sawmill owned by john sutter one of californias leading ranchers found traces of gold in the foothills of the sierra nevada.
within months news of the discovery had spread throughout the nation and much of the world.
almost immediately hundreds of thousands of people began flocking to california in a frantic search for gold.
the atmosphere in california at the peak of the gold rush was one of almost crazed excitement and greed.
most migrants to the far west prepared carefully before making the journey.
but the california migrants known as forty niners threw forty niners caution to the winds abandoning farms jobs homes and families piling onto ships and flooding the overland trails.
the overwhelming majority of the forty niners perhaps 95 percent were white men and the society they created in california was unusually fluid and volatile because of the almost total absence of white women children or families.
the gold rush also attracted some of the first chinese migrants to the western united states.
news of the discoveries created great excitement in china chinese migrants particularly in impoverished areas.
it was of course extremely difficult for a poor chinese peasant to get to america but many young adventurous people mostly men decided to go anyway in the belief that they could quickly become rich and then return to china.
finding gold in california was not for the most part a task for lone prospectors.
more common were teams of people who together built elaborate mining technologies.
granger nyc all rights reserved.
looking for gold 308 chapter 13 emigration brokers loaned many migrants money for passage to california which the migrants were to pay off out of their earnings there.
the gold rush produced a serious labor shortage in california as many male workers left their jobs and flocked to the gold fields.
that created opportunities for many people who needed work including chinese immigrants.
it also led to a frenzied exploitation indians exploited of indians that resembled slavery in all but name.
a new state law permitted the arrest of loitering or orphaned indians and their assignment to a term of indentured labor.
the gold rush was of critical importance to the growth of california but not for the reasons most of the migrants hoped.
there was substantial gold in the hills of the sierra nevada and many people got rich from it.
but only a tiny fraction of the forty niners ever found gold.
some disappointed migrants returned home after a while.
but many stayed in california and swelled both the agricultural and urban populations of the territory.
by 1856 for example san francisco whose population had been 1 000 before the gold rush was the home of over 50 000 people.
by the early 1850s california which had always had a diverse population had become even more heterogeneous.
the gold rush had attracted not just white americans but also europeans chinese south americans mexicans free blacks and slaves who accompanied southern migrants.
conflicts over gold intersected with racial and ethnic tensions to make the territory an unusually turbulent place.
rising sectional tensions zachary taylor believed statehood could become the solution to the issue of slavery in the territories.
as long as the new lands remained territories the federal government was responsible for deciding the fate of slavery within them.
but once they became states he thought their own governments would be able to settle the slavery question.
at taylors urging california quickly adopted a constitution that prohibited slavery and in december 1849 taylor asked congress to admit california as a free state.
congress balked in part because of several other controversies concerning slavery that were complicating the debate.
one was the effort of antislavery forces to abolish factors in statehood debate slavery in the district of columbia.
another was the emergence of personal liberty laws in northern states which barred courts and police officers from returning runaway slaves to their owners in defiance of the constitutions fugitive slave clause.
but the biggest obstacle to the presidents program was the white souths fear that new free states would be added to the northern majority.
the number of free and slave states was equal in 1849 fifteen each.
the admission of california would upset the balance and new mexico oregon and utah all candidates for statehood might upset it further.
even many otherwise moderate southern leaders now began to talk about secession from the union.
in the north every state legislature but one adopted a resolution demanding the prohibition of slavery in the territories.
the compromise of 1850 faced with this mounting crisis moderates and unionists spent the winter of 1849 1850 trying to frame a great compromise.
the aging henry clay who was spearheading the effort believed that no compromise could last unless it settled all clays compromise debated the impending crisis 309 me.

slave and free territories under the compromise of 1850 the acquisition of vast new western lands raised the question of the status of slavery in new territories organized for statehood by the united states.
tension between the north and the south on this question led in 1850 to a great compromise forged in congress to settle this dispute.
the compromise allowed california to join the union as a free state and introduced the concept of popular sovereignty for other new territories.
how well did the compromise of 1850 work.
the issues in dispute.
as a result he took several measures that had been proposed separately combined them into a single piece of legislation and presented it to the senate on january 29 1850.
among the bills provisions were the admission of california as a free state the formation of territorial governments in the rest of the lands acquired from mexico without restrictions on slavery the abolition of the slave trade but not slavery itself in the district of columbia and a new and more effective fugitive slave law.
these resolutions launched a debate that raged for seven months.
finally in midyear the climate for compromise improved.
president taylor suddenly died and vice president millard fillmore of new york took his place.
fillmore who understood the important of flexibility supported the compromise and persuaded northern whigs to do so as well.
where the old guards omnibus bill had failed stephen a douglas a democratic senator from illinois proposed breaking up the stephen a douglas bill.
thus representatives of different sections could support those elements of the compromise they liked and oppose those they did not.
douglas also gained support with complicated backroom deals linking the compromise to such nonideological matters as the sale of government bonds and the construction of railroads.
as a result of his efforts by mid september congress had enacted all the components of the compromise.
the compromise of 1850 was a victory of individual self interest.
still members of congress hailed the measure as a triumph of statesmanship and millard fillmore signing it called it a just settlement of the sectional problem in its character final and irrevocable 310 chapter 13 the crises of the 1850s for a few years after its passage the compromise of 1850 seemed to work.
sectional conflict appeared to fade amid booming prosperity and growth.
but the tensions between the north and the south never really disappeared.
the uneasy truce with the run up to the presidential election of 1852 both major parties endorsed the compromise of 1850 and nominated candidates unidentified with sectional passions.
franklin pierce elected the democrats chose the obscure new hampshire politician franklin pierce and the whigs chose the military hero general winfield scott.
but the sectional question quickly became a divisive influence in the election and the whigs were the principal victims.
they suffered massive defections from antislavery members who were angered by the partys evasiveness on the issue.
many of them flocked to the free soil party whose antislavery presidential candidate john p hale repudiated the compromise of 1850.
the divisions among the whigs helped produce a victory for the democrats in 1852.
franklin pierce attempted to maintain harmony by avoiding divisive issues particularly slavery.
but it was an impossible task.
northern opposition to the fugitive slave act intensified quickly after 1850.
mobs formed in some northern cities to prevent defiance of fugitive slave act enforcement of the fugitive slave law and several northern states also passed their own laws barring the deportation of fugitive slaves.
white southerners watched with growing anger and alarm as the one element of the compromise of 1850 that they had considered a victory seemed to become meaningless in the face of northern defiance.
young america one of the ways franklin pierce hoped to dampen sectional controversy was through his support of a movement in the democratic party known as young america its adherents saw the expansion of american democracy throughout the world as a way to divert attention from the controversies over slavery.
the great liberal and nationalist revolutions of 1848 in europe stirred them to dream of a republican europe with governments based on the model of the united states.
they dreamed as well of acquiring new territories in the western hemisphere.
but efforts to extend the nations domain could not avoid becoming entangled with the sectional crisis.
pierce had been pursuing diplomatic attempts to buy cuba from spain efforts begun in 1848 by polk.
in 1854 however a group of pierces envoys sent him a private document from ostend belgium making a case for seizing cuba by force.
when ostend manifesto the ostend manifesto as it became known was leaked to the public antislavery northerners charged the administration with conspiring to bring a new slave state into the union.
the south for its part opposed all efforts to acquire new territory that would not support a slave system.
the kingdom of hawaii agreed to join the united states in 1854 but the treaty died in the senate because it contained a clause prohibiting slavery in the islands.
a powerful movement to annex canada to the united states similarly foundered at least in part because of slavery.
the impending crisis 311 slavery railroads and the west what fully revived the sectional crisis however was the same issue that had produced it in the first place slavery in the territories.
by the 1850s the line of substantial white settlement had moved beyond the boundaries of missouri iowa and what is now minnesota into a great expanse of plains which many white americans had once believed was unfit for cultivation.
now it was becoming apparent that large sections of this region were in fact suitable for farming.
in the states of the old northwest prospective settlers urged the government to open the area to them provide territorial governments and dislodge local indians to make room for white settlers.
there was relatively little opposition from any segment of white society to this proposed violation of indian rights.
but the interest in further settlement raised two issues that did prove highly controversial and that gradually became entwined with each other railroads and slavery.
as the nation expanded westward broad support began to emerge for building a transcontinental railroad.
the problem was where to place it and in particular where to locate the railroads eastern terminus where the line could connect with the existing rail network east of the mississippi.
northerners favored chicago while southerners supported st louis memphis or new orleans.
the transcontinental transcontinental railroad and slavery railroad had also become part of the struggle between the north and the south.
pierces secretary of war jefferson davis of mississippi removed one obstacle to a southern route.
surveys indicated that a railroad with a southern terminus would have to pass through an area in mexican territory.
but in 1853 davis sent james gadsden purchase gadsden a southern railroad builder to mexico where he persuaded the mexican government to accept 10 million in exchange for a strip of land that today comprises parts of arizona and new mexico.
the so called gadsden purchase only accentuated the sectional rivalry as it added more slave territory.
the kansas nebraska controversy the momentum for an intercontinental railroad continued to build but the first great barrier was the debate over where to put it.
the acknowledged leader of northwestern democrats and senator from illinois stephen a douglas wanted the transcontinental railroad to run north through his state but he also recognized as many did that a northern route through the territories would run mostly through indian populations.
as a result he introduced a bill in january 1854 to organize and thus open to white settlement and railroads a huge new territory known as nebraska west of iowa and missouri from the still unorganized territory of the louisiana purchase.
douglas knew the south would oppose his bill because organized territories over time become states and the proposed territory was north of the missouri compromise line 363 and hence closed to slavery since 1820.
initially douglas attempted to appease southerners by including a provision that territorial legislatures would decide the status of slavery.
in theory the region could choose to open itself to slavery effectively repealing the missouri compromise.
when southern democrats demanded more douglas also agreed to divide the area into two territories nebraska and kansas instead of one.
the new second territory kansas was thought more likely to become a slave state.
in its final form the measure was known as the kansas nebraska act.
president pierce kansas nebraska act supported the bill and after a strenuous debate it became law in may 1854 with the unanimous support of the south and the partial support of northern democrats.
312 chapter 13 no piece of legislation in american history produced so many immediate sweeping and ominous political consequences.
it divided and destroyed the whig party.
it divided the northern democrats many of whom were appalled at the repeal of the missouri compromise and drove many of them from the party.
most important it spurred the creation of a new party that was frankly sectional in composition and creed.
people in both major parties who opposed douglass bill began to call themselves anti nebraska democrats and anti nebraska whigs.
in 1854 they formed a new organization and named republican party founded it the republican party and it instantly became a major force in american politics.
in the elections of that year the republicans won enough seats in congress to permit them in combination with allies among the know nothings to organize the house of representatives.
bleeding kansas white settlers began moving into kansas almost immediately after the passage of the kansas nebraska act.
in the spring of 1855 elections were held for a territorial legislature.
there were only about 1 500 legal voters in kansas by then but thousands of missourians some traveling in armed bands into kansas swelled the vote to over 6 000.
as a result pro slavery forces elected a majority to the legislature which immediately legalized slavery.
outraged free staters elected their own delegates to a constitutional convention which met at topeka and adopted a constitution excluding slavery.
they then chose their own governor and legislature and petitioned congress for statehood.
president pierce denounced them as traitors and threw the full support of the federal government behind the pro slavery territorial legislature.
a few months later a pro slavery federal marshal assembled a large posse consisting mostly of missourians to arrest the free state leaders who had set up their headquarters in lawrence.
the posse sacked the town burned the governors house and destroyed several printing presses.
retribution came quickly.
among the most fervent abolitionists in kansas was john brown a grim fiercely comjohn brown mitted zealot who had moved to kansas to fight to make it a free state.
after the events in lawrence he gathered six followers including four of his sons and in one night murdered five pro slavery settlers.
this terrible episode known as the pottawatomie massacre led to more civil strife in kansas including more armed bands engaged in guerrilla warfare with some more interested in land claims or loot than slavery.
northerners and southerners alike came to believe that the events in kansas illustrated and were caused by the aggressive designs of the rival section.
bleeding kansas became a powerful symbol of the sectional controversy.
another symbol soon appeared in the united states senate.
in may 1856 charles sumner of massachusetts a strong antislavery leader rose to give a speech titled the crime against kansas in it he gave particular attention to senator andrew p butler of south carolina an outspoken defender of slavery.
the south carolinian was sumner claimed the don quixote of slavery having chosen a mistress.
who though ugly to others is always lovely to him though polluted in the sight of the world is chaste in his sight.
the harlot slavery the pointedly sexual references and the general viciousness of the speech enraged butlers nephew preston brooks a member of the house of representatives from south carolina.
several days after the speech brooks approached sumner at his desk in the senate chamber during a recess raised a heavy cane and began beating him repeatedly sumner caned on the head and shoulders.
sumner trapped in his chair rose in agony with the impending crisis 313 even in this formal photographic portrait taken in 1859 the last year of his life john brown conveys the fierce sense of righteousness that fueled his extraordinary activities in the fight against slavery.
the library of congress john brown such strength that he tore the desk from the bolts holding it to the floor.
then he collapsed bleeding and unconscious.
so severe were his injuries that he was unable to return to the senate for four years.
throughout the north he became a hero a martyr to the barbarism of the south.
in the south preston brooks became a hero too.
censured by the house he resigned his seat returned to south carolina and stood successfully for reelection.
the free soil ideology what had happened to produce such deep hostility between the two sections.
in part the tensions were reflections of the two sections differing economic and territorial interests.
but they were also reflections of a hardening of ideas in both the north and the south.
in the north assumptions about the proper structure of society came to center on the belief in free soil and free labor most white northerners free soil and free labor came to believe that the existence of slavery was dangerous not because of what it did to blacks but because of what it threatened to do to whites.
at the heart of american democracy they argued was the right of all citizens to own property to control their own labor and to have access to opportunities for advancement.
according to this vision the south was the antithesis of democracy a closed static society in which slavery preserved an entrenched aristocracy.
while the north was growing and prospering the south was stagnating rejecting the values of individualism and progress.
the south northern free laborites further maintained was engaged in a conspiracy to extend slavery throughout the nation and thus to destroy the openness of northern capitalism and replace it with the closed aristocratic system of the south.
the only solution to this slave power conspiracy was to fight the spread of slavery and extend the slave power conspiracy nations democratic i e free labor ideals to all sections of the country.
314 chapter 13 this ideology which lay at the heart of the new republican party also strengthened the commitment of republicans to the union.
since the idea of continued growth and progress was central to the free labor vision the prospect of dismemberment of the nation was to the republicans unthinkable.
the pro slavery argument in the meantime in the south a very different ideology was emerging.
it was a result of many things the nat turner uprising in 1831 which terrified southern whites the expansion of the cotton economy into the deep south which made slavery unprecedentedly lucrative and the growth of the garrisonian abolitionist movement with its strident attacks on southern society.
the popularity of harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin was perhaps the most glaring evidence of the power of those attacks but other abolitionist writings had been antagonizing white southerners for years.
in response to these pressures a number of white southerners produced a new intellectual defense of slavery.
professor thomas r dew of the college of william and mary helped begin that effort in 1832.
twenty years later apologists for slavery summarized their views in an anthology that gave their ideology its name the pro slavery argument.
john c calhoun stated the essence of the case in 1837 slavery was a good a positive good it was good for the slaves because they enjoyed better conditions than industrial workers in the north good for southern society because it was the only way the two races this illustration was published by a boston press in 1850 in the wake of the english abolitionist george thompsons speaking tour of new york and new england.
a second half of the cartoon not shown here portrays a dismal scene of factory life in england.

one of the northern gentlemen observing this scene asks is it possible that we of the north have been so deceived by false reports.
why did we not visit the south before we caused this trouble between the north and south the library of congress pro slavery cartoon the impending crisis 315 could live together in peace and good for the entire country because the southern economy based on slavery was the key to the prosperity of the nation.
above all southern apologists argued slavery was good because it served as the basis for the southern way of life a way of life superior to any other in the united states perhaps in the world.
white southerners looking at the north saw a spirit of greed debauchery and destructiveness.
the masses of the north are venal corrupt covetous mean and selfish wrote one southerner.
others wrote with horror of the factory system and the crowded pestilential cities filled with unruly immigrants.
but the south they believed was a stable orderly society free from the feuds between capital and labor plaguing the north.
it protected the welfare of its workers.
and it allowed the aristocracy to enjoy a refined and accomplished cultural life.
it was in short an ideal social order in which all elements of the population were secure and content.
the defense of slavery rested too on increasingly elaborate arguments about the biological inferiority of african americans who were white southerners claimed inherently unfit to take care of themselves let alone exercise the rights of citizenship.
buchanan and depression in this unpromising climate the presidential campaign of 1856 began.
democratic party leaders wanted a candidate who unlike president pierce was not closely associated with the explosive question of bleeding kansas they chose james buchanan of pennsylvania who as minister to england had been safely out of the country during the recent controversies.
the republicans participating in their first presidential contest endorsed a whiggish program of internal improvements thus combining the idealism of antislavery with the economic aspirations of the north.
the republicans nominated john c frmont who had made a national reputation as an explorer of the far west and who had no political record.
the native american or know nothing party was beginning to break apart but it nominated former president millard fillmore who also received the endorsement of a small remnant of the whig party.
after a heated even frenzied campaign buchanan won a narrow victory over frmont and fillmore.
whether because of age and physical infirmities or because of a more fundamental weakness of character he became a painfully timid and indecisive president at a critical moment in history.
in the year buchanan took office a james buchanan elected financial panic struck the country followed by a depression that lasted several years.
in the north the depression strengthened the republican party because distressed manufacturers workers and farmers came to believe that the hard times were the result of the unsound policies of southern controlled pro slavery democratic administrations.
they expressed their frustrations by moving into an alliance with antislavery elements and thus into the republican party.
the dred scott decision on march 6 1857 the supreme court of the united states projected itself into the sectional controversy with one of the most controversial and notorious decisions in its history dred scott v sandford.
dred scott was a missouri slave once owned by an army surgeon who had taken scott with him into illinois and wisconsin where slavery was forbidden.
in 1846 after the surgeon died scott sued his masters widow for freedom on the grounds that his residence in free territory had liberated him from slavery.
316 chapter 13 the claim was well grounded in missouri law and in 1850 the circuit court in which scott filed the suit declared him free.
by now john sanford the brother of the surgeons widow was claiming ownership of scott and he appealed the circuit court ruling to the state supreme court which reversed the earlier decision.
when scott appealed to the federal courts sanfords attorneys claimed that scott had no standing to sue because he was not a citizen.
the supreme court which misspelled sanfords name in its decision was so divided that it was unable to issue a single ruling on the case.
the thrust of the various rulings however was a stunning defeat for the antislavery movement.
chief justice roger taney taneys pro slavery decision who wrote one of the majority opinions declared that scott could not bring a suit in the federal courts because he was not a citizen.
blacks had no claim to citizenship taney argued.
slaves were property and the fifth amendment prohibited congress from taking property without due process of law consequently taney concluded congress possessed no authority to pass a law depriving persons of their slave property in the territories.
the missouri compromise therefore had always been unconstitutional.
the ruling did nothing to challenge the right of an individual state to prohibit slavery within its borders but the statement that the federal government was powerless to act on the issue was a drastic and startling one.
southern whites were elated the highest tribunal in the land had sanctioned parts of the most extreme southern argument.
in the north the decision produced widespread dismay.
the decision the new york tribune wrote is entitled to just so much moral weight as would be the judgment of a majority of those congregated in any washington bar room republicans threatened that when they won control of the national government they would reverse the decision by packing the court with new members.
deadlock over kansas president buchanan timidly endorsed the dred scott decision.
at the same time he tried to resolve the controversy over kansas by supporting its admission to the union as a slave state.
in response the pro slavery territorial legislature called an election for delegates to a constitutional convention.
the free state residents refused to participate claiming that the legislature had discriminated against them in drawing district lines.
as a result the pro slavery forces won control of the convention which met in 1857 at lecompton framed a constitution legalizing slavery and refused to give voters a chance to reject it.
when an election for a new territorial legislature was called the antislavery groups turned out in force and won a majority.
the new antislavery legislature promptly submitted the lecompton constitution to the voters who rejected it by more than 10 000 votes.
both sides had resorted to fraud and violence but it was clear nevertheless that a majority of the people of kansas opposed slavery.
buchanan however pressured congress to admit kansas under the pro slavery lecompton constitution.
stephen a douglas and other northern and western democrats refused to support the presidents proposal which died in the house of representatives.
finally in april 1858 congress approved a compromise the lecompton constitution would be submitted to the voters of kansas again.
if it was approved kansas would be admitted to the union if it was rejected statehood lecompton constitution rejected would be postponed.
again kansas voters decisively rejected the lecompton constitution.
not until the closing months of buchanans administration in 1861 did kansas enter the union as a free state.
the impending crisis 317 the emergence of lincoln given the gravity of the sectional crisis the congressional elections of 1858 took on a special importance.
of particular note was the united states senate contest in illinois which pitted stephen a douglas the most prominent northern democrat against abraham lincoln who was largely unknown outside illinois.
lincoln was a successful lawyer who had long been involved in state politics.
he had served several terms in the illinois legislature and one undistinguished term in congress.
but he was not a national figure like douglas and so he tried to increase his visibility by engaging douglas in a series of debates.
the lincoln douglas lincoln douglas debates debates attracted enormous crowds and received wide attention.
at the heart of the debates was a basic difference on the issue of slavery.
douglas appeared to have no moral position on the issue lincoln claimed.
he stated that douglas did not care whether slavery was voted up or voted down lincolns opposition to slavery was more fundamental.
if the nation could accept that blacks were not entitled to basic human rights he argued then it could accept that other groups immigrant laborers for example could be deprived of rights too.
and if slavery were to extend into the western territories he argued opportunities for poor white laborers to better their lots there would be lost.
the nations future lincoln argued reflecting the central idea of the republican party rested on the spread of free labor.
lincoln believed slavery was morally wrong but he was not an abolitionist.
that was in part because he could not envision an easy alternative to slavery in the areas where it already existed.
he shared the prevailing view among northern whites that the black race was not prepared to live on equal terms with whites.
but even while lincoln accepted the inferiority of black people he continued to believe that they were entitled to basic rights.
i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races.
but i hold that.
there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man lincoln and his party would arrest the further spread of slavery.
they would not directly challenge it where it already existed but would trust that the institution would gradually die out there of its own accord.
douglass popular sovereignty position satisfied his followers sufficiently to produce a democratic majority in the state legislature which returned him to the senate but aroused little enthusiasm.
lincoln by contrast lost the election but emerged with a growing following both in and beyond the state.
and outside illinois the elections went heavily against the democrats.
the party retained control of the senate but lost its majority in the house with the result that the congressional sessions of 1858 and 1859 were bitterly deadlocked.
john browns raid the battles in congress however were almost entirely overshadowed by an event that enraged and horrified the south.
in the fall of 1859 john brown the antislavery radical whose bloody actions in kansas had inflamed the crisis there staged an even more dramatic episode this time in the south itself.
with private encouragement and financial aid from some prominent abolitionists he made elaborate plans to seize a mountain fortress in virginia from which he believed he could foment a slave insurrection in the south.
on october 16 he and a group of eighteen followers attacked and seized control of a united 318 chapter 13 states arsenal in harpers ferry virginia.
but the slave uprising brown hoped to inspire did not occur and he quickly found himself besieged in the arsenal by citizens local militia companies and before long united states troops under the command of robert e lee.
after ten of his men were killed brown surrendered.
he was promptly tried in a virginia court for treason and sentenced to death.
he and six of his followers were hanged.
no other single event did more than the harpers ferry raid to convince white southerners that they could not live safely in the union.
many southerners believed incorrectly that john browns raid had the support of the republican party and it suggested to them that the north was now committed to producing a slave insurrection.
harpers ferry the election of lincoln as the presidential election of 1860 approached the democratic party was torn apart by a battle between southerners who demanded a strong endorsement of slavery and westerners who supported the idea of popular sovereignty.
when the party convention met in april in charleston south carolina and endorsed popular sovereignty delegates from 11 13 23 4 6 candidate party electoral vote popular vote abraham lincoln republican 1 865 593 39 9 john c breckinridge southern democratic john bell constitutional union 848 356 18 1 592 906 12 6 stephen a douglas northern democratic 1 382 713 29 4 nonvoting territories 81 2 of electorate voting the election of 1860 the stark sectional divisions that helped produce the civil war were clearly visible in the results of the 1860 presidential election.
abraham lincoln the antislavery republican candidate won virtually all the free states.
stephen douglas a northern democrat with no strong position on the issue of slavery won two of the border states and john bell a supporter of both slavery and union won others.
john breckinridge a strong pro slavery southern democrat carried the entire deep south.
lincoln won under 40 percent of the popular vote but because of the four way division in the race managed to win a clear majority of the electoral vote.
what impact did the election of lincoln have on the sectional crisis.
the impending crisis 319 eight states in the lower south walked out.
the remaining delegates could not agree on a presidential candidate and finally adjourned after agreeing to meet again in baltimore.
the decimated convention at baltimore nominated stephen douglas for democrats divided president.
in the meantime disenchanted southern democrats met in richmond and nominated john c breckinridge of kentucky.
the republican leaders in the meantime were trying to broaden their appeal in the north.
the platform endorsed such traditional whig measures as a high tariff internal improvements a homestead bill and a pacific railroad to be built with federal financial assistance.
it supported the right of each state to decide the status of slavery within its borders.
but it also insisted that neither congress nor territorial legislatures could legalize slavery in the territories.
the republican convention chose abraham lincoln as the partys presidential nominee.
lincoln was appealing because of his growing reputation for eloquence because of his firm but moderate position on slavery and because his relative obscurity ensured that he would have none of the drawbacks of other more prominent and therefore more controversial republicans.
in the november election lincoln won the presidency with a majority of the electoral votes but only about two fifths of the fragmented popular vote.
the republicans moreover failed to win a majority in congress.
even so the election of lincoln lincoln elected became the final signal to many white southerners that their position in the union was hopeless.
and within a few weeks of lincolns victory the process of disunion began a process that would quickly lead to a prolonged and bloody war.
conclusion in the decades following the war of 1812 a vigorous nationalism pervaded much of american life helping smooth over the growing differences among the very distinct societies emerging in the united states.
during the 1850s however the forces that had worked to hold the nation together in the past fell victim to new and much more divisive pressures.
driving the sectional tensions of the 1850s was a battle over national policy toward the place of slavery within the western territories.
should slavery be permitted in the new states.
and who should decide.
there were strenuous efforts to craft compromises and solutions to this dilemma the compromise of 1850 the kansas nebraska act of 1854 and others.
but despite these efforts positions on slavery continued to harden in both the north and the south.
bitter battles in the territory of kansas over whether to permit slavery there growing agitation by abolitionists in the north and pro slavery advocates in the south the supreme courts controversial dred scott decision in 1857 the popularity of uncle toms cabin throughout the decade and the emergence of a new political party the republican party openly and centrally opposed to slavery all worked to destroy the hopes for compromise and push the south toward secession.
in 1860 all pretense of common sentiment collapsed when no political party presented a presidential candidate capable of attracting national support.
the republicans nominated abraham lincoln of illinois a little known politician recognized for his eloquent condemnations of slavery in a senate race two years earlier.
the democratic party split apart with its northern and southern wings each nominating different candidates.
lincoln won the election easily but with less than 40 percent of the popular vote.
and almost immediately after his victory the states of the south began preparing to secede from the union.

the second party system had collapsed replaced by one that accentuated rather than muted regional controversy.
the federal government was no longer a remote unthreatening presence the need to resolve the status of the territories had made it necessary for washington to deal directly with sectional issues.
the election of 1860 brought these tensions to a head and precipitated the most terrible war in the nations history.
321 the secession crisis time line almost as soon as news of abraham lincolns election reached the south militant leaders began to demand an end to the union.

by the time lincoln took office six other southern states mississippi january 9 1861 florida january 10 alabama january 11 georgia january 19 louisiana january 26 and texas february 1 had withdrawn from the union.
in february 1861 representatives of the seven seceded states met at montgomery alabama and formed a new nation the confederate states of america.
two months earlier president james buchanan told congress that no state had the right to secede from the union but that the federal government had no authority to stop a state if it did.
the seceding states immediately seized the federal property within their boundaries.
but they did not at first have sufficient military power to seize two fortified offshore military installations fort sumter in the harbor of charleston south carolina garrisoned by a small force under major robert anderson and fort pickens in pensacola florida.
buchanan refused to yield fort sumter when south carolina demanded it.
instead in january 1861 he ordered an unarmed merchant ship to proceed to fort sumter with additional troops and supplies.
confederate guns turned it back.
still neither section was yet ready to concede that war had begun.
and in washington efforts began once more to forge a compromise.
the failure of compromise gradually the compromise efforts came together around a proposal from john j crittenden of kentucky.
known as the crittenden compromise it proposed 322 the civil war 323 r eestablishing the missouri compromise line and extending it westward to the pacific.
slavery would be prohibited north of the line and permitted south of it.
southerners in the senate seemed willing to accept the plan.
but the compromise would have required the republicans to abandon their most fundamental position that slavery not be allowed to expand and they rejected it.
whether the failure to compromise and find common ground between northern and southern politicians triggered the civil war has been a topic of debate among historians for generations.
see debating the past the causes of the civil war when abraham lincoln arrived in washington talk of secession and possible war filled the air.
in his inaugural address lincoln insisted that acts of force or violence to support secession were insurrectionary and that the government would hold occupy and possess federal property in the seceded states a clear reference to fort sumter.
but fort sumter was running short of supplies.
so lincoln sent a relief expedition to the fort and informed the south carolina authorities that he would send no troops or munitions unless the supply ships met with resistance.
the new confederate government ordered general p g t beauregard commander of confederate forces at bombardment and war charleston to take the fort.
when anderson refused to give up the confederates bombarded it for two days.
on april 14 1861 anderson surrendered.
the civil war had begun.
almost immediately four more slave states seceded from the union and joined the confederacy virginia april 17 arkansas may 6 tennessee may 7 and north carolina may 20.
the four remaining slave states maryland delaware kentucky and missouri under heavy political pressure from washington remained in the union.
the opposing sides all the important material advantages for waging war lay with the north most notably an advanced industrial system able by 1862 to manufacture almost all the norths own war materials.
the south had almost no industry at all.
in addition the north had a much better transportation system with more and better railroads than did the south.
during the war the already inferior confederate railroad system steadily deteriorated and by early 1864 had almost collapsed.
but the south also had advantages.
the southern armies were for the most part fighting a defensive war on familiar land with local support.
the northern armies on the other hand were fighting mostly within the south amid hostile local populations they had to maintain long lines of communication.
the commitment of the white population of the south to the war was with limited exceptions clear and firm throughout much of the early years of fighting.
in the north opinion was more divided and support remained shaky until very near the end.
a major southern victory at any one of several crucial moments might have proved decisive in breaking the norths will to continue the struggle.
finally the dependence of the english and french textile industries on american cotton inclined many leaders in those countries to favor the confederacy and southerners hoped with some reason that one or both might intervene on their behalf.
billy yank and johnny reb the vast majority of civil war soldiers were volunteers.
recruiters for the union often pulled in groups of men from the same town or ethnic group.
there were entire companies and even regiments of irish americans german americans italian americans or later debating the past the causes of the civil war abraham lincoln in his 1865 inaugural address looked back at the terrible war that was now nearing its end and said all knew that slavery was somehow the cause of the war few historians dispute that.
but disagreement has been sharp over whether slavery was the only or even the principal cause of the war.
the debate began even before the war itself.
in 1858 senator william h seward of new york took note of the two competing explanations of the sectional tensions that were then inflaming the nation.
on one side he said stood those who believed the conflicts to be accidental unnecessary the work of interested or fanatical agitators opposing them stood those among them seward himself who believed there to be an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces the irrepressible conflict argument dominated historical discussion of the war from the 1860s to the 1920s.
war was inevitable some historians claimed because there was no room for compromise on the central issue of slavery.
others de emphasized slavery and pointed to the economic differences between the agrarian south and the industrializing north.
charles and mary beard for example wrote in 1927 of the inherent antagonisms between the interests of planters and those of industrialists.
still others cited social and cultural differences as the source of an irrepressible conflict.
slavery the historian allan nevins argued was only one factor that was making residents of the north and south separate peoples fundamental differences in 324 assumptions tastes and cultural aim made it virtually impossible for the two societies to live together in peace.
more recent proponents of irrepressible conflict arguments similarly emphasize culture and ideology but define the concerns of the north and the south in different terms.
eric foner writing in 1970 argued that the moral concerns of abolitionists and the economic concerns of industrialists were less important in explaining northern hostility to the south than was the broad based free labor ideology of the region.
northerners opposed slavery because they feared it might spread into their own region or into the west and threaten the position of free white laborers.
other historians have argued that the war was not inevitable beginning with a group of scholars in the 1920s known as the revisionists james g randall and avery craven were the two leading proponents of the view that the differences between the north and the south were not so great as to require a war that only a blundering generation of leaders caused the conflict.
michael holt revived the revisionist argument in a 1978 book in which he too emphasized the partisan ambitions of politicians.
holt was along with paul kleppner joel silbey and william gienapp one of the creators of an ethnocultural interpretation of the war which emphasized the collapse of the party system and the role of temperance and nativism which was central to the coming of the conflict.

initially these soldiers and their officers were haphazardly trained and unprepared for battle.

because individual states outfitted their soldiers at the outset of the war union uniforms were at first far from uniform ranging from the dark blue jackets and light blue pants of the regular army to dark blue and red zouave uniforms based on the french colonial regiments in algeria.
in the wars first major battle some union regiments wore gray uniforms which led to tragic mixups with confederate troops.
federals did not consistently wear blue uniforms until 1862 when the federal government provided them along with shoes weapons cartridge boxes knapsacks blankets canteens and other basic supplies.
northerners generally saw themselves fighting to restore the union and preserve the american democratic experiment.
they questioned how the nation might endure if parts of it could secede at every undesirable election result.
most white northerners understood that divisions over slavery had caused the civil war but they did not fight at first to abolish it.
later when it became clear that abolishing slavery would help end the rebellion emancipation joined reunion as a war aim.

in later years some of the hudson river painters traveled farther west.
their enormous canvases of great natural wonders the yosemite valley yellowstone the rocky mountains touched a passionate chord among the public.
some of the most famous of their paintings particularly the works of albert bierstadt and thomas moran traveled around the country attracting enormous crowds.
an american literature the effort to create a distinctively american literature made considerable progress in the 1820s through the work of the first great american novelist james fenimore cooper.
what most distinguished his work was its evocation of the american west.
cooper had a lifelong fascination with the human relationship to nature and with the challenges and dangers of americas expansion westward.
his most important novels among them the last of the mohicans 1826 and the deerslayer 1841 examined the experience of rugged white frontiersmen with indians pioneers violence and the law.
cooper evoked the ideal of the independent individual with a natural inner goodness an ideal that many americans feared was in jeopardy.
another later group of american writers displayed more clearly the influence of walt whitman romanticism.
walt whitmans book of poems leaves of grass 1855 celebrated democracy the liberation of the individual spirit and the pleasures of the flesh.
in helping free verse from traditional restrictive conventions he also expressed a yearning for emotional and physical release and personal fulfillment a yearning perhaps rooted in part in his own experience as a homosexual living in a society profoundly intolerant of unconventional sexuality.
less exuberant was herman melville perhaps the greatest american writer of his era.
herman melville moby dick published in 1851 is melvilles most important although not in his lifetime his most popular novel.
it tells the story of ahab the powerful driven captain of a whaling vessel and his obsessive search for moby dick the great white whale that had once maimed him.
it is a story of courage and of the strength of human will.
but it is also a tragedy of pride and revenge.
in some ways it is an uncomfortable metaphor for the harsh individualistic achievement driven culture of ninetee nthcentury america.
literature in the antebellum south the south experienced a literary flowering of its own in the mid nineteenth century and it produced writers and artists who were like their northern counterparts concerned with defining the nature of america.
but white southerners tended to produce very different images of what society was and should be.
the southern writer edgar allan poe produced stories and poems that were primarily edgar allan poe sad and macabre.
his first book tamerlane and other poems 1827 received little recognition.
but later works including his most famous poem the raven 1845 established him as a major if controversial literary figure.
poe evoked images of individuals rising above the narrow confines of intellect and exploring the deeper and often painful and horrifying world of the spirit and emotions.
other southern novelists of the 1830s among them nathaniel beverley tucker william alexander caruthers and john pendleton kennedy produced historical romances and antebellum culture and reform 275 eulogies for the plantation system of the upper south.
the most distinguished of the regions men of letters was william gilmore simms.
for a time his work expressed a broad nationalism that transcended his regional background but by the 1840s he too became a strong defender of southern institutions especially slavery against the encroachments of the north.
there was he believed a unique quality to southern life that fell to intellectuals to defend.
one group of southern writers however produced works that were more broadly american.
these writers from the fringes of plantation society augustus b longstreet joseph g baldwin johnson j hooper and others depicted the world of the backwoods south and focused on ordinary people and poor whites.
instead of romanticizing their subjects they were deliberately and sometimes painfully realistic seasoning their sketches with a robust vulgar humor that was new to american literature.
these southern realists established a tradition of american regional humor that was ultimately to find its most powerful voice in mark twain.
the transcendentalists one of the outstanding expressions of the romantic impulse in america came from a group of new england writers and philosophers known as the transcendentalists.
borrowing heavily from german and english writers and philosophers the transcendentalists promoted a theory of the individual that rested on a distinction between what they called reason and understanding reason as they defined it had little to do with rationality.
it was rather the individuals innate capacity to grasp beauty and truth by giving full expression to the instincts and emotions.
understanding by contrast was the use of margaret fuller as a leading transcendentalist fuller argued for the important relationship between the discovery of the self and the questioning of the prevailing gender roles of her era.
in her famous feminist work women in the nineteenth century fuller wrote many women are considering within themselves what they need and what they have not she encouraged her readers especially women to set aside conventional thinking about the role of women in society.
corbis 276 chapter 12 i ntellect in the narrow artificial ways imposed by society it involved the repression of instinct and the victory of externally imposed learning.
every persons goal therefore should be the cultivation of reason and thus liberation from understanding each individual should strive to transcend the limits of the intellect and allow the emotions the soul to create an original relation to the universe transcendentalist philosophy emerged first in america among a small group of ralph waldo emerson intellectuals centered in concord massachusetts and led by ralph waldo emerson.
a unitarian minister in his youth emerson left the clergy in 1832 to devote himself to writing teaching and lecturing.
in nature 1836 emerson wrote that in the quest for self fulfillment individuals should work for a communion with the natural world in the woods we return to reason and faith.

i am part and particle of god in other essays he was even more explicit in advocating a commitment to individuality and the full exploration of inner capacities.
equally influential was henry david thoreau.
thoreau went even further in repudiating henry david thoreau the repressive forces of society which produced he said lives of quiet desperation each individual should work for self realization by resisting pressures to conform to societys expectations and responding instead to his or her own instincts.
thoreaus own effort to free himself immortalized in walden 1854 led him to build a small cabin in the concord woods on the edge of walden pond where he lived alone for two years as simply as he could attempting to liberate himself from what he considered societys excessive interest in material comforts.
in his 1849 essay resistance to civil government he extended his critique of artificial constraints in society to government arguing that when government required an individual to violate his or her own morality it had no legitimate authority.
the proper response was civil disobedience or passive resistance a public refusal to obey unjust laws.
it was a belief that would undergird some antislavery reforms and much later in the mid twentieth century attacks on racial segregation.
the defense of nature as emersons and thoreaus tributes to nature suggest a small but influential group of americans in the nineteenth century feared the impact of capitalism on the integrity of the natural world.
the mountains and cataracts which were to have made poets and painters wrote the essayist oliver wendell holmes have been mined for anthracite and dammed for water power to the transcendentalists and others nature was not just a setting for economic activity as many farmers miners and others believed.
it was the source of deep personal human roots of environmentalism inspiration the vehicle through which individuals could best realize the truth within their own souls.
genuine spirituality they argued did not come from formal religion but through communion with the natural world.
in making such claims the transcendentalists were among the first americans to anticipate the environmental movement of the twentieth century.
they had no scientific basis for their defense of the wilderness and little sense of the twentieth century notion of the interconnectedness of species.
but they did believe in and articulate an essential unity between humanity and nature a spiritual unity they believed without which civilization would be impoverished.
they looked at nature they said with new eyes and with those eyes they saw that behind nature throughout nature spirit is present antebellum culture and reform 277 visions of utopia although transcendentalism was at its heart an individualistic philosophy it helped spawn one of the most famous nineteenth century experiments in communal living brook farm.
the dream of the boston transcendentalist george ripley brook farm was brook farm established in 1841 as an experimental community in west roxbury massachusetts.
there according to ripley individuals would gather to create a new society that would permit every member to have full opportunity for self realization.
all residents would share equally in the labor of the community so that all could share as well in the leisure which was essential for cultivation of the self.
the tension between the ideal of individual freedom and the demands of a communal society however eventually took its toll on brook farm.
many residents became disenchanted and left.
when a fire destroyed the central building of the community in 1847 the experiment dissolved.
among the original residents of brook farm was the writer nathaniel hawthorne who expressed his disillusionment with the experiment and to some extent with transcendentalism in a series of novels.
in the blithedale romance 1852 he wrote scathingly of brook farm itself.
in other novels most notably the scarlet letter 1850 and the house of the seven gables 1851 he wrote equally passionately about the price individuals pay for cutting themselves off from society.
egotism he claimed in an indirect challenge to the transcendentalist faith in the self was the serpent that lay at the heart of human misery.
brook farm was only one of many experimental communities in the years before the civil war.
the scottish industrialist and philanthropist robert owen founded an experimental community in indiana in 1825 which he named new harmony.
it new harmony was to be a village of cooperation in which every resident worked and lived in total equality.
the community was an economic failure but the vision that had inspired it continued to enchant some americans.
dozens of other owenite experiments were established in other locations in the ensuing years.
redefining gender roles many of the new utopian communities were deeply concerned with the relationship between men and women.
some even experimented with radical redefinitions of gender roles.
one of the most enduring of the utopian colonies of the nineteenth century was the oneida community established in 1848 in upstate new york by john humphrey oneida community noyes.
the oneida perfectionists as residents of the community called themselves rejected traditional notions of family and marriage.
all residents noyes declared were married to all other residents there were to be no permanent conjugal ties.
but oneida was not as horrified critics often claimed an experiment in unrestrained free love it was a place where the community carefully monitored sexual behavior where women were protected from unwanted childbearing and where children were raised communally often seeing little of their own parents.
the oneidans took pride in what they considered their liberation of women from the demands of male lust and from the traditional restraints of family.
the shakers too redefined traditional gender roles.
founded by mother ann lee in the 1770s the society of the shakers survived through the twentieth century.
shakers a tiny remnant is left today.
but the shakers attracted a particularly large following in the mid nineteenth century and established more than twenty communities throughout the northeast and northwest in the 1840s.
they derived their name from a unique religious ritual in which members of a congregation would shake themselves free of sin while performing a loud chant and an ecstatic dance.
278 chapter 12 the most distinctive feature of shakerism however was its commitment to complete celibacy which meant of course that no one could be born into the faith.
all shakers had to choose it voluntarily.
shakerism attracted about 6 000 members in the 1840s more women than men.
they lived in communities where contacts between men and women were strictly limited and they endorsed the idea of sexual equality although women exercised the greater power.
the shakers were not however motivated only by a desire to escape the burdens of traditional gender roles.
they were also trying to create a society set apart from the chaos and disorder they believed had come to characterize american life.
in that they were much like other dissenting religious sects and utopian communities of their time.
the mormons among the most important efforts to create a new and more ordered society was that of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the mormons.
mormonism began in joseph smith upstate new york through the efforts of joseph smith.
in 1830 when he was just twenty four he published a remarkable document the book of mormon named for the ancient prophet who he claimed had written it.
it was he said a translation of a set of golden tablets he had found in the hills of new york revealed to him by moroni an angel of god.
the book of mormon told the story of two ancient civilizations in america whose people had anticipated the coming of christ and were rewarded when jesus actually came to america after his resurrection.
ultimately both civilizations collapsed because of their rejection of christian principles.
but smith believed their history as righteous societies could serve as a model for building a new holy community in the united states.
in 1831 gathering a small group of believers around him smith began searching for a sanctuary for his new community of saints an effort that would continue unhappily for more than fifteen years.
time and again the latter day saints as they called themselves attempted to establish peaceful communities.
time and again they met with persecution from their neighbors who were suspicious of their radical religious doctrines their claims of new prophets new scripture and divine authority.
opponents were also concerned by their rapid growth and their increasing political strength.
near the end of his life joseph smith introduced the practice of polygamy giving a man the right to take several wives which became public knowledge after smiths death.
from then on polygamy became a central target of anti mormon opposition.
driven from their original settlements in independence missouri and kirtland ohio the mormons founded a new town in illinois that they named nauvoo.
in the early 1840s it became an imposing and economically successful community.
in 1844 however bitter enemies of joseph smith published an inflammatory attack on him.
smith ordered his followers to destroy the offending press and he was subsequently arrested and imprisoned in nearby carthage.
there an angry mob attacked the jail and fatally shot him.
the mormons soon abandoned nauvoo and under the leadership of smiths successor brigham young traveled 12 000 strong in one of the largest single group migrations in american history across the great plains and the rocky mountains.
they established salt lake city several communities in utah including the present salt lake city where finally the mormons were able to create a lasting settlement.
like other experiments in social organization of the era mormonism reflected a belief in human perfectibility.
god had once been a man the church taught and thus every man or woman could aspire to move continuously closer to god.
within a highly developed antebellum culture and reform 279 mormons heading west this lithograph by william henry jackson imagines the physical challenges that mormon pioneers faced in their journey to utah in 1850.
many of the men are shown pulling their families and possessions on handcarts.
private collection peter newark american pictures bridgeman images and centrally directed ecclesiastical structure mormons created a haven for people demoralized by the disorder and uncertainty of the secular world.
the original mormons were white men and women many of whom felt displaced in their rapidly changing society economically marginalized by the material growth and social progress of their era.
in the new religion they found a strong and animating faith.
in the society it created they found security and order.
remaking society the reform impulse also helped create new movements to remake mainstream society movements in which to a striking degree women formed both the rank and file and the leadership.
by the 1830s such movements had become organized reform societies.
revivalism morality and order the philosophy of reform arose in part from the optimistic vision of those such as the transcendentalists who preached the divinity of the individual.
another source was protestant revivalism the movement that had begun with the second great awakening early in the century and had by the 1820s evolved into a powerful force for social reform.
the new light evangelicals embraced the optimistic belief that every individual was capable of salvation through his or her own efforts.
partly as a result revivalism soon became not only a means of personal salvation but also an effort to reform the larger society.
in particular revivalism produced a crusade against personal immorality.
280 chapter 12 the drunkards progress this 1846 lithograph by nathaniel currier shows what temperance advocates argued was the inevitable consequence of alcohol consumption.
beginning with an apparently innocent glass with a friend the young man rises step by step to the summit of drunken revelry then declines to desperation and suicide while his abandoned wife and child grieve.
the library of congress evangelical protestantism greatly strengthened the crusade against drunkenness.
no social vice temperance advocates argued was more responsible for crime disorder and poverty than the excessive use of alcohol.
women complained that men spent money their families needed on alcohol and that drunken husbands often beat and abused their wives.
temperance also appealed to those who were alarmed by immigration drunkenness many nativists believed was responsible for violence and disorder in immigrant communities.
by 1840 temperance had become a major national movement with powerful organizations and more than a million followers who had signed a formal pledge to forgo hard liquor.
health science and phrenology for some americans the search for individual and social perfection led to an interest in new theories of health and knowledge.
in the nineteenth century more than half of those who contracted cholera a severe bacterial infection of the intestines usually contracted from contaminated food or water died.
nearly a quarter of the population of new orleans in 1833 perished from the disease.
many cities established health boards to try to find ways to prevent epidemics.
but the medical profession of the time not yet aware of the nature of bacterial infections had no answers.
instead many americans turned to nonscientific theories for improving health.
affluent men and especially women flocked to health spas for the celebrated water cure known to modern scientists as hydrotherapy which purported to improve health through immersing people in hot or cold baths or wrapping them in wet sheets.
other people adopted new dietary theories new dietary theories.
sylvester graham a connecticut born presbyterian minister and committed reformer won many followers with his prescriptions for eating fruits vegetables and bread made from coarsely ground flour a prescription not unlike antebellum culture and reform 281 some dietary theories today and for avoiding meat.
the graham cracker is made from a kind of flour named for him.
perhaps strangest of all to modern sensibilities was the widespread belief in the new science of phrenology which appeared first in germany and became popular in the united states beginning in the 1830s through the efforts of orson and lorenzo fowler publishers of the phrenology almanac.
phrenologists argued that the shape of phrenology an individuals skull was an important indicator of his or her character and intelligence.
they made elaborate measurements of bumps and indentations to calculate the size and they claimed the strength of different areas of the brain.
phrenology seemed to provide a way of measuring an individuals fitness for various positions in life and to promise an end to the arbitrary process by which people matched their talents to occupations and responsibilities.
the theory is now universally believed to have no scientific value at all.
medical science in an age of rapid technological and scientific advances medicine sometimes seemed to lag behind.
in part that was because of the character of the medical profession which in the absence of any significant regulation attracted many poorly educated people and many quacks.
efforts to regulate the profession were beaten back in the 1830s and 1840s by those who considered the licensing of physicians to be a form of undemocratic monopoly.
the prestige of the profession therefore remained low.
the biggest problem facing american medicine however was the absence of basic knowledge about disease.
the great medical achievement of the eighteenth century the development of a vaccination against smallpox by edward jenner came from no broad theory of infection but from a brilliant adaptation of folk practices among country people.
the development of anesthetics in the nineteenth century came not from medical doctors at first but from a new england dentist william morton who was looking for ways to help his patients endure the extraction of teeth.
beginning in 1844 experiments with anesthesia morton began experimenting with sulfuric ether.
john warren a boston surgeon soon began using ether to sedate surgical patients.
even these advances met with stiff resistance from some traditional physicians who mistrusted innovation and experimentation.
in the absence of any broad acceptance of scientific methods and experimental practice in medicine it was very difficult for even the most talented doctors to make progress in treating disease.
even so halting progress toward the discovery of the germ theory did occur in antebellum america.
in 1843 the boston essayist poet and progress in germ theory physician oliver wendell holmes published a study of large numbers of cases of puerperal fever septicemia in children and concluded that the disease could be transmitted from one person to another.
this discovery of contagion met with a storm of criticism but was later vindicated by the clinical success of the hungarian physician ignaz semmelweis who noticed that infection seemed to be spread by medical students who had been working with diseased corpses.
once he began requiring students to wash their hands and disinfect their instruments the infections virtually disappeared.
education one of the most important reform movements of the mid nineteenth century was the effort to produce a system of universal public education.
as of 1830 no state had such a system.
soon after that however interest in public education began growing rapidly.
282 chapter 12 the greatest of the educational reformers was horace mann the first secretary of the massachusetts board of education which was established in 1837.
to mann and his followers education was the only way to preserve democracy for an educated electorate was essential to the workings of a free political system.
mann reorganized the massachusetts horace mann and public schools school system lengthened the academic year to six months doubled teachers salaries broadened the curriculum and introduced new methods of professional training for teachers.
other states followed by building new schools creating teachers colleges and offering many children access to education for the first time.
by the 1850s the principle although not yet the reality of tax supported elementary schools was established in every state.
the quality of public education continued to vary widely.
in some places massachusetts for example educators were generally capable men and women often highly trained.
in other areas however barely literate teachers and severely limited funding hindered education.
among the highly dispersed population of the west many children had no access to uneven public education schools at all.
in the south all african americans were barred from education and only about a third of all white children of school age were actually enrolled in schools in 1860.
in the north 72 percent were enrolled but even there many students attended classes only briefly and casually.
among the goals of educational reformers was to teach children the social values of thrift order discipline punctuality and respect for authority.
horace mann for example spoke of the role of public schools in extending democracy and expanding individual opportunity.
but he spoke too of their role in creating social order train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it the interest in education contributed to the growing movement to educate american indians.
some reformers believed that indians could be civilized if only they could be taught the ways of the white world.
efforts by missionaries and others to educate indians and encourage them to assimilate were particularly prominent in such areas of the far west as oregon where conflicts with the natives had not yet become acute.
nevertheless the great majority of native americans remained outside the reach of white educational reform.
despite limitations and inequities the achievements of the school reformers were soaring literacy rates impressive.
by the beginning of the civil war the united states had one of the highest literacy rates of any nation in the world 94 percent of the population of the north and 83 percent of the white population of the south.
rehabilitation the belief in the potential of the individual also sparked the creation of new institutions to help the disabled institutions that formed part of a great network of charitable activities known as the benevolent empire.
among them was the perkins school for the blind in boston.
nothing better exemplified the romantic reform spirit of the era than the conviction of those who founded perkins.
they believed that even societys supposedly most disadvantaged members could be helped to discover their own inner strength and wisdom.
similar impulses produced another powerful movement of reform the creation of asylums for criminals and those who were mentally ill.
in advocating prison and hospital reform americans were reacting against one of societys most glaring ills antiquated jails and mental institutions whose inmates lived in almost inhuman conditions.
beginning in the 1820s many states built new penitentiaries and mental asylums.
antebellum culture and reform 283 new york built the first penitentiary at auburn in 1821.
in massachusetts dorothea dix the reformer dorothea dix began a national movement for new methods of treating individuals with mental illness.
new forms of prison discipline were designed to reform and rehabilitate criminals.
solitary confinement and the imposition of silence on work crews both instituted in pennsylvania and new york in the 1820s were meant to give prisoners opportunities to meditate on their wrongdoings and develop penitence hence the name penitentiary.
some of the same impulses that produced asylums underlay the emergence of a new reform approach to the problems of native americans the idea of the reservation.
for several decades the dominant thrust of the united states policy toward the indians had been relocation getting the tribes out of the way of white reservation concept born civilization.
but among some whites there had also been another intent to move the indians to a place where they would be allowed to develop to a point at which assimilation might be possible.
it was a small step from the idea of relocation to the idea of the reservation.
just as prisons asylums and orphanages would provide society with an opportunity to train and uplift misfits and unfortunates within white society so the reservations might provide a way to undertake what one official called the great work of regenerating the indian race these optimistic goals failed to meet the expectations of the reformers.
the rise of feminism many women who became involved in reform movements in the 1820s and 1830s came to resent the social and legal restrictions that limited their participation.
out of their concerns emerged the first american feminist movement.
sarah and angelina grimk sisters who became active and outspoken abolitionists ignored claims by men that their activism was inappropriate to their gender.
men and women were created equal they argued.
they are both moral and accountable beings leaders of the american feminist movement and whatever is right for man to do is right for women to do other reformers catharine beecher harriet beecher stowe her sister lucretia mott elizabeth cady stanton susan b anthony and dorothea dix similarly pressed at the boundaries of acceptable female behavior.
in 1840 american female delegates arrived at a world antislavery convention in london only to be turned away by the men who controlled the proceedings.
angered at the rejection several of the delegates became convinced that their first duty as reformers should now be to elevate the status of women.
over the next several years mott stanton and others began drawing pointed parallels between the plight of women and the plight of slaves and in 1848 in seneca falls new york they organized a seneca falls convention convention to discuss the question of womens rights.
out of the meeting came the declaration of sentiments and resolutions which stated that all men and women are created equal and that women no less than men are endowed with certain inalienable rights.
see consider the source declaration of sentiments and resolutions seneca falls new york 1848 in demanding the right to vote they launched a movement for woman suffrage that would survive until the battle was finally won in 1920.
many of the women involved in these feminist efforts were quakers.
quakerism had long embraced the ideal of sexual equality and had tolerated indeed encouraged the emergence of women as preachers and community leaders.
of the women who drafted the declaration of sentiments all but elizabeth cady stanton were quakers.
co ns ider t he s o urc e declaration of sentiments and resolutions seneca falls new york 1848 on july 19 and 20 1848 leaders of the womens rights movement gathered in seneca falls new york to host a national conversation about the social civil and religious conditions and rights of women they outlined their grievances and goals in the declaration of sentiments and resolutions which helped shape a national reform movement.
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied but one to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a course.
we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it and to insist upon the institution of a new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably 284 the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled.
the history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her.
to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.
he has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise.
he has compelled her to submit to laws in the formation of which she had no voice.
he has withheld from her rights which are given to the most ignorant and degraded men both natives and foreigners.
having deprived her of this first right of a citizen the elective franchise thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation he has oppressed her on all sides.
he has made her if married in the eye of the law civilly dead.
he has taken from her all right in property even to the wages she earns.
he has made her morally an irresponsible being as she can commit many crimes with impunity provided they be done in the presence of her husband.
in the covenant of marriage she is compelled to promise obedience to her husband he becoming to all intents and purposes her master the law giving him power to deprive her of her liberty and to administer chastisement.
he has so framed the laws of divorce as to what shall be the proper causes and in case of separation to whom the guardianship of the children shall be given as to be wholly regardless of the happiness of women the law in all cases going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of man and giving all power into his hands.
after depriving her of all rights as a married woman if single and the owner of property he has taxed her to support a government which recognizes her only when her property can be made profitable to it.
he has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments and from those she is permitted to follow she receives but a scanty remuneration.
he closes against her all the avenues to wealth and distinction which he considers most honorable to himself.
as a teacher of theology medicine or law she is not known.
he has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education all colleges being closed against her.
he allows her in church as well as state but a subordinate position claiming apostolic authority for her exclusion from the ministry and with some exceptions from any public participation in the affairs of the church.
he has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a different code of morals for men and women by which moral delinquencies which exclude women from society are not only tolerated but deemed of little account in man.
he has usurped the prerogative of jehovah himself claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action when that belongs to her conscience and to her god.
he has endeavored in every way that he could to destroy her confidence in her own powers to lessen her self respect and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.
now in view of this entire disfranchisement of one half the people of this country their social and religious degradation in view of the unjust laws above mentioned and because women do feel themselves aggrieved oppressed and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of the united states.

feminists benefited greatly from their association with other reform movements most notably abolitionism but they also suffered as a result.
the demands of women were usually assigned a secondary position to what many considered the far greater issue of the rights of slaves.
struggles of radical black women while black women like sojourner truth campaigned publicly for womens civil rights others attempted to reform society from within their religious traditions.
like white clerics black preachers in african american churches widely banned female congregants from becoming ordained and obtaining a license to preach and often required them to seek special permission to serve as class and prayer leaders.
indeed no black denomination formally recognized a woman as a cleric until the african methodist episcopal church ordained julia foote in 1895.
still black women sought to preach throughout the colonial 285 286 chapter 12 and antebellum eras.
among the first was jarena lee born free in 1783 in cape may new jersey.
as a twenty one year old woman then living in philadelphia she preached in public with such verve and passion that she earned an invitation from rev.
richard allen to speak at his church.
yet few other ministers welcomed her which lee struggled to understand theologically.
as she argued in 1833 if the man may preach because the savior died for him why not the women seeing he died for her also.
is he not a whole savior instead of a half one as those who hold it wrong for a woman to preach would seem to make it appear.
did not mary first preach the risen savior.
then did not mary a woman preach the gospel a more radical contemporary of lees was rebecca cox jackson.
growing up a free rebecca cox jackson woman in philadelphia during the early 1800s she lived much of her life with her brother joseph cox an african methodist episcopal minister.
following instructions given to her by a heavenly spirit in 1830 jackson began to host prayer meetings that quickly surged in popularity.
she stirred controversy by tossing aside convention and inviting men and women to worship side by side.
she earned a temporary reprieve however after a visit by rev.
morris brown who succeeded rev.
richard allen as bishop of the african methodist episcopal church.
brown came to one of jacksons meetings with the idea of silencing her but left thoroughly impressed by her preaching and ordered that she be left alone.
in 1833 jackson embarked on a preaching tour outside philadelphia but met with new and greater resistance.
her insistence on her right to preach open refusal to join a church and radical views on sexuality that included celibacy within marriage angered area clerics and jackson claimed motivated some to assault her.
eventually she broke ranks with the free black church movement and joined a shaker group in watervliet new york.
in 1851 she returned to philadelphia and founded a shaker community composed mainly of black women.
lee and jackson rejected the limitations placed on their preaching because of their gender.
like other black women they found confirmation for their efforts not in any church rule or clerical pronouncement but rather through their personal interpretation of the bible and more important an unflagging conviction that god had called them to preach.
though denied official recognition as preachers they still touched the lives of many and represented a vital dimension to the religious lives of northern blacks.
jarena lee the crusade against slavery the antislavery movement was not new to the mid nineteenth century.
nor was it primarily a domestic crusade.
indeed the struggle to end slavery took root in countries around the world.
see america in the world the abolition of slavery but not until 1830 in america did the antislavery movement begin to gather the force that would ultimately enable it to overshadow virtually all other efforts at social reform.
early opposition to slavery in the early years of the nineteenth century those who opposed slavery were for the most part a calm and genteel lot expressing moral disapproval but doing little else.
to the extent that there was an organized antislavery movement it centered on the effort to resettle american blacks in africa or the caribbean.
in 1817 a group of prominent white virginians organized the american colonization society acs which proposed a g radual antebellum culture and reform 287 freeing of slaves with masters receiving compensation.
the liberated black men and women would then be transported out of the country and helped establish a new society of their own.
the acs received some private funding some funding from congress and some funding from the legislatures of virginia and maryland.
and it successfully arranged to have several groups of blacks transported out of the united states to the west coast of africa where in 1830 they established the nation of liberia.
in 1846 liberia liberia became an independent black republic with its capital monrovia named for the american president who had presided over the initial settlement.
but the acs was in the end a negligible force.
there were far too many blacks in america in the nineteenth century to be transported to africa by any conceivable program.
and the acs met resistance in any case from blacks themselves many of whom were now three or more generations removed from africa and despite their loathing of slavery had no wish to emigrate.
they viewed themselves as entitled to fair treatment as americans.
garrison and abolitionism in 1830 with slavery spreading ideology rapidly in the south and the antislavery movement seemingly on the verge of collapse a new figure emerged william lloyd garrison.
born in massachusetts in 1805 garrison was in the 1820s an assistant to the new jersey quaker benjamin lundy who published the leading antislavery newspaper of the time.
garrison grew impatient with his employers moderate tone so in 1831 he returned to boston to found his own newspaper the liberator.
garrisons philosophy was so simple that it was genuinely revolutionary.
opponents of slavery he said should not talk about the evil influence of slavery on white society but rather the damage the system did to slaves.
and they should therefore reject gradualism and demand the immediate abolition of slavery and the extension of all the rights of american citizenship to both slaves and free african americans.
garrison garrisons antislavery argument wrote in a relentless uncompromising tone.
i am aware he wrote in the very first issue of the liberator that many object to the severity of my language but is there not cause for severity.
i will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.
i am in earnest i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard garrison soon attracted a large group of followers throughout the north enough to enable him to found the new england antislavery society in 1832 and a year later after a convention in philadelphia the american antislavery society.
black abolitionists abolitionism had a particular appeal to the free black population of the north.
these free blacks typically lived in conditions of poverty and oppression that were at times worse than those of their slave counterparts in the south.
for all their problems however northern blacks were fiercely proud of their freedom and sensitive to the plight of those members of their race who remained in bondage.
many in the 1830s came to support garrison.
but they also rallied to leaders of their own.
among the earliest black abolitionists was david walker who preceded even garrison in publicly calling for an uncompromising opposition to slavery on moral david walker grounds.
in 1829 walker a free black man who had moved from north carolina to boston published a harsh pamphlet an appeal to the coloured citizens of the world that described slavery as a sin that would draw divine punishment if not abolished.
america america in the world the abolition of slavery the united states formally abolished slavery through the thirteenth amendment of the constitution in 1865 in the aftermath of the civil war.
but the effort to abolish slavery did not begin or end in north america.
emancipation in the united states was part of a worldwide antislavery movement that began in the late eighteenth century and continued through the end of the nineteenth.
the end of slavery like the end of monarchies and established aristocracies was one of the ideals of the enlightenment which inspired new concepts of individual freedom and political equality.
as enlightenment ideas spread throughout the western world in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries people on both sides of the atlantic began to examine slavery anew.
some enlightenment thinkers including some of the founders of the american republic believed that freedom was appropriate for white people but not for people of color.
but others came to believe that all human beings had an equal claim to liberty and their views became the basis for an escalating series of antislavery movements.
opponents of slavery first targeted the slave trade the vast commerce in human beings that had grown up in the seventeenth the image of an enslaved man praying to god was popular in both british and american antislavery circles.
it began as the seal of the committee for the abolition of the slave trade a british abolitionist group formed in 1787 accompanied by the quote am i not a man and a brother this example is embroidered on cloth the image was also disseminated on medallions jewelry plates tea caddies tokens and snuffboxes.
wilberforce house hull city museums and art galleries uk bridgeman images antislavery message 288 and eighteenth centuries and had come to involve large parts of europe africa the caribbean and north and south america.
in the aftermath of the revolutions in america france and haiti the attack on the slave trade quickly gained momentum.
its central figure was the english reformer william wilberforce who spent years attacking britains connection with the slave trade on moral and religious grounds.
after the haitian revolution wilberforce and other antislavery activists denounced slavery on the grounds that its continuation would create more slave revolts.
in 1807 he persuaded parliament to pass a law ending the slave trade within the entire british empire.
the british example foreshadowed many other nations to make the slave trade illegal as well the united states in 1808 france in 1814 holland in 1817 spain in 1845.
trading in slaves persisted within countries and colonies where slavery remained legal including the united states and some illegal slave trading continued throughout the atlantic world.
but the international sale of slaves steadily declined after 1807.
the last known shipment of slaves across the atlantic from africa to cuba occurred in 1867.
ending the slave trade was a great deal easier than ending slavery itself in which many people had major investments and on which much agriculture commerce and industry depended.
but pressure to abolish slavery grew steadily throughout the nineteenth century with wilberforce once more helping to lead the international outcry against the institution.
in haiti the slave revolts that began in 1791 eventually abolished not only slavery but also french rule.
in some parts of south america slavery came to an end with the overthrow of spanish rule in the 1820s.
simn bolvar the great leader of latin american independence considered abolishing slavery an important part of his mission freeing those who joined his armies and insisting on constitutional prohibitions of slavery in several of the constitutions he helped frame.
in 1833 the british parliament passed a law abolishing slavery throughout the british empire and compensated slave owners for freeing their slaves.
france abolished slavery in its empire after years of agitation from abolitionists in 1848.
in the caribbean spain followed britain in slowly eliminating slavery from its colonies.
puerto rico abolished slavery in 1873 and cuba became the last colony in the caribbean to end slavery in 1886 in the face of increasing slave resistance and the declining profitability of slave based plantations.
brazil was the last nation in the americas ending the system in 1888.
the brazilian military began to turn against slavery after the valiant participation of slaves in brazils war with paraguay in the late 1860s eventually educated brazilians began to oppose the system too arguing that it obstructed economic and social progress.
in the united states the power of world opinion and the example of wilberforces movement in england became an important influence on the abolitionist movement as it gained strength in the 1820s and 1830s.
american abolitionism in turn helped reinforce the movements abroad.
frederick douglass the former american slave turned abolitionist became a major figure in the international antislavery movement and was a much admired and muchsought after speaker in england and europe in the 1840s and 1850s.
no other nation paid such a terrible price for abolishing slavery as did the united states during its civil war but american emancipation was nevertheless a part of a worldwide movement toward emancipation.

sojourner truth a freed black woman emerged as a powerful and eloquent spokeswoman for the abolition of slavery in the sojourner truth and frederick douglass 1830s.
the greatest african american abolitionist of all and one of the most electrifying orators of his time black or white was frederick douglass.
born a slave in maryland douglass escaped to massachusetts in 1838 became an outspoken leader of antislavery sentiment and spent two years lecturing in england.
on his return to the united states in 1847 douglass purchased his freedom from his maryland owner and founded an antislavery newspaper the north star in rochester new york.
he achieved wide renown as well for his autobiography narrative of the life of frederick douglass 1845 in which he presented a damning picture of slavery.
douglass demanded not only freedom but also full social and economic equality for blacks.
what to the american slave is your 4th of july douglass harshly asked in an independence day speech in rochester new york in 1854.
i answer a day that reveals to him more than all other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.
there is not a nation on earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these united states at this very hour antebellum culture and reform 291 black abolitionists had been active for years before douglass emerged as a leader of their cause.
they held their first national convention in 1830.
but with douglasss leadership they became a more influential force than any other african american.
they began too to forge an alliance with white antislavery leaders such as garrison.
anti abolitionism the rise of abolitionism provoked a powerful opposition.
almost all white southerners of course were bitterly hostile to the movement.
but even in the north abolitionists were a small dissenting minority.
some whites feared that abolitionism would produce a destructive civil war.
others feared that it would lead to a great influx of free blacks into the north and displace white workers.
the result of such fears was an escalating wave of violence.
a mob in philadelphia attacked the abolitionist headquarters there in 1834 burned it to the ground and began a bloody race riot.
another mob seized garrison on the streets of boston in 1835 and threatened to hang him.
he was saved from death only by being locked violent reprisals in jail.
elijah lovejoy the editor of an abolitionist newspaper in alton illinois was victimized repeatedly and finally killed when he tried to defend his printing press from attack.
that so many men and women continued to embrace abolitionism in the face of such vicious opposition suggests that abolitionists were not people who took their political commitments lightly.
they were strong willed passionate crusaders who displayed not only enormous courage and moral strength but at times a fervency that many of their contemporaries found deeply disturbing.
the mobs were only the most violent expression of a hostility to abolitionism that many perhaps most other white americans shared.
abolitionism divided by the mid 1830s the unity of the abolitionist crusade began to crack.
one reason was the violence of the anti abolitionists which persuaded some members of the abolition movement that a more moderate approach was necessary.
another reason was the growing radicalism of william lloyd garrison who shocked even many radicals and moderates of his own allies including frederick douglass by attacking not only slavery but the government itself.
the constitution he said was a covenant with death and an agreement with hell in 1840 garrison precipitated a formal division within the american antislavery society by insisting that women be permitted to participate in the movement on terms of full equality.
he continued after 1840 to arouse controversy with new and even more radical stands an extreme pacifism that rejected even defensive wars opposition to all forms of coercion not just slavery but prisons and asylums and finally in 1843 a call for northern disunion from the south.
from 1840 on therefore abolitionism moved in many channels and spoke with many different voices.
the radical and uncompromising garrisonians remained influential.
but so were others who operated in more moderate ways arguing that abolition could be accomplished only as the result of a long patient peaceful struggle.
they appealed to the conscience of the slaveholders and when that produced no results they turned to political action seeking to induce the northern states and the federal government to aid the cause.
they joined the garrisonians in helping runaway slaves find refuge in the north or in canada through the underground railroad.
patterns of popular culture sentimental novels america is now wholly given over to a damned mob of scribbling women nathaniel hawthorne complained in 1855 and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash hawthorne one of the leading novelists of his time was complaining about the most popular form of fiction in mid nineteenthcentury america not his own dark and serious works but the sentimental novel a genre of literature written and read mostly by middle class women.
in an age when affluent women occupied primarily domestic roles and in which finding a favorable marriage was the most important thing many women could do to secure or improve their lots in life the sentimental novel gave voice to both female hopes and female anxieties.
the plots of sentimental novels were usually filled with character improving problems and domestic trials but most of them ended with the heroine securely and happily married.
they were phenomenally successful many of them selling more than 100 000 copies each far more than almost any other books of the time.
sentimental heroines were almost always beautiful and endowed with specifically female qualities all the virtues one novelist wrote that are founded in the sensibility of the heart pity the attribute of angels and friendship the balm of life delight to dwell in the female breast women were highly sensitive creatures the sentimental writers believed incapable of disguising their feelings and subject to fainting mysterious illnesses trances and of course tears things rarely expected of men.
but they were also capable of a kind of 292 nurturing love and natural sincerity that was hard to find in the predominantly male public world.
in susan warners the wide wide world 1850 for example the heroine a young girl named ellen montgomery finds herself suddenly thrust into the wide wide world of male competition after her father loses his fortune.
she is unable to adapt to this world but she is saved in the end when she is taken in by wealthy relatives who will undoubtedly prepare her for a successful marriage.
they restore to her the security and comfort to which she had been born and without which she seemed unable to thrive.
sentimental novels accepted uncritically the popular assumptions about womens special needs and desires and they offered stirring tales of how women satisfied them.
but sentimental novels were not limited to romanticized images of female fulfillment through protection and marriage.
they hinted as well at the increasing role of women in reform movements.
many such books portrayed women dealing with social and moral problems and using their highly developed female sensibilities to help other women escape from their troubles.
women were particularly suitable for such reform work the writers implied because they were specially gifted at helping and nurturing others.
the most famous sentimental novelist of the nineteenth century was harriet beecher stowe.
most of her books the ministers wooing my wife and i we and our neighbors and others portrayed the travails and ultimate triumphs of women as they became wives mothers and hostesses.
but stowe was and remains best known for her 1852 antislavery novel uncle toms cabin did much to inflame public opinion in both the north and the south in the last years before the civil war.
when abraham lincoln was introduced to stowe once in the white house he reportedly said to her so you are the little lady that has brought this great war at the time however stowe was equally well known as one of the most successful american writers of sentimental novels.
bettmann corbis uncle toms cabin uncle toms cabin one of the most influential books ever published in america.
as a story about slavery and about an aging black man uncle tom who is unfailingly submissive to his white masters it is in many ways very different from her other novels.
but uncle toms cabin is a sentimental novel too.
stowes critique of slavery is based on her belief in the importance of domestic values and family security.
slaverys violation of those values and its denial of that security is what made it so abhorrent to her.
the simple decent uncle tom faces many of the same dilemmas that the female heroines of other sentimental novels encounter in their struggles to find security and tranquillity in their lives.
another way in which women were emerging from their domestic sphere was in becoming consumers of the expanding products of americas industrializing economy.
the female characters in sentimental novels searched not just for love security and social justice they also searched for luxury and for the pleasure of buying some favored item.
susan warner illustrated this aspect of the culture of the sentimental novel and the desires of the women who read them in the wide wide world in her description of the young ellen montgomery in an elegant bookstore buying a bible such beautiful bibles she had never seen she pored in ecstasy over their varieties of type and binding and was very evidently in love with them all understand analyze evaluate 1.

why has it endured.
the abolitionists also helped fund the legal battle over the spanish slave vessel amistad.
after the supreme court in prigg v pennsylvania 1842 ruled the amistad case that states need not aid in enforcing the 1793 law requiring the return of fugitive slaves to their owners abolitionists won passage in several northern states of personal liberty laws which forbade state officials to assist in the capture and return of runaways.
the antislavery societies also petitioned congress to abolish slavery in places where the federal government had jurisdiction in the territories and in the district of columbia and to prohibit the interstate slave trade.
293 294 chapter 12 antislavery sentiment underlay the formation in 1840 of the liberty party which ran kentucky antislavery leader james g birney for president.
but this party and its successors never campaigned for outright abolition.
they stood instead for free soil for keeping slavery out of the territories.
some free soilers were concerned about the welfare of blacks others were people who cared nothing about slavery but simply wanted to keep the west a country for whites.
but the free soil position would ultimately do what abolitionism never could attract the support of large numbers of the white population of the north.
the slow progress of abolitionism drove some critics of slavery to embrace more drastic measures.
a few began to advocate violence.
a group of prominent abolitionists in new england for example funneled money and arms to john brown for his bloody uprisings in kansas and virginia.
others attempted to arouse public anger through propaganda.
the most powerful of all abolitionist propaganda was harriet beecher stowes novel uncle toms cabin published as a book in 1852.
it sold more than 300 000 copies within a year of publication and was reissued again and again.
it succeeded in bringing the mesuncle toms cabin sage of abolitionism to an enormous new audience not only those who read the book but also those who watched countless theater companies reenact it across the nation.
an unconfirmed statement by lincoln to stowe has been widely publicized is this the little woman who made the great war reviled throughout the south stowe became a hero to many in the north.
and in both regions her novel helped inflame sectional tensions to a new level of passion.
stowes novel emerged not just out of abolitionist politics but also a popular tradition of sentimental novels written by and largely for women.
see patterns of popular culture sentimental novels stowe artfully integrated the emotional conventions of the sentimental novel with the political ideas of the abolitionist movement and to sensational effect.
her novel by embedding the antislavery message within a familiar literary form in which women were the key protagonists serving to improve society brought that message to an enormous new audience.
even divided abolitionism remained a powerful influence on the life of the nation.
only a relatively small number of people before the civil war ever accepted the abolitionist position that slavery must be entirely eliminated in a single stroke.
but the crusade that garrison had launched and that thousands of committed men and women kept alive for three decades was a constant visible reminder of how deeply the institution of slavery was dividing america.
conclusion the rapidly changing society of antebellum america encouraged interest in a wide range of reforms.
writers artists intellectuals and others drew heavily from new european notions of personal liberation and fulfillment a set of ideas often known as romanticism.
but they also strove to create a truly american culture.
the literary and artistic life of the nation expressed the rising interest in personal liberation in giving individuals the freedom to explore their own souls and to find in nature a full expression of their divinity.
it also called attention to some of the nations glaring social problems.
reformers too made use of the romantic belief in the divinity of the individual.
they flocked to religious revivals worked on behalf of such moral reforms as temperance antebellum culture and reform 295 supported education and articulated some of the first statements of modern feminism.
and in the north they rallied against slavery.
out of this growing antislavery movement emerged a new and powerful phenomenon abolitionism which insisted on immediate emancipation of slaves.
the abolitionist movement galvanized much of the north and contributed greatly to the growing schism between north and south.

why did they eventually fail to resolve the differences between the north and the south.
what were the major arguments for and against slavery and its expansion into new territories.
until the 1840s the tensions between the north and the south remained relatively contained.
had no new sectional issues arisen it is possible that the two sections might have resolved their differences peaceably over time.
but new issues did arise.
from the north came the strident and increasingly powerful abolitionist movement.
from the south came a newly militant defense of slavery and the way of life it supported.
and from the west most significantly emerged a series of controversies that would ultimately tear the fragile union apart.
296 looking westward more than a million square miles of new territory came under the control of the united states during the 1840s.
by the end of the decade the nation possessed all the territory of the present day united states except alaska hawaii and a few relatively small areas acquired later through border adjustments.
many factors accounted for this great new wave of expansion but one of the most important was an ideology known as manifest destiny manifest destiny manifest destiny reflected both the growing pride that characterized american nationalism in the mid nineteenth century and the idealistic vision of social perfection that fueled so much of the reform energy of the time.
it rested on the idea that america was destined by god and by history to expand its boundaries over a vast area.
by the 1840s publicized by the rise of inexpensive newspapers dubbed penny press the idea of manifest destiny had spread throughout the nation.
some advocates of manifest destiny envisioned a vast new empire of liberty that would include canada mexico caribbean and pacific islands and ultimately for the most ardent believers much of the rest of the world.
countering such bombast were politicians such as henry clay and others who warned that territorial expansion would reopen the painful controversy over slavery.
their voices however could not compete with the enthusiasm over expansion in the 1840s which began with the issues of texas and oregon.
americans in texas twice in the 1820s the united states had offered to purchase texas from the republic of mexico.
mexico indignantly refused and instead enacted a colonization law that time line texas declares independence from mexico polk elected president oregon boundary dispute settled treaty of guadalupe hidalgo taylor elected president california gold rush begins pierce elected president u s declares war on mexico wilmot proviso compromise of 1850 taylor dies fillmore becomes president gadsden purchase kansas nebraska act republican party formed 1855 1856 bleeding kansas buchanan elected president dred scott decision lecompton constitution defeated john brown raids harpers ferry lincoln elected president 297.
156 chapter 7 women.
as americans began to place a higher value on the importance of the republican mother who would help train the new generation for citizenship people began to ask how mothers could raise their children to be enlightened if the mothers themselves were uneducated.
such concerns helped speed the creation of female academies throughout the nation usually for the daughters of affluent families.
in 1789 massachusetts required that its public schools serve females as well as males.
other states although not all soon followed.
some women aspired to more.
in 1784 judith sargent murray published an essay judith sargent murray defending the right of women to education.
women and men were equal in intellect and potential murray argued.
women therefore should have precisely the same educational opportunities as men.
and they should have opportunities to earn their own livings and to establish roles in society apart from their husbands and families.
murrays ideas attracted relatively little support.
because jefferson and his followers liked to think of native americans as noble savages uncivilized but not necessarily uncivilizable they hoped that schooling the indians in white culture would uplift the tribes.
missionaries and mission schools proliferated among the tribes.
but there were no comparable efforts to educate enslaved african americans.
higher education similarly diverged from republican ideals.
the number of colleges and universities in america grew substantially from nine at the time of the revolution to twenty two in 1800.
none of the new schools however was truly public.
even universities established by state legislatures relied on private contributions and tuition fees to survive.
scarcely more than one white man in a thousand and virtually no women blacks or indians had access to any college education and those few who did attend universities were almost without exception members of prosperous propertied families.
medicine and science medicine and science were not always closely connected to each other in the early nineteenth century but many physicians were working hard to strengthen the link.
the university of pennsylvania created the first american medical school in 1765.
most doctors however studied medicine by working with an established practitioner.
some american physicians believed in applying new scientific methods to medicine but they had to struggle against age old prejudices and superstitions.
efforts to teach anatomy for example encountered strong public hostility because of the dissection of cadavers that the study required.
municipal authorities had virtually no understanding of medical science and almost no idea of what to do in the face of the severe epidemics that so often swept their populations only slowly did they respond to warnings that the lack of adequate sanitation programs was to blame for much disease.
individual patients often had more to fear from their doctors than from their illnesses.
even the leading advocates of scientific medicine often embraced ineffective or dangerous treatments.
george washingtons death in 1799 was probably less a result of the minor throat infection that had afflicted him than of his physicians efforts to cure him by bleeding and purging.
the medical profession also used its newfound commitment to the scientific method to justify expanding its control over kinds of care that had traditionally been outside its domain.
most childbirths for example had been attended by female midwives in the decline of midwifery eighteenth century.
in the early nineteenth century physicians began to handle deliveries themselves.
among the results of that change were a narrowing of opportunities for women and a restriction of access to childbirth care for poor mothers who could afford midwives but not physicians.
the jeffersonian era 157 cultural aspirations of the new nation many americans dreamed of an american literary and artistic life that would rival the greatest achievements of europe.
the 1772 poem on the rising glory of america predicted that america was destined to become the seat of empire and the final stage of civilization.
noah webster the connecticut schoolmaster lawyer and author of widely used american spellers and dictionaries echoed such sentiments arguing that the american schoolboy should be educated as a nationalist.
as soon as he opens his lips webster wrote he should rehearse the history of his own country he should lisp the praise of liberty and of those illustrious heroes and statesmen who have wrought a revolution in her favor a growing number of writers began working to create a strong american literature.
among the most ambitious was the philadelphia writer charles american literature brockden brown.
but his fascination with horror and deviance kept him from developing a popular audience.
more successful was washington irving of new york whose popular folktales recounting the adventures of such american rustics as ichabod crane and rip van winkle made him the widely acknowledged leader of american literary life in the early eighteenth century.
religion and revivalism by elevating ideas of individual liberty and reason the american revolution had weakened traditional forms of religious practice and challenged many ecclesiastical traditions.
by the 1790s only a small proportion of white americans were members of formal churches and ministers were complaining about the decay of vital piety methodist camp meeting 1837 camp or revival meetings were popular among some evangelical christians in america as early as 1800.
by the 1820s there were approximately 1 000 meetings a year most of them in the south and the west.
after one such meeting in 1806 a participant wrote will i ever see anything more like the day of judgement on the side of eternity to see the people running yes running from every direction to the stand weeping shouting and shouting for joy.
glorious day they went home singing shouting this lithograph dated 1837 suggests the degree to which women predominated at many revivals.

158 chapter 7 religious traditionalists were particularly alarmed about the emergence of new rational religious doctrines theologies that reflected modern scientific attitudes.
deism which had originated among enlightenment philosophers in france attracted such educated americans as jefferson and benjamin franklin and by 1800 was reaching a moderately broad popular audience.
deists accepted the existence of god but they considered him a remote watchmaker who after having created the universe had withdrawn from direct involvement with the human race and its sins.
religious skepticism also produced the philosophies of universalism and unitarianism disciples of these new ideas rejected the traditional calvinist belief in predestination and the idea of the trinity.
jesus was only a great religious teacher they claimed not the son of god.
but religious skepticism attracted relatively few people.
most americans clung to more traditional faiths.
beginning in 1801 traditional religion staged a dramatic comeback in a wave of revivalism known as the second great awakening.
the origins of the awakening lay in the efforts of conservative theologians to fight the second great awakening the spread of religious rationalism and of church establishments.
presbyterians expanded their efforts on the western fringes of white settlement.
itinerant methodist preachers traveled throughout the nation to win recruits for their new church which soon became the fastest growing denomination in america.
almost as successful were the baptists who found an especially fervent following in the south.
by the early nineteenth century the revivalist energies of all these denominations were combining to create the greatest surge of evangelical fervor since the first great awakening sixty years before.
in only a few years membership in churches embracing revivalism was cane ridge mushrooming.
at cane ridge kentucky in the summer of 1801 a group of evangelical ministers presided over the nations first camp meeting an extraordinary revival that lasted several days and impressed all who saw it with its fervor and its size some estimated that 25 000 people attended.
such events became common in subsequent years.
the basic message of the second great awakening was that individuals must readmit god and christ into their daily lives.
they must embrace a fervent active piety and they must reject the skeptical rationalism that threatened traditional beliefs.
yet the wave of revivalism did not restore the religion of the past.
few denominations any longer accepted the idea of predestination and the belief that people could affect their own destinies added intensity to the individuals search for salvation.
the awakening in short combined a more active piety with a belief in a god whose grace could be attained through faith and good works.
one of the striking features of the awakening was the preponderance of women within new roles for women it.
female converts far outnumbered males.
that may have been due in part to the movement of industrial work out of the home and into the factory.
that process robbed women of one of their roles as part of a household based economy and left many feeling isolated.
religious enthusiasm provided among other things access to a new range of activities charitable societies ministering to orphans and the poor missionary organizations and others in which women came to play important parts.
in some areas of the country revival meetings were open to people of all races.
from these revivals emerged a group of black preachers who became important figures within the enslaved community.
some of them translated the apparently egalitarian religious message of the awakening that salvation was available to all into a similarly liberating message for blacks in the present world.
out of black revival meetings in virginia for example arose an elaborate plan in 1800 devised by gabriel prosser the brother of a black preacher for a slave rebellion and an attack on richmond.
the plan was discovered and foiled in advance by whites but revivalism continued in subsequent years to create occasional racial unrest in the south.
the jeffersonian era 159 the spirit of revivalism was particularly strong among native americans.
presbyterian and baptist missionaries were active among the southern tribes and sparked a wave of conversions.
but the most important revivalist was handsome lake a handsome lake seneca whose seemingly miraculous rebirth after years of alcoholism helped give him a special stature within his tribe.
handsome lake called for a revival of traditional indian ways a repudiation of the individualism of white society and a restoration of the communal quality of the indian world.
his message spread through the scattered iroquois communities that had survived the military and political setbacks of previous decades and inspired many indians to give up whiskey gambling and other destructive customs derived from white society.
but handsome lake also encouraged christian missionaries to become active within the tribes and he urged iroquois men to abandon their roles as hunters and become sedentary farmers instead.
as in much of white society iroquois women who had traditionally done the farming were to move into more domestic roles.
stirrings of industrialism while americans had been engaged in a revolution to win their independence an even more important revolution had been in progress in england the emergence of modern industrialism.
power driven machines were permitting manufacturing to become more rapid and extensive with profound social and economic consequences.
see america in the world the global industrial revolution one reason for the growth of the textile industry in new england in the early nineteenth century was that there were many sources of water power in the region to run the machinery in the factories.
that was certainly the case with slaters mill one of the first american textile factories.
it was located in pawtucket rhode island alongside a powerful waterfall demonstrating the critical importance of water power to early american industry.
bettmann corbis pawtucket bridge and falls america in the world the global industrial revolution while americans were engaged in a revolution to win their independence they were also taking the first steps toward another great revolution one that was already in progress in england and europe.
it was the emergence of modern industrialism.
historians differ over precisely when the industrial revolution began but it is clear that by the end of the e ighteenth century it was well under way in many parts of the world.
a hundred years later the global process of industrialization had transformed the societies of britain most of continental europe japan and the united states.
its social and economic consequences were complex and profound and continue to shape the nature of global society.
for americans the industrial revolution largely resulted from rapid changes in great britain the nation with which they had the closest relations.
britain was the first nation to develop significant industrial capacity.
the factory system took root in england in the late eighteenth century revolutionizing the manufacture of cotton thread and cloth.
one invention followed another in quick succession.
improvements in weaving drove improvements in spinning and these changes created a demand for new devices for carding combing and straightening the fibers for the spinner.
water wind and animal power continued to be important in the textile industry but more important was the emergence of steam power which began to proliferate after the appearance of james watts advanced steam engine patented in 1769.
cumbersome and inefficient by modern standards watts engine was nevertheless a major improvement over earlier atmospheric engines.
englands textile industry 160 quickly became the most profitable in the world and it helped encourage comparable advances in other fields of manufacturing as well.
despite the efforts of the british government to prevent the export of english industrial technology knowledge of the new machines reached other nations quickly usually through the emigration of people who had learned the technology in british factories.
america benefited the most because it received more immigrants from great britain than from any other country but english technology spread quickly to the nations of continental europe as well.
belgium was the first developing a significant coal iron and armaments industry in the early nine teenth century.
france profiting from the immigration of approximately fifteen thousand british workers with advanced technological skills had created a substantial industrial capacity in textiles and metals by the end of the 1820s which in turn contributed to a great boom in railroad construction later in the century.
german industrialization progressed rapidly after 1840 beginning with coal and iron production and then in the 1850s moving into large scale railroad construction.
by the late nineteenth century germany had created some of the worlds largest industrial corporations.
in japan the sudden intrusion of american and european traders helped spur the so called meiji reforms of the 1880s and 1890s which launched a period of rapid industrialization there as well.
industrialization changed not just the worlds economies but also its societies.
first in england and then in europe america and japan social systems underwent wrenching changes.
hundreds of thousands of men and women moved from rural areas into cities to work in factories where they experienced both the benefits and the costs of industrialization.
the standard of living of the new working class when objectively quantified was usually significantly higher than that of the rural poor.
most of those who moved from farm to factory in other words experienced some improvement in nutrition and other material circumstances.
but the psychological costs of being suddenly uprooted from one way of life and thrust into a fundamentally different one could outweigh the economic gains.
there was little in most workers prior experience to prepare them for the nature of industrial labor.
it was disciplined routinized work with a fixed and rigid schedule a sharp contrast to the varying seasonal work pattern of the rural economy.
nor were many factory workers prepared for life in the new industrial towns and expanding cities.
industrial workers experienced too a fundamental change in their relationship with their employers.
unlike rural landlords and local aristocrats factory owners and managers were usually remote and inaccessible figures.
the new class of industrial capitalists many of them accumulating unprecedented wealth dealt with their workers impersonally and the result was a growing schism between the two classes each lacking access to or understanding of the other.
working men and women throughout the globe began thinking of themselves as a distinct class with common goals and interests.
and their efforts simultaneously to adjust to their new way of life and to resist its most damaging aspects sometimes created great social turbulence.
battles between workers and employers became a characteristic feature of industrial life throughout the world.
life in industrial nations changed at every level.
populations grew rapidly and people began to live longer.
at the same time pollution crime and infectious disease until modern sanitation systems emerged increased greatly in industrialized cities.
around the industrial world middle classes expanded and came in varying degrees to dominate the economy although not always the culture or the politics of their nations.
not since the agrarian revolution thousands of years earlier when many humans had turned from hunting to farming for sustenance had there been an economic change of a magnitude comparable to the industrial revolution.
centuries of traditions of social patterns and of cultural and religious assumptions were challenged and often shattered.
the tentative stirrings of industrial activity in the united states in the early nineteenth century therefore were part of a vast movement that over the course of the next century was to transform much of the globe.

why did the british government a ttempt to prevent the export of britains industrial technology.
what did the industrial revolution mean for ordinary people around the world.
technology in america nothing comparable to the english industrial revolution occurred in america in the first two decades of the nineteenth century.
yet even while jeffersonians warned of the dangers of rapid economic change they witnessed a series of technological advances 161 162 chapter 7 that would ultimately help ensure that the united states too would be transformed.
some of these technological advances were english imports.
despite efforts by the british government to prevent the export of textile machinery or the emigration of skilled mechanics a number of immigrants with advanced knowledge of english technology arrived in the united states eager to introduce the new machines to america.
samuel slater for example used the knowledge he had acquired before leaving england to build a spinning mill in pawtucket rhode island for the quaker merchant moses brown in 1790.
america also produced notable inventors of its own.
in 1793 eli whitney invented a machine that performed the arduous task of removing the seeds from short staple cotton quickly and efficiently.
it was dubbed the cotton gin gin was a derivative of engine.
with the device a single operator could clean as much cotton in a few hours as it once took a group of workers to do in a day.
the results were profound.
soon cotton cultivation spread throughout the south.
previously it had been restricted largely to the coast the cotton gin and the spread of slavery and the sea islands the only places where long staple cotton easily cleaned without the cotton gin could be grown.
within a decade the total cotton crop increased eightfold.
african american slavery which with the decline of tobacco production had seemed for a time to be a dwindling institution expanded and firmly fixed itself upon the south.
the large supply of domestically produced fiber also served as a strong incentive to entrepreneurs in new england and elsewhere to develop a native textile industry.
whitney was an important figure in the history of american technology for another reason as well.
he helped introduce the concept of interchangeable parts to the united states.
as machines such as the cotton gin began to be widely used it importance of interchangeable parts became increasingly important for owners of such machines to have access to spare parts and for the parts to be made so that they fit the machines properly.
whitney designed not only the cotton gin but also machine tools that could manufacture its component parts to exact specifications.
the u s government later commissioned whitney to manufacture 1 000 muskets for the army.
each part of the gun had to be interchangeable with the equivalent part in every other gun.
interchangeability was of great importance in the united states because of the great distances many people had to travel to reach towns or cities and the relatively limited transportation systems available to them.
interchangeable parts meant that a farmer could repair a machine himself.
but the interchangeability that whitney championed was not easy to achieve.
in theory many parts were designed to be interchangeable.
in reality the actual manufacturing of such parts was for many years not nearly precise enough.
farmers and others often had to do considerable fitting before the parts would work in their equipment.
not until later in the century would machine tools be developed to the point that they could make truly interchangeable parts.
transportation innovations one of the prerequisites for industrialization is a transportation system that allows the efficient movement of raw materials to factories and of finished goods to markets.
the united states had no such system in the early years of the republic and thus it had no the jeffersonian era 163 domestic market extensive enough to justify large scale production.
but projects were under way that would ultimately remove the transportation obstacle.
one such project was the development of the steamboat.
england had pioneered steam power and even steam navigation in the eighteenth century and there had been experiments in america in the 1780s and 1790s in various forms of steam powered transportation.
a major advance emerged out of the efforts of the robert fultons steamboat inventor robert fulton and the promoter robert r livingston who made possible the launching of a steamboat large enough to carry passengers.
their clermont equipped with paddle wheels and an english built engine sailed up the hudson river in the summer of 1807.
meanwhile what was to become known as the turnpike era had begun.
in 1794 a corporation built a toll road running the sixty miles from philadelphia the turnpike era to lancaster pennsylvania with a hard packed surface of crushed stone that provided a good year round surface with effective drainage but was very expensive to construct.
the pennsylvania venture proved so successful that similar turnpikes so named from the kind of tollgate frequently used were laid out from other cities to neighboring towns.
the process of building the turnpikes was a difficult one.
companies had to survey their routes with many things in mind particularly elevation.
horse drawn vehicles had great difficulty traveling along roads with more than a five degree incline which required many roads to take very circuitous routes to avoid steep hills.
building roads over mountains was an almost insurmountable task and no company was successful in doing so until governments began to participate in the financing of the projects.
country and city despite all these changes america remained an overwhelmingly rural and agrarian nation.
only 3 percent of the population lived in towns of more than 8 000 in 1800.
even the nations largest cities could not begin to compare with such european capitals as london and paris though philadelphia with 70 000 residents new york with 60 000 and others were becoming centers of commerce learning and urban culture comparable to many of the secondary cities of europe.
people in cities and towns lived differently from the vast majority of americans who continued to work as farmers.
among other things urban life produced affluence and affluent people sought increasing elegance and refinement in their homes their grounds and their dress.
they also looked for diversions music theater dancing and for many people horse racing.
informal horse racing had begun as early as the 1620s and the first formal race course in north america opened near new york city in 1665.
by the early nineteenth century it was a popular activity in most areas of the country.
the crowds that gathered at horse races were an early sign of the vast appetite for popular public entertainments that would be an enduring part of american culture.
see patterns of popular culture horse racing it was still possible for some to believe that this small nation might not become a complex modern society.
but the forces pushing such a transformation were already at work.
and thomas jefferson for all his commitment to the agrarian ideal found himself as president obliged to confront and accommodate them.
patterns of popular culture horse racing informal horse racing began in north america almost as soon as europeans settled the english colonies.
formal racing followed quickly.
the first racetrack in north america new market named for a popular racecourse in england was established in 1665 on long island near present day garden city new york.
tracks quickly developed wide appeal and soon horse racing had spread up and down the atlantic coast.
by the time of the american revolution it was popular in almost every colony and was moving as well into the newly settled areas of the southwest.
andrew jackson was a founder of the first racetrack in nashville tennessee in the early nineteenth century.
kentucky whose native bluegrass was early recognized as ideal for grazing horses had eight tracks by 1800.
like almost everything else in the life of early america the world of horse racing was bounded by lines of class and race.
for many years it was considered the exclusive preserve of gentlemen so much so that in 1674 a virginia court fined james bullocke a tailor for proposing a race it being contrary to law for a labourer to make a race being a sport only for gentlemen but while white aristocrats retained control of racing they were not the only people who participated in it.
southern planters often trained young male slaves as jockeys for their horses just as northern horse owners employed the services of free blacks as riders.
in the north and the south african americans eventually emerged as some of the most talented and experienced trainers of racing horses.
and despite social and legal pressures free blacks and poor whites often staged their own informal races.
164 racing also began early to reflect the growing sectional rivalry between the north and south.
in 1824 the union race course on long island established an astounding 24 000 purse for a race between two famous thoroughbreds american eclipse from the north and sir henry from the south.
american eclipse won two of the three heats.
a southern racehorse prevailed in another such celebrated contest in 1836.
these intersectional races which drew enormous crowds and created tremendous publicity continued into the 1850s until the north south rivalry began to take a more deadly form.
horse racing remained popular after the civil war but two developments changed its character considerably.
one was the successful effort to drive african americans out of the sport.
at least until the 1890s black jockeys and trainers remained central to racing.
at the first kentucky derby in 1875 fourteen of the fifteen horses had african american riders.
one black man isaac murphy won a remarkable 44 percent of all races in which he rode including three kentucky derbys.
gradually however the same social dynamics that enforced racial segregation in so many other areas of american life penetrated racing as well.
by the beginning of the twentieth century white jockeys and organized jockey clubs had driven a lmost all black riders and many black trainers out of the sport.
the second change was the introduction of formalized betting.
in the late nineteenth century racetracks created betting systems to lure customers to the races.

why has it continued to be popular.
how did changes in the sport of horse racing reflect similar changes in american society at large.
jefferson the president privately thomas jefferson may well have considered his victory over john adams in 1800 to be what he later termed it a revolution as real.
as that of 1776 publicly however he was restrained and conciliatory attempting to minimize the differences between the two parties and calm the passions that the bitter campaign had aroused.
there was no public repudiation of federalist policies no true revolution indeed at times jefferson seemed to outdo the federalists at their own work.
the federal city and the peoples president the modest character of the federal government during the jeffersonian era was symbolized by the newly founded national capital the city of washington d c.
there were many who envisioned that the uncompleted town designed by the french architect pierre lenfant would soon emerge as the paris of the united states.
in reality throughout most of the nineteenth century washington remained little more than a straggling provincial village.
although the population increased steadily from the 165 166 chapter 7 3 200 counted in the 1800 census it never rivaled that of new york philadelphia or the other major cities of the nation and remained a raw inhospitable community.
members of congress viewed washington not as a home but as a place to visit briefly during life in washington d c sessions of the legislature.
most lived in a cluster of simple boardinghouses in the vicinity of the capitol.
it was not unusual for a member of congress to resign his seat in the midst of a session to return home if he had an opportunity to accept the more prestigious post of member of his state legislature.
jefferson was a wealthy planter by background but as president he conveyed to the public an image of plain almost crude disdain for pretension.
like an ordinary citizen he walked to and from his inauguration at the capitol.
in the presidential mansion which had not yet acquired the name white house he disregarded the courtly etiquette of his predecessors.
he did not always bother to dress up prompting the british ambassador to complain of being received by the president in clothes that were indicative of utter slovenliness and indifference to appearances yet jefferson managed to impress most of those who knew him.
he probably had a wider range of interests and accomplishments than any other major political figure in american history with the possible exception of benjamin franklin.
in addition to politics and d iplomacy he was an active architect educator inventor farmer and philosopher scientist.
this 1805 portrait by the noted american painter rembrandt peale shows jefferson at the beginning of his second term as president.
it also conveys through the simplicity of dress and the slightly unkempt hair the image of democratic simplicity that jefferson liked to project as the champion of the common man bettmann corbis thomas jefferson the jeffersonian era 167 jefferson was a shrewd and practical politician.
he worked hard to exert influence as the leader of his party giving direction to republicans in congress by quiet and sometimes even devious means.
although the republicans had objected strenuously to the efforts of their federalist predecessors to build a network of influence through patronage jefferson used his powers of appointment as an effective political weapon.
like washington before him he believed that federal offices should be filled with men loyal to the principles and policies of the administration.
by the end of his second term practically all federal jobs were held by loyal republicans.
jefferson was a popular president and had little difficulty winning reelection against federalist charles c pinckney in 1804.
jefferson won by the overwhelming electoral majority of 162 to 14 and republican membership of both houses of congress increased.
dollars and ships under washington and adams the republicans believed the government had been needlessly extravagant.
yearly federal expenditures had almost tripled between 1793 and 1800 as hamilton had hoped.
the public debt had also risen and an extensive system of internal taxation had been erected.
the jefferson administration moved deliberately to reverse these trends.
in 1802 the president persuaded congress to abolish all internal taxes leaving customs duties and the sale of western lands as the only sources of revenue for the limiting the federal government government.
meanwhile secretary of the treasury albert gallatin drastically reduced government spending.
although jefferson was unable entirely to retire the national debt as he had hoped he did cut it almost in half from 83 million to 45 million.
jefferson also scaled down the armed forces.
he reduced the already tiny army of 4 000 men to 2 500 and pared down the navy from twenty five ships in commission to seven.
anything but the smallest of standing armies he argued might menace civil liberties and civilian control of government.
yet jefferson was not a pacifist.
at the same time that he was reducing the size of the army and navy he helped establish the united states military academy at west point founded in 1802.
and when trouble started brewing overseas he began again to build up the fleet.
such trouble appeared first in the mediterranean off the coast of northern africa.
for years the barbary states of north africa morocco algiers tunis and tripoli had been demanding protection money paid to avoid piracy from all nations whose ships sailed the mediterranean.
during the 1780s and 1790s the united states too had agreed to treaties providing for annual tribute to the barbary states but jefferson showed reluctance to continue this policy of appeasement.
in 1801 the pasha of tripoli forced jeffersons hand.
unhappy with american responses to his demands he ordered the flagpole of the american challenging the barbary pirates consulate chopped down a symbolic declaration of war.
jefferson responded cautiously and built up american naval forces in the area over the next several years.
finally in 1805 he agreed to terms by which the united states ended the payment of tribute to tripoli but paid a substantial and humiliating ransom for the release of american prisoners.
conflict with the courts having won control of the executive and legislative branches of government the republicans looked with suspicion on the judiciary which remained largely in the hands of federalist judges.
soon after jeffersons first inauguration his followers in congress launched an attack on this last preserve of the opposition.
their first step was the repeal 168 chapter 7 of the judiciary act of 1801 thus eliminating the judgeships to which adams had made his midnight appointments the debate over the courts led to one of the most important judicial decisions in the history of the nation.
federalists had long maintained that the supreme court had the authority to nullify acts of congress and the court itself had actually exercised the power of judicial review in 1796 when it upheld the validity of a law passed by congress.
but the courts authority in this area would not be secure it was clear until it actually declared marbury v madison a congressional act unconstitutional.
in 1803 in the case of marbury v madison it did so.
william marbury one of adamss midnight appointments had been named a justice of the peace in the district of columbia.
but his commission although signed and sealed had not been delivered to him before adams left office.
when jefferson took office his secretary of state james madison refused to hand over the commission.
marbury asked the supreme court to direct madison to perform his official duty.
but the court ruled that while marbury had a right to his commission the court had no authority to order madison to deliver it.
on the surface therefore the decision was a victory for the administration.
but of much greater importance than the relatively insignificant matter of marburys commission was the courts reasoning in the decision.
the original judiciary act of 1789 had given the court the power to compel executive officials to act in such matters as the delivery of commissions and it was on that basis that marbury had filed his suit.
but the court ruled that congress had exceeded its authority that the constitution defined the powers of the judiciary and that the legislature had no right to expand them.
the relevant section of the 1789 act was therefore void.
in seeming to deny its own authority the court was in fact radically enlarging it.
the justices had repudiated a relatively minor power the power to force the delivery of a commission by asserting a vastly greater one the power to nullify an act of congress.
the chief justice of the united states at the time of the ruling and until 1835 was john marshall john marshall.
a leading federalist and prominent virginia lawyer he had served john adams as secretary of state.
ironically it was marshall who had failed to deliver marburys commission.
in 1801 just before leaving office adams had appointed him chief justice and almost immediately marshall established himself as the dominant figure of the court shaping virtually all its most important rulings including of course marbury v madison.
through a succession of republican presidents he battled to give the federal government unity and strength.
and in so doing he established the judiciary as a coequal branch of government with the executive and the legislature.
doubling the national domain in the same year jefferson was elected president of the united states napoleon bonaparte made himself ruler of france with the title of first consul.
in the year jefferson was reelected napoleon named himself emperor.
the two men had little in common yet for a time they were of great assistance to each other in international politics.
jefferson and napoleon having failed in a grandiose plan to seize india from the british empire napoleon began to dream of restoring french power in the new world.
the territory east of the mississippi which france had ceded to great britain in 1763 was now part of the united states but the jeffersonian era 169 napoleon hoped to regain the lands west of the mississippi which had belonged to spain since the end of the seven years war.
in 1800 under the secret treaty of san ildefonso france regained title to louisiana which included almost the whole of the mississippi valley to the west of the river.
the louisiana territory would napoleon hoped become the heart of a great french empire in america.
jefferson was unaware at first of napoleons imperial ambitions in america.
for a time he pursued a foreign policy that reflected his well known admiration for france.
but he began to reassess american relations with the french when he importance of new orleans heard rumors of the secret transfer of louisiana.
particularly troubling to jefferson was french control of new orleans the outlet through which the produce of the fast growing western regions of the united states was shipped to the markets of the world.
jefferson was even more alarmed when in the fall of 1802 he learned that the spanish intendant at new orleans who still governed the city since the french had not yet taken formal possession of the region had announced a disturbing new regulation.
american ships sailing the mississippi river had for many years been accustomed to depositing their cargoes in new orleans for transfer to oceangoing vessels.
the intendant now forbade the practice even though spain had guaranteed americans that right in the pinckney treaty of 1795.
westerners demanded that the federal government do something to reopen the river and the president faced a dilemma.
if he yielded to the frontier clamor and tried to change the policy by force he would run the risk of a major war with france.
if he ignored the westerners demands he would lose political support.
but jefferson envisioned another solution.
he instructed robert livingston the american ambassador in paris to negotiate because of its location near the mouth of the mississippi river new orleans was the principal port of western north america in the early nineteenth century.
through it western farmers shipped their produce to markets in the east and europe.
this 1803 painting celebrates the american acquisition of the city from france as part of the louisiana purchase.
chicago history museum usa bridgeman images new orleans in 1803 170 chapter 7 for the purchase of new orleans.
livingston on his own authority proposed that the french sell the united states the rest of louisiana as well.
in the meantime jefferson persuaded congress to appropriate funds for an expansion of the army and the construction of a river fleet and he hinted that american forces might soon descend on new orleans and that the united states might form an alliance with great napoleons offer britain if the problems with france were not resolved.
perhaps in response napoleon suddenly decided to offer the united states the entire louisiana territory.
napoleon had good reasons for the decision.
his plans for an empire in america had already gone seriously awry partly because a yellow fever epidemic had wiped out much of the french army in the new world and partly because the expeditionary force he wished to send to reinforce the troops had been icebound in a dutch harbor through the winter of 1802 1803.
by the time the harbor thawed in the spring of 1803 napoleon was preparing for a renewed war in europe.
he would not he realized have the resources to secure an empire in america.
the louisiana purchase faced with napoleons sudden proposal livingston and james monroe whom jefferson had sent to paris to assist in the negotiations had to decide whether they should accept it even if they had no authorization to do so.
but fearful that napoleon might withdraw the offer they decided to proceed.
after some haggling over the price livingston and monroe signed an agreement with napoleon on april 30 1803.
by the terms of the treaty the united states was to pay a total of 80 million francs 15 million to the french government.
the united states was also to grant certain exclusive commercial privileges to france in the port of new orleans and to incorporate the residents of louisiana into the union with the same rights and privileges as other citizens.
the boundaries of the purchase were not clearly defined.
in washington the president was both pleased and embarrassed when he received the treaty.
he was pleased with the terms of the bargain but he was uncertain about his authority to accept it since the constitution said nothing about the acquisition of new territory.
but jeffersons jeffersons ideological dilemma advisers persuaded him that his treaty making power under the constitution would justify the purchase and congress promptly approved the treaty.
finally late in 1803 general james wilkinson a commissioner of the united states took formal control of the territory.
before long the louisiana territory was organized on the general pattern of the northwest territory with the assumption that it would be divided eventually into states.
the first of these was admitted to the union as the state of louisiana in 1812.
exploring the west meanwhile a series of explorations revealed the geography of the far flung new territory to white americans.
in 1803 jefferson helped plan an expedition that was to cross the continent to the pacific ocean gather geographical information and investigate prospects for trade with native americans.
see consider the source thomas jefferson to meriwether lewis june 20 1803 the expedition began in may 1804.
he named as its leader the twenty nine year old meriwether lewis a veteran of indian wars who was skilled in the ways of the wilderness.

in september 1806 they were back in st louis with elaborate records of the geography and the native civilizations they had observed along the way.
while lewis and clark explored jefferson dispatched other groups to other parts of the louisiana territory.
lieutenant zebulon montgomery pike twenty six years old led an expedition in the fall of 1805 from st louis into the upper mississippi valley.
in the summer of 1806 he set out again proceeding up the valley of the arkansas river and into what later became colorado.
his account of his western travels helped create an enduring and inaccurate impression among most americans that the land between the missouri river and the rockies was an uncultivatable desert.
the burr conspiracy jeffersons triumphant reelection in 1804 suggested that most of the nation approved of the new territorial acquisition.
but some new england federalists raged against it.
they realized that the more new states that joined the union the less power their region and party would retain.

but the leading federalist in new york alexander hamilton refused to support the secessionist scheme.
federalists in new york then turned to hamiltons greatest political rival vice president aaron burr.
burr accepted a federalist proposal that he become their candidate for governor hamilton and burr duel of new york in 1804 and there were rumors that he had also agreed to support the federalist plans for secession.
hamilton accused burr of plotting treason and made numerous private remarks widely reported in the press about burrs despicable character.

but there were also rumors that they wanted to separate the southwest from the union and create a western empire that burr would rule.
there is little evidence that these rumors were true.
whether true or not many of burrs opponents chose to believe the rumors including ultimately jefferson himself.
when burr led a group of armed followers down the ohio river by boat in 1806 disturbing reports flowed into washington the most alarming from wilkinson who had suddenly turned against burr that an attack on new orleans was imminent.
jefferson ordered the arrest of burr and his men as traitors.
burr was brought to richmond for trial.
but to jeffersons chagrin chief justice marshall limited the evidence the government could present and defined the charge in such a way that the jury had little choice but to acquit.
burr soon faded from the public eye.
but when he learned of the texas revolution against mexico years later he said what was treason in me thirty years ago is patriotic now the burr conspiracy was in part the story of a single mans soaring ambitions and flamboyant personality.
but it also exposed the larger perils still facing the new nation.
with a central government that remained deliberately weak with ambitious political leaders willing if necessary to circumvent normal channels in their search for power the legitimacy of the federal government and indeed the existence of the united states as a stable and united nation remained tenuous.
expansion and war two very different conflicts were taking shape in the last years of jeffersons presidency.
one was the continuing tension in europe which in 1803 escalated once again into a full scale conflict the napoleonic wars.
as fighting between the british and the french increased each side took steps to prevent the united states from trading with the other.
the other conflict occurred in north america itself a result of the ceaseless westward expansion of white settlement which was colliding with a native population committed to protecting its lands from intruders.
in both the north and the south the threatened the jeffersonian era 175 tribes mobilized to resist white encroachments.
they began as well to forge connections with british forces in canada and spanish forces in florida.
the indian conflict on land therefore became intertwined with the european conflict on the seas and ultimately helped cause the war of 1812.
conflict on the seas in 1805 at the battle of trafalgar a british fleet virtually destroyed what was left of the french navy.
because france could no longer challenge the british at sea napoleon now chose to pressure england in other ways.
the result was what he called the continental system designed to close the european continent to british trade.
napoleon issued a series of decrees barring british and neutral ships touching at british ports from landing their cargoes at any european port controlled by france or its allies.
the british government replied to napoleons decrees by establishing a blockade of the european coast.
the blockade required that any goods being shipped to napoleons europe be carried either in british vessels or in neutral vessels stopping at british ports precisely what napoleons policies forbade.
in the early nineteenth century the united states had developed one of the most important merchant marines in the world one that soon controlled a large proportion of the trade between europe and the west indies.
but the events in europe now challenged that control because american ships were caught between napoleons decrees and britains blockade.
if they sailed directly for the european continent they risked being captured by the british navy.
if they sailed by way of a british port they ran the risk of seizure by the french.
both of the warring powers were violating americas rights as a neutral nation.
but most americans considered the british with their greater sea power the worse offender especially since british vessels frequently stopped american ships on the high seas and seized sailors off the decks making them victims of impressment impressment many british sailors called their navy with its floggings its low pay and its terrible shipboard conditions a floating hell few volunteered.
most had had to be impressed forced into the service and at every opportunity they deserted.
by 1807 many of these deserters had emigrated to the united states and joined the american merchant marine or american navy.
to check this loss of manpower the british claimed the right to stop and search american merchantmen and reimpress deserters.
they did not claim the right to take native born americans but they did insist on the right to seize naturalized americans born on british soil.
in practice the british navy often made no careful distinctions impressing british deserters and native born americans alike.
in the summer of 1807 the british went to more provocative extremes.
sailing from norfolk with several alleged deserters from the british navy among the crew the american naval frigate chesapeake was hailed by the british ship leopard.
chesapeake leopard incident when the american commander james barron refused to allow the british to search the chesapeake the leopard opened fire.
barron had no choice but to surrender and a boarding party from the leopard dragged four men off the american frigate.
when news of the chesapeake leopard incident reached the united states there was a great popular clamor for revenge.
jefferson and madison tried to maintain the peace.
jefferson expelled all british warships from american waters to lessen the likelihood 176 chapter 7 of future incidents.
then he sent instructions to his minister in england james monroe to demand from the british government an end to impressment.
the british government disavowed the actions of the leopards commanding officer and recalled him it offered compensation for those killed and wounded in the incident and it promised to return three of the captured sailors the fourth had been hanged.
but the british cabinet refused to renounce impressment and instead reasserted its right to recover deserting seamen.
peaceable coercion to prevent future incidents that might bring the nation again to the brink of war jefferson persuaded congress to pass a drastic measure late in 1807.
known as the embargo act jeffersons embargo it prohibited all exports from american ports.
the embargo was widely evaded but it was effective enough to create a serious depression throughout most of the nation.
hardest hit were the merchants and shipowners of the northeast most of them federalists.
the presidential election of 1808 came in the midst of this embargo induced depression.
james madison was elected president but the federalist candidate charles pinckney again ran much more strongly than he had in 1804.
the embargo act was clearly a growing political liability and jefferson decided to back down.
a few days before leaving office he approved a bill ending his experiment with what he called peaceable coercion this cartoon shows a merchant being injured by the terms of the u s embargo which is personified by the snapping turtle.
the word ograbme is embargo spelled backward.
the embargo not only enraged american merchants but also failed to resolve the maritime tensions with the british that ultimately helped lead to war in 1812.
granger nyc all rights reserved.
struggling with the embargo the jeffersonian era 177 to replace the embargo congress passed the non intercourse act just before madison took office.
it reopened trade with all nations but great britain and france.
a year later in 1810 the non intercourse act expired and was replaced by macons bill no.
2 which reopened free commercial relations with britain and france but authorized the president to prohibit commerce with either belligerent if it should continue violating other trade acts neutral shipping after the other had stopped.
napoleon in an effort to induce the united states to reimpose the embargo against britain announced that france would no longer interfere with american shipping.
madison announced that an embargo against great britain alone would automatically go into effect early in 1811 unless britain renounced its restrictions on american shipping.
in time this new limited embargo persuaded england to repeal its blockade of europe.
but the repeal came too late to prevent war.
in any case naval policies were only part of the reason for tensions between britain and the united states.
the indian problem and the british given the ruthlessness with which white settlers in north america had continued to dislodge native tribes it was hardly surprising that indians continued to look to england for protection.
the british in canada for their part had relied on the indians as partners in the lucrative fur trade.
there had been relative peace in the northwest for over a decade after jays treaty and anthony waynes victory over the tribes at fallen timbers in 1794.
but the 1807 war crisis following the chesapeake leopard incident revived the conflict between indians and white settlers.
the virginia born william henry harrison already a veteran of combat against native americans at age twenty six went to washington as the congressional william henry harrison delegate from the northwest territory in 1799.
an advocate of development in the western lands he was largely responsible for the passage in 1800 of the so called harrison land law which enabled white settlers to acquire farms from the public domain on much easier terms than before.
in 1801 jefferson appointed harrison governor of the indiana territory to administer the presidents proposed solution to the indian problem jefferson offered the indians a choice they could convert themselves into settled farmers and become a part of white society or they could migrate west of the mississippi.
in either case they would have to give up their claims to their tribal lands in the northwest.
jefferson considered the assimilation policy a benign alternative to the continuing conflict between indians and white settlers.
but to the tribes the jeffersons assimilation proposal new policy seemed terribly harsh especially given the bludgeonlike efficiency with which harrison set out to implement it.
he used threats bribes trickery and whatever other tactics he felt would help him conclude treaties.
in the first decade of the nineteenth century the number of white americans who had settled west of the appalachians had grown to more than 500 000 a population far larger than that of the native americans.
the tribes would face ever growing pressure to move out of the way of the rapidly growing white settlements.
by 1807 the united states had extracted treaty rights to eastern michigan southern indiana and most of illinois from reluctant tribal leaders.
meanwhile in the southwest white americans were taking millions of acres from other tribes in georgia tennessee and mississippi.
the indians wanted desperately to resist but the separate tribes were helpless by themselves against the power of the united states.
178 chapter 7 yet two new factors emboldened them.
one was the policy of british authorities in canada.
after the chesapeake incident they began to expect an american invasion of canada and therefore renewed efforts to forge alliances with the indians.
a second and more important factor was the rise of two remarkable native leaders tenskwatawa and tecumseh.
tecumseh and the prophet tenskwatawa was a charismatic religious leader and orator known as the prophet like handsome lake he had experienced a mystical awakening in the process of recovering from alcoholism.
having freed himself from what he considered the evil effects of white culture he began to speak to his people of the superior virtues of indian civilization and the sinfulness and corruption of the white world.
in the process he inspired a religious revival that spread through numerous tribes and helped unite them.
the prophets headquarters at the meeting of tippecanoe creek and the wabash river known as prophetstown became a sacred place for people of many tribes.
out of their common religious experiences they began to consider joint military efforts as well.
tenskwatawa advocated an indian society entirely separate from that of white americans and a culture rooted in tribal tradition.
the effort to trade with the anglos and to borrow from their culture would he argued lead to the death of native ways.
tecumseh the chief of the shawnees called by his tribe the shooting star was in many ways even more militant than his brother tenskwatawa.
where today are the pequot he thundered.
the other powerful tribes of our people.
they have vanished before the avarice and oppression of the white man he warned of his tribes extermination if they did not take action against the white americans moving into their lands.
tecumseh understood as few other native leaders had that only through united action could the tribes hope to resist the steady advance of white civilization.
beginning in 1809 he set out to unite all the tribes of the mississippi valley into what became known as the the tecumseh confederacy tecumseh confederacy.
together he promised they would halt white expansion recover the whole northwest and make the ohio river the boundary between the united states and indian country.
he maintained that harrison and others by negotiating treaties with individual tribes had obtained no real title to land.
the land belonged to all the tribes none of them could rightfully cede any of it without the consent of the others.
in 1811 tecumseh left prophetstown and traveled down the mississippi to visit the tribes of the south and persuade them to join the alliance.
during tecumsehs absence governor harrison saw a chance to destroy the growing influence of the two indian leaders.
with 1 000 soldiers he camped near prophetstown and on november 7 1811 he provoked an armed conflict.
although the white forces suffered losses as heavy as those of the native americans harrison drove off the indians battle of tippecanoe and burned the town.
the battle of tippecanoe named for the creek near which it was fought disillusioned many of the prophets followers and tecumseh returned to find the confederacy in disarray.
but there were still warriors eager for combat and by the spring of 1812 they were raiding white settlements along the frontier.
the mobilization of the tribes resulted largely from the indians own initiative but britains agents in canada had encouraged and helped supply the uprising.
to harrison and most white residents of the regions there seemed only one way to make the west safe for americans to drive the british out of canada and annex that province to the united states.
the prophet the jeffersonian era 179 florida and war fever while white frontiersmen in the north demanded the conquest of canada those in the south looked to the acquisition of spanish florida.
the territory was a continuing threat to whites in the southern united states.
enslaved people escaped across the florida border indians in florida launched frequent raids north.
but white southerners also coveted floridas network of rivers that could provide residents of the southwest with access to valuable ports on the gulf of mexico.
in 1810 american settlers in west florida the area presently part of mississippi and louisiana seized the spanish fort at baton rouge and asked the federal government to annex the territory to the united states.
president madison happily agreed and then began planning to get the rest of florida too.
the desire for florida became yet another motivation for war with britain.
spain was britains ally and a war with england might provide an excuse for taking spanish as well as british territory.
by 1812 therefore war fever was raging on both the northern and southern borders of the united states.
the demands of the residents of these areas found substantial support in washington among a group of determined young congressmen who soon war hawks earned the name war hawks in the congressional elections of 1810 voters elected a large number of representatives of both parties eager for war with britain.
the most influential of them came from the new states in the west or from the backcountry of the old states in the south.
two of their leaders both recently elected to the house of representatives were henry clay of kentucky and john c calhoun of south carolina men of great intellect magnetism and ambition.
both were supporters of war with great britain.
clay was elected speaker of the house in 1811 and he appointed calhoun to the crucial committee on foreign affairs.
both men began agitating for the conquest of canada.
madison still preferred peace but was losing control of congress.
on june 18 1812 he approved a declaration of war against britain.
the war of 1812 the british were not eager for an open conflict with the united states.
even after the americans declared war britain largely ignored them for a time.
but in the fall of 1812 napoleon launched a catastrophic campaign against russia that left his army in disarray.
by late 1813 with the french empire on its way to final defeat britain was able to turn its military attention to america.
battles with the tribes in the summer of 1812 american forces invaded canada through detroit.
they soon had to retreat back to detroit and in august surrendered the fort there.
other invasion efforts also failed.
in the meantime fort dearborn later chicago fell before an indian attack.
things went only slightly better for the united states on the seas.
at first american frigates won some spectacular victories over british warships.
but by 1813 the british navy was counterattacking effectively driving the american frigates to cover and imposing a blockade on the united states.
the united states did however achieve significant early military successes on the great lakes.

it shows all the theaters of the war from new orleans to southern canada the extended land and water battle along the canadian border and in the great lakes and the fighting around washington and baltimore.
note how in all these theaters there are about the same number of british and american victories.
what finally brought this inconclusive war to an end.
the war of 1812 raid and burn york now toronto the capital of canada.
american forces then seized control of lake erie mainly through the work of the young oliver hazard perry who engaged and dispersed a british fleet at put in bay on september 10 1813.
this made possible at last a more successful invasion of canada by way of detroit.
william henry harrison pushed up the thames river into upper canada and on october 5 1813 won death of tecumseh a victory notable for the death of tecumseh who was serving as a brigadier general in the british army.
the battle of the thames resulted in no lasting occupation of canada but it weakened and disheartened the native americans of the northwest.
in the meantime another white military leader was striking an even harder blow at indians in the southwest.
the creek supplied by the spaniards in florida had been attacking white settlers near the florida border.
andrew jackson a wealthy tennessee planter and a general in the state militia set off in pursuit of the creek.
on march 27 1814 in the battle of horseshoe bend jacksons men took terrible revenge on the indians the jeffersonian era 181 slaughtering women and children along with warriors.
the tribe agreed to cede most of its lands to the united states and would eventually retreat westward.
defeat and retreat of the creek the vicious battle also won jackson a commission as major general in the united states army and in that capacity he led his men farther south into florida.
on november 7 1814 he seized the spanish fort at pensacola.
battles with the british but the victories over the tribes did not end the war.
after the surrender of napoleon in 1814 england decided to invade the united states.
a british armada the british invasion sailed up the patuxent river from chesapeake bay and landed an army that marched to nearby bladensburg on the outskirts of washington where it dispersed a poorly trained force of american militiamen.
on august 24 1814 the british troops entered washington and put the government to flight.
then they set fire to several public buildings including the white house in retaliation for the earlier american burning of the canadian capital at york.
leaving washington in partial ruins the invading army proceeded up the bay toward baltimore.
but that city guarded by fort mchenry was prepared.
to block the approaching fleet the american garrison had sunk several ships in the patapsco river the entry to baltimores harbor thus forcing the british to bombard the fort from a distance.
through the night of september 13 francis scott key a washington lawyer on board one of the british ships to negotiate the return of prisoners watched the bombardment.
the next morning by the dawns early light he could see the flag on the fort still flying he recorded his pride in the moment by writing a poem the star spangled banner the british withdrew from baltimore and keys words were soon set to the tune of an old english drinking song.
in 1931 the star spangled banner became the official national anthem.
meanwhile american forces repelled another british invasion in northern new york.
at the battle of plattsburgh on september 11 1814 they turned back a much larger british naval and land force.
in the south a formidable array of battle hardened british veterans landed below new orleans and prepared to advance north up the mississippi.
awaiting the british was andrew jackson with a contingent of tennesseans kentuckians creoles blacks pirates and regular army troops drawn up behind earthen breastworks.
on january 8 1815 the redcoats advanced on the american fortifications but the exposed british forces were no match for jacksons well protected men.
after the americans had repulsed several waves of attackers the british finally retreated leaving behind 700 dead 1 400 wounded and 500 prisoners.
jacksons losses were 8 killed and 13 wounded.
only later did news reach north america that the united states and britain battle of new orleans had signed a peace treaty several weeks before the battle of new orleans.
the revolt of new england with a few notable exceptions the military efforts of the united states between 1812 and 1815 had failed.
as a result the republican government became increasingly unpopular.
in new england opposition both to the war and to the republicans was so extreme that some federalists celebrated british victories.
in congress in the federalist opposition to war meantime the republicans had continual trouble with the federalist opposition led by a young congressman from new hampshire named daniel webster.
182 chapter 7 by now the federalists were in the minority in the country but they were still the majority party in new england.
some of them began to dream once again of creating a separate nation.
talk of secession reached a climax in the winter of 1814 1815.
on december 15 1814 delegates from the new england states met in hartford connecticut to discuss their grievances against the madison administration.
the would be the hartford convention seceders at the hartford convention were outnumbered by a comparatively moderate majority.
but while the conventions report only hinted at secession it reasserted the right of nullification and proposed seven amendments to the constitution amendments designed to protect new england from the growing influence of the south and the west.
because the war was going so badly the new englanders assumed that the republicans would have to agree to their demands.
soon after the convention adjourned however the news of jacksons victory at new orleans reached the cities of the northeast.
a day or two later reports of a peace treaty arrived from abroad.
in the changed atmosphere the aims of the hartford convention and the federalist party came to seem futile irrelevant even treasonable.
the peace settlement negotiations between the united states and britain began in august 1814 when american and british diplomats met in ghent belgium.
john quincy adams henry clay and albert gallatin led the american delegation.
although both sides began with extravagant demands the final treaty did little except end the fighting itself.
the americans gave up their demand for a british renunciation of impressment and for the cession of canada to the united states.
the british abandoned their call for the creation of an indian buffer treaty of ghent state in the northwest and made other minor territorial concessions.
the treaty was signed on christmas eve 1814.
both sides had reason to accept this skimpy agreement.
the british exhausted and in debt from their prolonged conflict with napoleon were eager to settle the lesser dispute in north america.
the americans realized that with the defeat of napoleon in europe the british would no longer have much incentive to interfere with american commerce.
other settlements followed the treaty of ghent.
a commercial treaty in 1815 gave americans the right to trade freely with england and much of the british empire.
the rush bagot agreement of 1817 provided for mutual disarmament on the great lakes eventually although not until 1872 the canadian american boundary became the longest unguarded frontier in the world.
for the indian tribes east of the mississippi the conflict dealt another disastrous blow to their ability to resist white expansion.
tecumseh was dead.
the british were gone from the northwest.
and the intertribal alliance of disastrous consequences for native americans tecumseh and the prophet had collapsed.
as the end of the war spurred a new white movement westward the native americans were less able than ever to defend their land.
conclusion thomas jefferson called his election to the presidency the revolution of 1800 and his supporters believed that his victory would bring a dramatic change in the character of the nation a retreat from hamiltons dreams of a powerful developing nation and a return to an ideal of a simple agrarian republic.
the jeffersonian era 183 but american society was changing rapidly making it virtually impossible for the jeffersonian dream to prevail.
the nations population was expanding and diversifying.
its cities were growing and its commercial life was becoming ever more important.
in 1803 jefferson himself made one of the most important contributions to the growth of the united states the louisiana purchase which dramatically expanded the physical boundaries of the nation and which began extending white settlement deeper into the continent.
in the process it greatly widened the battles between europeans and native americans.
the growing national pride and commercial ambitions of the united states gradually created another serious conflict with great britain the war of 1812 a war that was settled finally in 1814 on terms at least mildly favorable to the united states.
by then the bitter party rivalries that had characterized the first years of the republic had to some degree subsided and the nation was poised to enter what became known quite inaccurately as the era of good feelings key terms people places events aaron burr 174 cane ridge 158 capitalists 161 deism 158 eli whitney 162 embargo 176 handsome lake 159 hartford convention 182 impressment 175 industrial revolution 160 john marshall 168 judith sargent murray 156 lewis and clark 170 marbury v madison 168 noah webster 157 robert fulton 163 secession 174 second great awakening 158 tecumseh 178 the prophet tenskwatawa war hawks 179 war of 1812 179 washington irving 157 washington d c 165 william henry harrison 177 recall and reflect 1.

like a fire bell in the night as thomas jefferson said the issue of slavery arose after the war of 1812 to threaten the unity of the nation.
the debate began when the territory of missouri applied for admission to the union raising the question of whether it would be a free or a slaveholding state.
but the larger issue was whether the vast new western regions of the united states would ultimately align politically with the north or the south.
the missouri crisis was significant because it was a sign of sectional crises to come.
but at the time it was also significant because it stood in such sharp contrast to the rising american nationalism of the years following the war.
whatever forces might have been working to pull the nation apart stronger ones were acting at least for a time to draw it together.
184 stabilizing economic growth time line the end of the war of 1812 allowed the united states to resume its economic growth and territorial expansion.
yet a vigorous postwar boom led to a disastrous bust in 1819.
this collapse was evidence that the united states continued to lack some of the basic institutions necessary to sustain longterm growth.
u s treaties take western lands from indians the government and economic growth the war of 1812 produced chaos in shipping and banking and it exposed dramatically the inadequacy of the nations existing transportation and financial systems.
the aftermath of the war therefore led to new efforts to strengthen national economic development.
the wartime experience underlined the need for another national bank.
after the expiration of the first banks charter a large number of state banks had issued vast quantities of banknotes creating a confusing variety of currency of widely differing value.
it was difficult to tell what any banknote was really worth and counterfeiting was easy.
in response to these problems congress chartered a second bank of the united states in 1816 much like its predecessor of 1791 but with more capital.
the national bank could not forbid state banks from issuing notes but its size and power enabled it to compel the state banks to issue only sound notes or risk being forced out of business.
congress also acted to promote manufacturing which the war by cutting off imports had already greatly stimulated.
the american textile industry in particular had grown dramatically.
between 1807 and 1815 the total number of cotton spindles in the country increased more than fifteenfold from 8 000 to 130 000.
before the war the textile factories most of them in new england produced only yarn and thread families second bank of u s monroe elected president seminole war ends panic and depression dartmouth college v woodward mcculloch v maryland missouri compromise monroe reelected monroe doctrine john quincy adams elected president tariff of abominations jackson elected president 185.
186 chapter 8 o perating hand looms at home did the actual weaving of cloth.
then the boston merchant francis cabot lowell after examining textile machinery in england developed a power loom better lowell mill than its english counterpart.
in 1813 in waltham massachusetts lowell founded the first mill in america to carry on the processes of spinning and weaving under a single roof.
the end of the war suddenly dimmed the prospects for american industry.
british ships swarmed into american ports and unloaded cargoes of manufactured goods many priced the protective tariff below cost.
in response in 1816 protectionists in congress passed a tariff law that effectively limited competition from abroad on a wide range of items including cotton cloth despite objections from agricultural interests who stood to pay higher prices for manufactured goods.
transportation the nations most pressing economic need was a better transportation system to link the vast territories of the growing united states.
an old debate resumed should the federal government help finance roads and other internal improvements.
the idea of using government funds to finance road building was not a new one.
when ohio entered the union in 1803 the federal government agreed that part of the proceeds from the sale of public lands there should finance road construction.
and in 1807 congress enacted a law proposed by the jefferson the national road administration that permitted using revenues from ohio land sales to finance a national road from the potomac river to the ohio.
by 1818 the highway ran as far as wheeling virginia on the ohio river and the lancaster pike financed in part by the state of pennsylvania extended westward to pittsburgh.
at the same time steam powered shipping was expanding rapidly.
by 1816 river steamers were sailing up the mississippi to the ohio river and up the ohio as far as pittsburgh.
steamboats on the hudson inventor robert fulton developed an engine that could propel a boat from manhattan to albany a distance of about 150 miles in 32 hours.
his steam powered vessels were the first to be large and reliable enough for commercial use.
photo tarker bridgeman images varieties of american nationalism 187 steamboats were soon carrying more cargo on the mississippi than all the earlier forms of river transport flatboats barges and others combined.
they stimulated the agricultural economy of the west and the south by providing cheaper access to markets and they enabled eastern manufacturers to send their finished goods west much more readily.
nevertheless serious gaps in the nations transportation network remained as the war of 1812 had shown.
once the british blockade had cut off atlantic shipping the coastal roads had become choked by the unaccustomed volume of north south traffic.
congress passed a bill introduced by representative john c calhoun that would use government funds to finance internal improvements.
but president james madison on his last day in office vetoed it.
he believed that congress lacked authority to fund the improvements without a constitutional amendment.
for a time state governments and private enterprise were left on their own to build the transportation network necessary for the growing american economy.
expanding westward another reason for the rising interest in internal improvements was the dramatic westward surge of white americans.
by 1820 white settlers had pushed well beyond the mississippi river and the population of western regions was increasing more rapidly than the rest of the nation.
the great migration the westward movement of the white american population was one of the most important developments of the nineteenth century.
it occurred for several reasons.
one was population growth which drove many white americans out of the crowded east.
between 1800 and 1820 the american population nearly doubled from 5 3 million to 9 6 million.
most americans were still farmers and the agricultural lands of the east were by now largely occupied or exhausted.
in the south the spread of the plantation system limited opportunities for new settlers.
another reason for westward migration reasons for westward expansion was that the west itself was increasingly attractive to white s ettlers.
land there was much more plentiful than in the east.
and in the aftermath of the war of 1812 the federal government continued its policy of pushing native americans farther and farther west signing treaties in 1815 that took more land from the tribes.
migrants from throughout the east flocked in increasing numbers to what was then known as the old northwest now part of the midwest.
most settlers floated downstream on flatboats on the ohio river then left the river often at cincinnati and traveled overland with wagons handcarts packhorses cattle and hogs.
white settlers in the old northwest having arrived at their new lands most settlers built lean tos or cabins hewed clearings out of the forest and planted crops of corn to supplement wild game and domestic animals.
it was a rough and lonely existence.
men women and children worked side by side in the fields and at times had virtually no outside contact for weeks or months.
life in the western territories was not however entirely solitary or individualistic.
migrants often journeyed westward in groups and built communities with schools churches and stores.
the labor shortage in the interior led neighbors to develop systems of mutual aid.
they gathered periodically to raise a barn clear land or harvest crops.
another common feature of life in the old northwest was mobility.
individuals and families were constantly on the move settling for a few years in one place and then selling 188 chapter 8 their land often at a significant profit and resettling somewhere else.
when new areas for settlement opened farther to the west it was often the people already on the western edges of white settlement rather than those coming from the east who flocked to them first.
the plantation system in the old southwest in the old southwest later known as the deep south the new agricultural economy emerged along different lines.
the market for cotton continued to grow and the old southwest conthe black belt region tained a broad zone where cotton could thrive.
that zone became known as the black belt a region of dark productive soil in alabama and mississippi.
the first arrivals in the uncultivated regions of the old southwest were usually small farmers who made rough clearings in the forest.
but wealthier planters soon followed.
they bought up the cleared land as the original settlers moved farther west.
success in the wilderness was by no means assured even for the wealthiest settlers.
many planters managed to do little more than subsist in their new environment and others experienced utter ruin.
but some planters soon expanded small clearings into vast cotton fields.
they replaced the cabins of the early pioneers with more sumptuous log dwellings and ultimately with imposing mansions.
they also built up large slave workforces.
the rapid growth of the old northwest and southwest resulted in the admission of four new states four new states to the union indiana in 1816 mississippi in 1817 illinois in 1818 and alabama in 1819.
trade and trapping in the far west not many anglo americans yet knew much about the far western areas of the continent.
nevertheless a significant trade began to develop between these western regions and the united states early in the nineteenth century and it grew steadily for decades.
mexico which continued to control texas california and much of the rest of the far southwest won its independence from spain in 1821.
almost immediately it opened its trade with mexican territories northern territories to trade with the united states.
american traders poured into the region and quickly displaced indian and mexican traders.
in new mexico for example the missouri merchant william becknell began in 1821 to offer american manufactured goods for sale priced considerably below the inferior mexican goods that had dominated the market in the past.
mexico effectively lost its markets in its own colony as a steady traffic of commercial wagon trains began moving back and forth along the santa fe trail between missouri and new mexico.
fur traders created a wholly new kind of commerce.
after the war of 1812 john jacob astors american fur company and other firms extended their operations from the great white trappers in the west lakes area westward to the rockies.
at first fur traders did most of their business by purchasing pelts from the indians.
but increasingly white trappers entered the region and joined the iroquois and other indians in pursuit of beaver and other furs.
the trappers or mountain men who began trading in the far west were small in number.
but they developed important relationships with the existing residents of the west indian and mexican and altered the character of society there.
white trappers were mostly young single men.
many of them entered into sexual relationships with indian and mexican women.
they also recruited women as helpers in the difficult work of preparing furs and skins for trading.
in some cases though white trappers clashed violently with the mojave and other tribes.
in 1822 andrew and william ashley founded the rocky mountain fur company and recruited white trappers to move permanently into the rockies.
the ashleys d ispatched varieties of american nationalism 189 the annual rendezvous of fur trappers and traders was a major event for the lonely men who made their livelihoods gathering furs.
it was also a gathering of representatives of the many cultures that mingled in the far west among them anglo americans native americans and people of spanish origins.
walters art museum baltimore usa bridgeman images the rendezvous s upplies annually to their trappers in exchange for furs and skins.
the arrival of the supply train became the occasion for a gathering of scores of mountain men some of whom lived much of the year in considerable isolation.
but however isolated their daily lives these mountain men were closely bound up with the expanding market economy an economy in which the bulk of the profits from the trade flowed to the merchants not the trappers.
eastern images of the west americans in the east were only dimly aware of the world of the trappers.
they were more aware of the explorers many of them dispatched by the united states government.
in 1819 and 1820 the war department ordered stephen h long to journey stephen h longs expedition up the platte and south platte rivers through what is now nebraska and eastern colorado where he discovered the peak that would be named for him.
he then returned eastward along the arkansas river through what is now kansas.
long wrote an influential report on his trip which echoed the dismissive conclusions of zebulon pike fifteen years before.
the region between the missouri river and the rocky mountains long wrote is almost wholly unfit for cultivation and of course uninhabitable by a people depending upon agriculture for their subsistence on the published map of his expedition he labeled the great plains the great american desert the era of good feelings the expansion of the economy the growth of white settlement and trade in the west the creation of new states all reflected the rising spirit of nationalism that was spreading through the united states in the years following the war of 1812.
that spirit found reflection for a time as well in the character of national politics.
190 chapter 8 the end of the first party system ever since 1800 the presidency seemed to have been the possession of virginians.
after two terms in office jefferson secured the presidential nomination for his secretary of state james madison and after two more terms madison did the same for his secretary of state james the virginia dynasty monroe.
many in the north expressed impatience with the s o called virginia dynasty but the republicans had no difficulty electing their candidate in 1816.
monroe received 183 ballots in the electoral college his federalist opponent rufus king of new york received only 34.
monroe entered office under what seemed to be remarkably favorable circumstances.
with the decline of the federalists his party faced no serious opposition.
and with the conclusion of the war of 1812 the nation faced no important international threats.
some american politicians had dreamed since the first days of the republic of a time in which partisan divisions and factional disputes might come to an end.
in the prosperous postwar years monroe attempted to use his office to realize that dream.
he made that clear above all in the selection of his cabinet.
for secretary of state he chose former federalist john quincy adams of massachusetts son of the second president.
jefferson madison and monroe had all served as secretary of state before becoming president adams therefore immediately became the heir apparent suggesting that the virginia dynasty would soon come to an end.
speaker of the house henry clay declined an offer to be secretary of war so monroe named john c calhoun instead.
celebrations of independence day like this one in new york city became major festive events throughout the united states in the early nineteenth century a sign of rising american nationalism.
north wind picture archives alamy celebrating the nation varieties of american nationalism 191 soon after his inauguration monroe made a goodwill tour through the country.
in new england so recently the scene of rabid federalist discontent he was monroes goodwill tour greeted everywhere with enthusiastic demonstrations.
the columbian centinel a federalist newspaper in boston observed that an era of good feelings had arrived.
and on the surface at least that seemed to be the case.
in 1820 monroe was reelected without opposition.
for all practical purposes the federalist party had ceased to exist.
john quincy adams and florida john quincy adams had spent much of his life in diplomatic service before becoming secretary of state.
he was a committed nationalist and he considered his most important task to be the promotion of american expansion.
his first challenge was florida.
the united states had already annexed west florida but that claim was in dispute.
most americans moreover still believed the nation should gain possession of the entire peninsula.
in 1817 adams began negotiations with the spanish minister luis de ons over the territory.
in the meantime however events in florida were taking their own course.
andrew jackson now in command of american troops along the florida frontier had orders from secretary of war calhoun to adopt the necessary measures to stop continuing raids on american territory by seminole indians south of the border.
jackson used the seminole war those orders as an excuse to invade florida and seize the spanish forts at st marks and pensacola.
the operation became known as the seminole war.
instead of condemning jacksons raid adams urged the government to assume responsibility for it.
the united states he said had the right under international law to defend itself against threats from across its borders.
jacksons raid demonstrated to the spanish that the united states could easily take florida by force.
adams implied that the nation might consider doing so.
ons realized therefore that he had little choice but to negotiate a settlement.
under the provisions of the adams ons treaty of 1819 spain ceded all of adams ons treaty florida to the united states and gave up its claim to territory north of the 42nd parallel in the pacific northwest.
in return the american government gave up its claims to texas for a time.
the panic of 1819 the monroe administration had little time to revel in its diplomatic successes for the nation was facing a serious economic crisis the panic of 1819.
it followed a period of high foreign demand for american farm goods and thus of exceptionally high prices for american farmers.
but the rising prices for farm goods stimulated a land boom in the western united states.
fueled by speculative investments land prices soared.
the availability of easy credit to settlers and speculators from the government under the land acts of 1800 and 1804 from state banks and wildcat banks even for a time from the rechartered bank of the united states fueled the land boom.
beginning in 1819 however new management at the national bank began tightening credit calling in loans and foreclosing mortgages.
this precipitated a series of failures by state banks.
the result was a financial panic.
six years of depression followed.
some americans saw the panic of 1819 and the widespread distress that followed as a warning that rapid economic growth and territorial expansion would destabilize the nation.
but by 1820 most americans were irrevocably committed to the idea of growth and expansion.
192 chapter 8 sectionalism and nationalism for a brief but alarming moment in 1819 1820 the increasing differences between the north and the south threatened the unity of the united states until the missouri compromise averted a sectional crisis.
the missouri compromise when missouri applied for admission to the union as a state in 1819 slavery was already well established there.
even so representative james tallmadge jr of new york proposed an tallmadge amendment amendment to the missouri statehood bill that would prohibit the further introduction of slaves into missouri and provide for the gradual emancipation of those already there.
the tallmadge amendment provoked a controversy that raged for the next two years.
since the beginning of the republic new states had come into the union mostly in pairs one from the north another from the south.
in 1819 there were eleven free states and eleven slave states.
the admission of missouri would upset that balance.
hence the controversy over slavery and freedom in missouri.
complicating the missouri question was the admission of maine as a new and free henry clays maneuvers state.
speaker of the house henry clay informed northern members that if they blocked missouri from entering the union as a slave state southerners would block the admission of maine.
but ultimately the senate agreed to combine the maine and b r i t i s h c a n a da gr ea maine t l a k vt e mi c hi g a n n h s oregon country occupied by united states and britain mass.

gulf of mexico the missouri compromise 1820 this map illustrates the way in which the missouri compromise proposed to settle the controversy over slavery in the new western territories of the united states.
the compromise rested on the virtually simultaneous admission of missouri and maine to the union one a slave state and the other a free one.
note the red line extending beyond the southern border of missouri which in theory established a permanent boundary between areas in which slavery could be established and areas where it could not be.
what precipitated the missouri compromise.
varieties of american nationalism 193 missouri proposals into a single bill.
maine would be admitted as a free state missouri as a slave state.
then senator jesse b thomas of illinois proposed an amendment prohibiting slavery in the rest of the louisiana purchase territory north of the southern boundary of missouri the 3630 parallel.
the senate adopted the thomas amendment and speaker clay with great difficulty guided the amended maine missouri bill through the house.
nationalists in both the north and south hailed this settlement which became known as the missouri compromise as the happy resolution of a danger to the union.
former president thomas jefferson was less convinced that sectional harmony would last.
see consider the source thomas jefferson reacts to the missouri compromise marshall and the court john marshall served as chief justice of the united states from 1801 to 1835.
more than anyone but the framers themselves he molded the development of the constitution strengthening the supreme court increasing the power of the federal government and advancing the interests of the propertied and commercial classes.
the imposing figure in this image is john marshall the most important chief justice of the supreme court in american history.
a former secretary of state marshall served as chief justice from 1801 until his death in 1835 at the age of eighty.
such was the power of his intellect and personality that he dominated his fellow justices throughout that period regardless of their previous party affiliations or legal ideologies.
marshall established the independence of the court gave it a reputation for nonpartisan integrity and established its powers which were only vaguely described by the constitution.

jefferson wonders how the union will hold together amid sharp disagreements over slavery and westward expansion.
monticello april 22 1820 i thank you dear sir for the copy you have been so kind as to send me of the letter to your constituents on the missouri question.
it is a perfect justification to them.
i had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or pay any attention to public affairs confident they were in good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which i am not distant.
but this momentous question like a firebell in the night awakened and filled me with terror.
i considered it at once as the knell of the union.
it is hushed indeed for the m oment.
but this is a reprieve only not a final sentence.
a geographical line coinciding with a marked principle moral and political once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men will never be obliterated and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper.
i can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than i would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way.
the cession of that kind of property for so it is misnamed is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected and gradually and with due sacrifices i think it might be.
but as it is we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him 194 nor safely let him go.
justice is in one scale and self preservation in the other.
of one thing i am certain that as the passage of slaves from one state to another would not make a slave of a single human being who would not be so without it so their diffusion over a greater surface would make them individually happier and proportionally facilitate the accomplishment of their emancipation by dividing the burden on a greater number of coadjutors.
an abstinence too from this act of power would remove the jealousy excited by the undertaking of congress to regulate the condition of the different descriptions of men composing a state.
this certainly is the exclusive right of every state which nothing in the constitution has taken from them and given to the general government.
could congress for example say that the non freemen of connecticut shall be freemen or that they shall not emigrate into any other state.
i regret that i am now to die in the belief that the useless sacrifice of themselves by the generation of 76 to acquire self government and happiness to their country is to be thrown away by the u nwise and unworthy passions of their sons and that my only consolation is to be that i live not to weep over it.
if they would but dispassionately weigh the blessings they will throw away against an abstract principle more likely to be effected by union than by scission they would pause before they would perpetrate this act of suicide on themselves and of treason against the hopes of the world.
to yourself as the faithful advocate of the union i tender the offering of my high esteem and respect.

committed to promoting commerce the marshall court staunchly defended the inviolability of contracts.
in fletcher v peck 1810 which arose out of a series of notorious land frauds in georgia the court had to decide whether the georgia legislature of 1796 could repeal the act of the previous legislature granting lands under shady circumstances to the yazoo land companies.
in a unanimous decision marshall held that a land grant was a valid contract and could not be repealed even if corruption was involved.
dartmouth college v woodward 1819 further expanded the meaning of the contract clause of the constitution.
having gained control of the new dartmouth college v woodward hampshire state government republicans tried to revise dartmouth colleges charter to convert the private college into a state university.
daniel webster argued the colleges case.
the dartmouth charter he insisted was a contract protected by the same doctrine that the court had already upheld in fletcher v peck.
the court ruled for dartmouth proclaiming that corporation charters such as the one the colonial legislature had granted the college were contracts and thus inviolable.
the decision placed important restrictions on the ability of state governments to control corporations.
in overturning the act of the legislature and the decisions of the new hampshire courts the justices also implicitly claimed for themselves the right to override the decisions of state courts.
but advocates of states rights especially in the south continued to challenge this right.
in cohens v virginia 1821 marshall explicitly affirmed the constitutionality of federal review of state court decisions.
the states had given up part of their sovereignty in ratifying the constitution he explained and their courts must submit to federal jurisdiction.
meanwhile in mcculloch v maryland 1819 marshall confirmed the implied powers of congress by upholding the constitutionality of the bank of the united mcculloch v maryland states.
the bank had become so unpopular in the south and the west that several of the states tried to drive branches out of business.
this case presented two constitutional questions to the supreme court could congress charter a bank.
and if so could individual states ban it or tax it.
daniel webster one of the banks attorneys argued that establishing such an institution came within the necessary and proper clause of the constitution and that the power to tax involved a power to destroy if the states could tax the bank at all they could tax it to death.
marshall adopted websters words in deciding for the bank.
in the case of gibbons v ogden 1824 the court strengthened congresss power to regulate interstate commerce.
the state of new york had granted the steamboat gibbons v ogden company of robert fulton and robert livingston the exclusive right to carry passengers on the 195 196 chapter 8 hudson river to new york city.
fulton and livingston then gave aaron ogden the business of carrying passengers across the river between new york and new jersey.
but thomas gibbons who had a license granted by congress began competing with ogden for the ferry traffic.
ogden brought suit against him and won in the new york courts.
gibbons appealed to the supreme court.
the most important question facing the justices was whether congresss power to give gibbons a license superseded the state of new yorks power to grant ogden a monopoly.
marshall claimed that the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce which he said included navigation was complete in itself and might be exercised to its utmost extent ogdens state granted monopoly therefore was void.
the highly nationalist decisions of the marshall court established the primacy of the federal primacy established federal government over the states in regulating the economy and opened the way for an increased federal role in promoting economic growth.
they protected corporations and other private economic institutions from local government interference.
the court and the tribes the nationalist inclinations of the marshall court were visible as well in a series of decisions concerning the legal status of indian tribes.
but these decisions did not simply affirm the supremacy of the united states they also carved out a distinctive position for native americans within the constitutional structure.
the first of the crucial indian decisions was johnson v mcintosh 1823.
leaders of the illinois and pinakeshaw tribes had sold parcels of their land to a group of white settlers including johnson but had later signed a treaty with the federal government ceding territory that included those same parcels to the united states.
the government proceeded to grant homestead rights to new white settlers among them mcintosh on the land claimed by johnson.
the court was asked to decide which claim had precedence.
marshalls ruling not surprisingly favored the united states.
but in explaining it he offered a preliminary definition of the place of indians within the nation.
the tribes had a basic right to their tribal lands he said that preceded all other american law.
individual american citizens could not buy or take land from the tribes only the federal government the supreme authority could do that.
even more important was the courts 1832 decision in worcester v georgia in which the worcester v georgia court invalidated a georgia law that attempted to regulate access by u s citizens to cherokee country.
only the federal government could do that marshall claimed.
the tribes he explained were sovereign entities in much the same way georgia was a sovereign entity distinct political communities having territorial boundaries within which their authority is exclusive in defending the power of the federal government he was also affirming indeed expanding the rights of the tribes to remain free from the authority of state governments.
the marshall decisions therefore did what the constitution itself had not they defined a place for indian tribes within the american political system.
the tribes had basic property rights.
they were sovereign entities not subject to the authority of state governments.
but the federal government like a guardian governing its ward had ultimate authority over tribal affairs.
the latin american revolution and the monroe doctrine just as the supreme court was asserting american nationalism in shaping the countrys economic life so the monroe administration was asserting nationalism in formulating foreign policy.
american diplomacy had been principally concerned with europe.
but in the 1820s dealing with europe forced the united states to develop a policy toward latin america.
varieties of american nationalism 197 sequoyah who also used the name george guess was a mixed blood cherokee who translated his tribes language into writing through an elaborate syllabary equivalent to an alphabet of his own invention pictured here.
he opposed indian assimilation into white society and saw the preservation of the cherokee language as a way to protect the culture of his tribe.
he moved to arkansas in the 1820s and became a chief of the western cherokee tribes.
hulton archive getty images cherokee leader sequoyah americans looking southward in the years following the war of 1812 beheld a gigantic spectacle the spanish empire in its death throes and a whole continent in revolt.
already the united states had developed a profitable trade with latin america.
many believed the success of the anti spanish revolutions would further strengthen americas position in the region.
in 1815 the united states proclaimed neutrality in the wars between spain and its rebellious colonies.
but the united states sold ships and supplies to the revolutionaries a clear indication that it was trying to help the revolutions.
finally in 1822 president monroe established diplomatic relations with five new nations la plata later argentina chile peru colombia and mexico making the united states the first country to recognize them.
in 1823 monroe went further and announced a policy that would ultimately be known beginning some thirty years later as the monroe doctrine even the monroe doctrine though it was primarily the work of john quincy adams.
the american continents monroe declared are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers the united states would consider any foreign challenge to the sovereignty of existing american nations as an unfriendly act.
at the same time he proclaimed our policy in regard to europe.
is not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers 198 chapter 8 the monroe doctrine emerged directly out of americas relations with europe in the 1820s.
many americans feared that spains european allies notably france would help spain retake its lost empire.
even more troubling was the fear that great britain had designs on cuba.
monroe and adams wanted to keep cuba in spanish hands until it fell to the americans.
the monroe doctrine had few immediate effects but it was important as an expression of the growing spirit of nationalism in the united states in the 1820s.
and it established the idea of the united states as the dominant power in the western hemisphere.
the revival of opposition after 1816 the federalist party ceased to exist.
the republican party became the only national political organization in america for a short time.
in many ways it now resembled the defunct federalist party in its commitment to economic growth and centralized government.
but divisions were growing just as they had in the late eighteenth century.
by the 1820s a two party system was emerging once again.
the mighty republican party split apart and two new parties emerged.
one was the democratic republican party later the democrats which leaned toward the old jeffersonian vision of a decentralized nation.
the democrats opposed the federal governments growing role in the economy.
the other party was the national republican party later the whigs which leaned toward the old federalists belief in a centralized government.
the whigs believed in a strong national bank and a centralized economy.
both parties believed in economic growth and expansion.
but they disagreed on whether the national government should oversee the economy or whether the economy should be decentralized without interference.
the corrupt bargain until 1820 presidential candidates were nominated by party caucuses in congress.
but in 1824 king caucus was overthrown.
the republican caucus nominated william h crawford of georgia the favorite of the extreme states rights faction of the party.
but other candidates received nominations from state legislatures and won endorsements from irregular mass meetings throughout the country.
one of them was secretary of state john quincy adams.
but he was a man of cold and forbidding manners with little popular appeal.
another contender was henry clay the speaker of the house.
he had a devoted personal following and a definite and coherent program the american system which proposed creating a great home market for factory and farm producers by raising the protective tariff strengthening the national bank and financing internal improvements.
andrew jackson the fourth major candidate had no significant political record even though he was a new member of the united states senate.
but he was a military hero and had the help of shrewd political allies from his home state of tennessee.
jackson received more popular and electoral votes than any other candidate but not a majority.
the twelfth amendment to the constitution passed in the aftermath of the disputed election contested 1800 election required the house of representatives to choose among the three candidates with the largest numbers of electoral votes.
crawford was seriously ill clay was out of the running but he was in a strong position to influence the result.
jackson was clays most dangerous political rival in the west so clay supported adams in part because adams was an ardent nationalist and a likely supporter of the american system.
with clays endorsement adams won election in the house.
varieties of american nationalism 199 the jacksonians believed that their large popular and electoral pluralities entitled their candidate to the presidency and they were enraged when he lost.
but they grew angrier still when adams named clay his secretary of state.
the state department was the wellestablished route to the presidency and adams thus appeared to be naming clay as his own successor.
the outrage the jacksonians expressed at what they called a corrupt bargain haunted adams throughout his presidency.
the second president adams adams proposed an ambitiously nationalist program reminiscent of clays american system but jacksonians in congress blocked most of it.
adams also experienced diplomatic frustrations.
he appointed delegates to an international conference that the diplomatic frustrations venezuelan liberator simn bolvar had called in panama in 1826.
but haiti was one of the participating nations and southerners in congress opposed the idea of white americans mingling with the black delegates.
congress delayed approving the panama mission so long that the american delegation did not arrive until after the conference was over.
even more damaging to the administration was its support for a new tariff on imported goods in 1828.
this measure originated with the demands of new england woolen manufacturers.
but to win support from middle and western states the administration had to accept duties on other items.
in the process it antagonized the original supporters of the bill the benefits of protecting their manufactured goods from foreign competition now had to be weighed against the prospects of having to pay the tariff of abominations more for raw materials.
adams signed the bill earning the animosity of southerners who cursed it as the tariff of abominations jackson triumphant by the time of the 1828 presidential election the new two party system was now in place.
on one side stood the supporters of john quincy adams and the national republicans.
opposing them were the followers of andrew jackson known simply as democrats.
adams attracted the support of most of the remaining federalists jackson appealed to a broad coalition that opposed the economic aristocracy but issues seemed to count for little in the end as the campaign degenerated into a war of personal invective.
the jacksonians charged that adams had been guilty of gross waste and extravagance.
adamss supporters hurled even worse accusations at jackson.
they called him a murderer and distributed a coffin handbill which listed within coffin shaped outlines the names of militiamen whom jackson was said to have shot in cold blood during the war of 1812.
the men had been deserters who were legally executed after sentence by a court martial.
and they called his wife a bigamist.
jackson had married his beloved rachel at a time when the pair incorrectly believed her first husband had divorced her.
when jacksons wife read of the accusations against her she collapsed and a few weeks later died.
jacksons victory was decisive but sectional.
adams swept virtually all of new england and showed significant strength in the mid atlantic region.
nevertheless the jacksonians considered their victory as complete and as important as jeffersons in 1800.
once again the forces of privilege had been driven from washington.
once again a champion of democracy would occupy the white house.
america had entered some jacksonians claimed a new era of democracy the era of the common man 200 chapter 8 conclusion in the aftermath of the war of 1812 a vigorous nationalism increasingly came to characterize the political and popular culture of the united states.
in all regions of the country white men and women celebrated the achievements of the early leaders of the republic the genius of the constitution and the success of the nation in withstanding serious challenges from both without and within.
party divisions faded.
but the broad nationalism of the era of good feelings disguised some deep divisions.
indeed the character of american nationalism differed substantially from one region and one group to another.
battles continued between those who favored a strong central government committed to advancing the economic development of the nation and those who wanted a decentralization of power to open opportunity to more people.
battles continued as well over the role of slavery in american life and in particular over the place of slavery in the new western territories.

some feared that rapid growth would produce social chaos they insisted that the countrys first priority was to establish order and a clear system of authority.
others argued that the greatest danger facing the nation was the growth of inequality and privilege they wanted to eliminate the favored status of powerful elites and make opportunity more widely available.
advocates of this latter vision seized control of the federal government in 1829 with the inauguration of andrew jackson.

after the ceremonies the crowd poured into a public reception at the white house where in their eagerness to shake the new presidents hand they filled the state rooms to overflowing trampled one another soiled the carpets and damaged the upholstery.
it was a proud day for the people wrote amos kendall one of jacksons closest political associates.
supreme court justice joseph story a friend and colleague of john marshall remarked with disgust the reign of king mob seems triumphant in fact the age of jackson was much less a triumph of the common people than kendall hoped and story feared.
but it did mark a transformation of american politics.
once restricted to a relatively small elite of property owners politics now became open to virtually all the nations white male citizens.
in a political sense at least the period had some claim to the title the jacksonians gave it the era of the common man the expanding democracy what some have called the age of jackson did not really bring economic equality.
the distribution of wealth and property in america was little different at the end of the jacksonian era than it had been at the start.
but it did mark a transformation of american politics that widely extended to new groups the right to vote.
until the 1820s relatively few americans had been permitted to vote.
most states restricted the franchise to white male property owners or taxpayers or both.
but even before jacksons election the franchise began to expand.
change came first in ohio and other new states of the west which on jacksonian america 203 joining the union adopted constitutions that guaranteed all adult white males not just property owners or taxpayers the right to vote and permitted all voters the right to hold public office.
older states concerned about the loss of their population to the west began to drop or reduce their own property ownership or taxpaying requirements.
the wave of state reforms was generally peaceful but in rhode island democratization efforts created considerable instability.
the rhode island constitution barred more than half the adult males in the state from voting in the 1830s.
in 1840 the lawyer and activist thomas l dorr and a group of his followers formed a peoples party held a convention drafted a new constitution and submitted it to a popular vote.
it was overwhelmingly approved and the dorrites began to set up a new government with dorr as governor.
the existing legislature however rejected the legitimacy of dorrs constitution.
and so in 1842 two governments were claiming power in rhode island.
the old state government declared dorr and his followers rebels and began to imprison them.
the dorrites meanwhile made an ineffectual effort to capture the state the dorr rebellion arsenal.
the dorr rebellion as it was known quickly failed but the episode helped spur the old guard to draft a new constitution that greatly expanded suffrage.
the democratization process was far from complete.
in the south of course no slaves could vote.
in addition southern election laws continued to favor the planters and politicians of the older counties.
free blacks could not vote anywhere in the south and hardly anywhere in the north.
in no state could women vote.
nowhere was the ballot secret and often it was cast as a spoken vote which meant that voters could be easily bribed or intimidated.
despite the persisting limitations however the number of voters increased much more rapidly than did the population as a whole.
this scene of an election day gathering is peopled almost entirely by white men.
women and blacks were barred from voting but political rights expanded substantially in the 1830s and 1840s among white males.

204 chapter 9 one of the most striking political trends of the early nineteenth century was the change in the method of choosing presidential electors.
in 1800 the legislatures had chosen the presidential electors in ten states the electors were chosen by the people in only six states.
by 1828 electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but south carolina.
in the presidential election of 1824 fewer than 27 percent of adult white males had voted.
only four years later the figure was 58 percent and in 1840 80 percent.
tocqueville and democracy in america the rapid growth of the electorate and the emergence of political parties was among the most striking events of the early nineteenth century.
as the right to vote spread widely in these years it came to be the mark of freedom and democracy.
one of the most important commentaries on this extraordinary moment in american life was a book by the french aristocrat alexis de tocqueville.
see consider the source alexis de tocqueville concerning the peoples choices and the instinctive preferences of american democracy he spent two years in the united states in the 1830s watching the dramatic political changes in the age of andrew jackson.
the french government had requested that he make a study of american prisons which were thought to be more humane and effective institutions than those in europe.
but tocqueville quickly went far beyond the study of prisons and wrote a classic study of american life titled democracy in america.
tocqueville examined not just the politics of the united states but also the daily lives of many groups of americans and their cultures their associations and their visions of democracy.
in france in the early decades of the nineteenth century the fruits of democracy were largely restricted to landowners and aristocrats.
but tocqueville recognized that traditional aristocracies were rapidly fading in america and that new elites could rise and fall no matter what their backgrounds.
tocqueville also realized that the rising democracy of america had many limits.
democracy was a powerful visible force in the lives of most white men.
few women could vote although some shared the democratic ethos through their families.
for many other americans democracy was a distant hope.
tocqueville wrote of the limits of equality and democracy he first who attracts the eye the first in enlightenment in power and in happiness is the white man the european man par excellence below him appear the negro and the indian.
these two unfortunate races have neither birth nor face nor language nor mores in common only their misfortunes look alike.
both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit both experience the effects of tyranny and if their miseries are different they can accuse the same author for them.
tocquevilles book helped spread the idea of american democracy into france and other european nations.
only later did it become widely read and studied in the united states as a remarkable portrait of the emerging democracy of the united states.
the legitimization of party the high level of voter participation was only partly the result of an expanded electorate.
it resulted as well from growing interest in politics a strengthening of party organization and increasing party loyalty.
although party competition had been part of american politics almost from the beginning acceptance of the idea of party had not.
for more than thirty years most americans who had opinions about the nature of government considered parties evils to be avoided and thought the nation should seek a broad consensus without permanent factional lines.
but in the 1820s and 1830s those assumptions gave way to a jacksonian america 205 new view that permanent institutionalized parties were a desirable part of the political process that they were indeed essential to democracy.
the elevation of party occurred first at the state level most prominently in new york.
there after the war of 1812 martin van buren led a dissident political faction known as the bucktails that challenged the established political elite led by the aristocratic governor dewitt clinton.
the bucktails argued that clintons closed circle made genuine democracy impossible.
they advocated institutionalized political parties in its place based on the support of a broad public constituency.
a party would need a permanent opposition they insisted because competition would force it to remain sensitive to the will of the people.
parties would check and balance one another in much the same way as the different branches of government did.
by the late 1820s this new idea of party had spread beyond new york.
the election of jackson in 1828 the result of a popular movement that stood apart from the usual political elites seemed further to legitimize it.
in the 1830s finally a fully formed twoparty system began to operate at the national level.
the anti jackson the two party system forces began to call themselves the whigs.
jacksons followers called themselves democrats thus giving a permanent name to what is now the nations oldest political party.
president of the common people unlike thomas jefferson jackson was no democratic philosopher.
the democratic party much less than the old jeffersonian republicans embraced no clear or uniform this portrait suggests something of the fierce determination that characterized andrew jacksons military and political careers.
shattered by the death of his wife a few weeks after his election as president a death he blamed not entirely without reason on the attacks his political opponents had leveled at her he entered office with a steely determination to live by his own principles and give no quarter to his adversaries.
bettmann corbis andrew jackson co ns ider t he s o urc e alexis de tocqueville concerning the peoples choices and the instinctive preferences of american democracy in the 1830s the french political thinker and historian alexis de tocqueville devoted two years in the united states to studying the countrys institutions and political culture.
the result was his book democracy in america.
in this excerpt tocqueville considers the correlation between social class and political engagement.
many people in europe believe but do not say or say but do not believe that one of the great advantages of universal suffrage is that it brings men worthy of public trust into positions of leadership.
the people it is argued may not know how to govern themselves but they always sincerely want what is good for the state and their instinct is unlikely to overlook men animated by the same desire and eminently capable of wielding power.
for my part i must say that what i saw in america gives me no reason to believe that this is the case.
on arriving in the united states i was surprised to discover how common talent was among the governed and how rare in government.
there is no escaping the fact that in the united states today the most outstanding men are seldom called to public office and one is forced to acknowledge that this situation arose as democracy developed beyond all former bounds.
it is clear that over the past half century the race of american statesmen has singularly shrunk in stature.
several causes of this phenomenon may be adduced.
whatever one does there are limits to the degree to which people can be enlightened.
try as one might to make knowledge more accessible improve teaching methods and reduce the cost of acquiring 206 learning there is no way for people to educate themselves and develop their intelligence unless they can devote time to the effort.
how easy or hard it is for people to live without working therefore sets a necessary limit to their intellectual progress.
in some countries that limit is a long way from being reached in others not so far off.
but in order for there to be no limit the people would need to be freed of worries about their material needs in which case they would no longer be the people.
hence it is as difficult to conceive of a society in which everyone is highly enlightened as of a state in which every citizen is wealthy the two difficulties are related.
i am perfectly willing to concede that most citizens very sincerely want what is good for their country.
taking this one step further i would go so far as to add that in general the lower classes of society seem to me less likely than the upper classes to adulterate this desire with considerations of personal interest.
what the lower classes invariably lack to one degree or another however is the art of judging the means to the end they sincerely wish to achieve.
what a lengthy period of study and variety of ideas are necessary to form an exact idea of the character of a single man.
the greatest geniuses fail at this yet the multitude is supposed to succeed.
the people never have enough time or resources to devote to the effort.
they must always judge hastily and seize on whatever is most v isible.
that is why charlatans of every stripe are so clever at pleasing them while more often than not their true friends fail.
what democracy lacks moreover is not always the capacity to choose men of merit but the desire and taste to do so.
we must not blind ourselves to the fact that democratic institutions develop the sentiment of envy in the human heart to a very high degree.
this is not so much because such institutions give everyone the means to equal everyone else as because those means continually prove unavailing to those who employ them.
democratic institutions awaken and flatter the passion for equality without ever being able to satisfy it to the full.
no sooner does full equality seem within the peoples reach than it flies from their grasp and its flight as pascal said is eternal.
the people passionately seek a good that is all the more precious because it is close enough to be familiar yet far enough away that it cannot be savored.
the chance of success spurs them on the uncertainty of success vexes them.
they struggle they tire they grow bitter.
anything that is beyond them in any quarter then seems an obstacle to their desires and no form of superiority is so legitimate that the sight of it is not wearisome to their eyes.

ideological position.
but jackson himself did embrace a distinct and simple theory of democracy.
government he said should offer equal protection and equal benefits to all its white male citizens and favor no one region or class over another.
in practice that meant launching an assault on what jackson considered the citadels of the eastern aristocracy and extending opportunities to the rising classes of the west and the south.
for historians changing assessments of jackson see debating the past jacksonian democracy jacksons first target was the entrenched officeholders in the federal government whom he bitterly denounced.
offices he said belonged to the people not to a selfserving bureaucracy.
equally important a large turnover in the bureaucracy would allow him to reward his own supporters with offices.
one of jacksons allies william l marcy of new york once explained to the victors belong the spoils and patronage the process of giving out jobs as political rewards became known as the spoils system.
although jackson removed no more than one fifth the spoils system of existing federal officeholders his embrace of the spoils system helped cement its place in party politics.
jacksons supporters also worked to transform the process by which presidential candidates were selected.
in 1832 the presidents followers staged a national convention to renominate him.
through the convention its founders believed power in the party would arise directly from the people rather than from such elite political institutions as the congressional caucus.
207 debating the past jacksonian democracy to many americans in the 1820s and 1830s andrew jackson was a champion of democracy a symbol of the spirit of antielitism and egalitarianism that was sweeping american life.
historians however have disagreed sharply not only in their assessments of jackson himself but in their portrayal of american society in his era.
the progressive historians of the early twentieth century tended to see jacksonian politics as a forebear of their own battles against economic privilege and political corruption.
frederick jackson turner encouraged scholars to see jacksonianism as a protest by the frontier against the conservative aristocracy of the east.
jackson represented those who wanted to make government responsive to the will of the people rather than to the power of special interests.
the culmination of this progressive interpretation of jacksonianism was arthur m schlesingers the age of jackson 1945.
less interested in the regional basis of jacksonianism than the disciples of turner had been schlesinger argued that jacksonian democracy was an effort to control the power of the capitalist groups mainly eastern for the benefit of non capitalist groups farmers and laboring men east west and south he portrayed jacksonianism as an early version of m odern reform efforts to restrain the power of the business community richard hofstadter in an influential 1948 essay sharply disagreed.
jackson he argued was the spokesman of rising entrepreneurs aspiring businessmen who saw the road to opportunity blocked by the monopolistic power of eastern aristocrats.
the jacksonian leaders were less sympathetic to the aspirations of those below them than 208 they were to the destruction of obstacles to their own success.
bray hammond writing in 1957 argued similarly that the jacksonian cause was one of enterpriser against capitalist other historians saw jacksonianism less as a democratic reform movement than as a nostalgic effort to restore a lost past.
marvin meyerss the jacksonian persuasion 1957 argued that jackson and his followers looked with misgivings on the new industrial society emerging around them and yearned instead for a restoration of the agrarian republican virtues of an earlier time.
in the 1960s historians began taking less interest in jackson and his supporters and more in the social and cultural bases of american politics in the time of jackson.
lee bensons the concept of jacksonian democracy 1961 used quantitative techniques to demonstrate the role of religion and ethnicity in shaping party divisions.
edward pessens jacksonian america 1969 portrayed america in the jacksonian era as an increasingly stratified society.
this inclination to look more closely at society than at formal jacksonianism continued into the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries.
sean wilentz in chants democratic 1984 and in the rise of american democracy 2005 examined the rise of powerful movements among ordinary citizens who were attracted less to jackson himself than to the notion of popular democracy.
gradually this attention to the nature of society has led to reassessments of jackson himself and the nature of his regime.
in fathers and children 1975 michael rogin portrays jackson as a leader determined to secure the supremacy of white men in the united states.
alexander saxton in the rise and fall of the white republic 1990 makes the related argument that jacksonian democracy was explicitly a white mans democracy that rested on the subjugation of slaves women and native americans.
but the portrayal of jackson as a champion of the common people has not vanished from scholarship entirely.
the most renowned postwar biographer of jackson robert v remini argues that despite the flaws in his democratic vision he was a genuine man of the people understand analyze evaluate 1.
what was jacksonian democracy.
was it a reform movement against conservative special interests.
was it a regional movement designed to shift power to the west.
or was it a classbased movement to elevate workers and farmers.
jackson was known as a man of the people which people were attracted to him.
federal union jacksons commitment to extending power beyond entrenched elites led him to want to reduce the functions of the federal government.
a concentration of power in washington would he believed restrict opportunity to people with political connections.
but jackson was also strongly committed to the preservation of the union.
thus at the same time as he was promoting an economic program to reduce the power of the national government he was asserting the supremacy of the union in the face of a potent challenge.
for no sooner had he entered office than his own vice president john c calhoun began to champion a controversial constitutional theory nullification.
calhoun and nullification once an outspoken protectionist calhoun had strongly supported the tariff of 1816.
but by the late 1820s he had come to believe that the tariff was responsible for the stagnation of south carolinas economy even though the exhaustion of the states farmland was the real reason for the decline.
some exasperated carolinians were ready to consider a drastic remedy secession.
with his future political hopes resting on how he met this challenge in his home state calhoun developed the theory of nullification.
drawing from the ideas of madison and jefferson and citing the tenth amendment to the constitution calhoun argued that since the federal government was a creation of the states the states not the courts or congress were the final arbiters of the constitutionality of federal laws.
if a state concluded that congress had passed an unconstitutional law then it could hold a special convention and declare the federal law null and void within the state.
the nullification doctrine and the idea of using it to nullify the 1828 tariff quickly attracted broad support in south carolina.
but it did nothing to help calhouns standing within the new jackson administration in part because he had a powerful rival in martin van buren.
the rise of van buren van buren had served briefly as governor of new york before becoming jacksons secretary of state in 1829.
he soon established himself as a member both of the official 209 210 chapter 9 cabinet and of the presidents unofficial circle of political allies known as the kitchen cabinet and van burens influence with the president grew stronger still as a result of a quarrel over etiquette that drove a wedge between jackson and calhoun.
peggy oneale was the attractive daughter of a washington tavernkeeper with whom both andrew jackson and his friend john h eaton had taken lodgings while serving as senators from tennessee.
oneale was married but rumors circulated in washington in the mid 1820s that she and senator eaton were having an affair.
oneales husband died in 1828 and she and eaton were soon married.
a few weeks later jackson named eaton secretary of war and thus made the new mrs eaton a cabinet wife.
the rest of the administration wives led by mrs calhoun refused to receive her.
jackson who blamed slanderous gossip for the death of his own wife was furious and demanded that the members of the cabinet accept her into their social world.
calhoun under pressure from his wife refused.
van buren a widower befriended the eatons and thus ingratiated himself with jackson.
by 1831 jackson had tapped van buren as his preferred successor in the white house apparently ending calhouns dreams of the presidency.
the kitchen cabinet the webster hayne debate in january 1830 in the midst of a routine debate over federal policy toward western lands a senator from connecticut suggested that all land sales and surveys be temporarily discontinued.
robert y hayne a young senator from south carolina charged that slowing down the growth of the west was simply a way for the east to retain its political and economic power.
daniel webster now a senator from massachusetts attacked hayne and through him calhoun for what he considered an attack on the integrity of the union in effect challenging hayne to a debate not on the issues of public lands and the tariff but on the issue states rights versus national power of states rights versus national power.
hayne responded with a defense of nullification.
webster then spent two full afternoons delivering what became known as his second reply to hayne he concluded with the ringing appeal liberty and union now and for ever one and inseparable both sides waited to hear what president jackson thought of the argument.
that became clear at the annual democratic party banquet in honor of thomas jefferson.
after dinner guests delivered a series of toasts.
the president arrived with a written text in which he had underscored certain words our federal union it must be preserved while he spoke he looked directly at calhoun.
the diminutive van buren who stood on his chair to see better thought he saw calhouns hand shake and a trickle of wine run down his glass as he responded to the presidents toast with his own the union next to our liberty most dear the nullification crisis in 1832 the controversy over nullification finally produced a crisis when south carolinians responded angrily to a congressional tariff bill that offered them no relief from the 1828 tariff of abominations.
almost immediately the legislature summoned a state convention which voted to nullify the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 and to forbid the collection of duties within the state.
at the same time south carolina elected hayne to serve as governor and calhoun to replace hayne as senator.
jacksonian america 211 jackson insisted that nullification was treason.
he strengthened the federal forts in south carolina and ordered a warship to charleston.
when congress convened early in 1833 jackson proposed a force bill authorizing the president to use the military to see that acts of congress were obeyed.
violence seemed a real possibility.
calhoun faced a predicament as he took his place in the senate.
not a single state had come to south carolinas support.
but the timely intervention of henry clay also newly elected to the senate averted a crisis.
clay devised a compromise by clays compromise which the tariff would be lowered gradually so that by 1842 it would reach approximately the same level as in 1816.
the compromise and the force bill were passed on the same day march 1 1833.
jackson signed them both.
in south carolina the convention reassembled and repealed its nullification of the tariffs.
but unwilling to allow congress to have the last word the convention nullified the force act a purely symbolic act since the tariff had already been amended.
calhoun and his followers claimed a victory for nullification which had they insisted forced the revision of the tariff.
but the episode taught calhoun and his allies that no state could defy the federal government alone.
the removal of the indians there had never been any doubt about andrew jacksons attitude toward the indian tribes whose lands were now encircled by the eastern states and territories of the united states.
he wanted them to move west.
since his early military expeditions in florida jackson had harbored a deep hostility toward the indians.
in this he was little different from most white americans.
white attitudes toward the tribes in the eighteenth century many whites had shared thomas jeffersons view of the indians as noble savages with an inherent dignity that made civilization possible among them if they would only mimic white social cultural political and economic practices.
yet by the first decades of the nineteenth century many whites were coming to view native americans simply as savages who should be removed from all the lands east of the mississippi.
white westerners also favored removal to put an end to violence and conflict in the western areas of white settlement.
most of all they wanted valuable land that the tribes still possessed.
events in the northwest added urgency to the issue of removal.
in illinois an alliance of sauk or sac and fox indians under black hawk fought white settlers in 1831 1832 in an effort to overturn what black hawk considered an illegal cession of tribal lands to the united states.
the black hawk war was notable for its viciousness.
the black hawk war white forces attacked the indians even when they attempted to surrender pursued them as they retreated and slaughtered many of them.
the brutal war only reinforced the determination of whites to remove all the tribes to the west.
the five civilized tribes even more troubling to the government in the 1830s were the remaining indian tribes of the south who possessed lands southerners coveted for their growing cotton empire.
in western georgia alabama mississippi and florida lived what were known as the five 212 chapter 9 black hawk and whirling thunder after his defeat by white settlers in illinois in 1832 the famed sauk warrior black hawk and his son whirling thunder were captured and sent on a tour by andrew jackson displayed to the public as trophies of war.
they showed such dignity through the ordeal that much of the white public quickly began to sympathize with them.
this portrait by john wesley jarvis was painted on the tours final stop in new york city.
black hawk wears the european style suit while whirling thunder wears native costume to emphasize his commitment to his tribal roots.
soon thereafter black hawk returned to his tribe wrote a celebrated autobiography and died in 1838.

civilized tribes the cherokee creek seminole chickasaw and choctaw.
these groups had adopted various euro american institutions and practices including literacy organized government laws agricultural economies and even slavery.
in 1830 both the federal government and several southern states were accelerating efforts to remove the tribes to the west.
that year congress passed the indian removal act which authorized the financing of federal negotiations to relocate the southern tribes to the west.
some indians believed removal the least disagreeable option better perhaps than the prospect of destitution white encroachment and violence.
others fought back.
the cherokee tried to stop georgia from taking their lands through an appeal in the supreme court and the courts rulings in cherokee nation v georgia and worcester v georgia supcherokee legal resistance ported the tribes contention that the state had no authority to negotiate with tribal representatives.
but jackson repudiated the decisions reportedly responding to news of the rulings with the contemptuous statement john marshall has made his decision.
now let him enforce it then in 1835 the united states government extracted a treaty from a minority faction of the cherokee that ceded to georgia the tribes land in that state in return for 5 million and a reservation west of the mississippi.
with removal inevitable this cherokee treaty party reasoned a deal for cash and land to the west was the best alternative available.
but the great majority of the 17 000 cherokee did not recognize the treaty as legitimate.
jackson sent an army of 7 000 under general winfield scott to round them up and drive them westward.
trail of tears about 1 000 cherokee fled to north carolina where eventually the federal government provided them with a small reservation in the smoky mountains that survives today.

once in the white house he ensured that few indians would remain in the southern states of the nation now that white settlement was increasing there.
the result was a series of dramatic removals of indian tribes out of their traditional lands and into new territories west of the mississippi mostly in oklahoma.
note the very long distance many of these tribes had to travel.
why was the route of the cherokee shown in the upper portion of the map known as the trail of tears.
most of the rest made a long forced trek to indian territory what later became oklahoma beginning in the winter of 1838.
thousands perhaps a quarter or more removal of the migrs perished before reaching their unwanted destination.
in the harsh new reservations the survivors remembered the terrible journey as the trail where they cried the trail of tears.
between 1830 and 1838 virtually all the five civilized tribes were forced to travel to indian territory.
the choctaw of mississippi and western alabama were the first to make the trek beginning in 1830.
the army moved out the creek of eastern alabama and western georgia in 1836.
a year later the chickasaw in northern mississippi began their long march westward and the cherokee finally a year after that.
the seminole in florida were able to resist removal but even their success was limited.
like other tribes the seminole had agreed under pressure to a settlement by which they ceded their lands to the united states and agreed to move to indian territory within three years.
most did move west but a substantial minority under the leadership of the chieftain osceola balked and staged an uprising beginning in 1835 to defend their seminole wars lands.
joining the indians in their struggle was a group of runaway black slaves who had been living with the tribe.
jackson sent troops to florida but the seminole and their black allies were masters of guerrilla warfare in the junglelike everglades.
finally in 1842 the government abandoned the war.
by then many of the seminole had been either killed or forced westward.
214 chapter 9 the meaning of removal by the end of the 1830s most of the indian societies east of the mississippi had been removed to the west.
the tribes had ceded over 100 million acres to the federal government and had received in return about 68 million and 32 million acres in the far less hospitable lands west of the mississippi territory that already had established native populations.
there they lived divided by tribe into a series of separate reservations in a territory surrounded by a string of united states forts and in a region whose climate and topography bore little relation to anything they had known before.
what if any were the alternatives to the removal of the indians.
there was probably never any realistic possibility that the government could stop white expansion westward.
alternatives to removal but there were in theory at least alternatives to the brutal removal policy.
the west was filled with examples of white settlers and native tribes living side by side.
in the pueblos of new mexico in the fur trading posts of the pacific northwest and in parts of texas and california indians and the newcomers from mexico canada and the united states had created societies in which the various groups mingled intimately.
sometimes close contact between whites and indians was beneficial to both sides often it was cruel and exploitative.
but the early multiracial societies of the west did not separate whites and indians.
they demonstrated ways in which the two cultures could interact each shaping the other.
by the mid nineteenth century however white americans had adopted a different model.
much as the early british settlers along the atlantic coast had established plantations from which natives were in theory to be excluded so the western whites of later years believed that indians could not be partners in the creation of new societies in the west.
they were obstacles to be removed and as far as possible isolated.
jackson and the bank war jackson was quite willing to manipulate the indian tribes.
but in other contexts he was very reluctant to use federal authority as shown by his 1830 veto of a congressional measure providing a subsidy to the proposed maysville road in kentucky.
the bill was unconstitutional jackson argued because the road in question lay entirely within kentucky and was not therefore a part of interstate commerce jackson also thought the bill unwise because it committed the government to what he considered extravagant expenditures.
a similar resistance to federal power lay behind jacksons war against the bank of the united states.
biddles institution the bank of the united states held a monopoly on federal deposits provided credit to growing enterprises issued banknotes that served as a dependable medium of exchange and exercised a restraining effect on the less well managed state banks.
nicholas biddle nicholas biddle who ran the bank from 1823 on had done much to put the institution on a sound and prosperous basis.
nevertheless many americans among them andrew jackson were determined to destroy it.
opposition to the bank came from two very different groups the soft money and soft money versus hard money hard money factions.
advocates of soft money consisted jacksonian america 215 largely of state bankers and their allies.
they objected to the bank because it restrained state banks from issuing notes freely.
the hard money faction believed that coin was the only safe currency and they condemned all banks that issued banknotes state or federal.
the soft money advocates believed in rapid economic growth and speculation the hardmoney forces embraced older ideas of public virtue and looked with suspicion on expansion and speculation.
jackson himself supported the hard money position and he made clear that he would not favor renewing the charter of the bank of the united states which was due to expire in 1836.
a philadelphia aristocrat unaccustomed to politics biddle nevertheless began granting banking favors to influential men.
in particular he relied on daniel webster whom he named the banks legal counsel and director of the boston branch.
webster bank war helped biddle enlist the support of henry clay as well.
clay webster and other advisers persuaded biddle to apply to congress for a recharter bill in 1832 four years ahead of the expiration date.
congress passed the recharter bill jackson vetoed it and the banks supporters in congress failed to override the veto.
the bank question then emerged as the paramount issue of the 1832 election just as clay had hoped.
in 1832 clay ran for president as the unanimous choice of the whigs.
but the bank war failed to provide clay with the winning issue he had hoped for.
jackson with van buren as his running mate won an overwhelming victory with 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.
the monster destroyed jackson was now more determined than ever to destroy the monster he could not legally abolish the bank before the expiration of its charter.
but he weakened it by removing the governments deposits from it.
when his secretary of the treasury believing that such an action would destabilize the financial system refused to give the order jackson fired him and appointed a replacement.
when the new secretary similarly procrastinated jackson fired him too and named a third roger b taney the attorney general a close friend and loyal ally of the president.
taney soon began taking the governments deposits out of the bank of the united states and putting them in a number of state banks.
in response biddle called in loans and raised interest rates explaining that without the government government deposits removed deposits the banks resources were stretched too thin.
his actions precipitated a short recession.
as financial conditions worsened in the winter of 1833 1834 supporters of the bank sent petitions to washington urging its rechartering.
but the jacksonians blamed the recession on biddle and refused.
when the banker finally carried his contraction of credit too far and had to reverse himself to appease the business community his hopes of winning a recharter of the bank died in the process.
jackson had won a jacksons political victory considerable political victory.
but when the bank of the united states expired in 1836 the country was left with a fragmented and chronically unstable banking system that would plague the economy for many years.
the taney court in the aftermath of the bank war jackson moved against the most powerful remaining institution of economic nationalism the supreme court.
in 1835 when john marshall 216 chapter 9 died the president appointed as the new chief justice his trusted ally roger b taney.
taney did not bring a sharp break in constitutional interpretation but he did help modify marshalls vigorous nationalism.
perhaps the clearest indication of the new judicial climate was the celebrated case of charles river bridge v warren bridge charles river bridge v warren bridge of 1837.
the case involved a dispute between two massachusetts companies over the right to build a bridge across the charles river between boston and cambridge.
one company had a longstanding charter from the state to operate a toll bridge a charter that the firm claimed guaranteed it a monopoly of the bridge traffic.
another company had applied to the legislature for authorization to construct a second competing bridge that would since it would be toll free greatly reduce the value of the first companys charter.
the first company contended that in granting the second charter the legislature was engaging in a breach of contract and it noted that the marshall court in the dartmouth college case and other decisions had ruled that states had no right to abrogate contracts.
but now taney supported the right of massachusetts to award the second charter.
the object of government taney maintained was to promote the general happiness an object that took precedence over the rights of property.
a state therefore had the right to amend or abrogate a contract if such action was necessary to advance the well being of the community.
the decision reflected one of the cornerstones of the jacksonian idea that the key to democracy was an expansion of economic opportunity which would not occur if older corporations could maintain monopolies.
the changing face of american politics jacksons forceful some people claimed tyrannical tactics in crushing first the nullification movement and then the bank of the united states helped galvanize a growing opposition coalition.
it began as a gathering of national political leaders opposed to jacksons use of power.
denouncing the president as king andrew i they began to refer to themselves as whigs after the party in england that traditionally worked to limit the power of the king.
with the emergence of the whigs the nation once again had two competing political parties.
what scholars now call the second party system had begun its relatively brief life.
democrats and whigs the philosophy of the democratic party in the 1830s bore the stamp of andrew jackson.
the federal government the democrats believed should be limited in power except to the degree that it worked to eliminate social and economic arrangements that entrenched privilege and stifled opportunity.
the rights of states should be protected except to the extent that state governments interfered with social and economic mobility.
jacksonian jacksonian democrats democrats celebrated honest workers simple farmers and forthright businessmen and contrasted them to the corrupt monopolistic aristocratic forces of established wealth.
democrats were more likely than whigs to support territorial expansion which would they believed widen opportunities for aspiring americans.
among the most radical members of the party the so called locofocos mainly workingmen small businessmen and professionals in the northeast sentiment was strong for a vigorous perhaps even violent assault on monopoly and privilege.
jacksonian america 217 in contrast the political philosophy that became known as whiggery favored the e xpansion of federal power and industrial and commercial development.
whigs whiggery were cautious about westward expansion fearful that rapid territorial growth would produce instability.
and although whigs insisted that their vision would result in increasing opportunities for all americans they tended to attribute particular value to the entrepreneurs and institutions that most effectively promoted economic growth.
the whigs were strongest among the more substantial merchants and manufacturers of the northeast the wealthier planters of the south and the ambitious farmers and rising commercial class of the west.
the democrats drew more support from smaller merchants and the workingmen of the northeast from southern planters suspicious of industrial growth and from westerners who favored a predominantly agrarian economy.
whigs tended to be wealthier to have more aristocratic backgrounds and to be more commercially ambitious than the democrats.
but whigs and democrats alike were more interested in winning elections than in maintaining philosophical purity.
and both parties made adjustments from region to region to attract the largest possible number of voters.
in new york for example the whigs developed a popular following through a movement known as anti masonry.
the anti mason party had emerged in the anti masonry 1820s in response to widespread resentment against the secret and exclusive hence supposedly undemocratic society of freemasons.
such resentment increased in 1826 when a former mason william morgan mysteriously disappeared from his home in batavia new york shortly before he was scheduled to publish a book that would allegedly expose the secrets of freemasonry.
with help from a widespread assumption that morgan had been abducted and murdered by vengeful masons whigs seized on the anti mason frenzy to launch spirited attacks on jackson and van buren both freemasons implying that the democrats were connected with the antidemocratic conspiracy.
religious and ethnic divisions also played an important role in determining the constituencies of the two parties.
irish and german catholics tended to support the democrats who appeared to share their own vague aversion to commercial development and who seemed to respect their cultural values.
evangelical protestants gravitated toward the whigs because they associated the party with constant development and improvement.
they envisioned a society progressing steadily toward unity and order and they looked on the new immigrant communities as groups that needed to be disciplined and taught american ways.
the whig party was more successful at defining its positions and attracting a constituency than it was at uniting behind a national leader.
no one person was ever able to command the loyalties of the party in the way jackson commanded those of the democrats.
instead whigs tended to divide their allegiance among the great triumvirate of henry clay daniel webster and john c calhoun.
clay won support from many who favored internal improvements and economic development with what he called the american system.
but clays image the american system as a devious political operator and his identification with the west were a liability.
he ran for president three times and never won.
daniel webster won broad support among the whigs with his passionate speeches in defense of the constitution and the union but his close connection with the bank of the united states and the protective tariff his reliance on rich men for financial support and his excessive fondness for brandy prevented him from developing enough of a national constituency to win him his desired office.
john c calhoun never considered himself a true whig and his identification with the nullification controversy in effect disqualified him from national leadership in any case.
218 chapter 9 yet he sided with clay and webster on the issue of the national bank and he shared with them a strong animosity toward andrew jackson.
the whigs competed relatively evenly with the democrats in congressional state and local races but they managed to win only two presidential elections in the more than twenty years of their history.
their problems became particularly clear in 1836.
while the democrats united behind andrew jacksons personal choice for president martin van van buren elected buren the whigs could not even agree on a single candidate.
instead they ran several candidates in different regions hoping they might separately draw enough votes from van buren to throw the election to the house of representatives where the whigs might be better able to elect one of their candidates.
in the end however van buren won easily with 170 electoral votes to 124 for all his opponents combined.
politics after jackson andrew jackson retired from public life in 1837 the most beloved political figure of his age.
martin van buren was less fortunate.
he could not match jacksons personal magnetism and his administration suffered from economic difficulties that hurt both him and his party.
van buren and the panic of 1837 van burens success in the 1836 election was a result in part of a nationwide economic boom.
canal and railroad builders operated at a peak of activity.
prices were rising credit was plentiful and the land business in particular was booming.
between 1835 and 1837 the government sold nearly 40 million acres of public land this savage caricature of the economic troubles besetting the united states in 1837 illustrates among other things popular resentment of the hard money orthodoxies of the time.
a sign on the custom house reads all bonds must be paid in specie next door the bank announces no specie payments made here museum of the city of new york usa bridgeman images the times 1837 jacksonian america 219 nearly three fourths of it to speculators.
these land sales along with revenues the government received from the tariff of 1833 created a series of substantial federal budget surpluses and made possible a steady reduction of the national debt.
from 1835 to 1837 the government for the first and only time in its history was out of debt with a substantial surplus in the treasury.
congress and the administration now faced the question of what to do with the treasury surplus.
support soon grew for returning the federal surplus to the states.
an 1836 distribution act required the federal government to pay its surplus funds to the states each year in four quarterly installments as interest free unsecured loans.
no one expected the loans to be repaid.
the states spent the money quickly mainly to promote the construction of highways railroads and canals.
the distribution of the surplus thus gave further stimulus to the economic boom.
at the same time the withdrawal of federal funds strained the state banks in which they had been deposited by the government the banks had to call in their own loans to make the transfer of funds to the state governments.
congress did nothing to check the speculative fever.
but jackson feared that the government was selling land for state banknotes of questionable value.
in 1836 he issued an executive order the specie circular it provided that in payment for public specie circular lands the government would accept only gold or silver coins or currency backed by gold or silver.
the specie circular produced a financial panic that began in the first months of van burens presidency.
banks and businesses failed unemployment grew bread riots shook some of the larger cities and prices fell especially the price of land.
many railroad and canal projects failed several of the debt burdened state governments ceased to pay interest on their bonds and a few repudiated their debts at least temporarily.
the worst depression in american history to that point it lasted for five years and it was a political catastrophe for van buren and the democrats.
the van buren administration did little to fight the depression.
in fact some of the steps it took borrowing money to pay government debts and accepting only specie for payment of taxes may have made things worse.
other efforts failed in congress a preemption bill that would have given settlers the right to buy government land near them before it was opened for public sale and another bill that would have lowered the price of land.
van buren did succeed in establishing a ten hour workday on all federal projects via a presidential order but he had few legislative achievements.
the most important and controversial measure in the presidents program was a proposal for a new financial system.
under van burens plan known as the independent treasury or subtreasury system government funds would be independent treasury system placed in an independent treasury in washington and in subtreasuries in other cities.
no private banks would have the governments money or name to use as a basis for speculation.
van buren called a special session of congress in 1837 to consider the proposal but it failed in the house.
in 1840 however the administration finally succeeded in driving the measure through both houses of congress.
the log cabin campaign as the campaign of 1840 approached the whigs realized that they would have to settle on one candidate for president.
in december 1839 they held their first nominating convention.
passing over henry clay they chose william henry william henry harrison harrison a renowned soldier and a popular national figure.
the democrats again nominated van buren.
patterns of popular culture the penny press on september 3 1833 a small newspaper appeared in new york city for the first time the sun published by a young former apprentice from massachusetts named benjamin day.
four pages long it contained mostly trivial local news with particular emphasis on sex crime and violence.
it sold for a penny launching a new age in the history of american journalism the age of the penny press before the advent of the penny press newspapers in america were far too expensive for most ordinary citizens to buy.
but several important changes in both the business of journalism and the character of american society paved the way for benjamin day and others to challenge the established press.
new technologies the steam powered cylinder printing press new machines for making paper railroads and canals for distributing issues to a larger market made it possible to publish newspapers inexpensively and to sell them widely.
a rising popular literacy rate a r esult in part of the spread of public education created a bigger reading public.
the penny press was also a response to the changing culture of the 1820s and 1830s.
the spread of an urban market economy this 1834 front page of the sun which had begun publication a year earlier contains advertisements human interest stories a description of a slave auction in charleston south carolina and homespun advice life is short.
the poor pittance of several years is not worth being a villain for collection of the new york historical society the sun 220 c ontributed to the growth of the penny press by drawing a large population of workers artisans and clerks into large cities where they became an important market for the new papers.
the spirit of democracy symbolized by the popularity of andrew jackson and the rising numbers of white male voters across the country helped create an appetite for journalism that spoke to and for the people the sun and other papers like it were committed to feeding the appetites of the people of modest means who constituted most of their readership.
human interest stories helped solidify their hold on the working public.
within six months of its first issue the sun had the largest circulation in new york 8 000 readers more than twice the number of its nearest competitors.
james gordon bennetts new york herald which began publication in 1835 soon surpassed the sun in popularity with its lively combination of sensationalism and local gossip and its aggressive pursuit of national and international stories.
the herald pioneered a letters to the editor column was the first paper to have regular reviews of books and the arts and launched the first daily sports section.
by 1860 its c irculation of more than 77 000 was the largest of any daily newspaper in the world.
not all the new penny papers were as sensationalistic as the sun and the herald.
the new york tribune founded in 1841 by horace greeley prided itself on serious reporting and commentary.
as serious as the tribune but more sober and self consciously objective in its reportage was the new york times which henry raymond founded in 1851.
we do not mean to write as if we were in a passion unless that shall really be the case the times huffily proclaimed in its first issue in an obvious reference to greeley and his impassioned reportage and we shall make it a point to get into a passion as rarely as possible the newspapers of the penny press initiated the process of turning journalism into a profession.
they were the first papers to pay their reporters and they were also the first to rely heavily on advertisements often devoting up to half their space to paid advertising.
they tended to be sensationalistic and opinionated but they were also usually aggressive in uncovering serious and important news in police stations courts jails streets and private homes as well as in city halls state capitals washington and the world.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
how were the penny press newspapers a product of the jacksonian era.
before the advent of the penny press newspapers in america were aimed at a much narrower audience.
some published mainly business news and others worked to advance the aims of a political party.
what nationally circulated newspapers and other media today continue this tradition.
the 1840 campaign was the first in which the new and popular penny press carried news of the candidates to large audiences see patterns of popular culture the penny press.
such newspapers were deliberately livelier and more sensationalist than the newspapers of the past which had been almost entirely directed at the upper classes.
the sun the first of the new breed began publishing in 1833 and was from the beginning self consciously egalitarian.
it soon had the largest circulation in new york.
other similar papers soon began appearing in other cities reinforcing the increasingly democratic character of political culture and encouraging the inclination of both parties to try to appeal to ordinary voters as they planned their campaigns.
the campaign of 1840 also illustrated how fully the spirit of party competition had established itself in america.
the whigs who had emerged as a party largely because 221 222 chapter 9 harrison and reform this hand colored engraving was made for a brass brooch during the 1840 presidential campaign and served the same purposes that modern campaign buttons do.
it conveys harrisons presumably humble beginnings in a log cabin.
in reality harrison was a wealthy aristocratic man but the unpopularity of the aristocratic airs of his opponent president martin van buren persuaded the whig party that it would be good political strategy to portray harrison as a humble man of the people david j.
janice l frent collection corbis of their opposition to andrew jacksons common people democracy presented themselves in 1840 as the party of the common people.
so of course did the democrats.
with both parties using the same techniques of mass voter appeal what mattered was not the philosophical purity of the party but its ability to win votes.
the whig campaign was particularly effective in portraying william henry harrison a wealthy member of the frontier elite with a considerable estate as a simple man of the people who loved log cabins and hard cider.
the democrats already weakened by the depression had no effective defense against such tactics.
harrison won the election with 234 electoral votes to 60 for van buren and with a popular majority of 53 percent.
the frustration of the whigs despite their decisive victory the whigs found the four years after their resounding victory frustrating and divisive.
the trouble began when their appealing new president died of pneumonia just one month after taking office.
vice president john tyler of virginia succeeded him.
jacksonian america 223 tyler was a former democrat who had left the party in reaction to what he considered jacksons excessively egalitarian program tylers approach to public policy still showed signs of his democratic past.
the president did agree to bills abolishing van burens independenttreasury system and raising tariff rates.
but he refused to support clays attempt to recharter the bank of the united states and he vetoed several internal improvement bills sponsored by clay and other congressional whigs.
finally a conference of congressional whigs voted tyler out of the party.
every cabinet member but webster who was serving as secretary of state resigned five former democrats took their places.
when webster too left the cabinet tyler appointed calhoun who had rejoined the democratic party to replace him.
a new political alignment was taking shape.
tyler and a small band of conservative southern whigs were preparing to rejoin the democrats.
into the common changes to democratic party peoples party of jackson and van buren was arriving a faction with decidedly aristocratic political ideas men who thought that government had an obligation to protect and even expand the institution of slavery and who believed in states rights with almost fanatical devotion.
whig diplomacy in the midst of these domestic controversies anti british factions in canada launched an unsuccessful rebellion against the colonial government there in 1837.
when the insurrection failed some of the rebels took refuge near the united states border and chartered an american steamship the caroline to ship them supplies across the caroline affair and aroostook war niagara river from new york.
british authorities in canada seized the caroline and burned it killing one american in the process.
resentment in the united states grew rapidly.
at the same time tensions flared over the boundary between canada and maine which had been in dispute since the treaty of 1783.
in 1838 rival groups of americans and canadians mostly lumberjacks began moving into the aroostook river region in the disputed area precipitating a violent brawl that became known as the aroostook war several years later in 1841 an american ship the creole sailed from virginia for new orleans with more than 100 slaves aboard.
en route the slaves mutinied seized possession of the ship and took it to the bahamas.
british officials there declared the slaves free and the english government refused to overrule them.
many americans especially southerners were furious.
at this critical juncture a new government eager to reduce tensions with the united states came to power in great britain.
it sent lord ashburton an admirer of america to negotiate an agreement on the maine boundary and other matters.
the result was the webster ashburton treaty of 1842 under which the united states webster ashburton treaty received slightly more than half the disputed area and agreed to a northern boundary as far west as the rocky mountains.
ashburton also eased the memory of the caroline and creole affairs by expressing regret and promising no future officious interference with american ships.
anglo american relations improved significantly.
during the tyler administration the united states established its first diplomatic relations with china.
in the 1844 treaty of wang hya american diplomats trade with china secured the same trading privileges as the english.
in the next ten years american trade with china steadily increased.
in their diplomatic efforts at least the whigs were able to secure some important successes.
but by the end of the tyler administration the party could look back on few other victories.
and in the election of 1844 the whigs lost the white house to james k polk a democrat with an explicit agenda of westward expansion.
224 chapter 9 conclusion the election of andrew jackson in 1828 reflected the emergence of a new political world.
throughout the american nation the laws governing political participation were loosening and the number of people permitted to vote which eventually included most white males but almost no one else was increasing.
along with this expansion of the electorate was emerging a new spirit of party politics.
jackson set out as president to entrench his party the democrats in power.
a fierce defender of the west and a sharp critic of what he considered the stranglehold of the aristocratic east on the nations economic life he sought to limit the role of the federal government in economic affairs and worked to destroy the bank of the united states which he considered a corrupt vehicle of aristocratic influence.
and he confronted the greatest challenge yet to american unity the nullification crisis of 1832 1833 with a strong assertion of the power and importance of the union.
these positions won him broad popularity and ensured his reelection in 1832 and the election of his designated successor martin van buren in 1836.
but a new coalition of anti jacksonians who called themselves the whigs launched a powerful new party that used much of the same anti elitist rhetoric to win support for their own much more nationalist program.
their emergence culminated in the campaign of 1840 with the election of william henry harrison the first whig president.
when his death led to the accidental presidency of john tyler however further realignments were set in motion.

why did americas industrial revolution affect the northern economy and society differently than it did the southern economy and society.
when the united states entered the war of 1812 it was still an essentially agrarian nation.
there were to be sure some substantial cities in america and also modest but growing manufacturing mainly in the northeast.
but the overwhelming majority of americans were farmers and tradespeople.
by the time the civil war began in 1861 the united states had transformed itself.
most americans were still rural people.
but even most farmers were now part of a national and even international market economy.
equally important the united states was beginning to challenge the industrial nations of europe for supremacy in manufacturing.
the nation had experienced the beginning of its industrial revolution.

population trends three trends characterized the american population during the antebellum period rapid population increase movement westward and the growth of towns and cities where demand for work was expanding.
the american population 4 million in 1790 had reached 10 million by 1820 and 17 million by 1840.
improvements in public health played a role in this growth.
epidemics declined in both frequency and intensity and the death rate as a whole dipped.
but the population increase was also a result of a high birthrate.
in 1840 white women bore an average of 6 14 children each.
the african american population increased more slowly than the white population.
after 1808 when the importation of slaves became illegal the proportion of blacks to whites in the nation as a whole steadily declined.
the slower increase of the black population was also a result of its comparatively high death rate.
slave mothers had large families but life was shorter for both slaves and free blacks than for whites a result of the enforced poverty and harsh working conditions in which virtually all african americans lived.
immigration choked off by wars in europe and economic crises in america contributed little to the american population in the first three decades of the nineteenth century.
of the total 1830 population of nearly 13 million the foreign born numbered fewer than 500 000.
soon however immigration americas economic revolution 227 began to grow once again.
reduced transportation costs and increasing economic opportunities helped stimulate the immigration boom as did deteriorating economic conditions in some areas of europe.
much of this new european immigration flowed into the rapidly growing cities of the northeast.
but urban growth was a result of substantial internal migration as well.
as agriculture in new england and other areas grew less profitable more and more people picked up stakes and moved some to promising agricultural regions in the west but many to eastern cities.
immigration and urban growth 1840 1860 the growth of cities accelerated dramatically between 1840 and 1860.
the population of new york for example rose from 312 000 to 805 000 making it the rapid urbanization nations largest and most commercially important city.
philadelphias population grew over the same twenty year period from 220 000 to 565 000 bostons from 93 000 to 177 000.
by 1860 26 percent of the population of the free states was living in towns places of 2 500 people or more or cities up from 14 percent in 1840.
the urban population of the south by contrast increased from 6 percent in 1840 to only 10 percent in 1860.
the booming agricultural economy of the west produced significant urban growth as well.
between 1820 and 1840 communities that had once been small villages or trading posts became major cities st louis pittsburgh cincinnati louisville.
all became centers of the growing carrying trade that connected the farmers of the midwest with new orleans and through it the cities of the northeast.
after 1830 however an increasing proportion of this trade moved from the mississippi river to the great lakes creating such important new port cities as buffalo detroit milwaukee and chicago which gradually overtook the river ports.
immigration from europe swelled.
between 1840 and 1850 more than 1 5 million europeans moved to america.
in the 1850s the number rose to 2 5 million.
almost half the residents of new york city in the 1850s were recent immigrants.
in st louis chicago and milwaukee the foreign born outnumbered those of native birth.
few immigrants settled in the south.
the newcomers came from many different countries but the overwhelming majority came from ireland and germany.
by 1860 there were more than irish and german immigrants 1 5 million irish born and approximately 1 million german born people in the united states.
most of the irish stayed in the eastern cities where they landed and became part of the unskilled labor force.
the largest single group of irish immigrants comprised young single women who worked in factories or in domestic service.
germans who unlike the irish usually arrived with at least some money and often came in family groups generally moved on to the northwest where they became farmers or small businessmen.
the rise of nativism many politicians particularly democrats eagerly courted the support of the new arrivals.
other older citizens however viewed the growing foreign population with alarm.
some people argued that the immigrants were racially inferior or that they corrupted politics by selling their votes.
others complained that they were stealing jobs from the native workforce.
protestants worried that the growing irish population would increase the power of the catholic church in america.
older stock americans feared that immigrants would become a radical force in politics.
out of these fears and prejudices emerged a number of secret societies to combat the alien menace.
