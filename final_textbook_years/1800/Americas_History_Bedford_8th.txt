how do american tariffs change over time.
chapter 10 will explain the reasons for these changes.
what is the impact of american tariff rates on the import of british textiles.
what insights does this material provide into the political and economic aspects of american industrialization.
part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 and cheap female labor they could undersell their british rivals.
their textiles were also cheaper than those made in new york and pennsylvania where farmworkers were paid more than in new england and textile wages consequently were higher.
manufacturers in those states garnered profits by using advanced technology to produce higher quality cloth.
even thomas jefferson the great champion of yeoman farming was impressed.
our manufacturers are now very nearly on a footing with those of england he boasted in 1825.
american mechanics and technological innovation by the 1820s american born artisans had replaced british immigrants at the cutting edge of technological innovation.
though few mechanics had a formal education they commanded respect as men professing an ingenious art in the philadelphia region the remarkable sellars family produced the most important inventors.
samuel sellars jr invented a machine for twisting worsted woolen yarn to give it an especially smooth surface.
his son john improved the efficiency of the waterwheels powering the familys sawmills and built a machine to weave wire sieves.
johns sons and grandsons ran machine shops that turned out riveted leather fire hoses papermaking equipment and eventually locomotives.
in 1824 the sellars and other mechanics founded the franklin institute in philadelphia.
named after benjamin franklin whom the mechanics admired for his work ethic and scientific accomplishments the institute published a journal provided high schoollevel instruction in chemistry mathematics and mechanical design and organized exhibits of new products.
craftsmen in ohio and other states established similar institutes to disseminate technical knowledge and encourage innovation.
between 1820 and 1860 the number of patents issued by the u s patent office rose from two hundred to four thousand a year.
american craftsmen pioneered the development of machine tools machines that made parts for other machines.
a key innovator was eli whitney 1765 1825 the son of a middling new england farm family.
at the age of fourteen whitney began fashioning nails and knife blades later he made womens hatpins.
aspiring to wealth and status trace change whitney won admission to yale over time college and subsequently worked what new types of prodas a tutor on a georgia cotton ucts came out of american plantation.
using his expertise in factories by the 1840s and making hatpins he built a simple 1850s.
machine in 1793 that separated eli whitney eli whitney posed for this portrait in the 1820s when he had achieved prosperity and social standing as the inventor of the cotton gin and other machines.
whitneys success prompted the artist his young new haven connecticut neighbor samuel f b morse to turn his creative energies from painting to industrial technology.
by the 1840s morse had devised the hardware for the first successful commercial telegraph and the software the morse code that it transmitted.

the seeds in a cotton boll from the delicate fibers work previously done slowly by hand.
although whitney patented his cotton engine or gin as it became known other manufacturers improved on his design and captured the market.
still seeking his fortune whitney decided in 1798 to manufacture military weapons.
he eventually designed and built machine tools that could rapidly produce interchangeable musket parts bringing him the wealth and fame he had long craved.
after whitneys death in 1825 his partner john h hall built an array of metalworking machine tools such as turret lathes milling machines and precision grinders.
technological innovation now swept through american manufacturing.
mechanics in the textile industry invented lathes planers and boring machines that turned out standardized parts for new spinning jennies and weaving looms.
despite being massproduced these jennies and looms were precisely made and operated at higher speeds than british equipment.
chapter 9 the leading inventor was richard garsed he nearly doubled the speed of the power looms in his fathers delaware factory and patented a cam and harness device that allowed damask and other elaborately designed fabrics to be machine woven.
meanwhile the mechanics employed by samuel w collins built a machine for pressing and hammering hot metal into dies cutting forms.
using this machine a worker could make three hundred ax heads a day compared to twelve using traditional methods.
in richmond virginia welsh and american born mechanics at the tredegar iron works produced great quantities of lowcost parts for complicated manufacturing equipment.
as a group of british observers noted admiringly many american products were made with machinery applied to almost every process.
all reduced to an almost perfect system of manufacture as mass production spread the american industrial revolution came of age.
reasonably priced products such as remington rifles singer sewing machines and yale locks became household names in the united states and abroad.
after winning praise at the crystal palace exhibition in london in 1851 the first major international display of industrial goods remington singer and other american firms became multinational businesses building factories in great britain and selling goods throughout europe.
by 1877 the singer manufacturing company controlled 75 percent of the world market for sewing machines.
wageworkers and the labor movement as the industrial revolution gathered momentum it changed the nature of workers lives.
following the american revolution many craft workers espoused artisan republicanism an ideology of production based diagram of mccormicks reaper the economic revolution was the result in part of increased output created by powerdriven machinery used in factories.
however machines also increased farm productivity.
using mccormicks reaper and a horse a farmer and his son could cut as much grain in a day as seven men with scythes.
they could now plant more acres and not worry about the wheat sprouting and becoming worthless before it could be harvested.
moreover as this advertisement from the may 1846 issue of the cultivator indicates farmers could easily repair their new reapers by providing mccormick with the letter denoting a broken part.

they saw themselves as small scale producers equal to one another and free to work for themselves.
the poet walt whitman summed up their outlook men must be masters under themselves free workers form unions however as the outwork and factory systems spread more and more workers became wage earners who labored under the control of an employer.
unlike young women who embraced factory work because it freed them from parental control and domestic service men bridled at their status as supervised wageworkers.
to assert their independent status male wageworkers rejected the traditional terms of master and servant and used the dutch word boss to refer to their employer.
likewise lowly appren understand tices refused to allow masters to points of view control their private nonwork how did the capitalist run lives and joined their mates in industrial economy conflict building a robust plebeian cul with artisan republicanture.
still as hired hands they ism and how did workers received meager wages and had respond.
little job security.
the artisanrepublican ideal of self ownership confronted the harsh reality of waged work in an industrializing capitalist society.
labor had become a commodity to be bought and sold.
some wage earners worked in carpentry stonecutting masonry and cabinetmaking traditional crafts that required specialized skills.
their strong sense of identity or trade consciousness enabled these workers to form unions and bargain with their master artisan employers.
they resented low wages and long hours which restricted their family life and educational opportunities.
in boston six hundred carpenters went on strike in 1825.
that protest failed but in 1840 craft part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 with a masters authority over his servant other lawsuits accused unions of conspiring to raise wages and thereby injure employers.
it is important to the best interests of society that the price of labor be left to regulate itself the new york supreme court declared in 1835 while excluding employers from this rule.
clothing manufacturers in new york city collectively agreed to set wage rates and to dismiss members of the society of journeymen tailors.
woodworker c 1850 skilled makers took great pride in their furniture which was often intricately designed and beautifully executed.
to underline the dignity of his occupation this woodworker poses in formal dress and proudly displays the tools of his craft.
a belief in the value of their labor was an important ingredient of the artisan republican ideology held by many workers.
library of congress.
workers in st louis secured a ten hour day and president van buren issued an executive order setting a similar workday for federal workers.
artisans in other occupations were less successful in preserving their pay and working conditions.
as aggressive entrepreneurs and machine technology took command shoemakers hatters printers furniture makers and weavers faced the regimentation of lowpaid factory work.
in response some artisans in these trades moved to small towns while in new york city 800 highly skilled cabinetmakers made fashionable furniture.
in status and income these cabinetmakers outranked a group of 3 200 semitrained wage earning workers disparagingly called botches who made cheaper tables and chairs in factories.
thus the new industrial system split the traditional artisan class into self employed craftsmen and wage earning workers.
when wage earners banded together to form unions they faced a legal hurdle english and american common law branded such groups as illegal combinations as a philadelphia judge put it unions were a government unto themselves and unlawfully interfered labor ideology despite such obstacles during the 1830s journeymen shoemakers founded mutual benefit societies in lynn massachusetts and other shoemaking centers.
as the workers explained the capitalist has no other interest in us than to get as much labor out of us as possible.
we are hired men and hired men like hired horses have no souls to exert more pressure on their employers in 1834 local unions from boston to philadelphia formed the national trades union the first regional union of different trades.
workers found considerable popular support for their cause.
when a new york city court upheld a conspiracy verdict against their union tailors warned that the freemen of the north are now on a level with the slaves of the south and organized a mass meeting of 27 000 people to denounce the decision.
in 1836 local juries hearing conspiracy cases acquitted shoemakers in hudson new york carpet makers in thompsonville connecticut and plasterers in philadelphia.
even when juries convicted workers judges imposed only light fines so labor organizers were not deterred.
then in commonwealth v hunt 1842 chief justice lemuel shaw of the massachusetts supreme judicial court overturned common law precedents and upheld the right of workers to form unions and call strikes to enforce closed shop agreements that limited employment to union members.
but many judges continued to resist unions by issuing injunctions forbidding strikes.
union leaders expanded artisan republicanism to include wageworkers.
arguing that wage earners were becoming slaves to a monied aristocracy they condemned the new factory system in which capital and labor stand opposed to create a just society in which workers could live as comfortably as others they advanced a labor theory of value.
under this theory the price of goods should reflect the labor required to make them and the income from their sale should go primarily to the producers not to factory owners middlemen or storekeepers.
the poor who perform the work ought to receive at least half of that sum which is charged to the consumer declared minister chapter 9 ezra stiles ely.
union activists agreed organizing nearly fifty strikes for higher wages in 1836.
appealing to the spirit of the american revolution which had destroyed the aristocracy of birth they called for a new revolution to demolish the aristocracy of capital.
women textile operatives were equally active.
competition in the woolen and cotton textile industries was fierce because mechanization caused output to grow faster than consumer demand.
as textile prices fell manufacturers revenues declined.
to maintain profits employers reduced workers wages and imposed tougher work rules.
in 1828 and again in 1834 women mill workers in dover new hampshire went on strike and won some relief.
in lowell two thousand women operatives backed a strike by withdrawing their savings from an employer owned bank.
one of the leaders mounted a pump the boston transcript reported and made a flaming.
speech on the rights of women and the iniquities of the monied aristocracy increasingly young new england women refused to enter the mills and impoverished irish and later french canadian immigrants took their places.
in 1857 the new economic system faltered as overproduction and a financial panic sparked by the bankruptcies of several railroads pushed the economy into a recession.
urban unemployment soared to 10 percent and reminded americans of the social costs of industrial production.
the market revolution as american factories and farms churned out more goods legislators and businessmen created faster and cheaper ways to get those products to consumers.
around 1820 they began constructing a massive system of canals and roads linking states along the atlantic coast with new states in the trans appalachian west.
this transportation system set in motion both a crucial market revolution and a massive migration of people to the greater mississippi river basin.
this huge area drained by six river systems the missouri arkansas red ohio tennessee and mississippi contains the largest and most productive contiguous acreage of arable land in the world.
by 1860 nearly one third of the nations citizens lived in eight of its states the midwest consisting of the five states carved out of the northwest territory ohio indiana illinois michigan and wisconsin along with missouri iowa and minnesota.
there they created a rich agricultural economy and an industrializing society similar to that of the northeast.
transforming the economy 1800 1860 the transportation revolution forges regional ties with the indian peoples in retreat slave owning planters from the lower south settled in missouri admitted to the union in 1821 and pushed on to arkansas admitted in 1836.
simultaneously yeomen families from the upper south joined migrants from new england and new york in farming the fertile lands near the great lakes.
once indiana and illinois were settled land hungry farmers poured into michigan 1837 iowa 1846 and wisconsin 1848 where they resided among tens of thousands of hardworking immigrants from germany.
to meet the demand for cheap farmsteads congress in 1820 reduced the price of federal land from 2 00 an acre to 1 25.
for 100 a farmer could buy 80 acres the minimum required under federal law.
by the 1840s this generous policy had enticed about 5 million people to states and territories west of the appalachians map 9 2.
to link the midwestern settlers to the seaboard states congress approved funds for a national road constructed of compacted gravel.
the project began in 1811 at cumberland in western maryland at the head of navigation of the potomac river reached wheeling virginia now west virginia on the ohio river in 1818 and ended in vandalia illinois in 1839.
the national road and other interregional highways carried migrants and their heavily loaded wagons westward these migrants passed livestock herds heading in the opposite direction destined for eastern markets.
to link the settler communities with each other state legislatures chartered private companies to build toll roads or turnpikes.
canals and steamboats shrink distance even on well built gravel roads overland travel was slow and expensive.
to carry people crops and manufactures to and from the great mississippi river basin public money and private businesses developed a water borne transportation system of unprecedented size complexity and cost.
the key event was the new york legislatures 1817 financing of the erie canal a 364 mile waterway connecting the hudson river and lake erie.
previously the longest canal in the united states was just 28 miles long reflecting the huge capital cost of canals and the lack of american engineering expertise.
new yorks ambitious project had three things working in its favor the vigorous support of new york citys merchants who wanted access to western markets the backing of new yorks governor de witt clinton who proposed to finance the waterway from tax revenues part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 1830 1839 n w e s iowa territory 1850 1862 minn n wis w wis terr.

during the 1830s the offices sold huge amounts of land in the corn and wheat belt of the midwest ohio indiana illinois and michigan and the cotton belt to the south especially alabama and mississippi.
as settlers moved westward in the 1850s most sales were in the upper mississippi river valley particularly iowa and wisconsin.

even so the task was enormous.
workers many of them irish immigrants dug out millions of cubic yards of soil quarried thousands of tons of rock for the huge locks that raised and lowered the boats and constructed vast reservoirs to ensure a steady supply of water.
the first great engineering project in american history the erie canal altered the ecology of an entire region.
as farming communities and market towns sprang up along the waterway settlers cut down millions of trees to provide wood for houses and barns and to open the land for growing crops and grazing animals.
cows and sheep foraged identify causes in pastures that had recently which was more important been forests occupied by deer in the market revolution and bears and spring rains government support for caused massive erosion of the transportation or technodenuded landscape.
logical innovations and whatever its environmental why was that the case.
consequences the erie canal was an instant economic success.
the first 75 mile section opened in 1819 and quickly yielded enough revenue to repay its construction cost.
when workers finished the canal in 1825 a 40 foot wide ribbon of water stretched from buffalo on the eastern shore of lake erie to albany where it joined the hudson river for the 150 mile trip to new york city.
the canals water must be the most fertilizing of all fluids suggested novelist nathaniel hawthorne for it causes towns with their masses of brick and stone their churches and theaters their business and hubbub their luxury and refinement their gay dames and polished citizens to spring up the erie canal brought prosperity to the farmers of central and western new york and the entire great lakes region.
northeastern manufacturers shipped clothing boots and agricultural equipment to farm families in return farmers sent grain cattle and hogs as well as raw materials leather wool and hemp for example to eastern cities and foreign markets.
onehundred ton freight barges each pulled by two horses chapter 9 transforming the economy 1800 1860 view of the erie canal this pastoral view of the erie canal near lockport new york painted by artist john william hill hints at this waterways profound impact on american life.
without the canal the town in the background would not exist and farmers such as the man in the foreground would not have a regional market for their cattle and grain.
the success of the erie canal had led to the construction of a vast system of canals by 1860.
this infrastructure was as important to the nation as the railroad network of the late nineteenth century and the interstate highway and airport transportation systems of the late twentieth century.
bettmann corbis.
moved along the canal at a steady 30 miles a day cutting transportation costs and accelerating the flow of goods.
in 1818 the mills in rochester new york processed 26 000 barrels of flour for export east and north to montreal for sale as canadian produce to the west indies ten years later their output soared to 200 000 barrels and by 1840 it was at 500 000 barrels.
the spectacular benefits of the erie canal prompted a national canal boom.
civic and business leaders in philadelphia and baltimore proposed waterways to link their cities to the midwest.
copying new yorks fiscal innovations they persuaded their state legislatures to invest directly in canal companies or to force state chartered banks to do so.
they also won state guarantees that encouraged british and dutch investors as one observer noted in 1844 the prosperity of america her railroads canals steam navigation and banks are the fruit of english capital soon artificial waterways connected philadelphia and baltimore via the pennsylvania canal and the chesapeake and ohio canal to the great lakes region.
equally important was the vast network of navigable rivers that drained into the mississippi.
every year 25 000 farmer built flatboats used these waterways to carry produce to new orleans.
in 1848 the completion of the michigan and illinois canal which linked chicago to the mississippi river completed an inland all water route from new york city to new orleans the two most important port cities in north america map 9 3.
the steamboat another product of the industrial age added crucial flexibility to the mississippi basins river based transportation system.
in 1807 engineerinventor robert fulton built the first american steamboat the clermont which he piloted up the hudson river.
to navigate shallow western rivers engineers broadened steamboats hulls to reduce their draft and enlarge their cargo capacity.
these improved vessels halved the cost of upstream river transport along the mississippi river and its tributaries and dramatically increased the flow of goods people and news.
in 1830 a traveler or a letter from new york could reach buffalo or pittsburgh by water in less than a week and detroit chicago or st louis in two weeks.
in 1800 the same journeys had taken twice as long.
the state and national governments played key roles in developing this interregional network of trade and travel.
state legislatures subsidized canals while the national government created a vast postal system the first network for the exchange of information.
thanks to the post office act of 1792 there were more than eight thousand post offices by 1830 and they safely delivered thousands of letters and banknotes worth millions of dollars.

short canals and navigable rivers carried cotton tobacco and other products from the countryside of the southern seaboard states into the atlantic commercial system.
a second system centered on the erie chesapeake and ohio and pennsylvania mainline canals linked northeastern seaports to the vast trans appalachian region.
finally a set of regional canals in the midwest connected most of the great lakes region to the ohio and mississippi rivers and the port of new orleans.

railroads link the north and midwest in the 1850s railroads another technological innovation joined canals as the core of the national transportation system map 9 4.
in 1852 canals carried twice the tonnage transported by railroads.
then capitalists in boston new york and london secured state charters for railroads and invested heavily in new lines which by 1860 had become the main carriers of wheat and freight from the midwest to the northeast.
serviced by a vast network of locomotive and freight car repair shops the erie pennsylvania new york central and the baltimore and ohio railroads connected the atlantic ports new york philadelphia and baltimore with the rapidly expanding great lakes cities of cleveland and chicago thinking like a historian p 298.
the railroad boom also linked these western cities to adjacent states.
chicago based railroads carried huge quantities of lumber from michigan to the treeless prairies of indiana illinois iowa and missouri where settlers built 250 000 new farms covering 19 million acres and hundreds of small towns.
on their 400 miles 400 kilometers return journey the trains moved millions of bushels of wheat to chicago for transport to eastern markets.
increasingly they also carried livestock to chicagos slaughterhouses.
in jacksonville illinois a farmer decided to feed his entire corn crop of 1 500 bushels to hogs cattle as we think it is more profitable than to sell the corn a chicago newspaper boasted in ancient times all roads led to rome in modern times all roads lead to chicago initially midwestern settlers relied on manufactured goods imported from the northeast.
they bought high quality shovels and spades fabricated at the delaware iron works and the oliver ames company in easton massachusetts axes forged in connecticut factories and steel horseshoes manufactured in troy new york.
however by the 1840s midwestern entrepreneurs were also producing machine tools hardware furniture and especially agricultural implements.
working as a blacksmith in grand detour illinois john deere made his first steel plow out of old saws in 1837 ten years later he opened a factory in moline illinois that mass produced the plows.
stronger than the existing cast iron models built in new york deeres steel plows allowed farmers to cut through the thick sod of the prairies.
other midwestern companies such as mccormick and hussey mass produced self raking reapers that harvested 12 acres of grain a day rather than the 2 acres that an adult worker could chapter 9 minnesota transforming the economy 1800 1860 canada maine even in 1860 it was impossible to go from new york city to chicago without changing trains because of nonconnecting railroad lines.
although the railroads seem to form an integrated system companies used different gauges of track and two lines ending in the same city often did not connect with one another.

cut by hand.
with the harvest bottleneck removed farmers planted more acres and grew even more wheat.
flour soon accounted for 10 percent of all american exports to foreign markets.
interregional trade also linked southern cotton planters to northeastern textile plants and foreign markets.
this commerce in raw cotton bolstered the wealth of white southerners but did not transform their economic and social order as it did in the midwest.
with the exception of richmond virginia and a few other places southern planters did not invest their profits in manufacturing.
lacking cities factories and highly trained workers the south remained tied to agriculture even as the commerce in wheat corn and livestock promoted diversified economies in the northeast and midwest.
the growth of cities and towns the expansion of industry and trade dramatically increased americas urban population.
in 1820 there were 58 towns with more than 2 500 inhabitants by thinking like a historian the risks and rewards of technological innovation the nineteenth century was the age of progress and improved transportation was one of its hallmarks.
between the 1830s and the 1860s american capitalists and workers aided by state governments built steam powered railroads that stretched across the nation and reduced the cost of moving goods and people by more than 90 percent.
yet like all major technological changes the railroad revolution was controversial expensive and politically explosive.

new social classes and cultures the industrial revolution and the market revolution improved the lives of many americans who now lived in larger houses cooked on iron stoves and wore better made clothes.
yet in the booming cities the new economic order spawned distinct social classes a small but wealthy business elite a substantial middle class and a mass of propertyless wage earners.
by creating a class divided society industrialization posed a momentous challenge to americas republican ideals.
the business elite before industrialization white americans thought of their society in terms of rank notable families had higher status than those from the lower orders yet in transforming the economy 1800 1860 rural areas people of different ranks often shared a common culture.

the urban economy made a few city residents the merchants manufacturers bankers and landlords who made up the business elite very rich.
in 1800 the richest 10 percent of the nations families owned about 40 percent of the wealth by 1860 they held nearly 70 percent.

state and local governments also favored the wealthy.
they taxed real estate farms city lots and buildings and tangible personal property furniture tools and machinery but almost never taxed stocks and bonds or the inheritances the rich passed on to their children.

urban workers and the poor architecture for the emergent middle class this dwelling was well suited for a farmer of wealth or a middle class suburbanite according to andrew downing author of the architecture of country houses 1850.
the exterior of the house exhibited a considerable degree of elegance while the interior boasted a substantial drawing room and dining room for the entertainment of guests and a parlor for more intimate conversations among family and friends.
downings books helped to define the culture of the growing middle class and diffuse it across the nation.
downing the architecture of country houses 1850 believed that diligent work in an earthly calling was a duty owed to god.
now the business elite and the middle class gave this idea a secular twist by celebrating work as the key to individual social mobility and national prosperity.

in 1840 all of the nations slaves some 2 5 million people and about half of its adult white workers another 3 million were laboring for others.
the bottom 10 percent of white wage earners consisted of casual workers hired on a short term basis for arduous jobs.
poor women washed clothes their husbands and sons carried lumber and bricks for construction projects loaded ships and dug out dirt and stones to build canals.
when they could find jobs these men earned their dollar per diem a longtime resident told readers of the baltimore american but they could never save enough to pay rent buy fire wood and eatables when the job market or the harbor froze up.
during business depressions casual laborers suffered and died in good times their jobs were temporary and dangerous.
other laborers had greater security of employment but few were prospering.
in massachusetts in 1825 an unskilled worker earned about two thirds as much as a mechanic did two decades later it was less than half chapter 9 as much.
a journeyman carpenter in philadelphia reported that he was about even with the world after several years of work but that many of his coworkers were in debt.
the 18 000 women who sewed mens ready made clothing in new york city in the 1850s earned just a few pennies a day less than 100 a year about 3 000 today.
such meager wages barely paid for food and rent so poorer workers could not take advantage of the rapidly falling prices of manufactured goods.
only the most fortunate working class families could afford to educate their children buy apprenticeships for their sons or accumulate small dowries for their daughters.
most families sent ten year old children out to work and the death of a parent often threw the survivors into dire poverty.

the urban police mostly low paid watchmen and untrained constables were unable to contain the lawlessness.
the benevolent empire the disorder among wage earners alarmed the rising middle classes who wanted safe cities and a disciplined workforce.
to improve the world around them many upwardly mobile men and women embraced religious benevolence.
led by congregational and presbyterian ministers they created organizations of conservative social reform that historians call the benevolent empire which became prominent in the 1820s.
the reformers goal was to restore the moral government of god by reducing the consumption of alcohol and other vices that resulted in poverty explained presbyterian minister lyman beecher.

and the american society for the promotion of temperance among many others.
each organization had a managing staff a network of hundreds of chapters thousands of volunteer members and a newspaper.
often acting in concert these benevolent groups worked to improve society.
first they encouraged people to lead disciplined lives and acquire regular habits they persuaded local governments to ban carnivals of drink and dancing such as negro election day festivities in which african americans symbolically took control of the government which had been enjoyed by whites as well as blacks.
second they devised new institutions to help the needy and control the unruly.
reformers provided homes of refuge for abandoned children and asylums for the insane who previously had been confined by their families in attics and cellars.
they campaigned to end corporal punishment of criminals and to rehabilitate them in specially designed penitentiaries.
women formed a crucial part of the benevolent empire.
since the 1790s upper class women had sponsored charitable organizations such as the society for the relief of poor widows with small children founded in 1797 in new york by isabella graham a devout presbyterian widow.
her daughter joanna bethune set up other charitable institutions including the orphan asylum society and the society for the promotion of industry which found jobs for hundreds of poor women as spinners and seamstresses.
some reformers believed that declining observance by christians of the sabbath sunday as a day devoted to religion was the greatest threat to the moral government of god as the market revolution spread merchants and storekeepers conducted business on sundays and urban saloons provided drink and entertainment.
to halt these profane activities lyman beecher and other ministers founded the general union for promoting the observance of the christian sabbath in 1828.
general union chapters replete with womens auxiliaries sprang up from maine to part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 cincinnati and beyond.
the general union demanded that congress repeal an 1810 law allowing mail to be transported though not delivered on sundays.
members boycotted shipping companies that did business on the sabbath and campaigned for municipal laws forbidding games and festivals on the lords day.
the benevolent empires efforts to impose its sabbatarian values provoked opposition from workers and freethinkers.

when evangelical reformers proposed teaching christianity to slaves they aroused hostility among white southerners.
this popular resistance by workers and planters limited the success of the benevolent empire.
charles grandison finney revivalism and reform presbyterian minister charles grandison finney found a new way to propagate religious values.
finney was not part of the traditional religious elite.
born into a poor farming family in connecticut he had planned to become a lawyer and rise into the middle class.
but in 1823 finney underwent an intense religious experience and chose the ministry as his career.
beginning in towns along the erie canal the young minister conducted emotional revival meetings that stressed conversion rather than doctrine.
repudiating calvinist beliefs he preached that god would welcome any sinner who submitted to the holy spirit.
finneys ministry drew on and greatly accelerated the second great awakening the wave of protestant revivalism that had begun after the revolution chapter 8.
evangelical beliefs finneys central message was that god has made man a moral free agent who could choose salvation.
this doctrine of free will was particularly attractive to members of the new middle class who had accepted personal responsibility for their lives improved their material condition and welcomed finneys assurance that heaven was also within their grasp.
but finney also had great success in converting people at both ends of the social spectrum from the haughty rich who had placed themselves charles grandison finney evangelist 1792 1875 when an unknown artist painted this flattering portrait in 1834 finney was forty two years old and at the height of his career as an evangelist.
handsome and charismatic finney had just led a series of enormously successful revivals in rochester new york and other cities along the erie canal.
in 1835 he established a theology department at newly founded oberlin college in ohio where he trained a generation of ministers and served as president from 1851 to 1866.

above god to the abject poor who seemed lost to drink and sloth.
finney celebrated their common fellowship in christ and identified them spiritually with pious middle class respectability.
finneys most spectacular triumph came in 1830 when he moved his revivals from small towns to rochester new york now a major milling and commercial city on the erie canal.
preaching every day for six months and promoting group prayer meetings in family homes finney won over the influential merchants and manufacturers of rochester.
they promised to attend church give up intoxicating beverages and work hard.
to encourage their employees to do the same wealthy businessmen founded a free presbyterian church free because members did not have to pay for pew space.
other evangelical protestants founded churches to serve transient canal laborers and pious businessmen set up a savings bank to encourage thrift among the working classes.
meanwhile finneys wife chapter 9 lydia and other middle class women carried the christian message to the wives of the unconverted set up sunday schools for poor children and formed the female charitable society to assist the unemployed.
finneys efforts to create a spiritual christian community were not completely successful.
skilled workers in strong craft organizations boot makers carpenters stonemasons and boatbuilders protested that they needed higher wages and better schools more urgently than sermons and prayers.
poor people ignored finneys revival as did irish catholic immigrants many of whom hated protestants as religious heretics and political oppressors.
nonetheless revivalists from new england to the midwest copied finneys evangelical message and techniques.
in new york city wealthy silk merchants arthur and lewis tappan founded a magazine the christian evangelist that promoted finneys ideas.
the revivals swept through pennsylvania north carolina tennessee and indiana where a convert reported you could not go upon the street and hear any conversation transforming the economy 1800 1860 except upon religion the success of the revivals has been so general and thorough concluded a presbyterian general assembly that the whole customs of society have changed explain consequences what was finneys central message and how did it influence the work of reform movements.
temperance the temperance movement was the most successful social reform.
beer and rum had long been standard fare in american rituals patriotic ceremonies work breaks barn raisings and games.
long before the arrival of spirit drinking irish and beerdrinking german immigrants grogshops dotted almost every block in working class districts and were centers of disorder.
during the 1820s and 1830s alcohol consumption reached new heights even among the elite alcoholism killed daniel tompkins vice president under james monroe and undermined henry clays bid for the presidency.
heavy drinking was especially devastating for wage earners who could ill afford its costs.
although methodist artisans and ambitious the drunkards progress from the first glass to the grave this 1846 lithograph published by n currier suggests the inevitable fate of those who drink.
the drunkards descent into poverty and disease ends with death by suicide leaving a grieving and destitute wife and child.
temperance reformers urged americans to take the cold water cure by drinking water instead of alcoholic beverages.
to promote abstinence among the young in 1836 revivalist preacher reverend thomas poage hunt founded the cold water army an organization that grew to embrace several hundred thousand children all of whom pledged perpetual hate to all that can intoxicate library of congress.
american voices a debate over catholic immigration between 1776 and 1830 few immigrants came to the united states.
then increasing population and poverty in europe prompted the migration of hundreds of thousands of germans both catholics and protestants and irish catholics.
the sudden arrival of foreign catholics amidst the intense protestantism of the second great awakening led to religious riots the formation of the nativist american party and sharp debates in the public press.
contemporary pamphlets and books offer historians access to the public rhetoric and the private passions of the time.
lyman beecher catholicism is incompatible with republicanism lyman beecher 1775 1863 was a leading protestant minister and the father of a remarkable family the influential minister henry ward beecher and authors harriet beecher stowe uncle toms cabin and catharine beecher a treatise on domestic economy.
in a plea for the west 1835 lyman beecher warned protestants of the powerful priestly hierarchy of the roman catholic church and its opposition to republicanism.
papal encyclicals issued by pope gregory xvi mirari vos 1832 and pope pius ix quanta cura 1864 condemned republicanism freedom of conscience and the separation of church and state as false political ideologies.
since the irruption of the northern barbarians the world has never witnessed such a rush of dark minded population from one country to another as is now leaving europe and dashing upon our shores.
they come also not undirected.
they are led or followed quickly by a catholic priesthood who maintain over them in the land of strangers and unknown tongues an absolute ascendancy.
the ministers of no protestant sect could or would dare to attempt to regulate the votes of their people as the catholic priests can do who.
have almost unlimited power over the conscience as it respects the performance of every civil or social duty.
there is another point of dissimilarity.
the opinions of the protestant clergy are congenial with liberty they are chosen by the people who have been educated as freemen and they are dependent on them for patronage and support.
the catholic system is adverse to liberty and the clergy to a great extent are dependent on foreigners the pope and european bishops opposed to the principles of our government.
nor is this all.
how many mechanics merchants lawyers physicians in any political crisis might the priests reach and render timid.
a tenth part of the suffrage of the nation thus condensed and wielded by the catholic powers of europe might decide our elections perplex our policy inflame and divide the nation break the bond of our union and throw down our free institutions.
catholicism is a religion which never prospered but in alliance with despotic governments has always been and still is the inflexible enemy of liberty of conscience and free inquiry and at this moment is the main stay of the battle against republican institutions.

orestes brownson catholicism as a necessity for popular government like lyman beecher orestes brownson was born into the presbyterian church but he quickly grew dissatisfied with its doctrines.
after experimenting with unitarianism communalism socialism and transcendentalism brownson converted to catholicism in 1844.
a zealous convert brownson defended catholicism with rigorous provocative arguments in this article catholicity necessary to sustain popular liberty 1845.
without the roman catholic religion it is impossible to preserve a democratic government and secure its free orderly and wholesome action.
the theory of democracy is construct your government and commit it to the people to be taken care of.
as they shall think proper.
it is a beautiful theory and would work admirably if it were not for one little difficulty namely the people are fallible both individually and collectively and governed by their passions and interests which not unfrequently lead them far astray and produce much mischief.
we know of but one solution of the difficulty and that is in religion.
there is no foundation for virtue but in religion and it is only religion that can command the degree of popular virtue and intelligence requisite to insure to popular government the right direction.
but what religion.
it must be a religion which is above the people and controls them or it will not answer the purpose.
it cannot be protestantism because.
the faith and discipline of a protestant sect take any and every direction the public opinion of that sect demands.
all is loose floating is here to day is there tomorrow and next day may be nowhere.
according to the prejudices interests or habits of the people.
here then is the reason why protestantism though it may institute cannot sustain popular liberty.
it is itself subject to popular control and must follow in all things the popular will passion interest ignorance prejudice or caprice.
if protestantism will not answer the purpose what religion will.
the roman catholic or none.
the roman catholic religion assumes as its point of departure that it is instituted not to be taken care of by the people but to take care of the people not to be governed by them but to govern them.
the word is harsh in democratic ears we admit but it is not the office of religion to say soft or pleasing words.
the people need governing and must be governed or nothing but anarchy and destruction await them.
they must have a master.
quote our expression the people must have a master as you doubtless will hold it up in glaring capitals to excite the unthinking and unreasoning multitude and to doubly fortify their prejudices against catholicity.
even as you seek to bring the people into subjection to your banks or moneyed corporations.
the roman catholic religion then is necessary to sustain popular liberty because popular liberty can be sustained only by a religion free from popular control above the people speaking from above and able to command them.

the society grew quickly to two thousand chapters and more than 200 000 members.
its nationwide campaign employed revivalist methods group confession and prayer using women as spiritual guides and sudden emotional conversion and was a stunning success.
on one day in new york city in 1841 more than 4 000 people took the temperance pledge the annual consumption of spirits fell dramatically from an average of 5 gallons per person in 1830 to 2 gallons in 1845.
evangelical reformers celebrated religion as the key to moral improvement.
laziness and drinking might be cured by self discipline as benjamin franklin had argued but religious conversion would ensure a profound change of heart.
religious discipline and the ideology of social mobility thus served as powerful cements bonding middle class americans and wageearning citizens as they grappled with the economic divisions created by industrialization market expansion and increasing cultural diversity.
immigration and cultural conflict cultural diversity was the result of a vast wave of immigration.
between 1840 and 1860 about 2 million irish 1 5 million germans and 750 000 britons poured into the united states.
the british migrants were primarily protestants and relatively prosperous trained professionals propertied farmers and skilled workers.
many german immigrants also came from propertied farming and artisan families and had sufficient resources to move to the midwestern states of wisconsin iowa and missouri.
poorer germans and most of the irish settled in the northeast where by 1860 they numbered nearly one third of white adults.
most immigrants avoided the south because they feared competition from enslaved understand workers.
points of view why did the catholic irish poverty the poorest hierarchy consider repubmigrants irish peasants and licanism a threat.
why did laborers were fleeing a famine morse think the same of caused by severe overpopulation catholicism.
and a devastating blight that destroyed much of the irish potato crop.
they settled mostly in the cities of new england and new york.
the men took low paying jobs as factory hands construction workers and canal diggers while the women became washerwomen and domestic servants.
irish families crowded into cheap tenement buildings with primitive sanitation systems and were the first to die when disease struck a city.
in the summer of 1849 cholera epidemics took the lives of thousands of poor immigrants in st louis and new york city.
in times of hardship and sorrow immigrants turned to their churches.
many germans and virtually all the irish were catholics and they fueled the growth of the american catholic church.
in 1840 there were 16 catholic dioceses and 700 churches by 1860 there were 45 dioceses and 2 500 churches.
guided by their priests and bishops catholics built an impressive network of institutions charitable societies orphanages militia companies parochial schools and political organizations that maintained both their religion and their german or irish identity.
nativism confronted by catholic and germanspeaking immigrants some american born citizens formed nativist movements that condemned immigration and asserted the superiority of protestant religious and cultural values.
in 1834 artist and inventor samuel f b morse published foreign conspiracy against the liberties of the united states which warned of a catholic threat to american republican institutions.
morse argued that catholic immigrants would obey the dictates of pope gregory xvi 1831 1846 who urged catholics to repudiate republicanism and acknowledge the submission due to princes and to the papacy.
republican minded protestants of many denominations shared morses fears of papal interference in american life and politics and foreign conspiracy became their handbook american voices p 308.
the social tensions stemming from industrialization intensified nativist and anti catholic attitudes.
unemployed protestant mechanics and factory workers joined mobs that attacked catholic immigrants accusing them of taking jobs and driving down wages.
these cultural conflicts undercut trade unionism because many protestant wage earners sided more with their protestant employers than with their catholic coworkers.
benevolent minded protestants supported the anti catholic movement for reasons of public policy.
as crusaders for public education they opposed the use of tax resources for catholic schools as advocates of temperance and civilized manners they condemned the rowdyism of drunken irish men.
chapter 9 religious and cultural tensions led to violence.
in 1834 in charlestown massachusetts a quarrel between catholic laborers repairing a convent and protestant workers in a neighboring brickyard led to a full scale riot and the convents destruction.
in 1844 in philadelphia riots erupted when the catholic bishop persuaded public school officials to use both catholic and protestant versions of the bible.
anti irish violence incited by the citys nativist clubs eventually escalated into open warfare between protestants and the pennsylvania militia.
thus even as the american economic revolution attracted millions of european immigrants it divided society along lines of ethnicity and religion as well as class.
summary this chapter examined the causes of the economic transformation of the first half of the nineteenth century.
that transformation had two facets a major increase in production the industrial revolution and the chapter review expansion of commerce the market revolution.
water steam and minerals such as coal and iron were crucial ingredients in both revolutions driving factory machinery carrying goods to market on canals and rivers and propelling steamboats and railroad engines.
we also explored the consequences of that transformation the rise of an urban society the increasing similarity between the northeast and midwest and their growing difference from the south and the creation of a society divided by class and ethnicity.
to shape this emerging society benevolent reformers and evangelical revivalists worked to instill moral discipline and christian values.
however artisan republicans unionized workers and irish and german immigrants had their own cultural values and economic interests.
the result was a fragmented society.
as the next chapter suggests americans looked to their political system which was becoming increasingly democratic to address these social divisions.
in fact the tensions among economic inequality cultural diversity and political democracy became a troubling and enduring part of american life.

the negative verdict was nearly unanimous.
the most able men in the united states are very rarely placed at the head of affairs french aristocrat alexis de tocqueville concluded in democracy in america 1835.
the reason said tocqueville lay in the character of democracy itself.
most citizens ignored important policy issues jealously refused to elect their intellectual superiors and listened in awe to the clamor of a mountebank a charismatic fraud who knows the secret of stimulating their tastes these europeans were witnessing the american democratic revolution.
before 1815 men of ability had sat in the seats of government and the prevailing ideology had been republicanism or rule by men of talents and virtue as a newspaper put it.
many of those leaders feared popular rule so they wrote constitutions with bills of rights bicameral legislatures and independent judiciaries and they censured overambitious men who campaigned for public office.
but history took a different course.
by the 1820s and 1830s the watchwords were democracy and party politics a system run by men who avidly sought office and rallied supporters through newspapers broadsides and great public processions.
politics became a sport a competitive contest for the votes of ordinary men.
that the majority should govern was a fundamental maxim in all free governments declared martin van buren the most talented of the new breed of professional politicians.
a republican minded virginian condemned van buren as too great an intriguer but by encouraging ordinary americans to burn with election fever and support party principles he and other politicians redefined the meaning of democratic government and made it work.
the politics of democracy as ordinary american men asserted a claim to a voice in government affairs politicians catered to their preferences and prejudices.
aspiring candidates took their messages to voters in rural hamlets as well as large towns.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 the rise of popular politics 1810 1828 expansion of the franchise the right to vote dramatically symbolized the democratic revolution.
by the 1830s most states allowed nearly all white men to vote.
nowhere else in the world did ordinary farmers and wage earners exercise such political influence in england the reform bill of 1832 extended the vote to only 600 000 out of 6 million men a mere 10 percent.
equally important political parties provided voters with the means to express their preferences.
the decline of the notables and the rise of parties the american revolution weakened the elite run society of the colonial era but did not overthrow it.
only two states pennsylvania and vermont gave the vote to all male taxpayers and many families of low rank continued to defer to their social betters consequently wealthy notables northern landlords slave owning planters and seaport merchants dominated the political system in the new republic.
and rightly so said john jay the first chief justice of the supreme court those who own the country are the most fit persons to participate in the government of it jay and other notables managed local elections by building up an interest lending money to small farmers giving business to storekeepers and treating their tenants to rum.
an outlay of 20 for refreshments remarked one poll watcher may produce about 100 votes this gentry dominated system kept men who lacked wealth and powerful family connections from seeking office.
the rise of democracy to expand the suffrage maryland reformers in the 1810s invoked the equalrights rhetoric of republicanism.
they charged that property qualifications for voting were a tyranny because they endowed one class of men with privileges which are denied to another to defuse such arguments and deter migration to the west legislators in maryland and other seaboard states grudgingly accepted a broader franchise and identify causes its democratic results.

smallholding farmers and ambitious laborers in the midwest and southwest likewise challenged the old hierarchical order.
in ohio a traveler reported no white man or woman will bear being called a servant the constitutions of the new states of indiana 1816 illinois 1818 and alabama 1819 prescribed a broad male franchise and voters usually elected middling men to local and state offices.
a well to do migrant in illinois was surprised to learn that the man who plowed his fields was a colonel of militia and a member of the legislature once in public office men from modest backgrounds restricted imprisonment for debt kept taxes low and allowed farmers to claim squatters rights to unoccupied land.
by the mid 1820s many state legislatures had given the vote to all white men or to all men who paid taxes or served in the militia.
only a few north carolina virginia and rhode island still required the possession of freehold property.
equally significant between 1818 and 1821 connecticut massachusetts and new york wrote more democratic constitutions that reapportioned legislative districts on the basis of population and mandated the popular election rather than the appointment of judges and justices of the peace.
democratic politics was contentious and because it attracted ambitious men often corrupt.
powerful entrepreneurs and speculators both notables and self made men demanded government assistance and paid bribes to get it.
speculators won land grants by paying off the members of important committees and bankers distributed shares of stock to key legislators.
when the seventh ward bank of new york city received a legislative charter in 1833 the banks officials set aside one third of the 3 700 shares of stock for themselves and their friends and almost two thirds for state legislators and bureaucrats leaving just 40 shares for public sale america compared p 317.
more political disputes broke out when religious reformers sought laws to enforce the cultural agenda of the benevolent empire.
in utica new york evangelical presbyterians insisted upon a town ordinance restricting sunday entertainment.
in response a member of the local universalist church a freethinking protestant denomination denounced the measure as coercive and called for religious liberty parties take command the appearance of political parties encouraged such debates over government policy.

instead he produced a brilliant analysis of the new republican society and politics democracy in america 1835 1840.
this letter to a french friend reveals his thinking and insights.
do you know what in this countrys political realm makes the most vivid impression on me.
the effect of laws governing inheritance.
the english had exported their laws of primogeniture according to which the eldest acquired three quarters of the fathers fortune.
this resulted in a host of vast territorial domains passing from father to son and wealth remaining in families.
my american informants tell me that there was no aristocracy but instead a class of great landowners leading a simple rather intellectual life characterized by its air of good breeding its manners and a strong sense of family pride.
since then inheritance laws have been revised.
primogeniture gave way to equal division with almost magical results.
domains split up passing into other hands.
family spirit disappeared.
the aristocratic bias that marked the republics early years was replaced by a democratic thrust of irresistible force.
ive seen several members of these old families.
they regret the loss of everything aristocratic patronage family pride high tone.
there can be no doubt that the inheritance law is responsible in some considerable measure for this complete triumph of democratic principles.
the americans.
agree that it has made us what we are it is the foundation of our republic.
when i apply these ideas to france i cannot resist the thought that louis xviiis charter of 1814 sought to restore the pre revolutionary regime by creating.
aristocratic institutions in political law but by mandating equality before the law and retaining the revolutionaryera inheritance laws giving all children irrespective of sex an equal share of the parental estate within the domain of civil law gave shelter to a democratic principle and national constitutions made no mention of political parties.
however as the power of notables waned in the 1820s disciplined political parties appeared in a number of states.
usually they were run by professional politicians often middle class lawyers and journalists.
one observer called the new parties political machines because like the new power driven textile looms they so vigorous that it was bound before long to destroy the foundations of the edifice it raised.
we are moving toward an unrestricted democracy.
would not suit france at all.
however there is no human power capable of changing the law of inheritance and with this change our families will disappear possessions will pass into other hands wealth will be increasingly equalized the upper class will melt into the middle the latter will become immense and shape everything to its level.
what i see in america leaves me doubting that government by the multitude even under the most favorable circumstances and they exist here is a good thing.
there is general agreement that in the early days of the republic statesmen and members of the two legislative houses were much more distinguished than they are today.
they almost all belonged to that class of landowners i mentioned above.
the populace no longer chooses with such a sure hand.
it generally favors those who flatter its passions and descend to its level.

martin van buren of new york was the chief architect of the emerging system of party government.
the ambitious son of a jeffersonian tavern keeper van buren grew up in the landlord dominated society of the hudson river valley.
to get training as a lawyer he part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 martin van buren martin van burens skills as a lawyer and a politician won him many admirers as did his personal charm sharp intellect and imperturbable composure.
little van a mere 5 feet 6 inches in height had almost as many detractors.
davy crockett kentucky frontiersman land speculator and congressman labeled him an artful cunning intriguing selfish lawyer concerned only with office and money in truth van buren was a complex man a middle class lawyer with republican values and aristocratic tastes who nonetheless created a democratic political party.
national portrait gallery smithsonian institution art resource ny.
relied on the van ness clan a powerful local gentry family.
then determined not to become their dependent tool van buren repudiated their tutelage and set out to create a political order based on party identity not family connections.
in justifying party governments van buren rejected the traditional republican belief that political factions were dangerous and claimed that the opposite was true all men of sense know that political parties are inseparable from free government because they checked an elected officials inherent disposition to abuse power to see a longer excerpt of martin van burens autobiography along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
between 1817 and 1821 in new york van buren turned his bucktail supporters who wore a deers tail on their hats into the first statewide political machine.
he purchased a newspaper the albany argus and used it to promote his policies and get out the vote.
patronage was an even more important tool.
when van burens bucktails won control of the new york legislature in 1821 they acquired the power to appoint some six thousand of their friends to positions in new yorks legal bureaucracy of judges justices of the peace sheriffs deed commissioners and coroners.
critics called this ruthless distribution of offices a spoils system but van buren argued it was fair operating sometimes in favour of one party and sometimes of another party government was thoroughly republican he added because it reflected the preferences of a majority of the citizenry.
to ensure the passage of the partys legislative program van buren insisted on disciplined voting as determined by a caucus a meeting of party leaders.
on one crucial occasion the little magician a nickname reflecting van burens short stature and political dexterity honored seventeen new york legislators for sacrificing individual preferences for the general good of the party.
the election of 1824 the advance of political democracy in the states undermined the traditional notable dominated system of national politics.
after the war of 1812 the aristocratic federalist party virtually disappeared and the republican party splintered into competing factions chapter 7.
as the election of 1824 approached five republican candidates campaigned for the presidency.
three were veterans of president james monroes cabinet secretary of state john quincy adams the son of former president john adams secretary of war john c calhoun and secretary of the treasury william h crawford.
the other candidates were henry clay of kentucky the hard drinking dynamic speaker of the house of representatives and general andrew jackson now a senator from tennessee.
when the republican caucus in congress selected crawford as the partys official nominee the other candidates took their case to the voters.
thanks to democratic reforms eighteen of the twenty four states required popular elections rather than a vote of the state legislature to choose their representatives to the electoral college.
each candidate had strengths.
thanks to his diplomatic successes as secretary of state john quincy chapter 10 mich terr.

rr te adams enjoyed national recognition and his familys prestige in massachusetts ensured him the electoral votes of new england.
henry clay based his candidacy on the american system his integrated mercantilist program of national economic development similar to the commonwealth system of the state governments.
clay wanted to strengthen the second bank of the united states raise tariffs and use tariff revenues to finance internal improvements that is public works such as roads and canals.
his nationalistic program won praise in the west which needed better transportation but elicited sharp criticism in the south which relied on rivers to market its cotton and had few manufacturing industries to protect.
william crawford of georgia an ideological heir of thomas jefferson denounced clays american system as a scheme to consolidate political power in washington.
recognizing crawfords appeal in the south john c calhoun of south carolina withdrew from the race and endorsed andrew jackson.
as the hero of the battle of new orleans jackson benefitted from the surge of patriotism after the war of 1812.
born in the carolina backcountry jackson settled in nashville tennessee where he formed ties to influential families through marriage and a career as an attorney and a slave owning cotton planter.
his rise from common origins symbolized the new democratic age and his reputation as a plain solid republican attracted voters in all regions.
still jacksons strong showing in the electoral college surprised most political leaders.
the tennessee senator received 99 electoral votes adams garnered 84 votes crawford struck down by a stroke during the campaign won 41 and clay finished with 37 map 10 1.
because no candidate received an absolute majority the twelfth amendment to the constitution ratified in 1804 set the rules the house of representatives would choose the president from among the three highest vote getters.
this procedure hurt jackson because many congressmen feared that the rough hewn military chieftain might become a tyrant.
excluded from the race henry clay used his influence as speaker to thwart jacksons election.
clay assembled a coalition of representatives from new england and the ohio river valley that voted adams into the presidency in 1825.
adams showed his gratitude by appointing clay his secretary of state the traditional stepping stone to the presidency.
clays appointment was politically fatal for both men jacksons supporters accused clay and adams of making a corrupt bargain and they vowed to oppose adamss policies and to prevent clays rise to the presidency.

john quincy adams captured every electoral vote in new england and most of those in new york henry clay carried ohio and kentucky the most populous trans appalachian states and william crawford took the southern states of virginia and georgia.
only andrew jackson claimed a national constituency winning pennsylvania and new jersey in the east indiana and most of illinois in the midwest and much of the south.
only 356 000 americans voted about 27 percent of the eligible electorate.
the last notable president john quincy adams as president adams called for bold national action.
the moral purpose of the creator he told congress was to use the president to improve the conditions of himself and his fellow men adams called for the establishment of a national university in washington scientific explorations in the far west and a uniform standard of weights and measures.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 the fate of adamss policies manufacturers entrepreneurs and farmers in the northeast and midwest welcomed adamss proposals.

in 1817 president madison had vetoed the bonus bill which proposed using the national governments income from the second bank of the united states to fund improvement projects in the states.
such projects madison argued were the sole responsibility of the states a sentiment shared by the republican followers of thomas jefferson.
in 1824 martin van buren likewise declared his allegiance to the constitutional doctrines of the jefferson school and his opposition to consolidated government a powerful and potentially oppressive national administration.
now a member of the u s senate van buren helped to defeat most of adamss proposed subsidies for roads and canals.
the tariff battle the major battle of the adams administration came over tariffs.
the tariff of 1816 had placed relatively high duties on imports of cheap english cotton cloth allowing new england textile producers to control that segment of the market.
in 1824 adams and clay secured a new tariff that protected new england and pennsylvania manufacturers from more expensive woolen and cotton textiles and also english iron goods.
without these tariffs british imports would have dominated the market and significantly inhibited american industrial development chapter 9 america compared p 289.
recognizing the appeal of tariffs van buren and his jacksonian allies hopped on the bandwagon.
by increasing duties on wool hemp and other imported raw materials they hoped to win the support of farmers in new york ohio and kentucky for jacksons presidential candidacy in 1828.
the tariff had become a political weapon.
i fear this tariff thing remarked thomas cooper the president of the college of south carolina and an advocate of free trade.
b y some strange mechanical contrivance it has become.
a machine for manufacturing presidents instead of broadcloths and bed blankets disregarding southern protests northern jacksonians joined with supporters of adams and clay to enact the tariff of 1828 which raised duties significantly on raw materials textiles and iron goods.
the new tariff enraged the south which produced the worlds cheapest raw cotton and did not need to protect its main industry.
moreover the tariff cost southern planters about 100 million a year.
planters had to buy either higher cost american textiles and iron goods thus enriching northeastern businesses and workers or highly dutied british imports thus paying the expenses of the national government.
the new tariff was little less than legalized pillage an alabama legislator declared calling it a tariff of abominations.
ignoring the jacksonians support for the tariff of 1828 most southerners heaped blame on president adams.
southern governments also criticized adamss indian policy.
a deeply moral man the president supported the treaty guaranteed land rights of native the tariff of abominations political cartoons enjoyed wide use in eighteenth century england and became popular in the united states during the political battles of the first party system 1794 1815.

chapter 10 americans against expansion minded whites.
in 1825 u s commissioners had secured a treaty from one faction of creeks ceding its lands in georgia to the united states for eventual sale to the states citizens.
when the creek national council repudiated the treaty claiming that it was fraudulent adams called for new negotiations.
in response georgia governor george m troup attacked the president as a public enemy.
the unblushing ally of the savages mobilizing georgias congressional delegation troup persuaded congress to extinguish the creeks land titles forcing most creeks to leave the state.
elsewhere adamss primary weakness was his outof date political style.
the last notable to serve in the white house he acted the part aloof inflexible and paternalistic.
when congress rejected his activist economic policies adams accused its members of following the whims of public opinion and told them not to be enfeebled by the will of our constituents ignoring his waning popularity the president refused to dismiss hostile federal bureaucrats or to award offices to his supporters.
rather than run for reelection in 1828 adams stood for it telling friends if my country wants my services she must ask for them the democracy and the election of 1828 martin van buren and the politicians handling andrew jacksons campaign for the presidency had no reservations about running for office.
to put jackson in the white house van buren revived the political coalition created by thomas jefferson championing policies that appealed to both southern planters and northern farmers and artisans the plain republicans of the north john c calhoun jacksons running mate brought his south carolina allies into van burens party and jacksons close friends in tennessee rallied voters throughout the old southwest.
the little magician hoped that a national party would reconcile the diverse interests that as james madison suggested in federalist no.

equally important added jacksons ally duff green it would put the anti slave party in the north.
to sleep for twenty years to come at van burens direction the jacksonians orchestrated a massive publicity campaign.

elsewhere jacksonians used mass meetings torchlight parades and barbecues to celebrate the candidates frontier origin and rise to fame.
they a democratic revolution 1800 1844 praised old hickory as a natural aristocrat a selfmade man.
the jacksonians called themselves democrats or the democracy to convey their egalitarian message.
as thomas morris told the ohio legislature democrats were fighting for equality the republic had been corrupted by legislative charters that gave a few individuals rights and privileges not enjoyed by the citizens at large morris promised that the democracy would destroy such artificial distinction jackson himself declared that equality among the people in the rights conferred by government was the great radical principle of freedom jacksons message appealed to many social groups.

yet by astutely declaring his support for a judicious tariff that would balance regional interests jackson remained popular in the south.
old hickory likewise garnered votes in the southeast and midwest where his well known hostility toward native americans reassured white farmers seeking indian removal.
the democrats celebration of popular rule carried jackson into office.
in 1824 about one quarter of the electorate had voted in 1828 more than one half went to the polls and 56 percent voted for the tennessee senator figure 10 1 and map 10 2.
the first president from a trans appalachian state jackson cut a dignified figure as he traveled to washington.
he wore his hair carelessly but not ungracefully arranged an english observer noted and in spite of his harsh gaunt features looked like a gentleman and a soldier still jacksons popularity and sharp temper frightened men of wealth.
senator daniel webster of massachusetts a former federalist and now a corporate lawyer warned his clients that the new president would bring a breeze with him.

in 1824 27 percent voted in 1840 and thereafter about 80 percent went to the polls.
voter participation soared first in 1828 when andrew jackson and john quincy adams contested for the white house and again in 1840 as competition heated up between democrats and whigs who advocated different policies and philosophies of government.
democrats won most of these contests because their policies had greater appeal to ordinary citizens.

however andrew jackson swept the rest of the nation and won a resounding victory in the electoral college.
over 1 1 million american men cast ballots in 1828 more than three times the number who voted in 1824.
american style political democracy a broad franchise a disciplined political party and policies favoring specific interests ushered andrew jackson into office.
jackson used his popular mandate to transform the policies of the national government and the definition of the presidency.
during his two terms he enhanced presidential authority destroyed the mercantilist and nationalist american system and established a new ideology of limited government.
an ohio supporter summed up jacksons vision the sovereignty of the people the rights of the states and a light and simple government jacksons agenda rotation and decentralization to make policy jackson relied primarily on his socalled kitchen cabinet.
its most influential members were two kentuckians francis preston blair who edited the washington globe and amos kendall who wrote jacksons speeches roger b taney of maryland who became attorney general treasury secretary and chapter 10 president andrew jackson 1830 the new president came to washington with a welldeserved reputation as an aggressive indian fighter and unpredictable military leader.

subsequent events would show that jackson had not lost his hard edged authoritarian personality.

rotation would not lessen expertise jackson insisted because public duties were so plain and simple that men of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their performance william l marcy a new york jacksonian offered a more realistic explanation for rotation government jobs were like the spoils of war and to the victor belong the spoils of the enemy jackson used those spoils to reward his allies and win backing for his policies.
a democratic revolution 1800 1844 jacksons highest priority was to destroy the american system.
he believed that henry clays system and all government sponsored plans for national economic development were contrary to the constitution encouraged consolidated government and through higher tariffs increased the burden of taxation.

how do you explain declaring that the voice of the this paradox.
people called for economy in the expenditures of the government jackson rejected national subsidies for transportation projects.
invoking constitutional arguments he vetoed four internal improvement bills in 1830 including an extension of the national road arguing that they infringed on the reserved powers of states by eliminating potential expenditures by the federal government these vetoes also undermined the case for protective tariffs.
as jacksonian senator william smith of south carolina pointed out d estroy internal improvements and you leave no motive for the tariff the tariff and nullification the tariff of 1828 had helped jackson win the presidency but it saddled him with a major political crisis.
there was fierce opposition to high tariffs throughout the south and especially in south carolina.
that state was the only one with an african american majority 56 percent of the population in 1830 and its slave owners like the white sugar planters in the west indies feared a black rebellion.
even more they worried about the legal abolition of slavery.
the british parliament had declared that slavery in its west indian colonies would end in 1833 south carolina planters vividly recalling northern efforts to end slavery in missouri chapter 8 worried that the u s congress would follow the british lead.
so they attacked the tariff both to lower rates and to discourage the use of federal power to attack slavery.
the crisis began in 1832 when high tariff congressmen ignored southern warnings that they were endangering the union and reenacted the tariff of abominations.
in response leading south carolinians called a state convention which in november boldly adopted an ordinance of nullification declaring the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 to be null and void.
the ordinance part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 who will be jacksons heir.
elected vice president in 1828 john c calhoun hoped to succeed jackson in the white house.
he failed to account for the ambition of martin van buren who managed jacksons campaign and claimed the prized office of secretary of state.
when van buren resigned as secretary in 1831 and jackson nominated him as minister to britain calhoun sought to destroy his rival by blocking his confirmation in the senate.
the little magician pounced on this miscalculation persuading jackson already disillusioned by calhouns support for nullification to oust him from the ticket.

prohibited the collection of those duties in south carolina after february 1 1833 and threatened how did south carolina secession if federal officials tried justify nullification on to collect them.
constitutional grounds.
south carolinas act of nullification the argument that a state has the right to void within its borders a law passed by congress rested on the constitutional arguments developed in the south carolina exposition and protest 1828.
written anonymously by vice president john c calhoun the exposition gave a localist or sectional interpretation to the federal union.
because each state or geographic region had distinct interests localists argued protective tariffs and other national legislation that operated unequally on the various states lacked fairness and legitimacy in fact they were unconstitutional.
an obsessive defender of the interests of southern slave owners calhoun exaggerated the frequency and severity of such legislation declaring constitutional government and the government of a majority are utterly incompatible calhouns constitutional doctrines reflected the arguments advanced by jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolutions of 1798.
those understand points of view resolutions asserted that because state based conventions had ratified the constitution sovereignty lay in the states not in the people.
beginning from this premise calhoun argued that a state convention could declare a congressional law to be void within the states borders.
replying to this states rights interpretation of the constitution which had little support in the text of the document senator daniel webster of massachusetts presented a nationalist interpretation that celebrated popular sovereignty and congresss responsibility to secure the general welfare jackson hoped to find a middle path between websters strident nationalism and calhouns radical doctrine of localist federalism.
the constitution clearly gave the federal government the authority to establish tariffs and jackson vowed to enforce it.
he declared that south carolinas ordinance of nullification violated the letter of the constitution and was destructive of the great object for which it was formed more pointedly he warned disunion by armed force is treason at jacksons request congress in early 1833 passed a military force bill authorizing the president to compel south carolinas obedience to national laws.
simultaneously jackson addressed the souths objections to high import duties with a new tariff act that chapter 10 a democratic revolution 1800 1844 the great webster hayne debate 1830 the tariff of abominations sparked one of the great debates in american history.
when senator robert y hayne of south carolina seated in the middle of the picture with his legs crossed opposed the federal tariffs by invoking the doctrines of states rights and nullification daniel webster rose to the defense of the union.
speaking for two days to a spellbound senate webster delivered an impassioned oration that celebrated the unity of the american people as the key to their freedom.
his parting words liberty and union now and forever one and inseparable quickly became part of the national memory.

illinois wants a market for her agricultural products declared senator sidney breese in 1846.
s he wants the market of the world having won the political battle by securing a tariff reduction the south carolina convention did not press its constitutional stance on nullification.
jackson was satisfied.
he had assisted the south economically while upholding the constitutional principle of national authority a principle that abraham lincoln would embrace to defend the union during the secession crisis of 1861.
the bank war in the midst of the tariff crisis jackson faced a major challenge from politicians who supported the second bank of the united states.
founded in philadelphia in 1816 chapter 7 the bank was privately managed and operated under a twenty year charter from the federal government which owned 20 percent of its stock.
the banks most important role was to stabilize the nations money supply which consisted primarily of notes and bills of credit in effect paper money issued by state chartered banks.
those banks promised to redeem the notes on demand with hard money or specie that is gold or silver coins minted by the u s or foreign governments but there were few coins in circulation.
by collecting those notes and regularly demanding specie the second bank kept the state banks from issuing too much paper money and depreciating its value.
this cautious monetary policy pleased creditors the bankers and entrepreneurs in boston new york and philadelphia whose capital investments were underwriting economic development.
however expansionminded bankers including friends of jacksons in nashville demanded an end to central oversight.
moreover many ordinary americans worried that the part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 second bank would force weak banks to close leaving them holding worthless paper notes.
many politicians resented the arrogance of the banks president nicholas biddle.
as to mere power biddle boasted i have been for years in the daily exercise of more personal authority than any president habitually enjoys jacksons bank veto although the second bank had many enemies a political miscalculation by its friends brought its downfall.
in 1832 henry clay and daniel webster persuaded biddle to seek an early extension of the banks charter which still had four years to run.
they had the votes in congress to enact the required legislation and hoped to lure jackson into a veto that would split the democrats just before the 1832 elections.
jackson turned the tables on clay and webster.
he vetoed the rechartering bill with a masterful message that blended constitutional arguments with class rhetoric and patriotic fervor.
adopting the position taken by thomas jefferson in 1793 jackson declared that congress had no constitutional authority to charter a national bank.
he condemned the bank as subversive of the rights of the states dangerous to the liberties of the people and a privileged monopoly that promoted the advancement of the few at the expense of.
farmers mechanics and laborers finally the president noted that british aristocrats owned much of the banks stock.
such a powerful institution should be purely american jackson declared with patriotic zeal.
jacksons attack on the bank carried him to victory in 1832.
old hickory and martin van buren his new running mate overwhelmed henry clay who headed the national republican ticket by 219 to 49 electoral votes.
jacksons most fervent supporters were eastern workers and western farmers who blamed the second bank for high urban prices and stagnant farm income.
all the flourishing cities of the west are mortgaged to this money power charged senator thomas hart benton a jacksonian from missouri.
still many of jacksons supporters had prospered during a decade of strong economic growth.
thousands of middle class americans lawyers clerks shopkeepers and artisans had used the opportunity to rise in the world and cheered jacksons attack on privileged corporations.
place events in context why and how did jackson destroy the second national bank.
the bank destroyed early in 1833 jackson met their wishes by appointing roger b taney a strong opponent of corporate privilege as head of the treasury department.
taney promptly transferred the federal governments gold and silver from the second bank to various state banks which critics labeled jacksons pet banks to justify this abrupt and probably illegal transfer jackson declared that his reelection represented the decision of the people against the bank and gave him a mandate to destroy it.
this sweeping claim of presidential power was new and radical.
never before had a president claimed that victory at the polls allowed him to pursue a controversial policy or to act independently of congress american voices p 328.
the bank war escalated into an all out political battle.
in march 1834 jacksons opponents in the senate passed a resolution composed by henry clay that censured the president and warned of executive tyranny we are in the midst of a revolution hitherto bloodless but rapidly descending towards a total change of the pure republican character of the government and the concentration of all power in the hands of one man clays charges and congresss censure did not deter jackson.
the bank is trying to kill me but i will kill it he vowed to van buren.
and so he did.
when the second banks national charter expired in 1836 jackson prevented its renewal.
jackson had destroyed both national banking the handiwork of alexander hamilton and the american system of protective tariffs and public works created by henry clay and john quincy adams.
the result was a profound check on economic activism and innovative policymaking by the national government.
all is gone observed a washington newspaper correspondent.
all is gone which the general government was instituted to create and preserve indian removal the status of native american peoples posed an equally complex political problem.
by the late 1820s white voices throughout the south and midwest demanded the resettlement of indian peoples west of the mississippi river.
many whites who were sympathetic to native americans also favored resettlement.
removal to the west seemed the only way to protect indians from alcoholism financial exploitation and cultural decline.
however most indians did not want to leave their ancestral lands.
for centuries cherokees and creeks had lived in georgia tennessee and alabama chickasaws and choctaws in mississippi and alabama and seminoles in florida.
during the war of 1812 andrew jackson had forced the creeks to relinquish millions of chapter 10 acres but indian tribes still controlled vast tracts and wanted to keep them.
cherokee resistance but on what terms.
some indians had adopted white ways.
an 1825 census revealed that various cherokees owned 33 gristmills 13 sawmills 2 400 spinning wheels 760 looms and 2 900 plows.
many of these owners were mixed race the offspring of white traders and indian women.
they had grown up in a bicultural world knew the political and economic ways of whites and often favored assimilation into white society.
indeed some of these mixedrace people were indistinguishable from southern planters.
at his death in 1809 georgia cherokee james vann owned one hundred black slaves two trading posts and a gristmill.
three decades later forty other mixed blood cherokee families each owned ten or more african american workers.
prominent mixed race cherokees believed that integration into american life was the best way to protect their property and the lands of their people.
in 1821 sequoyah a part cherokee silversmith perfected a system of writing for the cherokee language six years later mixed race cherokees devised a new charter of cherokee government modeled directly on the u s constitution.
you asked us to throw off the hunter and warrior state cherokee john ridge told a philadelphia audience in 1832.
you asked us to form a republican government we did so.
you asked us to learn to read we did so.
you asked us to cast away our idols and worship your god we did so full blood cherokees who made up 90 percent of the population resisted many of these cultural and political innovations but were equally determined to retain their ancestral lands.
we would not receive money for land in which our fathers and friends are buried one full blood chief declared.
we love our land it is our mother what the cherokees did or wanted carried no weight with the georgia legislature.
in 1802 georgia had given up its western land claims in return for a federal promise to extinguish indian landholdings in the state.
now it demanded fulfillment of that pledge.
having spent his military career fighting indians and seizing their lands andrew jackson gave full support to georgia.
on assuming the presidency he withdrew the federal troops that had protected indian enclaves there and in alabama and mississippi.
the states he declared were sovereign within their borders.
the removal act and its aftermath jackson then pushed the indian removal act of 1830 through a democratic revolution 1800 1844 congress over the determined opposition of evangelical protestant men and women.
to block removal catharine beecher and lydia sigourney composed a ladies circular which urged benevolent ladies to use prayers and exertions to avert the calamity of removal women from across the nation flooded congress with petitions.
nonetheless jacksons bill squeaked through the house of representatives by a vote of 102 to 97.
the removal act created the indian territory on national lands acquired in the louisiana purchase and located in present day oklahoma and kansas.
it promised money and reserved land to native american peoples who would give up their ancestral holdings east of the mississippi river.
government officials promised the indians that they could live on their new land they and all their children as long as grass grows and water runs however as one indian leader noted on the great plains water and timber are scarcely to be seen when chief black hawk and his sauk and fox blackhawk this portrait of black hawk 1767 1838 by george catlin shows the indian leader holding his namesake a black hawk and its feathers.
when congress approved andrew jacksons indian removal act in 1830 black hawk mobilized sauk and fox warriors to protect their ancestral lands in illinois.

in the course of the voyage an event occurred which i repeat as it is suggestive of his character.
a steamer of greater speed than ours going in the same direction passed us crossed our bow then stopped and let us pass her and then passed us again in triumph.
this was repeated again and again until the general being excited by the offensive course ordered a rifle to be brought to him hailed the pilot of the other steamer and swore that if he did the same thing again he would shoot him.
i apprehend that mr van buren jacksons vice president and his friends have no permanent cause of triumph in their victory.
have mounted a vicious horse who taking the bit in his mouth will run away with them.
this battle had been fought upon the ground of the poor against the rich and this unworthy prejudice this dangerous delusion has been encouraged by the leaders of the triumphant party and fanned into a flame by the polluted breath of the hireling press in their employ.
the cry of down with the aristocracy mingled with the shouts of victory.
they have succeeded in raising this dangerous spirit of the mob and have gladly availed themselves of its support to accomplish a temporary object but can they allay it at pleasure.

henry clay introducing a senate resolution censuring jackson december 26 1833 we are in the midst of a revolution hitherto bloodless but rapidly tending toward a total change of the pure republican character of the government and to the concentration of all power in the hands of one man.
the powers of congress are paralyzed except when exerted in conformity with his will by frequent and an extraordinary exercise of the executive veto not anticipated by the founders of our constitution and not practiced by any of the predecessors of the present chief magistrate.
the judiciary has not been exempt from the prevailing rage for innovation.

alexis de tocqueville analysis of jackson in democracy in america 1835 we have been told that general jackson has won battles that he is an energetic man prone by nature and habit to the use of force covetous of power and a despot by inclination.
all this may be true but the inferences which have been drawn from these truths are very erroneous.
it has been imagined that general jackson is bent on establishing a dictatorship in america introducing a military spirit and giving a degree of influence to the central authority that cannot but be dangerous to provincial state liberties.
far from wishing to extend the federal power the president belongs to the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the constitution and which never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the union far from standing forth as the champion of centralization general jackson is the agent of the state jealousies and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the central government.

andrew jacksons indian removal act of 1830 formalized this policy.
subsequently scores of indian peoples signed treaties that exchanged their lands in the east midwest and southeast for money and designated reservations in an indian territory west of the mississippi river.
when the sauk fox cherokees and seminoles resisted resettlement the government used the u s army to enforce the removal policy.

this color engraving from the 1830s showing red and black seminoles butchering respectable white families sought to bolster political support for the removal of the seminoles to indian territory.
by the mid 1840s after a decade of warfare the u s army had forced 2 500 seminoles to migrate to oklahoma.

scotts army rounded up 14 000 cherokees including mixed race african cherokees and marched them 1 200 miles an arduous journey that became known as the trail of tears.
along the way 3 000 indians died of starvation and exposure.
once in oklahoma the cherokees excluded anyone of negro or mulatto parentage from governmental office thereby affirming that full citizenship in their nation was racially defined.
just as the united states was a white mans country so indian territory would be defined as a red mans country encouraged by generous gifts of land the creeks chickasaws and choctaws moved west of the mississippi leaving the seminoles in florida as the only numerically significant indian people remaining in the southeast.
government pressure persuaded about half of the seminoles to migrate to indian territory but families whose ancestors had intermarried with runaway slaves feared the emphasis on blood purity there.
during the 1840s they fought a successful guerrilla war against the u s army and retained their lands in central florida.
these seminoles were the exception the jacksonians had forced the removal of most eastern indian peoples.
the jacksonian impact jacksons legacy like that of every other great president is complex and rich.
on the institutional level he expanded the authority of the nations chief executive.
as jackson put it the president is the direct representative of the american people assuming that role during the nullification crisis he upheld national authority by threatening the use of military force laying the foundation for lincolns defense of the union a generation later.
at the same time and somewhat contradictorily jackson curbed the reach of the national government.
by undermining henry clays american system of national banking protective tariffs and internal improvements jackson reinvigorated the jeffersonian tradition of a limited and frugal central government.
the taney court jackson also undermined the constitutional jurisprudence of john marshall by appointing roger b taney as his successor in 1835.
during his long tenure as chief justice 1835 1864 taney partially reversed the nationalist and vested propertyrights decisions of the marshall court and gave constitutional legitimacy to jacksons policies of states rights and free enterprise.
in the landmark case charles river bridge co v warren bridge co 1837 taney declared that a legislative charter in this case to build and operate a toll bridge did not necessarily bestow a part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 monopoly and that a legislature could charter a competing bridge to promote the general welfare while the rights of private property are sacredly guarded we must not forget that the community also has rights this decision directly challenged marshalls interpretation of the contract clause of the constitution in dartmouth college v woodward 1819 which had stressed the binding nature of public charters and the sanctity of vested rights chapter 7.
by limiting the property claims of existing canal and turnpike companies taneys decision allowed legislatures to charter competing railroads that would provide cheaper and more efficient transportation.
the taney court also limited marshalls nationalistic interpretation of the commerce clause by enhancing the regulatory role of state governments.
for example in mayor of new york v miln 1837 the taney court ruled that new york state could use its police power to inspect explain the health of arriving immigrants.

between 1830 and 1860 twenty states called conventions that furthered democratic principles by reapportioning state legislatures on the basis of population and giving the vote to all white men.
voters also had more power because the new documents mandated the election rather than the appointment of most public officials including sheriffs justices of the peace and judges.
the new constitutions also embodied the principles of classical liberalism or laissez faire by limiting the governments role in the economy.
twentieth century social welfare liberalism endorses the opposite principle that government should intervene in economic and social life.
as president jackson had destroyed the american system and his disciples now attacked the state based commonwealth system which used chartered corporations and state funds to promote economic development.
most jackson era constitutions prohibited states from granting special charters to corporations and extending loans and credit guarantees to private businesses.
if there is any danger to be feared in.
government declared a new jersey democrat it is the danger of associated wealth with special privileges the revised constitutions also protected taxpayers by setting strict limits on state debt and encouraging judges to enforce them.
said new york reformer michael hoffman we will not trust the legislature with the power of creating indefinite mortgages on the peoples property the world is governed too much the jacksonians proclaimed as they embraced a small government laissez faire outlook and celebrated the power of ordinary people to make decisions in the voting booth and the marketplace.
class culture and the second party system the rise of the democracy and jacksons tumultuous presidency sparked the creation in the mid 1830s of a second national party the whigs.
for the next two decades whigs and democrats competed fiercely for votes and appealed to different cultural groups.
many evangelical protestants became whigs while most catholic immigrants and traditional protestants joined the democrats.
by debating issues of economic policy class power and moral reform party politicians offered americans a choice between competing programs and political leaders.
of the two great parties remarked philosopher ralph waldo emerson the democracy has the best cause.
for free trade for wide suffrage but the whig party has the best men the whig worldview the whig party arose in 1834 when a group of congressmen contested andrew jacksons policies and his high handed kinglike conduct.
they took the name whigs to identify themselves with the pre revolutionary american and british parties also called whigs that had opposed the arbitrary actions of british monarchs.
the whigs accused king andrew i of violating the constitution by creating a spoils system and undermining elected legislators whom they saw as the true representatives of the sovereign people.
one whig accused jackson of ruling in a manner more absolute than that of any absolute monarchy of europe initially the whigs consisted of political factions with distinct points of view.
however guided by senators webster of massachusetts clay of kentucky and calhoun of south carolina they gradually coalesced into a party with a distinctive stance and coherent chapter 10 a democratic revolution 1800 1844 ideology.
like the federalists of the 1790s the whigs wanted a political world dominated by men of ability and wealth unlike the federalists they advocated an elite based on talent not birth.
the whigs celebrated the entrepreneur and the enterprising individual this is a country of self made men they boasted pointing to the relative absence of permanent distinctions of class and status among white citizens.
embracing the industrial revolution northern whigs welcomed the investments of moneyed capitalists which provided workers with jobs and bread clothing and homes indeed whig congressman edward everett championed a holy alliance among laborers owners and governments and called for a return to henry clays american system.
many new england and pennsylvania textile and iron workers shared everetts vision because they benefitted directly from protective tariffs.
calhouns dissent support for the whigs in the south less widespread than that in the north rested on the appeal of specific policies and politicians.
some southern whigs were wealthy planters who invested in railroads and banks or sold their cotton to new york merchants.
but the majority were yeomen whites who resented the power and policies of low country planters most of whom were democrats.
in addition some virginia and south carolina democrats such as john tyler became whigs because they condemned andrew jacksons crusade against nullification.
southern whigs rejected their partys enthusiasm for high tariffs and social mobility and john c calhoun was their spokesman.
extremely conscious of class divisions in society calhoun believed that northern whigs rhetoric of equal opportunity was contradicted not only by slavery which he considered a fundamental american institution but also by the wage labor system of industrial capitalism.
there is and always has been in an advanced state of wealth and civilization a conflict between labor and capital calhoun declared in 1837.
he urged slave owners and factory owners to unite against their common foe the working class of enslaved blacks and propertyless whites.
most northern whigs rejected calhouns classconscious social ideology.
a clear and well defined line between capital and labor might fit the slave south or class ridden europe daniel webster conceded but in the north this distinction grows less and less definite as commerce advances ignoring the ever increasing numbers of propertyless immigrants and native born wageworkers webster focused on the growing size of the middle class whose members generally favored whig candidates.
in the election of 1834 the whigs john c calhoun 1782 1850 this daguerreotype made close to the time of calhouns death suggests his emotional intensity and thwarted ambition.
the prime advocate of the doctrines of nullification and states rights a founder of the whig party and a steadfast defender of slavery calhoun found his lifelong pursuit of the presidency frustrated by martin van burens political skills and sectional divisions over tariffs and slavery.

new england new york and the new communities along the great lakes.
anti masons become whigs many whig voters in 1834 had previously supported the anti masons a powerful but short lived party that formed in the late 1820s.
as its name implies anti masons opposed the order of freemasonry.
freemasonry began in europe as an organization of men seeking moral improvement by promoting the welfare and unity of humanity.
many masons espoused republicanism and the order spread rapidly in america after the revolution.
its ideology mysterious symbols and semisecret character gave the order an air of exclusivity that attracted ambitious businessmen and political leaders including george washington henry clay and andrew jackson.
in new part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 york state alone by the mid 1820s there were more than 20 000 masons organized into 450 local lodges.
however after the kidnapping and murder in 1826 of william morgan a new york mason who had threatened to reveal the orders secrets the freemasons fell into disrepute.
thurlow weed a newspaper editor in rochester new york spearheaded an anti masonic party which condemned the order as a secret aristocratic fraternity.
the new party quickly ousted freemasons from local and state offices and just as quickly ran out of political steam.
because many anti masons espoused temperance equality of opportunity and evangelical morality they gravitated to the whig party.
throughout the northeast and midwest whig politicians won election by proposing legal curbs on the sale of alcohol and local ordinances that preserved sunday as a day of worship.
the whigs also secured the votes of farmers bankers and shopkeepers who favored henry clays american system.
for these citizens of the growing midwest the whigs program of government subsidies for roads canals and bridges was as important as their moral agenda.
in the election of 1836 the whig party faced martin van buren the architect of the democratic party and jacksons handpicked successor.
like jackson van buren denounced the american system and warned that its revival would create a consolidated government positioning himself as a defender of individual rights van buren also condemned the efforts of whigs and moral reformers to enact state laws imposing temperance and national laws abolishing slavery.
the government is best which governs least became his motto in economic cultural and racial matters.
to oppose van buren the whigs ran four candidates each with a strong regional reputation.
they hoped to garner enough electoral votes to throw the contest into the house of representatives.
however the whig tally 73 electoral votes collected by william henry harrison of ohio 26 by hugh l white of tennessee 14 by daniel webster of massachusetts and 11 by w p mangum of georgia fell far short of van burens 170 votes.
still the four whigs won 49 percent of the popular vote showing that the partys message of economic and moral improvement had broad appeal.
labor politics and the depression of 1837 1843 as the democrats battled whigs on the national level they faced challenges from urban artisans and workers.
between 1828 and 1833 artisans and laborers in fifteen states formed working mens parties.
past experience teaches us that we have nothing to hope from the aristocratic orders of society declared the new york working mens party.
it vowed to send men of our own description if we can to the legislature at albany the new parties agenda reflected the values and interests of ordinary urban workers.
the philadelphia working mens party set out to secure a just balance of power.
between all the various classes it called for the abolition of private banks chartered monopolies and debtors prisons and it demanded universal public education and a fair system of taxation thinking like a historian p 336.
it won some victories electing a number of assemblymen and persuading the pennsylvania legislature in 1834 to authorize tax supported schools.
elsewhere working mens candidates won office in many cities but their parties weakness in statewide contests soon took a toll.
by the mid 1830s most politically active workers had joined the democratic party.
the working mens parties left a mixed legacy.
they mobilized craft workers and gave political expression to their ideology of artisan republicanism.
as labor intellectual orestes brownson defined their distinctive vision all men will be independent proprietors working on their own capitals on their own farms or in their own shops however this emphasis on proprietorship inhibited alliances between the artisan based working mens parties and the rapidly increasing class of dependent wage earners.
as joseph weydemeyer a close friend of karl marx reported from new york in the early 1850s many american craft workers are incipient bourgeois and feel themselves to be such moreover the panic of 1837 threw the american economy and the workers movement into disarray.
the panic began when the bank of england tried to boost the faltering british economy by sharply curtailing the flow of money and credit to the united states.
since 1822 british manufacturers had extended credit to southern planters to expand cotton production and british investors had purchased millions of dollars of the canal bonds from the northern states.
suddenly deprived of british funds american planters merchants and canal corporations had to withdraw gold from domestic banks to pay their foreign debts.
moreover british textile mills drastically reduced their purchases of raw cotton causing its price to plummet from 20 cents a pound to 10 cents or less.
falling cotton prices and the drain of specie to britain set off a financial panic.
on may 8 the dry dock bank of new york city ran out of specie prompting worried depositors to withdraw gold and silver chapter 10 coins from other banks.
within two weeks every american bank had stopped trading specie and called in its loans turning a financial panic into an economic crisis.
this sudden overthrow of the commercial credit had a stunning effect observed henry fox the british minister in washington.
the conquest of the land by a foreign power could hardly have produced a more general sense of humiliation and grief to stimulate the economy state governments increased their investments in canals and railroads.
however as governments issued or guaranteed more and more bonds to finance these ventures they were unable to pay the interest charges sparking a severe financial crisis on both sides of the atlantic in 1839.
nine state governments defaulted on their debts and hard pressed european lenders cut the flow of new capital to the united states.
the american economy fell into a deep depression.
by 1843 canal construction had dropped by 90 percent prices and wages had fallen by 50 percent and unemployment in seaports and industrial centers had reached 20 percent.
bumper crops drove down cotton prices a democratic revolution 1800 1844 pushing hundreds of planters identify causes and merchants into bankruptcy.

in 1837 six thousand masons carpenters and other buildingtrades workers lost their jobs in new york city destroying their unions bargaining power.
by 1843 most local unions all the national labor organizations and all the workers parties had disappeared.

thinking like a historian becoming literate public education and democracy the struggle for a genuinely democratic polity government of the people by the people and for the people as lincoln put it played out at the local and state level in battles over who should participate in the political arena.
as legislators argued over extending the franchise they considered the knowledge that citizens needed to participate responsibly in politics.
although primary education was publicly supported in most new england towns giving that region nearly universal literacy it received only spotty funding in the other northern states and almost none in the south restricting literacy there to one third of the white population.
the following documents address the resulting debate over publicly supported education and citizenship.
editorial from the philadelphia national gazette 1830.
pennsylvania was one of the first states to debate legislation regarding universal free public education.
the scheme of universal equal education.
is virtually agrarianism redistribution of land from rich to poor.
it would be a compulsory application of the means of the richer for the direct use of the poorer classes.
one of the chief excitements to industry.
is the hope of earning the means of educating their children respectably.
that incentive would be removed and the scheme of state and equal education be a premium for comparative idleness to be taken out of the pockets of the laborious and conscientious.
thaddeus stevens speech before the pennsylvania general assembly february 1835.
pennsylvanias free public school act of 1834 was the handiwork of the working mens party of philadelphia see p 334.
when over half of pennsylvanias school districts refused to implement the law the legislature threatened to repeal it.
thaddeus stevens later a leading antislavery advocate turned back that threat through this speech to the pennsylvania general assembly.
it would seem to be humiliating to be under the necessity in the nineteenth century of entering into a formal argument to prove the utility and to free governments the absolute necessity of education.
such necessity would be degrading to a christian age and a free republic.
if an elective republic is to endure for any great length of time every elector must have sufficient information not only to accumulate wealth and take care of his pecuniary concerns but to direct wisely the legislatures the ambassadors and the executive of the nation for some part of all these things some agency in approving or disapproving of them falls to every freeman.
if then the permanency of our government depends upon such knowledge it is the duty of government to see that the means of information be diffused to every citizen.
this is a sufficient answer to those who deem education a private and not a public duty who argue that they are willing to educate their own children but not their neighbors children.

popular education 1833.
this piece appeared in the north american review the nations first literary and cultural journal and the mouthpiece of new englands intellectual elite.
t he mind of a people in proportion as it is educated will not only feel its own value but will also perceive its rights.
we speak now of those palpable rights which are recognised by all free states.
t he palpable rights of men those of personal security of property and of the free and unembarrassed pursuit of individual welfare it is obviously impossible to conceal from an educated and reading people.
such a people rises at once above the condition of feudal tenants.
it directs its attention to the laws and institutions that govern it.
it compels public office to give an account of itself.
it strips off the veil of secrecy from the machinery of power.
and when all this is spread abroad in newspaper details.
of a people that can read when the estimate is freely made of what the government tax levies upon the daily hoard and upon apparel and upon every comfort of life can it be doubted that such a people will demand and obtain an influence in affairs that so vitally concern it.
this would be freedom.

judge baker sentencing hearing in the court case against mrs margaret douglass of norfolk virginia january 10 1854.
southern whites considered the acquisition of literacy by blacks whether slave or free as a public danger especially after the nat turner uprising in southampton county virginia in 1831 chapter 11 p 362.
a virginia court sent mrs margaret douglass to jail for a month as an example to all others for teaching free black children to read so they might have access to books on religion and morality.
there are persons i believe in our community opposed to the policy of the law in question.
they profess to believe that universal intellectual culture is necessary to religious instruction and education and that such culture is suitable to a state of slavery.
such opinions in the present state of our society i regard as manifestly mischievous.
it is not true that our slaves cannot be taught religious and moral duty without being able to read the bible and use the pen.
intellectual and religious instruction often go hand in hand but the latter may well be exist without the former.
among the whites one fou r th or more are entirely without a knowledge of letters nonetheless respect for the law and for moral and religious conduct and behavior are justly and prope r ly appreciated and practiced.
the first legislative provision upon this subject was introduced in the year 1831 immediately succeeding the bloody scenes of the memorable southampton insurrection and.
was re enacted with additional penalties in the year 1848.
after these several and repeated recognitions of the wisdom and propriety of the said act it may well be said that bold and open opposition to it must be condemned.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 department in 1836 to issue the specie circular an executive order that required the treasury department to accept only gold and silver in payment for lands in the national domain.
critics charged mistakenly that the circular drained so much specie from the economy that it sparked the panic of 1837.
in fact as noted above the curtailing of credit by the bank of england was the main cause of the panic.
nonetheless the public turned its anger on van buren who took office just before the panic struck.
ignoring the pleas of influential bankers the new president refused to revoke the specie circular or take actions to stimulate the economy.
holding to his philosophy of limited government van buren advised congress that the less government interferes with private pursuits the better for the general prosperity as the depression deepened in 1839 this laissezfaire outlook commanded less and less political support.
worse van burens major piece of fiscal legislation the independent treasury act of 1840 delayed recovery by pulling federal specie out of jacksons pet banks where it had backed loans and placing it in government vaults where it had little economic impact.
the log cabin campaign the whigs exploited van burens weakness.
in 1840 they organized their first national convention and nominated william henry harrison of ohio for president and john tyler of virginia for vice president.
a military hero of the battle of tippecanoe and the war of 1812 harrison was well advanced in age sixty eight and had little political experience.
however the whig leaders in congress henry clay and daniel webster wanted a president who would rubber stamp their program for protective tariffs and a national bank.
an unpretentious amiable man harrison told voters that whig policies were the only means under heaven by which a poor industrious man may become a rich man without bowing to colossal wealth the depression stacked the political cards against van buren but the election turned as much on style as on substance.
it became the great log cabin campaign the first time two well organized parties competed for votes through a new style of campaigning.
whig songfests parades and well orchestrated mass meetings drew new voters into politics.
whig speakers assailed martin van ruin as a manipulative politician with aristocratic tastes a devotee of fancy wines elegant clothes and polite refinement as indeed he was.
less truthfully they portrayed harrison as a self made man who lived contentedly in a log cabin and quaffed hard cider a drink of the common people.
in fact harrisons father was a wealthy virginia planter who the whigs boost harrison and tyler for the white house in their quest for victory in 1840 whig political strategists advanced a wide ranging and misleading set of policies.
this poster celebrates william henry harrison and john tyler as candidates who would secure protective tariffs for american manufacturers a policy that appealed to northern voters but one that tyler opposed.
it also promises to cut the size of the u s army which general harrison did not favor.

the whigs boosted their electoral hopes by welcoming women to campaign festivities a first for american politics.
many jacksonian democrats had long embraced an ideology of aggressive manhood likening politically minded females to public women prostitutes who plied their trade in theaters and other public places.
whigs took a more restrained view of masculinity and recognized that christian women had already entered american public life through the temperance movement and other benevolent activities.
in october 1840 daniel webster celebrated moral reform to an audience of twelve hundred women and urged them to back whig candidates.
this way of making politicians of their women is something new under the sun exclaimed one democrat worried that it would bring more whig men to the polls.
and it did more than 80 percent of the eligible male voters cast ballots in 1840 up from fewer than 60 percent in 1832 and 1836 see figure 10 1.
heeding the whigs campaign slogan tippecanoe and tyler too they voted harrison into the white house with 53 percent of the popular vote and gave the party a majority in congress.
tyler subverts the whig agenda led by clay and webster the whigs in congress prepared to reverse the jacksonian revolution.
their hopes were shortlived barely a month after his inauguration in 1841 harrison died of pneumonia and the nation got tyler too but in what capacity as acting president or as president.
the constitution was vague on the issue.
ignoring his whig associates in congress who wanted a weak chief executive tyler took the presidential oath of office and understand declared his intention to govern points of view as he pleased.
as it turned out how did whigs and democrats view women that would not be like a whig.
tyler had served in the house in politics and why did and the senate as a jeffersonian they hold those views.
democrat firmly committed to slavery and states rights.
he had joined the whigs only to protest jacksons stance against nullification.
on economic issues tyler shared jacksons hostility to the second bank and the american system.
he therefore vetoed whig bills that would have raised tariffs and created a new national bank.
outraged by this betrayal most of tylers cabinet resigned in 1842 and the whigs expelled tyler from their party.
his accidency as he part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 was called by his critics was now a president without a party.
the split between tyler and the whigs allowed the democrats to regroup.
the party vigorously recruited subsistence farmers in the north smallholding planters in the south and former members of the working mens parties in the cities.
it also won support among irish and german catholic immigrants whose numbers had increased during the 1830s by backing their demands for religious and cultural liberty such as the freedom to drink beer and whiskey.
a pattern of ethnocultural politics as historians refer to the practice of voting along ethnic and religious lines now became a prominent feature of american life.
thanks to these urban and rural recruits the democrats remained the majority party in most parts of the nation.
their program of equal rights states rights and cultural liberty was attractive to more white americans than the whig platform of economic nationalism moral reform temperance laws and individual mobility.
summary in this chapter we examined the causes and the consequences of the democratic political revolution.
we saw that the expansion of the franchise weakened the political system run by notables of high status and encouraged the transfer of power to professional politicians men like martin van buren who were mostly of middle class origin.
we also witnessed a revolution in government policy as andrew jackson and his democratic party dismantled the mercantilist economic system of government supported economic development.
on the national level jackson destroyed henry clays american system on the state level democrats wrote new constitutions that ended the commonwealth system of government charters and subsidies to private businesses.
jacksons treatment of native americans was equally revolutionary the removal act of 1830 forcefully resettled eastern indian peoples west of the mississippi river opening their ancestral lands to white settlement.
finally we watched the emergence of the second party system.
following the split in the republican party during the election of 1824 two new parties the democrats and the whigs developed on the national level and eventually absorbed the members of the antimasonic and working mens parties.
the new party system established universal suffrage for white men and a mode of representative government that was responsive to ordinary citizens.
in their scope and significance these political innovations matched the economic advances of both the industrial revolution and the market revolution.

suddenly thousands of men and women took inspiration from the economic progress and democratic spirit of the age.
drawing on the religious optimism of the second great awakening they felt that they could improve their personal lives and society as a whole.
some activists dedicated themselves to the cause of reform.
william lloyd garrison began as an antislavery advocate and foe of indian removal and then went on to campaign for womens rights pacifism and the abolition of prisons.
susan b anthony embraced antislavery temperance and female suffrage.
such obsessively reformminded individuals warned unitarian minister henry w bellows were pursuing an object which in its very nature is unattainable the perpetual improvement of peoples outward condition in bellowss view human progress depended on inner character the regeneration of man through christian precepts.
such debates reveal the multifaceted character of the reform impulse.
like bellows the first wave of american reformers the benevolent religious improvers of the 1820s hoped to promote morality and enforce social discipline.
they championed regular church attendance temperance and a strict moral code.
their zeal offended many upright citizens a peaceable man can hardly venture to eat or drink.

although their numbers were small second wave reformers challenged deeply rooted cultural practices and elicited horrified opposition among the majority of americans.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 individualism the ethic of the middle class those fears were not exaggerated.
rapid economic growth and geographical expansion had weakened traditional institutions forcing individuals to fend for themselves.
in 1835 alexis de tocqueville coined the word individualism to describe the result.
native born white americans were no longer attached to each other by any tie of caste class association or family the french aristocrat lamented and so lived in social isolation.
as tocqueville mourned the loss of social ties the new england essayist and philosopher ralph waldo emerson 1803 1882 celebrated the liberation of the individual.
emersons vision influenced thousands of ordinary americans and a generation of important artists who in the american renaissance a mid nineteenth century flourishing of literature and philosophy wrote a remarkable number of first class novels poems and essays.
ralph waldo emerson and transcendentalism emerson was the leading voice of transcendentalism an intellectual movement rooted in the religious soil of new england.
its first advocates were unitarian ministers from well to do new england families who questioned the constraints of their puritan heritage chapter 8.
for inspiration they turned to european romanticism a new conception of self and society.
romantic thinkers such as german philosopher immanuel kant and english poet samuel taylor coleridge rejected the ordered rational world of the eighteenth century enlightenment.
they embraced human passion and sought deeper insight into the mysteries of existence.
by tapping their intuitive powers the young unitarians believed people could come to know the infinite and the eternal.
as a unitarian emerson stood outside the mainstream of american protestantism.
unlike most christians unitarians believed that god was a single being not a trinity of father son and holy spirit.
in 1832 emerson took a more radical step by resigning his boston pulpit and rejecting all organized religion.
he moved to concord massachusetts and wrote influential essays probing what he called the infinitude of the private man the radically free person.
the young philosopher argued that people were trapped by inherited customs and institutions.
they the founder of transcendentalism as this painting of ralph waldo emerson by an unknown artist indicates the young philosopher was an attractive man his face brimming with confidence and optimism.
with his radiant personality and incisive intellect emerson deeply influenced dozens of influential writers artists and scholars and enjoyed great success as a lecturer to the emerging middle class.

wore the ideas of earlier times new england calvinism for example as a kind of faded masquerade and they needed to shed those values.
what is a man born for but to be a reformer a remaker of what man has made emerson asked.
in his view individuals could be remade only by discovering their original relation with nature and entering into a mystical union with the currents of universal being the ideal setting for this transcendent discovery was under an open sky in solitary communion with nature.
the revivalist charles grandison finney described his religious conversion in emersonian terms an individual in the woods alone joining with god in a mystical union.
the transcendentalist message of individual selfrealization reached hundreds of thousands of people through emersons writings and lectures.
public lectures had become a spectacularly successful way of chapter 11 spreading information and fostering discussion among the middle classes.
beginning in 1826 the lyceum movement modeled on the public forum of the ancient greek philosopher aristotle arranged lecture tours by hundreds of poets preachers scientists and reformers.
the lyceum became an important cultural institution in the north and midwest but not in the south where the middle class was smaller and popular education had a lower priority.
in 1839 nearly 150 lyceums in massachusetts invited lecturers to address more than 33 000 subscribers.
emerson was the most popular speaker eventually delivering fifteen hundred lectures in more than three hundred towns in twenty states.
emerson celebrated those who rejected tradition and practiced self discipline and civic responsibility.
his individualistic ethos spoke directly to the experiences of many middle class americans who had left family farms to make their way in the urban world.
his pantheistic view of nature that it was saturated with the presence of god encouraged unitarians in boston to create the mount auburn cemetery a beautiful planned landscape of trees and bushes and burial markers for the dead of all faiths soon there were similar rural cemeteries in many american cities.
emersons optimism also inspired many religious preachers of the second great awakening such as finney who told believers to transcend old doctrines and constraints.
god has made man a moral free agent finney declared.
emerson worried that the new market society the focus on work profits and consumption was debasing americans spiritual lives.
things are in the saddle he wrote and ride mankind seeking to revive intellectual life transcendentalists created communal experiments.
the most important was brook farm just outside boston where emerson henry david thoreau and margaret fuller were residents or frequent visitors.
members recalled that they inspired the young with a passion for study and the middleaged with deference and admiration whatever its intellectual excitement and spiritual rewards brook farm was an economic failure.
the residents planned to produce their own food and exchange their surplus milk vegetables and hay for manufactures.
however most members were ministers teachers writers and students who had few farming skills only the cash of affluent residents kept the enterprise afloat for five years.
after a devastating fire in 1846 the organizers disbanded the community and sold the farm.
with the failure of brook farm the emersonians abandoned their quest for new social institutions.
they religion and reform 1800 1860 accepted the brute reality of the emergent commercial and industrial order and tried to reform it especially through the education of workers and the movement to abolish slavery.
understand points of view what were the main principles of transcendentalism and how did they differ from the beliefs of most protestant christians.
emersons literary influence even as emerson urged his fellow citizens to break free from tradition and expand their spiritual awareness he issued a declaration of literary independence.
in the american scholar 1837 emerson urged american authors to free themselves from the courtly muse of old europe and find inspiration in the experiences of ordinary americans the ballad in the street the news of the boat the glance of the eye the form and gait of the body thoreau fuller and whitman one young new england intellectual henry david thoreau 1817 1862 heeded emersons call and sought inspiration from the natural world.
in 1845 depressed by his beloved brothers death thoreau built a cabin near walden pond in concord massachusetts and lived alone there for two years.
in 1854 he published walden or life in the woods an account of his search for meaning beyond the artificiality of civilized society i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived.
waldens most famous metaphor provides an enduring justification for independent thinking if a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer beginning from this premise thoreau advocated a thoroughgoing individuality urging readers to avoid unthinking conformity to social norms and peacefully to resist unjust laws.
as thoreau was seeking self realization for men margaret fuller 1810 1850 was exploring the possibilities of freedom for women.
born into a wealthy boston family fuller mastered six languages and read broadly in classic literature.
embracing emersons ideas she started a transcendental conversation or discussion group for educated boston women in 1839.
while editing the dial the leading transcendentalist journal fuller published woman in the nineteenth century 1844.

margaret fuller 1848 at the age of thirty eight the american transcendentalist author margaret fuller moved to italy where she reported on the revolution of 1848 for the new york tribune.
there she fell in love with thomas hicks 1823 1890 a much younger american artist.
hicks rebuffed fullers romantic advances but painted this flattering portrait softening her features and giving her a pensive look.
fuller took as a lover a petty noble and republican revolutionary giovanni angelo marchese dossoli and gave birth to a son in september 1848.
two years later the entire family died in a shipwreck while en route to the united states.

ers and reformers.
the poet walt whitman 1819 1892 also responded to emersons call.
he had been simmering simmering he recalled and then emerson brought me to a boil whitman worked as a printer a teacher a journalist an editor of the brooklyn eagle and an influential publicist for the democratic party.
however poetry was the direction of his dreams in leaves of grass a collection of wild exuberant poems first published in 1855 and constantly revised and expanded whitman recorded in verse his efforts to transcend various invisible boundaries between solitude and community between prose and poetry even between the living and the dead.
at the center of leaves of grass is the individual i walt he begins alone i celebrate myself and sing myself because he has an emersonian original relation with nature whitman claims perfect communion with others for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you for emerson thoreau and fuller the individual had a divine spark for whitman the collective democracy assumed a sacred character.
the transcendentalists were optimistic but not naive.
whitman wrote about human suffering with passion and emerson laced his accounts of transcendence with twinges of anxiety.
i am glad he once said to the brink of fear thoreau was gloomy about everyday life the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation nonetheless dark murmurings remain muted in their work overshadowed by assertions that nothing was impossible for the individual who could break free from tradition.
darker visions emersons writings also influenced two great novelists nathaniel hawthorne and herman melville who had more pessimistic worldviews.
both sounded powerful warnings that unfettered egoism could destroy individuals and those around them.
hawthorne brilliantly explored the theme of excessive individualism in his novel the scarlet letter 1850.
the two main characters hester prynne and arthur dimmesdale blatantly challenge their seventeenthcentury new england community by committing adultery and producing a child.
their decision to ignore social restraints results not in liberation but in degradation a profound sense of guilt and condemnation by the community.
herman melville explored the limits of individualism in even more extreme and tragic terms and emerged chapter 11 cities of the united states.
there they created a popular culture that challenged some sexual norms reinforced traditional racist feelings and encouraged new styles of dress and behavior.
as a scathing critic of transcendentalism.
his most powerful statement was moby dick 1851 the story of captain ahabs obsessive hunt for a mysterious white whale that ends in death for ahab and all but one member of his crew.
here the quest for spiritual meaning in nature brings death not transcendence because ahab the liberated individual lacks inner discipline and self restraint.
moby dick was a commercial failure.
the middleclass audience that devoured sentimental american fiction refused to follow melville into the dark dangerous realm of individualism gone mad.
what middleclass readers emphatically preferred were the more modest examples of individualism offered by emerson and finney personal improvement and religious piety through spiritual awareness and self discipline.
the utopian impulse many rural communalists were farmers and artisans seeking refuge from the economic depression of 1837 1843.
others were religious idealists.
whatever their origins these rural utopias were symbols of social protest and experimentation.
by advocating the common ownership of property socialism and unconventional forms of marriage and family life the communalists challenged traditional property rights and gender roles.
mother ann and the shakers the united society of believers in christs second appearing known as the shakers because of the ecstatic dances that were part of their worship was the first successful american communal movement.
in 1770 ann lee stanley mother ann a young cook in manchester england had a vision that she was an incarnation of christ.
four years later she led a few followers to america and established a church near albany new york.
after mother anns death in 1784 the shakers honored her as the second coming of christ withdrew from the profane world and formed disciplined rural communalism and urban popular culture between 1820 and 1860 thousands of americans grew dissatisfied with life in americas emerging market society and retreated into rural areas of the northeast and midwest map 11 1.
there they sought to create ideal communities or utopias that would allow people to live differently and realize their spiritual potential.
simultaneously tens of thousands of rural americans and european immigrants poured into the larger map 11 1 major communal experiments before 1860 some experimental communities settled along the frontier but the vast majority chose rural areas in settled regions of the north and midwest.
because they opposed slavery communalists usually avoided the south.
most secular experiments failed within a few decades as the founders lost their reformist enthusiasm or died off tightly knit religious communities such as the shakers and the mormons were longer lived.

they feared the sects radical aspects such as a commitment to celibacy and communal property and considered the shakers dancing more an invitation to debauchery than a form of prayer.
those apprehensions surfaced in this engraving the shakers of new lebanon new york which expresses both the powerful intensity and the menacing character of this shaker spiritual ritual.

shakers also repudiated sexual pleasure and marriage.

shakers founded twenty communities mostly in new england new york and ohio.
their agriculture and crafts especially furniture making acquired a reputation for quality that made most shaker communities self sustaining and even comfortable.
because the shakers disdained sexual intercourse they relied on conversions and the adoption of thousands of young orphans to increase their numbers.
during the 1830s three thousand adults mostly women joined the shakers attracted by their communal intimacy and sexual equality.
to rebecca cox jackson an african american seamstress from philadelphia the shakers seemed to be loving to live forever however with the proliferation of public and private orphanages during the 1840s and 1850s shaker communities began to decline and by 1900 had virtually disappeared.
they chapter 11 left as a material legacy a plain but elegant style of wood furniture.
albert brisbane and fourierism as the shakers growth slowed during the 1840s the american fourierist movement mushroomed.
charles fourier 1777 1837 was a french reformer who devised an eight stage theory of social evolution that predicted the imminent decline of individual property rights and capitalist values.
fouriers leading disciple in america was albert brisbane.
just as republicanism had freed americans from slavish monarchical government brisbane argued so fourierist socialism would liberate workers from capitalist employers and the menial and slavish system of hired labor or labor for wages members would work for the community in cooperative groups called phalanxes they would own its property in common including stores and a bank a school and a library.
fourier and brisbane saw the phalanx as a humane system that would liberate women as well as men.
in society as it is now constituted brisbane wrote individual freedom was possible only for men while woman is subjected to unremitting and slavish domestic duties in the new social order.
based upon attacking the womens rights movement amelia jenks bloomer 1818 1894 wrote for her husbands newspaper the county courier of seneca falls new york.
in 1848 she attended the womens convention there and began her own biweekly newspaper the lily focusing on temperance and womens rights.
in 1851 bloomer enthusiastically promoted and serendipitously gave her name to the comfortable womens costume devised by another temperance activist loose trousers gathered at the ankles topped by a short skirt.
fearing womens quest for equal dress and equal rights humorists such as john leech ridiculed the new female attire.

brisbane skillfully promoted fouriers ideas in his influential book the social destiny of man 1840 a regular column in horace greeleys new york tribune and hundreds of lectures.
fourierist ideas found a receptive audience among educated farmers and craftsmen who yearned for economic stability and communal solidarity following the panic of 1837.
during the 1840s fourierists started nearly one hundred cooperative communities mostly in western new york and the midwest.
most communities quickly collapsed as members fought over work responsibilities and social policies.
fourierisms rapid decline revealed the difficulty of maintaining a utopian community in the absence of a charismatic leader or a compelling religious vision.
john humphrey noyes and oneida john humphrey noyes 1811 1886 was both charismatic and religious.
he ascribed the fourierists failure to their secular outlook and embraced the pious shakers as the true pioneers of modern socialism the shakers marriageless society also inspired noyes to create a community that defined sexuality and gender roles in radically new ways.
part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 noyes was a well to do graduate of dartmouth college who joined the ministry after hearing a sermon by charles grandison finney.
dismissed as the pastor of a congregational church for holding unorthodox beliefs noyes turned to perfectionism an evangelical protestant movement of the 1830s that attracted thousands of new englanders who had migrated to new york and ohio.
perfectionists believed that christ had already returned to earth the second coming and therefore people could aspire to sinless perfection in their earthly lives.
unlike most perfectionists who lived conventional personal lives noyes rejected marriage calling it a major barrier to perfection.
exclusiveness jealousy quarreling have no place at the marriage supper of the lamb noyes wrote.
instead of the shakers celibacy noyes embraced complex marriage in which all members of the community were married to one another.
he rejected monogamy partly to free women from their status as the property of their husbands as they were by custom and by common law.
symbolizing the quest for equality noyess women followers cut their hair short and wore pantaloons under calf length skirts.
in 1839 noyes set up a perfectionist community near his hometown of putney vermont.
however local outrage over the practice of complex marriage forced noyes to relocate the community in 1848 to an isolated area near oneida new york where the members could follow his precepts.
to give women the time and energy to participate fully in community affairs noyes urged them to avoid multiple pregnancies.
he asked men to help by avoiding orgasm during intercourse.
less positively he encouraged sexual relations at a very early age and used his position of power to manipulate the sexual lives of his followers.
by the mid 1850s the oneida settlement had two hundred residents and became self sustaining when the inventor of a highly successful steel animal trap joined the community.
with the profits from trap making the oneidians diversified into the production of silverware.
when noyes fled to canada in 1879 to avoid prosecution for adultery the community abandoned complex marriage but retained its cooperative spirit.
the oneida community ltd a jointly owned silverware manufacturing company remained a successful communal venture until the middle of the twentieth century.
the historical significance of the oneidians shakers and fourierists does not lie in their numbers which were small or in their fine crafts.
rather it stems from their radical questioning of traditional sexual norms and of the capitalist values and class divisions of the emerging market society.
their utopian communities stood as countercultural blueprints of a more egalitarian social and economic order.
joseph smith and the mormon experience the mormons members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints were religious utopians with a conservative social agenda to perpetuate close knit communities and patriarchal power.
because of their cohesiveness authoritarian leadership and size the mormons provoked more animosity than the radical utopians did.

smith and his growing congregation eventually settled in nauvoo illinois a town they founded on the mississippi river map 11 2.
by the early 1840s nauvoo had 30 000 residents.
the mormons rigid discipline and secret rituals along with their prosperity hostility toward other sects and bloc voting in illinois elections fueled resentment among their neighbors.
that resentment increased when smith refused to accept illinois laws of which he disapproved asked congress to make nauvoo a separate federal territory and declared himself a candidate for president of the united states.
moreover smith claimed to have received a new revelation justifying polygamy the practice of a man having multiple wives.
when leading mormon men took several wives plural celestial marriage they threw the mormon community into turmoil and enraged nearby christians.

in 1830 he published the book of mormon which he claimed to have translated from ancient hieroglyphics on gold plates shown to him by an angel named moroni.
the book of mormon told the story of an ancient jewish civilization from the middle east that had migrated to the western hemisphere and of the visit of jesus christ soon after his resurrection to those descendants of israel.
smiths account explained the presence of native peoples in the americas and integrated them into the judeo christian tradition.
smith proceeded to organize the church of jesus christ of latter day saints.

when the united states acquired mexicos northern territories in 1848 the salt lake mormons petitioned congress to create a vast new state deseret stretching from utah to the pacific coast.
instead congress set up the much smaller utah territory in 1850 and named brigham young its governor.
young and his associates ruled in an authoritarian fashion determined to ensure the ascendancy of the mormon church and its practices.

our natural boundary is the pacific ocean asserted massachusetts congressman francis baylies in 1823.
the swelling tide of our population must and will roll on until that mighty ocean interposes its waters however the creation of a continental republic was far from inevitable.
it would require a revolution in transportation canals and railways to access the nations fertile core in the vast mississippi river basin and a growing population and dynamic economy to exploit its riches.
by the 1840s all those prerequisites were in place.
other obstacles remained.
well armed indian peoples controlled the great plains mexico held sovereignty over texas and the lands west of the rocky mountains and great britain laid claim to the oregon country.
to extend the american republic would involve new indian wars and possibly armed conflict with great britain and with mexico and perhaps france its main creditor.

manifest destiny south and north the upsurge in violence reflected a generational shift in culture and politics.
the missouri crisis of 1819 1822 chapter 8 had frightened the nations leaders.
for the next two decades the professional politicians who ran the second party system avoided policies such as the annexation of the slaveholding republic of texas that would prompt regional strife.
then during the 1840s many citizens embraced an ideology of expansion and proclaimed a god given duty to extend american republicanism to the pacific ocean.
but whose republican institutions the hierarchical slave system of the south or the more egalitarian reform minded capitalist managed society of the north and midwest.
ultimately the failure to find a political solution to this question would rip the nation apart.
oregon land hungry farmers of the ohio river valley had already cast their eyes toward the fertile lands of the oregon country a region that stretched along the pacific coast between the mexican province of california and russian settlements in alaska.
since 1818 a british american agreement had allowed settlement by people from both nations.
the british run hudsons bay company developed a lucrative fur business north of the columbia river while methodist missionaries and a few hundred american farmers settled to the south in the willamette valley map 13 1.

as the spring mud dried they began their six month trek hoping to miss the winter snows.
another 5 000 settlers mostly yeomen farm families from the southern border states missouri kentucky and tennessee set out over the next two years.
these pioneers overcame floods dust storms livestock deaths and a few armed encounters with native peoples before reaching oregon a journey of 2 000 miles.
by 1860 about 250 000 americans had braved the oregon trail with 65 000 heading for oregon 185 000 to california and others staying in wyoming idaho and montana.

tens of thousands of americans set out on these trails to found new communities in utah oregon new mexico and california.
this mass migration exposed sedentary indian peoples to american diseases guns and manufactures.
however raids by comanches and sioux affected their lives even more significantly as did the euro american traders who provided a ready market for indian horses and mules dried meat and buffalo skins.
a remote outpost of spains american empire california had few nonnative residents until the 1770s when spanish authorities built a chain of forts and religious missions along the pacific coast.
when mexico achieved independence in 1821 its government took over the franciscan run missions and freed the 20 000 indians whom the monks had persuaded or coerced into working on them.
some mission indians rejoined their tribes but many intermarried with mestizos mexicans of mixed spanish and indian ancestry.
chapter 13 expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 william henry jackson california crossing south platte river detail 1867 the south platte river was wide stretching from the foreground to the low bluff in the middle of the picture but shallow allowing relatively easy passage for the migrants cattle and covered wagons.
wagon trains followed the course of the various branches of the platte river for more than 300 miles across the great plains.
during the late spring and early summer wagons often stretched as far as the eye could see.

they worked on huge ranches the 450 estates created by mexican officials and bestowed primarily on their families and political allies.
the owners of these vast properties averaging 19 000 acres mostly raised spanish cattle prized for their hides and tallow.
the ranches soon linked california to the american economy.
new england merchants dispatched dozens of agents to buy leather for the booming massachusetts boot and shoe industry and tallow to make soap and candles.
many agents married the daughters of the elite mexican ranchers the californios and adopted their manners attitudes and catholic religion.
a crucial exception was thomas oliver larkin a successful merchant in the coastal town of monterey.
although larkin worked closely with mexican politicians and landowners he remained strongly american in outlook.
like larkin the american migrants in the sacramento river valley did not assimilate into mexican society.
some hoped to emulate the americans in texas by colonizing the country and then seeking annexation.
however in the early 1840s these settlers numbered only about 1 000 far outnumbered by the 7 000 mexicans who lived along the coast.
the plains indians as the pacific bound wagon trains rumbled across nebraska along the broad platte river the migrants encountered the unique ecology of the great plains.
a vast sea of wild grasses stretched from texas to saskatchewan in canada and west from the missouri river to the rocky mountains.
tall grasses flourished in the eastern regions of the future states of kansas nebraska and the dakotas where there was ample rainfall.
to the west in the semiarid region beyond the 100th meridian the migrants found short grasses that sustained a rich wildlife dominated by buffalo and grazing antelopes.
nomadic buffalo hunting indian peoples roamed the western plains while the eastern part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 river valleys were home to semisedentary tribes and since the 1830s the indian peoples whom andrew jackson had removed to the west.
a line of military forts stretching from fort jesup in louisiana to fort snelling then in the wisconsin territory policed the boundary between white settlements and what congress in 1834 designated as permanent indian territory.
for centuries the indians who lived on the eastern edge of the plains such as the pawnees and the mandans on the upper missouri river subsisted primarily on corn and beans supplemented by buffalo meat.
they hunted buffalo on foot driving them over cliffs or into canyons for the kill.
to the south the nomadic apaches acquired horses from spanish settlers in new mexico and ranged widely across the plains.
the comanches who migrated down the arkansas river from the rocky mountains around 1750 developed both a horse based culture and imperial ambitions.
skilled buffalo hunters and fierce warriors the comanches slowly pushed the apaches to the southern edge of the plains.
they also raided spanish settlements in new mexico incorporating captured women and children into their society.
after 1800 the comanches gradually built up a pastoral economy raising horses and mules and selling them to northern indian peoples and to euroamerican farmers in missouri and arkansas.
many comanche families owned thirty to thirty five horses or mules far more than the five or six required for hunting buffalo and fighting neighboring peoples.
the comanches also exchanged goods with merchants and travelers along the santa fe trail which cut through their territory as it connected missouri and new mexico.
by the early 1840s goods worth nearly 1 million moved along the trail each year.
by the 1830s the kiowas cheyennes and arapahos had also adopted this horse culture and allied with the comanches dominated the plains between the arkansas and red rivers.
the new culture brought sharper social divisions.
some kiowa men owned hundreds of horses and had several chore wives and captive children who worked for them.
poor men who owned only a few horses had difficulty finding marriage partners and often had to work for their wealthy kinsmen.
while european horses made plains indians wealthier and more mobile european diseases and comanches meeting the dragoons 1830s in the 1830s when artist george catlin accompanied the dragoons of the u s army into indian territory the comanches were masters of the southern plains.
they hunted buffalo raised horses and mules for sale and used their skills as horsemen to dominate other indian peoples and control the passage of americans along the santa fe trail.

chapter 13 guns thinned their ranks.
a devastating smallpox epidemic spread northward from new spain in 1779 1781 and killed half of the plains peoples.
twenty years later another smallpox outbreak left dozens of deserted villages along the missouri river.
smallpox struck the northern plains again from 1837 to 1840 killing half of the assiniboines and blackfeet and nearly a third of the crows pawnees and cheyennes.
if i could see this thing if i knew where it came from i would go there and fight it exclaimed a distressed cheyenne warrior.
european weapons also altered the geography of native peoples.
around 1750 the crees and assiniboines who lived on the far northern plains acquired guns by trading wolf pelts and beaver skins to the british run hudsons bay company.
once armed they drove the blackfoot peoples westward into the rocky mountains and took control of the saskatchewan and upper missouri river basins.
when the blackfeet obtained guns and horses around 1800 they emerged from the mountains and pushed the shoshones and crows to the south.
because horses could not easily find winter forage in the snow filled plains north of the platte river blackfoot families kept only five to ten horses and remained hunters rather than pastoralists.
the powerful lakota sioux who acquired guns and ammunition from french spanish and american traders along the missouri river also remained buffalo hunters.
a nomadic war prone people who lived in small groups the lakotas largely avoided major epidemics.
they kept some sedentary peoples such as the arikaras in subjection and raided others for their crops and horses.
by the 1830s the lakotas were the dominant tribe on the central as well as the northern plains.
those lands once belonged to the kiowas and the crows boasted the oglala sioux chief black hawk but we whipped those nations out of them and in this we did what the white men do when they want the lands of the indians the siouxs prosperity also came at the expense of the buffalo which provided them with a diet rich in protein and with hides and robes to sell.
the number of hides and robes shipped down the missouri river each year by the american fur company and the missouri fur company increased from 3 000 in the 1820s to 45 000 in the 1830s and to 90 000 annually after 1840.
north of the missouri the story was much the same.
the 24 000 indians of that region blackfeet crees and assiniboines annually killed about 160 000 buffalo.
the women dried the meat to feed their people and to sell to white traders and soldiers.
the women also undertook the arduous work of skinning and tanning the hides which they fashioned into tepees expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 buffalo robes and sleeping covtrace change ers.
over time indian hunters over time increased the kill and traded sur why did some great plains plus hides and robes about peoples flourish between 40 000 annually by the 1840s for 1750 and 1860 while pots knives guns and other others did not.
euro american manufactures.
as among the kiowas trade increased social divisions.
it is a fine sight a traveler noted around 1850 to see one of those big men among the blackfeet who has two or three lodges five or six wives twenty or thirty children fifty to a hundred head of horses for his trade amounts to upward of 2 000 per year although the blackfeet kiowas and lakotas contributed buffalo hides to the national economy they did not fully grasp their market value as winter clothes leather accessories and industrial drive belts.
consequently they could not demand the best price.
moreover the increasing size of the kill diminished the buffalo herds.
between 1820 and 1870 the northern herd shrank from 5 million to less than 2 million.
when the assiniboines cultural hero inktonmi had taught his people how to kill the buffalo he told them the buffalo will live as long as your people.
there will be no end of them until the end of time meant as a perpetual guarantee by the 1860s inktonmis words prefigured the end of time the demise of traditional buffalo hunting and perhaps of the assiniboines as well.
the fateful election of 1844 the election of 1844 changed the american governments policy toward the great plains the far west and texas.
since 1836 southern leaders had supported the annexation of texas but cautious party politicians pressured by northerners who opposed the expansion of slavery had rebuffed them chapter 12.
now rumors swirled that great britain was encouraging texas to remain independent wanted california as payment for the mexican debts owed to british investors and had designs on spanish cuba which some slave owners wanted to add to the united states.
to thwart such imagined schemes southern expansionists demanded the immediate annexation of texas.
at this crucial juncture oregon fever altered the political landscape in the north.
in 1843 americans in the ohio river valley and the great lakes states organized oregon conventions and democratic and whig politicians alike called for american sovereignty over the entire oregon country from spanish california to russian alaska which began at 5440 north latitude.
with northerners demanding oregon part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 president john tyler a proslavery zealot called for the annexation of texas.
disowned by the whigs because he thwarted henry clays nationalist economic program tyler hoped to win reelection in 1844 as a democrat.
to curry favor among northern expansionists tyler supported claims to all of oregon.
in april 1844 tyler and john c calhoun his proslavery expansionist minded secretary of state sent the senate a treaty to bring texas into the union.
however the understand two major presidential hopefuls points of view democrat martin van buren and why did party politiwhig henry clay opposed tylers cians initially oppose the initiative.
fearful of raising the annexation of texas and issue of slavery they persuaded how did this view change during the election of the senate to reject the treaty.
nonetheless expansion into texas and oregon became the central issue in the election of 1844.
most southern democrats favored texas annexation and refused to support van burens candidacy.
the party also passed over tyler whom they did not trust.
instead the democrats selected governor james k polk of tennessee a slave owner and an avowed expansionist.
known as young hickory because he was a protg of andrew jackson polk shared his mentors iron will boundless ambition and determination to open up lands for american settlement.
accepting the false claim in the democratic party platform that both areas already belonged to the united states polk campaigned for the re occupation of oregon and the re annexation of texas he insisted that the united states defy british claims and occupy the whole of the territory of oregon to the alaskan border.
fifty four forty or fight became his jingoistic cry.
the whigs nominated henry clay who again advocated his american system of high tariffs internal improvements and national banking.
clay initially dodged the issue of texas but seeking southern votes ultimately supported annexation.
northern whigs who opposed the admission of a new slave state refused to vote for clay and cast their ballots for james g birney of the liberty party chapter 11.
birney garnered less than 3 percent of the national vote but took enough whig votes in new york to cost clay that state and the presidency.
following polks narrow victory congressional democrats called for immediate texas statehood.
however they lacked the two thirds majority in the senate needed to ratify a treaty of annexation.
so the democrats admitted texas using a joint resolution of congress which required just a majority vote in each house and texas became the twenty eighth state in december 1845.
polks strategy of linking texas and oregon had put him in the white house and texas in the union.
shortly it would make the expansion of the south and its system of slavery the central topic of american politics.
war expansion and slavery 1846 1850 the acquisition of texas whetted polks appetite for the mexican lands between texas and the pacific ocean.
if necessary he was ready to go to war for them.
what he and many democrats consciously ignored was the domestic crisis that a war of conquest to expand slavery would unleash.
the war with mexico 1846 1848 since gaining independence in 1821 mexico had not prospered.
its civil wars and political instability produced a stagnant economy a weak government and modest tax revenues which a bloated bureaucracy and debt payments to european bankers quickly devoured.
although the distant northern provinces of california and new mexico remained undeveloped and sparsely settled with a spanish speaking population of only 75 000 in 1840 mexican officials vowed to preserve their nations historic boundaries.
when its breakaway province of texas prepared to join the american union mexico suspended diplomatic relations with the united states.
polks expansionist program president polk now moved quickly to acquire mexicos other northern provinces.
he hoped to foment a revolution in california that like the 1836 rebellion in texas would lead to annexation.
in october 1845 secretary of state james buchanan told merchant thomas oliver larkin now the u s consul for the mexican province to encourage influential californios to seek independence and union with the united states.
to add military muscle to this scheme polk ordered american naval commanders to seize san francisco bay and californias coastal towns in case of war with mexico.
the president also instructed the war department to dispatch captain john c frmont and an exploring party of soldiers into mexican territory.
by december 1845 frmonts force had reached californias sacramento river valley.
chapter 13 with these preparations in place polk launched a secret diplomatic initiative he sent louisiana congressman john slidell to mexico telling him to secure the rio grande boundary for texas and to buy the provinces of california and new mexico for 30 million.
however mexican officials refused to meet with slidell.
events now moved quickly toward war.
polk ordered general zachary taylor and an american army of 2 000 soldiers to occupy disputed lands between the nueces river the historic southern boundary of spanish texas and the rio grande which the republic of texas had claimed as its border with mexico.
we were sent to provoke a fight recalled ulysses s grant then a young officer serving with taylor but it was essential that mexico should commence it when the armies clashed near the rio grande in may 1846 polk delivered the war message he had drafted long before.
taking liberties with the truth the president declared that mexico has passed the boundary of the united states has invaded our territory and shed american blood upon the american expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 soil ignoring pleas by some whigs for a negotiated settlement an overwhelming majority in congress voted for war a decision greeted with great popular acclaim.
to avoid a simultaneous war with britain polk retreated from his demand for fifty four forty or fight and in june 1846 accepted british terms that divided the oregon country at the forty ninth parallel.
american military successes american forces in texas quickly established their military superiority.
zachary taylors army crossed the rio grande occupied the mexican city of matamoros and after a fierce six day battle in september 1846 took the interior mexican town of monterrey.
two months later a u s naval squadron in the gulf of mexico seized tampico mexicos second most important port.
by the end of 1846 the united states controlled much of northeastern mexico map 13 3.
fighting also broke out in california.

in february 1847 in the battle of buena vista santa anna nearly defeated taylors army in northeastern mexico.
with most mexican troops deployed in the north polk approved general winfield scotts plan to capture the port of veracruz and march 260 miles to mexico city.

chapter 13 a divisive victory initially the war with mexico sparked an explosion of patriotic expansionism.
the nashville union hailed it as a noble struggle to extend the principles of free government however the war soon divided the nation american voices p 422.
some northern whigs among them charles francis adams of massachusetts the son of john quincy adams and chancellor james kent of new york opposed the war on moral grounds calling it causeless wicked unjust adams kent and other conscience whigs accused polk of waging a war of conquest to add new slave states and give slave owning democrats permanent control of the federal government.
swayed by such arguments troops deserted in droves creating the highest desertion rate of any american war and antiwar activists denounced enlistees as murderers and robbers the united states will conquer mexico ralph waldo emerson had predicted as the war began but mexico will poison us when voters repudiated polks war policy in the elections of 1846 the whig party took control of congress.
whig leaders called for no territory a congressional pledge that the united states would not seek any land from the mexican republic.
away with this wretched cant about a manifest destiny a divine mission.
to civilize and christianize and democratize our sister republics at the mouth of a cannon declared new york senator william duer.
the wilmot proviso polks expansionist policies also split the democrats.
as early as 1839 ohio democrat thomas morris had warned that the power of slavery is aiming to govern the country its constitutions and laws in 1846 david wilmot an antislavery democratic congressman from pennsylvania took up that refrain and proposed the so called wilmot proviso a ban on slavery in any territories gained from the war.
whigs and antislavery democrats in the house of representatives quickly passed the bill dividing congress along sectional lines.
the madmen of the north.
grumbled the richmond enquirer have we fear cast the die and numbered the days of this glorious union fearing that outcome a few proslavery northern senators joined their southern colleagues to kill the proviso.
fervent democratic expansionists now became even more aggressive.
president polk secretary of state buchanan and senators stephen a douglas of illinois and jefferson davis of mississippi called for the annexation of a huge swath of mexican territory south of the rio grande.
however john c calhoun and other expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 southern whites feared this demand would extend the costly war and require the assimilation of many darkskinned mestizos.
they favored only the annexation of sparsely settled new mexico and california.
ours is a government of the white man proclaimed calhoun which should never welcome into the union any but the caucasian race to unify the democratic party polk and buchanan accepted calhouns policy.
in 1848 polk signed and the senate ratified the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in which the united states agreed to pay mexico 15 million in return for more than onethird of its territory map 13 4.
congress also created the oregon territory in 1848 and two years later passed the oregon donation land claim act which granted farm sized plots of free land to settlers who took up residence before 1854.
soon treaties with native peoples extinguished indian titles to much of the new territory.
with the settlement of oregon and the acquisition of new mexico and california the american conquest of the far west was far advanced.
free soil however the political debate over expansion was far from over and dominated the election of 1848.
the senates rejection of the wilmot proviso revived thomas morriss charge that leading southerners were part of a slave power conspiracy to dominate national life.
to thwart any such plan thousands of ordinary northerners including farmer abijah beckwith of herkimer county new york joined the free soil movement.
slavery beckwith wrote in his diary was an institution of aristocratic men and a danger to the great mass of the people because it.
threatens the general and equal distribution of our lands into convenient family farms the free soilers quickly organized the free soil party in 1848.
the new party abandoned the garrisonians and liberty partys emphasis on the sinfulness of slavery and the natural rights of african americans.
instead like beckwith it depicted slavery as a threat to republicanism and to the jeffersonian ideal of a freeholder society arguments that won broad support among aspiring white farmers.
hundreds of men and women in the great lakes states joined the free soil organizations formed by the american and foreign anti slavery society.
so too did frederick douglass the foremost black abolitionist who attended the first free soil party convention in the summer of 1848 and endorsed its strategy.
however william lloyd garrison and other radical abolitionists condemned the freesoilers stress on white freehold farming as racist whitemanism american voices the mexican war expansion and slavery conflict with mexico prompted debates over the polk administrations aggressive efforts to acquire territory and spread slavery.
here polks critics face off against the expansionists.
john l osullivan editor james buchanan u s secretary of state manifest destiny from united states magazine and democratic review july letter to john slidell minister plenipotentiary to mexico november 1845 texas is now ours.
britain and france tried to intrude themselves into texas affairs.
for the avowed object of thwarting our policy and hampering our power limiting our greatness and checking the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.
the independence of texas was complete and absolute.
it was an independence not only in fact but of right.
what then can be more preposterous than all this clamor by mexico and the mexican interest against annexation as a violation of any rights of hers.
nor is there any just foundation for the charge that annexation is a great pro slavery measure calculated to increase and perpetuate that institution.
slavery had nothing to do with it.
that it will tend to facilitate and hasten the disappearance of slavery from all the northern tier of the present slave states cannot surely admit of serious question.
the greater value in texas of the slave labor now employed in those states must soon produce the effect of draining off that labor southwardly.
california will probably next fall away.
already the advance guard of the irresistible army of anglo saxon emigration has begun to pour down upon it armed with the plough and the rifle and marking its trail with schools and colleges courts and representative halls mills and meeting houses.
a population will soon be in actual occupation of california.
and they will have a right to independence to self government.
a better and a truer right than the artificial title of sovereignty in mexico a thousand miles distant inheriting from spain a title good only against those who have none better.
in your negotiations with mexico the independence of texas must be considered a settled fact and is not to be called in question.
it may however be contended on the part of mexico that the nueces and not the rio del norte rio grande is the true western boundary of texas.
i need not furnish you arguments to controvert this position.
the jurisdiction of texas has been extended beyond that river the nueces and.
representatives from the country between it and the del norte have participated in the deliberations both of her congress and her convention.
the case is different in regard to new mexico.
santa fe its capital was settled by the spaniards more than two centuries ago and that province has been ever since in their possession and that of the republic of mexico.
the texans never have conquered or taken possession of it.
however a great portion of new mexico being on this side of the rio grande and included within the limits already claimed by texas it may hereafter should it remain a mexican province become a subject of dispute.
it would seem to be equally the interest of both powers that new mexico should belong to the united states.
it is to be seriously apprehended that both great britain and france have designs upon california.
this government.
would vigorously interpose to prevent the latter from becoming either a british or a french colony.
the possession of the bay and harbor of san francisco is all important to the united states.
money would be no object.

if we regard it as an independent state they must be determined by the extent of jurisdiction which the state was able to maintain.
now it seems clear that the river nueces was always recognized by mexico as the western boundary and it is undisputed that the state of texas since its declaration of independence never exercised any jurisdiction beyond the nueces.
in the month of january 1846 the president of the united states directed the troops under general taylor called the army of occupation to take possession of this region west of the nueces river.

these new territories president polk boasted to congress constitute of themselves a country large enough for a great empire and the acquisition is second in importance only to that of louisiana in 1803 the election of 1848 the conflict over slavery took a toll on polk and the democratic party.
scorned by whigs and free soilers and exhausted by his rigorous dawn to midnight work regime polk declined to run for a second term and died just three months after leaving office.
in his place the democrats nominated senator lewis cass of michigan an avid expansionist who had advocated buying cuba annexing mexicos yucatn peninsula and taking all of oregon.
to maintain party unity on the slavery place events issue cass promoted a new idea in context squatter sovereignty.
under this what did conscience plan congress would allow setwhigs david wilmot tlers in each territory to deterand free soilers have in mine its status as free or slave.
common and why did casss doctrine of squatter they all rise to prominence sovereignty failed to persuade between 1846 and 1848.
those northern democrats who opposed any expansion of slavery.
they joined the free soil party as did former democratic president martin van buren who became its candidate for president.
to attract whig votes the free soilers chose conscience whig charles francis adams for vice president.
the whigs nominated general zachary taylor.
taylor was a louisiana slave owner firmly committed to the defense of slavery in the south but not in the territories a position that won him support in the north.
moreover the generals military exploits had made him a popular hero known affectionately among his troops as old rough and ready in 1848 as in 1840 with the candidacy of william henry harrison running a military hero worked for the whigs.
taylor took 47 percent of the popular vote to casss 42 percent.
however taylor won a majority in the electoral college 163 to 127 only because van buren and the free soil ticket chapter 13 expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 land in the sacramento river valley.
he tried to hide the discovery but by mid 1848 americans from monterey and san francisco were pouring into the foothills along with hundreds of indians and californios and scores of australians mexicans and chileans.
the gold rush was on america compared p 426.

for bernard reid the overland trip on the pioneer line was a long dreadful dream beset by cholera scurvy and near starvation.

this is the house that polk built president james polks administration started off with a bang a long sought democratic free trade tariff a compromise settlement of the oregon boundary dispute with great britain and a war to seize california and other mexican provinces.
this ambitious agenda promised fame for the president but the cartoonist pictures polk as a worried man afraid that he has built a house of cards that might collapse at any time.
bettmann corbis.
took enough votes in new york to deny cass a victory there.
although their numbers were small antislavery voters in new york had denied the presidency to clay in 1844 and to cass in 1848.
the bitter debate over slavery had changed the dynamics of national politics.
california gold and racial warfare even before taylor took office events in sparsely settled california took center stage.
in january 1848 workers building a milldam for john a sutter in the sierra nevada foothills came across flakes of gold.
sutter was a swiss immigrant who came to california in 1839 became a mexican citizen and accumulated the forty niners the forty niners lived in crowded chaotic towns and mining camps amid gamblers saloon keepers and prostitutes.
they set up claims clubs to settle mining disputes and cobbled together a system of legal rules based on practice back east the american miners usually treated alien whites fairly but ruthlessly expelled indians mexicans and chileans from the goldfields or confined them to marginal diggings.
when substantial numbers of chinese miners arrived in 1850 often in the employ of chinese companies whites called for laws to expel them from california.
the first miners to exploit a site often struck it rich.
they scooped up the easily reached deposits leaving small pickings for later arrivals.
his high hopes wrecked one latecomer saw himself and most other forty niners as little better than convicts condemned to exile and hard labor they faced disease and death as well diarrhea was so general during the fall and winter months and so often fatal a sacramento doctor remarked that it was called the disease of california like many migrants william swain gave up the search for gold in 1850 and borrowed funds to return to his wife infant daughter and aged mother on a new york farm.
o william his wife sabrina had written i wish you had been content to stay at home for there is no real home for me without you thousands of disillusioned forty niners were either too ashamed or too tired or too ambitious to go home.
some became wageworkers for companies that engaged in hydraulic or underground mining others turned to farming.
instead of going to the mines where fortune hangs upon the merest chance a frustrated miner advised emigrants you should at once commence the cultivation of the soil america c o m pa r e d the gold rush california and australia in 1849 hundreds of australian men booked passage for san francisco hoping to make their fortune in the california goldfields.
a mere two years later thousands more australian diggers flocked to the colony of victoria in australia itself drawn by a gold strike that yielded onethird of the worlds gold output during the 1850s.
in california and victoria miners lived mostly in canvas tents and flimsy wood shanties and found gold initially in stream beds.
in both territories the huge migration virtually wiped out the aboriginal peoples.
similarly both rushes attracted about 40 000 chinese miners an influx that in the race conscious english speaking world of the nineteenth century prompted riots and legislation in both regions to restrict asian migrants.
finally only a few california forty niners or australian diggers made a fortune perhaps 5 of every 100.
there were differences as well.
upon a gold strike in california the prospectors would stake their claims and collectively protect those claims a rough system of democratic self rule.
in victoria the british crown owned much of the land and gold commissioners and police administered the diggings selling licenses to dig for 30 shillings a month about 200 in present day u s dollars.
distressed by license fees and corrupt local officials 10 000 miners at ballarat voted to create a reform league which demanded abolition of fees and universal male suffrage.
when authorities ignored their demands 500 miners seized a rich mine at eureka.
in the ensuing struggle british troops killed 22 miners ending the armed uprising.
despite these differences as well as a significant disparity in the proportion of women california and victoria were both transformed by the nearly simultaneous discovery of gold.
within a few decades a mining boom vastly increased their wealth and boasted their populations as the following chart indicates table 13 1 nonnative population increases from gold rush in united states and australia california united states total women victoria australia nonwhite total women nonwhite 11 000 93 000 7 000 7 1 97 000 39 000 40 0 380 000 120 000 31 15 540 000 219 000 40 5 560 000 211 000 37 11 746 000 339 000 45 4 questions for analysis 1.
how would you account for the relative numbers of women in victoria and california and how those proportions changed over time.
how might the percentage of women affect the character of the two societies.
why were there no equivalents of the ballarat reform league and the eureka stockade in california given that the two rushes were similar in so many ways and fostered similar anti chinese violence and legislation.
racial warfare and land rights farming required arable land and mexican grantees and native peoples owned or claimed much of it.
the american migrants brushed aside both groups brutally eliminating the indians and wearing down mexican claimants with legal tactics and political pressure.
the subjugation of the native peoples came first.

until the indian race becomes extinct predicted governor peter burnett in 1851.
congress abetted these assaults.
at the bidding of white californians it repudiated treaties that federal agents had negotiated with 119 tribes and that had provided the indians with 7 million acres of land.
instead in 1853 congress authorized five reservations of only 25 000 acres each and refused to provide the indians with military protection.
consequently some settlers simply murdered indians to push them off nonreservation lands.
the yuki people who lived in the round valley in northern california were one target.
as the petaluma journal reported in april 1857 within the past three weeks from 300 to 400 bucks squaws and children have been killed by whites other white californians turned to slave trading hundreds of indians have been stolen and carried into the settlements and sold the states indian affairs superintendent reported in 1856.
laborhungry farmers quickly put them to work.
indians were all among us around us with no house and kitchen without them recalled one farmer.
expelled from their lands and widely dispersed many indian peoples simply vanished as distinct communities.
those tribal communities that survived were a shadow of their former selves.

owned by mexicans would be inviolably respected although many of the 800 grants made by spanish and mexican authorities in california were either fraudulent or poorly documented the land claims commission created by congress eventually upheld the validity of 75 percent of them.
in the meantime hundreds of americans had set up farms on the sparsely settled grants.
having come of age in the antimonopoly jacksonian era these american squatters rejected the legitimacy of the californios claims to unoccupied and unimproved land and successfully pressured local land commissioners and judges to void or reduce the size of many grants.
indeed the americans clamor for land was so intense and their numbers so large that many californio claimants sold off their properties at bargain prices.

although he favored the american conquest of 1846 vallejo was imprisoned for a short period and subsequently suffered severe financial setbacks losing most of his vast landholdings to squatters and rival claimants.

most important using the latest agricultural machinery and scores of hired workers california farmers produced huge crops of wheat and barley which san francisco merchants exported to europe at high prices.
the gold rush turned into a wheat boom.
1850 crisis and compromise the rapid settlement of california qualified it for admission to the union.
hoping to avoid an extended debate over slavery president taylor advised the constitutional conflict californias bid for admission produced passionate debates in congress and four distinct positions regarding the expansion of slavery.
first john c calhoun took his usual extreme stance.
on the verge of death calhoun reiterated his deep resentment of the norths long continued agitation of the slavery question to uphold southern honor and political power he proposed a constitutional amendment to create a dual presidency permanently dividing executive power between the north and the south.
calhoun also advanced the radical argument that congress had no constitutional authority to regulate slavery in the territories.
slaves were property calhoun insisted and the constitution restricted congresss power to abrogate or limit property rights.
that argument ran counter to a half century of practice congress had prohibited slavery in the northwest territory in 1787 and had extended that ban to most of the louisiana purchase in the missouri compromise of 1820.
but calhouns assertion that slavery follows the flag that planters could by right take their slave property into new territories won support in the deep south.
however many southerners favored a second more moderate proposal to extend the missouri compromise line to the pacific ocean.
this plan won the backing of pennsylvanian james buchanan and other influential northern democrats.
it would guarantee slave owners access to some western territory including a separate state in southern california.
a third alternative was squatter sovereignty allowing settlers in a territory to decide the status of slavery.
lewis cass had advanced this idea in 1848 and democratic senator stephen douglas of illinois now became its champion.
douglas called his plan popular sovereignty to link it to republican ideology which placed ultimate power in the hands of the people chapter 5 and it had considerable appeal.
politicians hoped it would remove the explosive issue of slavery from congress and settlers welcomed the power it would give them.
however popular sovereignty was a slippery concept.
could residents accept or ban slavery when a territory was first organized.
or must they delay that decision until a territory had enough people to frame a constitution and apply for statehood.
no one knew.
for their part antislavery advocates refused to accept any plan for california or the territories that chapter 13 would allow slavery.
senator salmon p chase of ohio elected by a democratic free soil coalition and senator william h seward a new york whig urged a fourth position that federal legislation restrict slavery within its existing boundaries and eventually extinguish it completely.
condemning slavery as morally unjust politically unwise and socially pernicious and invoking a higher law than the constitution seward demanded bold action to protect freedom the common heritage of mankind a complex compromise standing on the brink of disaster senior whig and democratic politicians worked desperately to preserve the union.
aided by millard fillmore who became president in 1850 after compromise of 1850 voters allowed to decide whether to permit slavery territory left unorganized expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 zachary taylors sudden death whig leaders henry clay and daniel webster and democrat stephen a douglas won the passage of five separate laws known collectively as the compromise of 1850.
to mollify the south the compromise included a new fugitive slave act giving federal support to slave catchers.
to satisfy the north the legislation admitted california as a free state resolved a boundary dispute between new mexico and texas in favor of new mexico and abolished the slave trade but not slavery in the district of columbia.
finally the compromise organized the rest of the conquered mexican lands into the territories of new mexico and utah and invoking popular sovereignty left the issue of slavery in the hands of their residents map 13 6.

however the kansas nebraska act of 1854 voided the missouri compromise 1820 and instituted popular sovereignty in those territories.
that decision sparked a bitter local war and revealed a fatal flaw in the doctrine.

militant its terms.
activists or fire eaters in south carolina georgia mississippi and alabama organized special conventions to safeguard southern rights georgia congressman alexander h stephens called on convention delegates to prepare men and money arms and munitions etc.
to meet the emergency a majority of delegates remained committed to the union but only on the condition that congress protect slavery where it existed and grant statehood to any territory that ratified a proslavery constitution.
political wizardry had solved the immediate crisis but not the underlying issues.
place events in context the end of the second party system 1850 1858 the missouri compromise had endured for a generation and the architects of the compromise of 1850 hoped their agreement would have an even longer life.
religious leaders conservative businessmen and leading judges called upon citizens to support the compromise to preserve government and civil society their hopes quickly faded.
demanding freedom for fugitive slaves and free soil in the west antislavery northerners refused to accept the legitimacy of the compromise.
for their part proslavery southerners plotted to extend slavery into the west the caribbean and central america.
the resulting disputes destroyed the second party system and deepened the crisis of the union.
resistance to the fugitive slave act the fugitive slave act proved the most controversial element of the compromise.
the act required federal magistrates to determine the status of alleged runaways and denied them a jury trial or even the right to testify.
using its provisions southern owners re enslaved about 200 fugitives as well as some free blacks.
the plight of the runaways and the presence of slave catchers aroused popular hostility in the north and midwest.
ignoring the threat of substantial fines and prison sentences free blacks and white abolitionists protected fugitives.
in october 1850 boston abolitionists helped two slaves escape from georgia slave catchers.
rioters in syracuse new york broke into a courthouse freed a fugitive and accused the u s marshal of kidnapping.
abandoning nonviolence chapter 13 frederick douglass declared the only way to make a fugitive slave law a dead letter is to make half a dozen or more dead kidnappers precisely such a deadly result occurred in christiana pennsylvania in september 1851 when twenty african americans exchanged gunfire with maryland slave catchers killing two of them.
federal authorities indicted thirty six blacks and four whites for treason and other crimes but a pennsylvania jury acquitted one defendant and the government dropped charges against the rest.
harriet beecher stowes novel uncle toms cabin 1852 boosted opposition to the fugitive slave act.
conveying the moral principles of abolitionism in heartrending personal situations using the now familiar literary trope of sentimental domesticity stowes book quickly sold 310 000 copies in the united states and double that number in britain where it prompted an antislavery petition signed by 560 000 english women.
as uncle toms cabin sparked an unprecedented discussion of race and slavery state legislators in the north protested that the fugitive slave act violated state sovereignty and they passed personal liberty laws that guaranteed to all residents including alleged fugitives the right to a jury trial.
in 1857 the wisconsin supreme court went further ruling in ableman v booth that the fugitive slave act was unconstitutional because it violated the rights of wisconsins citizens.
taking a states rights stance traditionally a southern position the wisconsin court denied the authority of the federal judiciary to review its decision.
in 1859 chief justice roger b taney led a unanimous supreme court in affirming the supremacy of federal courts a position that has withstood the test of time and upholding the constitutionality of the fugitive slave act.
by then as frederick douglass had hoped popular opposition had made the law a dead letter the whigs disintegrate and new parties rise the conflict over slavery split both major political parties along sectional lines.
hoping to unify their party the whigs ran another war hero general winfield scott as their presidential candidate in 1852.
among the democrats southerners demanded a candidate who embraced calhouns constitutional argument that all territories were open to slavery.
however northern and midwestern democrats stood behind the three leading candidates lewis cass of michigan stephen douglas of illinois and james buchanan of pennsylvania who advocated popular sovereignty.

sympathetic to the south.
as the whig party fragmented over slavery pierce swept to victory.
proslavery initiatives as president pierce pursued an expansionist foreign policy.
to assist northern merchants who wanted a commercial empire he negotiated a trade opening treaty with japan.
to mollify southern expansionists who desired a plantation empire he sought extensive mexican lands south of the rio grande.
ultimately pierce settled for a smaller slice of land the gadsden purchase of 1853 now part of arizona and new mexico that opened the way for his negotiator james gadsden to build a transcontinental rail line from new orleans to los angeles.
pierces most controversial initiatives came in the caribbean and central america.
southern expansionists had long urged cuban slave owners to declare independence from spain and join the united states.
to assist the expansionists and the american traders who still supplied enslaved africans to cuba pierce threatened war with spain and covertly supported filibustering private military expeditions to cuba.
when secretary of state william l marcy arranged in 1854 for american diplomats in europe to compose the ostend manifesto which urged pierce to seize cuba northern democrats denounced these aggressive initiatives and scuttled the planters dreams of american expansion into the caribbean.
the kansas nebraska act the caribbean was a sideshow.
the main stage was the trans mississippi west where a major controversy in 1854 destroyed the whig party and sent the union spinning toward disaster.
the missouri compromise prohibited new slave states in the louisiana purchase north of 3630 so southern senators had long prevented the creation of new territories there.
it remained permanent indian territory.
now senator stephen a douglas of illinois wanted to open it up allowing a transcontinental railroad to link chicago to california.
douglas proposed to extinguish native american rights on the great plains and create a large free territory called nebraska.
southern politicians opposed douglass initiative.
they hoped to extend slavery throughout the louisiana purchase and to have a southern city new orleans memphis or st louis as the eastern terminus of a transcontinental railroad.
to win their support douglas amended his bill so that it explicitly repealed part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 the missouri compromise and organized the region on the basis of popular sovereignty.
he also agreed to the formation of two territories nebraska and kansas raising the prospect that settlers in the southern one kansas would choose slavery.
knowing the revised bill would raise a hell of a storm in the north douglas argued that kansas was not suited to plantation agriculture and would become a free state.
after weeks of bitter debate the senate passed the kansas nebraska act.
as 1 600 petitions opposing the bill flooded the house of representatives the measure barely squeaked through.
the republican and american parties the kansasnebraska act of 1854 was a disaster for the american political system.
it finished off the whig party we went to bed one night old fashioned conservative union whigs and waked up stark mad abolitionists cotton textile magnate amos lawrence lamented.
and it crippled the democracy because anti nebraska democrats denounced the act as part of a great scheme for extending and perpetuating supremacy of the slave power in 1854 they joined ex whigs freesoilers and abolitionists to form a new republican party.
the new party was a coalition of strange discordant and even hostile elements one republican observed.
however all its members opposed slavery which they argued drove down compare and the wages of free workers and contrast degraded the dignity of manual what were the main policy labor.
like thomas jefferson objectives of the republirepublicans praised a society can and american parties.
based on the middling classes who own the soil and work it with their own hands abraham lincoln an ex whig from illinois conveyed the new partys vision of social mobility.
there is no permanent class of hired laborers among us he declared ignoring the growing social divisions in the industrializing north and midwest.
lincoln and his fellow republicans envisioned a society of independent farmers artisans and proprietors and they celebrated middle class values domesticity and respectability religious commitment and capitalist enterprise.
the republicans faced strong competition from the american or know nothing party which had its origins in the anti immigrant and anti catholic movements of the 1840s chapter 9.
in 1850 these nativist societies banded together as the order of the starspangled banner the following year they formed the american party.
when questioned the partys secrecyconscious members often replied i know nothing hence the nickname.
the american or knownothing party program was far from secret however party supporters wanted to mobilize native born protestants against the alien menace of irish and german catholics prohibit further immigration and institute literacy tests for voting.
northern members of the party had a strong antislavery outlook.
in 1854 voters elected dozens of american party candidates to the house of representatives and gave the party control of the state governments of massachusetts and pennsylvania.
the emergence of a protestant based nativist party to replace the whigs became a real possibility.
bleeding kansas meanwhile thousands of settlers rushed into the kansas territory putting douglass armed abolitionists in kansas the confrontation between north and south in kansas took many forms.
in the spring of 1859 dr john doy seated slipped across the border into missouri and tried to lead thirteen escaped slaves to freedom in kansas only to be captured and jailed in st joseph missouri.
the serious looking men standing behind doy well armed with guns and bowie knives attacked the jail and carried doy back to kansas.
the photograph celebrated and memorialized their successful exploit.
kansas state historical society.
chapter 13 concept of popular sovereignty to the test.
on the side of slavery missouri senator david r atchison encouraged residents of his state to cross temporarily into kansas to vote in crucial elections there.
opposing atchison was the abolitionist new england emigrant aid society which dispatched free soilers to kansas.
in 1855 the pierce administration accepted the legitimacy of a proslavery legislature in lecompton kansas which had been elected with aid from border crossing missourians.
however the majority of kansas residents favored free soil and refused allegiance to the lecompton government.
in 1856 both sides turned to violence prompting horace greeley of the new york tribune to label the territory bleeding kansas a proslavery force seven hundred strong looted and burned the free soil town of lawrence.
the attack enraged john brown a fiftysix year old abolitionist from new york and ohio who commanded a free state militia.
brown was a complex man with a record of failed businesses but he had an intellectual and moral intensity that won the trust of influential people.
avenging the sack of lawrence brown and his followers murdered five proslavery settlers at pottawatomie.
abolitionists must fight fire with fire and strike terror in the hearts of the proslavery people brown declared.
the attack on lawrence and the pottawatomie killings started a guerrilla war in kansas that took nearly two hundred lives.
buchanans failed presidency the violence in kansas dominated the presidential election of 1856.
the new republican party counted on anger over bleeding kansas to boost the partys fortunes.
its platform denounced the kansas nebraska act and demanded that the federal government prohibit slavery in all the territories.
republicans also called for federal subsidies for transcontinental railroads reviving a whig economic proposal popular among midwestern democrats.
for president the republicans nominated colonel john c frmont a free soiler who had won fame in the conquest of mexican california.
the election of 1856 the american party entered the election with equally high hopes but like the whigs and democrats it split along sectional lines over slavery.
the southern faction of the american party nominated former whig president millard fillmore while the northern contingent endorsed frmont.
during the campaign the republicans won the votes expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 of many northern know nothings by demanding legislation banning foreign immigrants and imposing high tariffs on foreign manufactures.
as a pennsylvania republican put it let our motto be protection to everything american against everything foreign in new york republicans campaigned on a reform platform designed to unite all of the anti slavery antipopery and anti whiskey voters.
the democrats reaffirmed their support for popular sovereignty and the kansas nebraska act and they nominated james buchanan of pennsylvania.
a tall dignified and experienced politician buchanan was staunchly prosouthern.
he won the three way race with 1 8 million popular votes 45 3 percent and 174 electoral votes.
frmont polled 1 3 million popular votes 33 2 percent and 114 electoral votes fillmore won 873 000 popular votes 21 5 percent but captured only 8 electoral votes.
the dramatic restructuring of the political system was now apparent map 13 7.
with the splintering of the american party the republicans had replaced the whigs as the second major party.
however frmont had not won a single vote in the south had he triumphed a north carolina newspaper warned the result would have been a separation of the states the fate of the republic hinged on president buchanans ability to quiet the passions of the past decade and to hold the democratic party the only national party together.
dred scott petitioner for freedom events and his own values and weaknesses conspired against buchanan.
early in 1857 the supreme court decided the case of dred scott v sandford which raised the controversial issue of congresss constitutional authority over slavery.
dred scott was an enslaved african american who had lived for a time with his owner an army surgeon in the free state of illinois and at fort snelling in the northern part of the louisiana purchase then part of the wisconsin territory where the missouri compromise 1820 prohibited slavery.
scott claimed that residence in a free state and a free territory had made him free.
buchanan opposed scotts appeal and pressured the two justices from pennsylvania to place events side with their southern col in context leagues.
seven of the nine justices declared that scott was still a slave but they disagreed on the legal rationale thinking like a historian p 434.
why did northern democratic presidents such as pierce and buchanan adopt prosouthern policies.
thinking like a historian biography as history sometimes the life of one individual can exemplify an era and bridget biddy mason was such a person.
mason was born into slavery in georgia in 1818 of mixed african american and native american descent.
in 1836 her owner gave biddy age eighteen to his recently married cousins robert and rebecca smith who owned a mississippi plantation.
trained as a midwife biddy delivered all six of rebeccas babies as well as working in the fields.
biddy herself gave birth to three daughters probably fathered by smith as were at least two of her sister hannahs eight children.
in the mid 1840s the smiths converted to mormonism and in 1847 along with other mississippi converts and their slaves journeyed 1 700 miles to the utah territory.

mason v smith 1856 the bridget biddy mason case.
most mormon migrants to california heeded brigham youngs advice to free their slaves as california was a free state.
robert smith refused to do so and in 1855 prepared to move to texas.
however in 1856 members of the free black community assisted biddy to file a habeas corpus petition and obtain freedom for herself and her extended family of thirteen women and children.
in a later interview mason stated i feared this trip to texas since i first heard of it and it further appearing by satisfactory proof to the judge here that all of the said persons of color are entitled to their freedom and are free and cannot be held in slavery or involuntary servitude.
and it further appearing to the satisfaction of the judge here that the said robert smith intended to and is about to remove from the state of california where slavery does not exist to the state of texas where slavery of negroes and persons of color does exist and is established by the municipal laws and intends to remove the said before mentioned persons of color to his own use without the free will and consent of all or any of the said persons of color whereby their liberty will be greatly jeopardized and there is good reason to apprehend and believe that they may be sold into slavery or involuntary servitude.
and it further appearing that none of the said persons of color can read and write and are almost entirely ignorant of the laws of the state of california as well as those of the state of texas and of their rights and that the said robert smith from his past relations to them as members of his family does possess and exercise over them an undue influence in respect to the matter of their said removal insofar that they have been in duress and not in possession and exercise of their free will so as to give a binding consent to any engagement or arrangement with him.

subsequently the political conflict over slavery and the compromise of 1850 destroyed the whig party in the south.
as the only nationwide party the democrats won easily over the whigs in 1852 and with the opposition split between the republican and american parties triumphed in 1856 as well.
however a new region based party system appeared by 1860 and persisted for the next seventy years with democrats dominant in the south and republicans usually controlling the northeast midwest and far west.
chief justice roger b taney of maryland a slave owner himself wrote the most influential opinion.
he declared that negroes whether enslaved or free could not be citizens of the united states and that scott therefore had no right to sue in federal court.
that argument was controversial given that free blacks were citizens in many states and therefore had access to the federal courts.
taney then made two even more controversial claims.
first he endorsed john c calhouns argument that the fifth amendment which prohibited taking of property without due process of law meant that congress could not prevent southern citizens from moving their slave property into the territories and owning it there.
consequently the chief justice concluded the provisions of the northwest ordinance and the missouri compromise that prohibited slavery had never been constitutional.
second taney declared that congress could not give to territorial governments any powers that it did not possess such as the authority to prohibit slavery.
taney thereby endorsed calhouns interpretation of popular sovereignty only when settlers wrote a constitution and requested statehood could they prohibit slavery.
in a single stroke taney had declared the republican proposals to restrict the expansion of slavery through legislation to be unconstitutional.
the republicans could never accept the legitimacy of taneys constitutional arguments which indeed had significant flaws.
led by senator seward of new york they accused the chief justice and president buchanan of participating in the slave power conspiracy.
buchanan then added fuel to the raging constitutional fire.
ignoring reports that antislavery residents held a clear majority in kansas he refused to allow a popular vote on the proslavery lecompton constitution and in 1858 strongly urged congress to admit kansas as a slave state.
angered by buchanans machinations stephen douglas the most influential democratic senator and architect of the kansas nebraska act broke with the president and persuaded congress to deny statehood to kansas.
kansas would enter the union as a free state in 1861.
still determined to aid the south buchanan resumed negotiations to buy cuba in december 1858.

chapter 13 expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 abraham lincoln and the republican triumph 1858 1860 as the democratic party split along sectional lines the republicans gained support in the north and midwest.
abraham lincoln of illinois emerged as the only republican leader whose policies and temperament might have saved the union.
however few southerners trusted lincoln and his presidential candidacy revived secessionist agitation.
lincolns political career the middle class world of storekeepers lawyers and entrepreneurs in the small towns of the ohio river valley shaped lincolns early career.
he came from a hardscrabble yeoman farm family that was continually on the move from kentucky where lincoln was born in 1809 to indiana and then to illinois.
in 1831 lincoln rejected his fathers life as a subsistence farmer and became a store clerk in new salem illinois.
socially ambitious lincoln won entry to the middle class by mastering its culture he joined the new salem debating society read shakespeare and studied law.
admitted to the bar in 1837 lincoln moved to springfield the new state capital.
there he met mary todd the cultured daughter of a kentucky banker they married in 1842.
her tastes were aristocratic his were humble.
she was volatile he was easygoing but suffered bouts of depression that tried her patience and tested his character.
an ambitious politician lincolns ambition was a little engine that knew no rest a close associate remarked and it propelled him into politics.
an admirer of henry clay lincoln joined the whig party and won election to four terms in the illinois legislature where he promoted education banks canals and railroads.
he became a dexterous party politician adept in the use of patronage and the passage of legislation.
in 1846 the rising lawyer politician won election to a congress that was bitterly divided over the wilmot proviso.
lincoln believed that human bondage was unjust but doubted that the federal government had the constitutional authority to tamper with slavery.
with respect to the mexican war he took a middle ground by voting for military appropriations but also for the wilmot provisos ban on slavery in any acquired territories.
lincoln also introduced legislation that abraham lincoln 1859 lincoln was not a handsome man and he photographed poorly.
his campaign managers had this photo and many others retouched to soften lincolns features.
however no photograph no matter how realistic captured lincolns complex personality and wit or the intensity of his spirit and intellect.

would require the gradual and thus compensated emancipation of slaves in the district of columbia.
to avoid future racial strife he favored the colonization of freed blacks in africa or south america.
both abolitionists and proslavery activists heaped scorn on lincolns middle of the road policies and he lost his bid for reelection.
dismayed by the rancor of ideological debate he withdrew from politics and prospered as a lawyer by representing railroads and manufacturers.
lincoln returned to the political fray because of the kansas nebraska act.
shocked by the acts repeal of the missouri compromise and senator douglass advocacy of popular sovereignty lincoln reaffirmed his opposition to slavery in the territories.
he now likened slavery to a cancer that had to be cut out if the nations republican ideals and moral principles were to endure.
the lincoln douglas debates abandoning the whigs lincoln quickly emerged as the leading republican in illinois and in 1858 he ran for the u s senate seat held by douglas.
lincoln pointed out that part 5 creating and preserving a continental nation 1844 1877 the proslavery supreme court might soon declare that the constitution does not permit a state to exclude slavery just as it had decided in dred scott that neither congress nor the territorial legislature could ban slavery in a territory.
in that event he warned we shall awake to the reality.
that the supreme court has made illinois a slave state this prospect informed lincolns famous house divided speech.
quoting the biblical adage a house divided against itself cannot stand he predicted that american society cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.
it will become all one thing or all the other the senate race in illinois attracted national interest because of douglass prominence and lincolns reputation as a formidable speaker.
during a series of seven debates douglas declared his support for white supremacy this government was made by our fathers by white men for the benefit of white men he said attacking lincoln for supporting negro equality lincoln parried douglass racist attacks by arguing that free blacks should have equal economic opportunities but not understand equal political rights.
taking the points of view offensive he asked how douglas what was lincolns position on slavery and people could accept the dred scott of african descent during decision which protected slave the 1840s and 1850s.
property in the territories yet advocate popular sovereignty which allowed settlers to exclude slavery.
douglas responded with the so called freeport doctrine that a territorys residents could exclude slavery by not adopting laws to protect it.
that position pleased neither proslavery nor antislavery advocates.
nonetheless when democrats won a narrow majority in the state legislature they reelected douglas to the u s senate.
the union under siege the debates with douglas gave lincoln a national reputation and in the election of 1858 the republican party won control of the u s house of representatives.
the rise of radicalism shaken by the republicans advance southern democrats divided again into moderates and fire eaters.
the moderates who included senator jefferson davis of mississippi strongly defended southern rights and demanded ironclad political or constitutional protections for slavery.
the fire eaters men such as robert barnwell rhett of south carolina and william lowndes yancey of alabama repudiated the union and actively promoted secession.
radical antislavery northerners likewise took a strong stance.
senator seward of new york declared that freedom and slavery were locked in an irrepressible conflict and ruthless abolitionist john brown who had perpetrated the pottawatomie massacre showed what that might mean.
in october 1859 brown led eighteen heavily armed black and white men in a raid on the federal arsenal at harpers ferry virginia.
brown hoped to arm slaves with the arsenals weapons and mount a major rebellion to end slavery.
republican leaders condemned browns unsuccessful raid but democrats called his plot a natural logical inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of the republican party when the state of virginia sentenced brown to be hanged transcendentalist reformers henry david thoreau and ralph waldo emerson chapter 11 proclaimed him a saint awaiting his martyrdom the slaveholding states looked to the future with terror.
the aim of the present black republican organization is the destruction of the social system of the southern states warned one newspaper.
once republicans came to power another cautioned they would create insurrection and servile war in the south they would put the torch to our dwellings and the knife to our throats nor could the south count any longer on the democratic party to protect its interests.
at the partys convention in april 1860 northern democrats rejected jefferson daviss proposal to protect slavery in the territories and delegates from eight southern states quit the meeting.
at a second democratic convention northern and midwestern delegates nominated stephen douglas for president meeting separately southern democrats nominated the sitting vice president john c breckinridge of kentucky.
the election of 1860 with the democrats divided the republicans sensed victory.
they courted white voters with a free soil platform that opposed both slavery and racial equality missouri for white men and white men for missouri declared that states republican platform.
the national republican convention chose lincoln as its presidential candidate because he was more moderate on slavery than the best known republicans senators william seward of new york and salmon chase of ohio.
lincoln also conveyed a compelling egalitarian image that appealed to smallholding farmers wage earners and midwestern voters.
the republican strategy worked.
although lincoln received less than 1 percent of the popular vote in the south and only 40 percent of the national poll he won every northern and western state except new jersey giving him 180 of 303 electoral votes and an absolute chapter 13 expansion war and sectional crisis 1844 1860 lincoln on home base beginning in the 1820s the language and imagery of sports penetrated politics cutting across the lines of class and party.

summary in this chapter we examined four related themes the ideology of manifest destiny and the westward movement of americans in the 1840s the impact of american traders and settlers on the indian peoples of the great plains and california the causes and consequences of the mexican war 1846 1848 and the disintegration of the second party system during the 1850s.
c h a p t e r we saw that the determination of presidents john tyler and james polk to add territory and slave states to the union pushed the united states into the mexican war and into a new debate over the expansion of slavery.
to resolve the resulting crisis henry clay daniel webster and stephen douglas devised the compromise of 1850.
their efforts were in vain antislavery northerners defied the fugitive slave act and expansionistminded southerners sought new slave states in the caribbean.
ideology the pursuit of absolutes replaced politics the art of compromise as the ruling principle of american political life.
the second party system rapidly disintegrated.
the whig party vanished and two issue oriented parties the nativist american party and the antislavery republican party competed for its members.
as the republicans gained strength the democratic party splintered into sectional factions over bleeding kansas and other slavery related issues.
the stage was set for lincolns victory in the climactic election of 1860.

to southern whites the republican victory in 1860 presented an immediate danger to the slave owning republic that had existed since 1776.
o ur struggle is for inherited rights declared one southern leader.
southerners did not believe lincoln when he promised not directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists soon a southern senator warned cohorts of federal officeholders abolitionists may be sent into our midst to encourage slave revolts and even worse racial mixture.
by racial mixture white southerners meant sexual relations between black men and white women given that white masters had already fathered untold thousands of children by their enslaved black women.
better far better.
to endure all horrors of civil war insisted a confederate recruit than to see the dusky sons of ham leading the fair daughters of the south to the altar to preserve black subordination and white supremacy radical southerners chose the dangerous enterprise of secession.
lincoln and the north would not let them go in peace.
living in a world still ruled by monarchies northern leaders believed that the collapse of the american union might forever destroy the possibility of democratic republican governments.
we cannot escape history lincoln eloquently declared.
we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth and so came the conflict.
called the war between the states by southerners and the war of the rebellion by northerners the struggle finally resolved the great issues of the union and slavery.
the costs were terrible more american lives lost than the combined total for all the nations other wars and a century long legacy of bitterness between the triumphant north and the vanquished white south.
fields of death fought with mass armies and new weapons the civil war took a huge toll in human lives as evidenced by this grisly photograph of a small section of the battlefield at antietam maryland.

the secession crisis the union collapsed first in south carolina the home of john c calhoun nullification and southern rights.
robert barnwell rhett and other fire eaters had demanded secession since the compromise of 1850 and their goal was now within reach.
our enemies are about to take possession of the government warned one south carolinian.
frightened by that prospect a state convention voted unanimously on december 20 1860 to dissolve the union now subsisting between south carolina and other states the lower south secedes fire eaters elsewhere in the deep south quickly called similar conventions and organized mobs to attack local union supporters.

adopting a provisional constitution the delegates named mississippian jefferson davis a former u s senator and secretary of war as the confederacys president and georgia congressman alexander stephens as vice president.
secessionist fervor was less intense in the four states of the middle south virginia north carolina tennessee and arkansas where there were fewer slaves.
white opinion was especially divided in the four border slave states maryland delaware kentucky and missouri where yeomen farmers held greater political power and from bitter experience as well as the writings of journalist hilton helper knew that all too often the slaveholders.

meanwhile the union government floundered.
president buchanan declared secession illegal but in line with his states rights outlook claimed that the federal government lacked authority to restore the union by force.
buchanans timidity prompted south carolinas new government to demand the surrender of fort sumter a federal garrison in charleston harbor and to cut off its supplies.
the president again backed down refusing to use the navy to supply the fort.
the crittenden compromise instead the outgoing president urged congress to find a compromise.
the plan proposed by senator john j crittenden of kentucky received the most support.
the crittenden compromise had two parts.
the first which congress approved called for a constitutional amendment to protect slavery from federal interference in any state where it already existed.
crittendens second provision called for the westward extension of the missouri compromise line 3630 north latitude to the california border.
the provision would ban slavery north of the line and allow bound labor to the south including any territories hereafter acquired raising the prospect of expansion into cuba or central america.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 black social thought uplift race equality and rebellion beginning in the 1790s leading african americans in the north advocated a strategy of social uplift encouraging free blacks to elevate themselves through education temperance and hard work.
by securing respectability they argued blacks could become the social equals of whites.
to promote that goal black leaders men such as james forten a philadelphia sailmaker prince hall a boston barber and ministers hosea easton and richard allen chapter 8 founded an array of churches schools and self help associations.
capping this effort john russwurm and samuel d cornish of new york published the first african american newspaper freedoms journal in 1827.
the black quest for respectability elicited a violent response in boston pittsburgh and other northern cities among whites who refused to accept african americans as change over time their social equals.

walker was a free black from north carolina who had moved to boston where he sold secondhand clothes and copies of freedoms journal.
a self educated author walker ridiculed the religious pretensions of slaveholders justified slave rebellion and in biblical language warned of a slave revolt if justice were delayed.
we must and shall be free he told white americans.
and woe woe will be it to you if we have to obtain our freedom by fighting.
your destruction is at hand and will be speedily consummated unless you repent walkers pamphlet quickly went through three printings and carried by black merchant seamen reached free african americans in the south.
in 1830 walker and other african american activists called a national convention in philadelphia.
the delegates refused to endorse either walkers radical call for a slave revolt or the traditional program of uplift for free blacks.
instead this new generation of activists demanded freedom and race equality for those of african descent.

as a child turner had taught himself to read and had hoped for emancipation but one new master forced him into the fields and another separated him from his wife.
becoming deeply spiritual turner had a religious vision in which the spirit explained that christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and that i should take it on and fight against the serpent for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first taking an eclipse of the sun in august 1831 as an omen turner and a handful of relatives and friends rose in rebellion and killed at least 55 white men women and children.
turner hoped that hundreds of slaves would rally to his cause but he mustered only 60 men.
the white militia quickly dispersed his poorly armed force and took their revenge.

was not christ crucified he asked.
deeply shaken by turners rebellion the virginia assembly debated a law providing for gradual emancipation and colonization abroad.
when the bill failed by a vote of 73 to 58 the possibility that southern planters would voluntarily end slavery was gone forever.
instead the southern states toughened their slave codes limited black movement and prohibited anyone from teaching slaves to read.

the women raised money for the liberator and carried the movement to the farm villages and small towns of the midwest where they distributed abolitionist literature and collected thousands of signatures on antislavery petitions.
abolitionist leaders launched a three pronged plan of attack.
to win the support of religious americans weld published the bible against slavery 1837 which used passages from christianitys holiest book to discredit slavery.
two years later weld teamed up with the grimk sisters angelina whom he married and sarah.
the grimks had left their fathers plantation in south carolina converted to quakerism and taken up the abolitionist cause in philadelphia.
in american slavery as it is testimony of a thousand witnesses 1839 weld and the grimks addressed a simple question what is the actual condition of the slaves in the united states using reports from southern newspapers and firsthand testimony they presented incriminating evidence of the inherent violence of slavery.
angelina grimk told of a treadmill that south carolina slave owners used for punishment one poor girl who was sent there to be flogged and who was accordingly stripped naked and whipped showed me the deep gashes on her back i might have laid my whole finger in them large pieces of flesh had actually been cut out by the torturing lash filled with such images of pain and suffering the book sold more than 100 000 copies in a single year.
the american anti slavery society to spread their message the abolitionists turned to mass communication.
using new steam powered presses to print a million pamphlets the american anti slavery society carried out a great postal campaign in 1835 flooding the nation including the south with its literature.
the abolitionists second tactic was to aid fugitive slaves.
they provided lodging and jobs for escaped blacks in free states and created the underground railroad an informal network of whites and free blacks in richmond charleston and other southern towns that assisted fugitives map 11 3.
in baltimore a free african american sailor loaned his identification papers to future abolitionist frederick douglass who used them to escape to new york.
harriet tubman and other runaways risked re enslavement or death by returning repeatedly to the south to help others escape.
i should fight for.
liberty as long as my strength lasted tubman explained and when the time came for me to go the lord would let them take me thanks to the railroad about one thousand african americans reached freedom in the north each year.
there they faced an uncertain future because most whites continued to reject civic or social equality for african americans.
voters in six northern and midwestern states adopted constitutional amendments that denied or limited the franchise for free blacks.
we want no masters declared a new york artisan and least of all no negro masters moreover the fugitive slave law 1793 allowed owners and their hired slave catchers to seize suspected runaways and return them to bondage.
to thwart these efforts white abolitionists and free blacks formed mobs that attacked slave catchers released their captives and often spirited them off to british ruled canada which refused to extradite fugitive slaves.
chapter 11 religion and reform 1800 1860 the underground railroad helped runaway slaves to leave the south and find refuge either in canada or in remote northern towns where professional slave catchers rarely ventured.

they demanded the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia an end to the interstate slave trade and a ban on admission of new slave states.
thousands of deeply religious farmers and smalltown proprietors supported these efforts.
the number of local abolitionist societies grew from two hundred in 1835 to two thousand by 1840 with nearly 200 000 members including many transcendentalists.

underlining the national reach of slavery northern merchants and textile manufacturers supported the southern planters who supplied them with cotton as did hog farmers in ohio indiana and illinois and pork packers in cincinnati and chicago who profited from lucrative sales to slave plantations.
finally whites almost universally opposed amalgamation the racial mixing and intermarriage that garrison seemed to support by holding meetings of blacks and whites of both sexes.
racial fears and hatreds led to violent mob actions.
white workers in northern towns laid waste to taverns and brothels where blacks and whites mixed and they vandalized respectable african american churches temperance halls and orphanages.
in 1833 a mob of 1 500 new yorkers stormed a church in search of garrison and arthur tappan.
another white mob swept through philadelphias african american neighborhoods clubbing and stoning residents and destroying homes and churches.
in 1835 gentlemen of property and standing lawyers merchants and bankers broke up an abolitionist convention in utica new chapter 11 york.
two years later a mob in alton illinois shot and killed elijah p lovejoy editor of the abolitionist alton observer.
by pressing for emancipation and equality the abolitionists had revealed the extent of racial prejudice and had heightened race consciousness as both whites and blacks identified across class lines with members of their own race.
racial solidarity was especially strong in the south where whites banned abolitionists.
the georgia legislature offered a 5 000 reward for kidnapping garrison and bringing him to the south to be tried or lynched for inciting rebellion.
in nashville vigilantes whipped a northern college student for distributing abolitionist pamphlets in charleston a mob attacked the post office and destroyed sacks of abolitionist mail.
after religion and reform 1800 1860 1835 southern postmasters simply refused to deliver mail suspected to be of abolitionist origin.
politicians joined the fray.
president andrew jackson a longtime slave owner asked congress in 1835 to restrict the use of the mails by abolitionist groups.
congress refused but in 1836 the house of representatives adopted the so called gag rule.
under this informal agreement which remained in force until 1844 the house automatically tabled antislavery petitions keeping the explosive issue of slavery off the congressional stage.
internal divisions assailed by racists from the outside evangelical abolitionists fought among themselves over gender issues.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 opposed an activist role for women but garrison had broadened his reform agenda to include pacifism the abolition of prisons and womens rights our object is universal emancipation to redeem women as well as men from a servile to an equal condition in 1840 garrisons demand that the american anti slavery society support womens rights split the abolitionist movement.
abby kelley lucretia mott and elizabeth cady stanton among others remained with garrison in the american anti slavery society and assailed both the institutions that bound blacks and the customs that constrained free women.
garrisons opponents founded a new organization the american and foreign anti slavery society which turned to politics.
its members mobilized their churches to oppose racial bondage and organized the liberty party the first antislavery political party.
in 1840 the new party nominated james g birney a former alabama slave owner for president.
birney and the liberty party argued that the constitution did not recognize slavery and consequently that slaves became free when they entered areas of federal authority such as the district of columbia and the national territories.
however birney won few votes and the future of political abolitionism appeared dim.
popular violence in the north government aided suppression in the south and internal schisms stunned the abolitionist movement.
by melding the energies and ideas of evangelical protestants moral reformers and transcendentalists it had raised the banner of antislavery to new heights only to face a hostile backlash.
when we first unfurled the banner of the liberator garrison admitted it did not occur to us that nearly every religious sect and every political party would side with the oppressor the womens rights movement the prominence of women among the abolitionists reflected a broad shift in american culture.
by joining religious revivals and reform movements women entered public life.
their activism caused many gender issues sexual behavior marriage family authority to become subjects of debate.
the debate entered a new phase in 1848 when some reformers focused on womens rights and demanded complete equality with men.
origins of the womens movement dont be afraid not afraid fight satan stand up for christ dont be afraid so spoke mary walker ostram on her deathbed in 1859.
her religious convictions were as firm at the age of fifty eight as they had been in 1816 when she joined the first sunday school in utica new york.
married to a lawyer politician and childless ostram had devoted her life to evangelical presbyterianism and its program of benevolent social reform.
at her funeral minister philemon fowler celebrated ostram as a living fountain of faith an exemplar of womens sphere of influence in the world.

chapter 11 although reverend fowler heaped praise on ostram he rejected a public presence for women.
like men of the revolutionary era fowler thought women should limit their political role to that of republican mother instructing their sons in the principles of liberty and government women inhabited a separate sphere of domestic life he said and had no place in the markets of trade the scenes of politics and popular agitation the courts of justice and the halls of legislation.
home is her peculiar sphere however ostram and many other middle class women were redefining the notion of the domestic sphere by becoming active in their churches.
their spiritual activism bolstered their authority within the household and gave them new influence over many areas of family life including the timing of pregnancies.
publications such as godeys ladys book a popular monthly periodical and catharine beechers treatise on domestic economy 1841 taught women how to make their homes examples of middle class efficiency and domesticity.
women in propertied farm families were equally vigilant and carried domestic issues into the public sphere.
to protect their homes and husbands from alcoholic excess they joined the independent order of good templars a temperance group which made women full members american voices p 368.
moral reform some religious women developed a sharp consciousness of gender and became public actors.
in 1834 middle class women in new york city founded the female moral reform society and elected lydia finney the wife of revivalist charles grandison finney as its president.
the society tried to curb prostitution and to protect single women from moral corruption.
rejecting the sexual double standard its members demanded chaste behavior by men.
by 1840 the female moral reform society had blossomed into a national association with 555 chapters and 40 000 members throughout the north and midwest.
employing only women as agents the society provided moral guidance for young women who were working as factory operatives seamstresses or servants.
society members visited brothels where they sang hymns offered prayers searched for runaway girls and noted the names of clients.
they also founded homes of refuge for prostitutes and won the passage of laws in massachusetts and new york that made seduction a crime.

by 1832 she had published seven books including conversations on common things 1824 an enormously successful treatise on natural science and moral improvement.
in 1841 dix took up a new cause.
discovering that insane women were jailed alongside male criminals she persuaded massachusetts lawmakers to enlarge the state hospital to house indigent mental patients.
exhilarated by that success dix began a national movement to establish state asylums for the mentally ill by 1854 she had traveled more than 30 000 miles and had visited eighteen state penitentiaries three hundred county jails and more than five hundred almshouses and hospitals.
dixs reports and agitation prompted many states to improve their prisons and public hospitals.
both as reformers and teachers other northern women transformed public education.
from maine to wisconsin women vigorously supported the movement led by horace mann to increase elementary schooling and improve the quality of instruction.
as secretary of the massachusetts board of education from 1837 to 1848 mann lengthened the school year established teaching standards in reading writing and arithmetic and recruited well educated women as teachers.
the intellectual leader of the new women educators was catharine beecher who founded academies for young women in hartford connecticut and cincinnati ohio.
in widely read publications beecher argued that energetic and benevolent women were better qualified than men were to impart moral and intellectual instruction to the young.
by the 1850s most teachers were women both because local school boards heeded beechers arguments and because they could hire women at lower salaries than men.
as secular educators as well as moral reformers women were now part of american public life.
from black rights to womens rights as women addressed controversial issues such as moral reform and emancipation they faced censure over their public presence.
offended by this criticism which revealed their own social and legal inferiority some women sought full freedom for their sex.
american voices saving the nation from drink the temperance crusade was the most successful antebellum reform movement.
it mobilized more than a million supporters in all sections of the nation and significantly lowered the consumption of alcoholic beverages.
nonetheless like other reform efforts the antidrinking crusade divided over questions of strategy and tactics.
the following passages taken from the writings of leading temperance advocates show that some reformers favored legal regulation while others preferred persuasion and voluntary abstinence.
lyman beecher intemperance is the sin of our land a leading protestant minister and spokesman for the benevolent empire lyman beecher regarded drunkenness as a sin.
his six sermons on.
intemperance 1829 condemned the recklessness of working class drunkards and called on responsible members of the middle class to lead the way to a temperate society.
intemperance is the sin of our land and with our boundless prosperity is coming in upon us like a flood and if anything shall defeat the hopes of the world which hang upon our experiment of civil liberty it is that river of fire.
in every city and town the poor tax created chiefly by intemperance is increasing the burden on taxpaying citizens.
the frequency of going upon the town relying on public welfare has taken away the reluctance of pride and destroyed the motives to providence which the fear of poverty and suffering once supplied.
the prospect of a destitute old age or of a suffering family no longer troubles the vicious portion of our community.
they drink up their daily earnings and bless god for the poor house and begin to look upon it as of right the drunkards home.
every intemperate and idle man whom you behold tottering about the streets and steeping himself at the stores regards your houses and lands as pledged to take care of him puts his hands deep annually into your pockets.
what then is this universal natural and national remedy for intemperance.
it is the banishment of ardent spirits from the list of lawful articles of commerce by a correct and efficient public sentiment such as has turned slavery out of half our land and will yet expel it from the world.
we are not therefore to come down in wrath upon the distillers and importers and venders of ardent spirits.
none of us are enough without sin to cast the first stone.
it is the buyers who have created the demand for ardent spirits and made distillation and importation a gainful traffic.
let the temperate cease to buy and the demand for ardent spirits will fall in the market three fourths and ultimately will fail wholly.
this however cannot be done effectually so long as the traffic in ardent spirits is regarded as lawful and is patronized by men of reputation and moral worth in every part of the land.
like slavery it must be regarded as sinful impolitic and dishonorable.
that no measures will avail short of rendering ardent spirits a contraband of trade is nearly self evident.
abraham lincoln a new class of champions in baltimore in 1840 a group of reformed alcoholics formed the washington temperance society which turned the antidrinking movement in a new direction.
by talking publicly about their personal experiences of alcoholic decline and spiritual recovery they inspired thousands to sign the pledge of total abstinence.
its philosophy exists today in the organization alcoholics anonymous.
in 1842 lincoln an ambitious lawyer and illinois legislator who did not drink praised such moral suasion in an address to the washingtonians of springfield illinois.
although the temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty years it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a degree of success hitherto unparalleled.
the list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties of hundreds and of thousands.
the warfare heretofore waged against the demon intemperance has somehow or other been erroneous.
its champions for the most part have been preachers such as beecher lawyers and hired agents.
between these and the mass of mankind there is a want of approachability.
but when one who has long been known as a victim of intemperance bursts the fetters that have bound him and appears before his neighbors clothed and in his right mind.
to tell of the miseries once endured now to be endured no more.
there is a logic and an eloquence in it that few with human feelings can resist.
in my judgment it is to the battles of this new class of champions that our late success is greatly perhaps chiefly owing.
previously too much denunciation against dram sellers and dram drinkers was indulged in.
this i think was both impolitic and unjust.
when the dramseller and drinker were incessantly condemned.
as moral pestilences.
they were slow to.
join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against themselves.
by the washingtonians this system of consigning the habitual drunkard to hopeless ruin is repudiated.
they teach hope to all despair to none.
as applying to their cause they deny the doctrine of unpardonable sin.
if the relative grandeur of revolutions shall be estimated by the great amount of human misery they alleviate and the small amount they inflict then indeed will this be the grandest the world shall ever have seen.
of our political revolution of 76 we are all justly proud.
it has given us a degree of political freedom far exceeding that of any other nation of the earth.
but with all these glorious results past present and to come this freedom had its evils too.
it was abused by drunken husbands and thereby breathed forth famine swam in blood and rode in fire and long long after the orphans cry and the widows wail continued to break the sad silence that ensued.
these were the price the inevitable price paid for the blessings it brought.
turn now to the temperance revolution.
in it we shall find a stronger bondage broken a viler slavery manumitted a greater tyrant deposed in it more of want supplied more disease healed more sorrow assuaged.
by it no orphans starving no widows weeping.
glorious consummation.
hail fall of fury.
reign of reason all hail.
american temperance magazine you shall not sell in 1851 the maine legislature passed a statute prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages in the state.
the maine supreme court upheld the statute arguing that the legislature had the right to regulate by law the sale of any article the use of which would be detrimental of the morals of the people subsequently the american temperance magazine became a strong advocate of legal prohibition and by 1856 had won passage of maine laws in twelve other states chapter 9.
this is a utilitarian age.
the speculative has in all things yielded to the practical.
words are mere noise unless they are things and result in action.
in this sense moral suasion is moral balderdash.
words my lord words.
are a delusion.
the drunkards mental and physical condition pronounces them an absurdity.
he is ever in one or other extreme under the excitement of drink or in a state of morbid collapse.
reason with a man when all reason has fled and it is doubtful whether he or you is the greater fool.
moral suasion.
place this man we have been describing out of the reach of temptation.
he will have time to ponder.
his mind and frame recover their native vigor.
the publichouse does not beset his path.
thus and thus only will reformation and temperance be secured.
and how is this accomplished.
never except through the instrumentality of the law.
if it were possible to reason the drunkard into sobriety it would not be possible to make the rumseller forego his filthy gains.
try your moral suasion on him.
the only logic he will comprehend is some such ordinance as this coming to him in the shape and with the voice of law you shall not sell.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 abolitionist women women were central to the antislavery movement because they understood the special horrors of slavery for women.
in her autobiography incidents in the life of a slave girl black abolitionist harriet jacobs described forced sexual intercourse with her white owner.
i cannot tell how much i suffered in the presence of these wrongs she wrote.
according to jacobs and other enslaved women such sexual assaults incited additional cruelty by their owners wives who were enraged by their husbands promiscuity.
in her best selling novel uncle toms cabin 1852 harriet beecher stowe pinpointed the sexual abuse of women as a profound moral failing of the slave regime.
as garrisonian women attacked slavery they frequently violated social taboos by speaking to mixed audiences of men and women.
maria w stewart an african american spoke to mixed crowds in boston in the early 1830s.
as abolitionism blossomed scores of white women delivered lectures condemning slavery and thousands more made home visitations to win converts to their cause map 11 4.
when congregationalist clergymen in new england assailed angelina and sarah grimk for such activism in a pastoral letter in 1837 sarah grimk turned to the bible for justification the lord jesus defines the duties of his followers in his sermon on the mount.
without any reference to sex or condition she replied men and women were created equal both are moral and accountable beings and whatever is right for man to do is right for woman in a pamphlet debate with catharine beecher who believed that women should exercise authority primarily as wives mothers and schoolteachers angelina grimk pushed the argument beyond religion by invoking enlightenment principles to claim equal civic rights it is a womans right to have a voice in all the laws and regulations by which she is governed whether in church or state.
the present arrangements of society on these points are a violation of human rights a rank usurpation of power a violent seizure and confiscation of what is sacredly and inalienably hers.

women accounted for two thirds of the 67 000 signatures on the petitions submitted in 1837 1838 a fact that suggests not only the influence of women in the antislavery movement but also the extent of female organizations and social networks.
lawmakers eager to avoid sectional conflict devised an informal agreement the gag rule to table the petitions without discussion.

seneca falls and beyond during the 1840s womens rights activists devised a pragmatic program of reform.
unlike radical utopians they did not challenge the institution of marriage or the conventional division of labor within the family.
instead they tried to strengthen the legal rights of married women by seeking legislation that permitted them to own property america compared p 372.

then women activists in new york won a comprehensive statute that became the model for fourteen other states.
the new york statute of 1848 gave women full legal control over the property they brought to a marriage.
also in 1848 elizabeth cady stanton and lucretia mott organized a gathering of womens rights activists in the small new york town of seneca falls.
seventy women and thirty men attended the seneca falls convention which issued a rousing manifesto extending to women the egalitarian republican ideology of the declaration of independence.
all men and women are created equal the declaration of sentiments declared yet the history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman and the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her to persuade americans to right this long standing wrong the activists resolved to employ agents circulate tracts petition the state and national legislatures and endeavor to enlist the pulpit and the press on our behalf by staking out claims for equality for women in public life the seneca falls reformers repudiated both the natural inferiority of women and the ideology of separate spheres.
most men dismissed the seneca falls declaration as nonsense and many women also rejected the activists and their message.

in 1850 delegates to the first national womens rights convention in worcester massachusetts hammered out a program of action.
the women called on churches to eliminate notions of female inferiority in their theology.
addressing state legislatures they proposed laws to allow married women to institute lawsuits testify in court and assume custody of their children in the event of divorce or a husbands death.
finally they began a concerted campaign to win the vote for women.

imprisoned for their activism they dispatched a letter to the second womans rights convention which met in worcester massachusetts in 1851.
when their letter was read to the convention ernestine potowsky rose 1810 1892 offered the following response which indicated the different perspective and political strategy of the american womens movement.

the assembly kept silence in regard to the right of one half of humanity.
no mention was made of the right of woman in a constitution framed in the name of liberty equality and fraternity.
however the right of woman has been recognized by the laborers and they have consecrated that right by the election of those who had claimed it in vain for both sexes.

those experiences anthony reflected taught her the great evil of womans utter dependence on man joining the chapter 11 womens rights movement she worked closely with elizabeth cady stanton.
anthony created an activist network of political captains all women who relentlessly lobbied state legislatures.
in 1860 her efforts secured a new york law granting women the right to control their own wages which fathers or husbands had previously managed to own property acquired by trade business labors or services and if widowed to assume sole guardianship of their children.
genuine individualism for women the dream of transcendentalist margaret fuller had advanced a tiny step closer to reality.
in such small and much larger ways the midcentury reform movements had altered the character of american culture.
summary in this chapter we examined four major cultural movements of the mid nineteenth century transcendentalist reform communalism abolitionism and womens rights as well as the new popular culture in new york city.
our discussion of the transcendentalists highlighted the influence of ralph waldo emerson chapter review on the great literary figures of the era and linked transcendentalism to the rise of individualism and the character of middle class american culture.
our analysis of communal experiments probed their members efforts to devise new rules for sexual behavior gender relationships and property ownership.
we saw that successful communal experiments such as mormonism required a charismatic leader or a religious foundation and endured if they developed strong even authoritarian institutions.
we also traced the personal and ideological factors that linked the abolitionist and womens rights movements.
lucretia mott elizabeth cady stanton and the grimk sisters began as antislavery advocates but denied access to lecture platforms by male abolitionists and conservative clergy they became staunch advocates of womens rights.
this transition was a logical one both enslaved blacks and married women were owned by men either as property or as their legal dependents.
consequently the efforts to abolish the legal prerogatives of husbands were as controversial as those to end the legal property rights of slave owners.
as reformers took aim at such deeply rooted institutions and customs many americans feared that their activism would not perfect society but destroy it.

in 1790 its western boundary ran through the middle of georgia by 1830 it stretched through western louisiana by 1860 the slave frontier extended far into texas map 12 1.
that advance of 900 miles more than doubled the geographical area cultivated by slave labor and increased the number of slave states from eight in 1800 to fifteen by 1850.
the federal government played a key role in this expansion.
it acquired louisiana from the french in 1803 welcomed the slave states of mississippi and alabama into the union in 1817 and 1819 removed native americans from the southeastern states in the 1830s and annexed texas and mexican lands in the 1840s.

in 1790 most slaves lived and worked on chesapeake tobacco and carolina rice and indigo plantations.
by 1830 those areas were still heavily populated by black families but hundreds of thousands of slaves also labored on the cotton and sugar lands of the lower mississippi valley and on cotton plantations in georgia and northern florida.
three decades later the majority of blacks lived and worked along the mississippi river and in an arc of fertile cotton lands the black belt sweeping from mississippi through south carolina.
s part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 was growing rapidly from natural increase an average of 27 percent a decade by the 1810s and creating a surplus of enslaved workers on many plantations.
the result was a growing domestic trade in slaves.
between 1818 and 1829 planters in just one maryland tobaccogrowing county frederick sold at least 952 slaves to traders or cotton planters.
plantation owners in virginia disposed of 75 000 slaves during the 1810s and again duridentify causes ing the 1820s.

in virginia alone then slave owners ripped 440 000 african americans from communities where their families had lived for three or four generations.
by 1860 the mania for buying negroes from the upper south had resulted in a massive transplantation of more than 1 million slaves figure 12 2.
a majority of african americans now lived and worked in the deep south the lands that stretched from georgia to texas.
this african american migration took two forms transfer and sale.
looking for new opportunities thousands of chesapeake and carolina planters men like james lide sold their existing plantations and moved their slaves to the southwest.
many other planters gave slaves to sons and daughters who moved west.
such transfers accounted for about 40 percent of the african american migrants.
the rest about 60 percent of the 1 million migrants were sold south through traders.
just as the atlantic slave trade enriched english merchants in the eighteenth century so the domestic market brought wealth to american traders between 1800 and 1860.
one set of routes ran to the atlantic coast and sent thousands of slaves to sugar plantations in louisiana the former french territory that entered the union in 1812.
as sugar output soared slave traders scoured the countryside near the port cities of baltimore alexandria richmond and charleston searching as one of them put it for likely young men such as i think would suit the new orleans market each year hundreds of muscular young slaves passed through auction houses in the port cities bound for the massive trade mart in new orleans.
because this coastal trade in laborers was highly visible it elicited widespread condemnation by northern abolitionists.
sugar was a killer crop and louisiana like the eighteenth century west indies soon had a welldeserved reputation among african americans as a place of slaughter hundreds died each year from disease overwork and brutal treatment.
maryland farmer john anthony munnikhuysen refused to allow his daughter priscilla to marry a louisiana sugar planter declaring mit has never been used to see negroes flayed alive and it would kill her the inland system that fed slaves to the cotton south was less visible than the coastal trade but more extensive.
professional slave traders went from one rural village to another buying young and likely negroes the traders marched their purchases in coffles columns of slaves bound to one another to alabama mississippi and missouri in the 1830s and to arkansas and texas in the 1850s.

equally important it sustained the wealth of slave owners in the upper south.

the world of southern whites american slavery took root in the early eighteenth century on the tobacco plantations of the chesapeake and in the rice fields of the carolina low country.
however it grew to maturity during the first half of the nineteenth century on the cotton fields and sugar plantations of the mississippi valley.
by then a small elite of extraordinarily wealthy planter families stood at the top of southern society.
these families about three thousand in number each owned more than one redcliffe plantation in 1857 james henry hammond began construction of this house on a 400 acre site in aiken county south carolina.
it originally had a double decked porch in the greek revival style which gave it an even more imposing presence.
fifty enslaved african americans worked at redcliffe and nearly three hundred more on hammonds other properties providing the wealth that allowed his family to live in comfort.
hammond lived at redcliffe until he died in 1864 at the age of fifty seven his health undermined by his struggles with confederate leaders over wartime policies and by mercury poisoning from the laxatives he had taken for nearly forty years.

other white southerners backcountry yeomen farmers and cotton planting tenants in particular occupied some of the lowest rungs of the nations social order.
the expansion of southern slavery like the flowering of northern capitalism increased inequalities of wealth and status.
the dual cultures of the planter elite the westward movement split the plantation elite into two distinct groups the traditional aristocrats of the old south whose families had gained their wealth from tobacco and rice and the upstart capitalistinclined planters of the cotton states.
the traditional southern gentry the old south gentry dominated the tidewater region of the chesapeake and the low country of south carolina and georgia.
during the eighteenth century these planters built impressive mansions and adopted the manners and values of the english landed gentry chapter 3.
their aristocratic oriented culture survived the revolution of 1776 and soon took on a republican glaze american voices the debate over free and slave labor as the abolitionist assault on slavery mounted its rhetoric shaped the debate over the emergent system of wage labor in the northern states.
by the 1850s new york senator william seward starkly contrasted the political systems of the south and the north in terms of their labor systems the one resting on the basis of servile or slave labor the other on voluntary labor of freemen seward strongly favored the free labor system crediting to it the strength wealth greatness intelligence and freedom which the whole american people now enjoy as the following documents show some americans agreed with seward while others such as new york tribune editor horace greeley and south carolina senator james henry hammond who is quoted often in this chapter and whose house appears on page 383 contested his premises and conclusions.

this excerpt demonstrates the societys belief that a classbound social order could be avoided by encouraging a spirit of independence and self estimation among the poor.

such a class you must have or you would not have that other class which leads progress civilization and refinement.

for the man who lives by daily labor and scarcely lives at that and who has to put out his labor in the market and take the best he can get for it in short your whole hireling class of manual laborers and operatives as you call them are essentially slaves.
the difference between us is that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated there is no starvation no begging no want of employment among our people and not too much employment either.
yours are hired by the day not cared for and scantily compensated which may be proved in the most painful manner at any hour in any street in any of your large towns.

horace greeley public letter declining an invitation to attend an antislavery convention in cincinnati ohio june 3 1845 this letter from the editor of the new york tribune explains his broad definition of slavery.
dear sir i received weeks since your letter inviting me to be present at a general convention of opponents of human slavery.
what is slavery.
you will probably answer the legal subjection of one human being to the will and power of another but this definition appears to me inaccurate.
i understand by slavery that condition in which one human being exists mainly as a convenience for other human beings.
where the relation is one of authority social ascendency and power over subsistence on the one hand and of necessity servility and degradation on the other there in my view is slavery.
if i am less troubled concerning the slavery prevalent in charleston or new orleans it is because i see so much slavery in new york.
wherever opportunity to labor is obtained with difficulty and is so deficient that the employing class may virtually prescribe their own terms and pay the laborer only such share as they choose of the produce there is a strong tendency to slavery.

questions for analysis 1.
which of these documents argue for slave owners as benevolent paternalists and the institution of slavery as a positive good.
what other points of view are represented.
given the discussion of class and honorable independence in the mission society statement how would an episcopalian reply to hammonds critique of the northern labor system.
how can we understand hammonds treatment of sally johnson and her daughter as well as his refusal to free his and his sons children in the context of his 1858 speech and the staunton spectators editorial.
using the principles asserted in his letter how would horace greeley analyze the southern labor system as described by hammond and the staunton spectator.
why does greeley suggest that the northern system has only a strong tendency to slavery.
consider the sources above in the light of this abraham lincoln comment although volume upon volume is written to prove slavery a very good thing we never hear of the man who wishes to take the good of it by being a slave himself part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 chapter 8.
classical republican theory which had long identified political tyranny as the major threat to liberty had its roots in the societies of greece and rome where slavery was part of the natural order of society.
that variety of republicanism appealed to wealthy southerners who feared federal government interference with their slave property.
on the state level planters worried about populist politicians who would mobilize poorer whites and so they demanded that authority rest in the hands of incorruptible men of virtue indeed affluent planters cast themselves as a republican aristocracy.

hammond built a greek revival mansion with a center hall 53 feet by 20 feet its floor embellished with stylish belgian tiles and expensive brussels carpets.
once a year like a great feudal landlord hammonds neighbor recounted he gave a fete or grand dinner to all the country people rice planters remained at the apex of the plantation aristocracy.
in 1860 the fifteen proprietors of the vast plantations in all saints parish in south carolina owned 4 383 slaves nearly 300 apiece who annually grew and processed 14 million pounds of rice.
as inexpensive asian rice entered the world market in the 1820s and cut their profits the carolina rice aristocrats sold some slaves and worked the others harder sustaining their luxurious lifestyle.
the hospitality and elegance of charleston and savannah impressed savvy english traveler john silk buckingham.
buckingham likewise found polished families among long established french catholic planters in new orleans and along the mississippi river there the sugar and cotton planters live in splendid edifices and enjoy all the luxury that wealth can impart america compared p 387.
in tobacco growing regions the lives of the planter aristocracy followed a different trajectory in part because slave ownership was widely diffused.
in the 1770s about 60 percent of white families in the chesapeake region owned at least one african american.
as wealthy tobacco planters moved their estates and slaves to the cotton south middling whites who owned between five and twenty slaves came to dominate the chesapeake economy.
the descendants of the old tobacco aristocracy remained influential but increasingly as slave owning grain farmers lawyers merchants industrialists and politicians.
they hired out surplus slaves sold them south or allowed them to purchase their freedom.
the ideology and reality of benevolence the planter aristocracy flourished around the periphery of the souths booming cotton belt in virginia south carolina and louisiana but it took the lead in defending slavery.
ignoring the jeffersonian response to slavery as a misfortune or a necessary evil chapter 8 southern apologists in the 1830s argued that the institution was a positive good because it subsidized an elegant lifestyle for a white elite and provided tutelage for genetically inferior africans.
as a race the african is inferior to the white man declared alexander stephens the future vice president of the confederacy.
subordination to the white man is his normal condition apologists depicted planters and their wives as aristocratic models of disinterested benevolence who provided food and housing for their workers and cared for them in old age.
one wealthy georgian declared plantation government should be eminently patriarchal.

after a military career the duke ruled his principality from 1853 until his death in 1862.
in new orleans we were invited to a subscription ball.
only good society is invited to these balls.
the first to which we came was not very well attended but most of the ladies were very nice looking and well turned out in the french manner.
their clothing was elegant after the latest paris fashions.
they danced very well and did credit to their french dancing masters.
dancing and some music are the main branches of the education of a creole an american born white woman.
the native men are far from matching the women in elegance.
and they stayed only a short time preferring to escape to a so called quarterons ball which they find more amusing and where they do not have to stand on ceremony.
a quarteron actually an octoroon a person of one eighth african ancestry is the offspring of a mestizo mother and a white father just as the mestizo is the child of a mulatto and a white man.
the quarterons are almost completely white.
there would be no way of recognizing them by their complexion for they are often fairer than the creoles.
black hair and eyes are generally the signs of their status although some are quite blond.
the ball is attended by the free quarterons yet the deepest prejudice reigns against them on account of their colored origin the white women particularly feel or affect to feel a strong repugnance to them.
marriage between colored and white people is forbidden by the laws of the state.
yet the quarterons for their part look upon the negroes and mulattoes as inferiors and are unwilling to mix with them.
the girls therefore have no other recourse than to become the mistresses of they built churches on their plantations welcomed evangelical preachers and required their slaves to attend services.
a few encouraged african americans with spiritual gifts to serve as exhorters and deacons.
most of these planters acted from sincere christian white men.
the quarterons regard such attachment as the equivalent of marriage.
they would not think of entering upon it other than with a formal contract in which the man engages to pay a stipulated sum to the mother or father of the girl.
some of these women have inherited from their fathers and lovers and possess considerable fortunes.
their status is nevertheless always very depressed.
they must not ride in the street in coaches and their lovers can bring them to the balls in their own conveyances only after nightfall.
but many of these girls are much more carefully educated than the whites behave with more polish and more politeness and make their lovers happier than white wives their husbands.
and yet the white ladies speak of these unfortunate depressed creatures with great disdain even bitterness.
because of the depth of these prejudices many fathers send their daughters conceived after this manner to france where good education and wealth are no impediments to the attainment of a respectable place.

protestant part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 ministers in the south pointed out that the hebrews gods chosen people had owned slaves and that jesus christ had never condemned slavery.
as james henry hammond told a british abolitionist in 1845 what god ordains and christ sanctifies should surely command the respect and toleration of man however many aristocratic defenders of slavery were absentee owners or delegated authority to overseers and they rarely glimpsed the day to day brutality of their regime of forced labor.

to increase output profit seeking cotton planters began during the 1820s to use a rigorous gang labor system.
previously many planters had supervised their workers sporadically or assigned them specific tasks to complete at their own pace.
now masters with twenty or more slaves organized disciplined teams or gangs supervised by black drivers and white overseers.
they instructed the supervisors to work the gangs at a steady pace clearing and plowing land or hoeing and picking cotton.
a traveler in mississippi described two gangs returning from work cotton entrepreneurs there was much less hypocrisy and far less elegance among the entrepreneurial planters of the cotton south.
the glare of expensive luxury vanishes in the black soil regions of alabama and mississippi john silk buckingham remarked as he traveled through the cotton south.
frederick law olmsted the future architect of new yorks central park who during the mid 1850s traveled through the south for the new york times found that the plantations in mississippi mostly had but small and mean residences aristocratic paternalism vanished as well.
a mississippi planter put it plainly everything has to give way to large crops of cotton land has to be cultivated wet or dry negroes must work hot or cold angry at being sold south and pressed to hard labor many slaves grew mean and stubborn.
those who would not labor were subject to the lash.

overseers pushed workers hard because their salaries often depended on the amount of cotton they were able to make for the market a mississippi slave recalled when i wuz so tired i cudnt hardly stan i had to spin my cut of cotton befor i cud go to sleep.
we had to card spin an reel at nite cotton was a demanding crop because of its long growing season.
slaves plowed the land in march dropped seeds into the ground in early april and once the plants began to grow continually chopped away the surrounding grasses.
in between these tasks they planted the corn and peas that would provide food for them and the plantations hogs and chickens.
when the cotton bolls ripened in late august the long fourmonth picking season began.
slaves in the cotton south concluded olmsted worked much harder and more unremittingly than those in the tobacco regions.
moreover fewer of them acquired craft skills than in tobacco sugar and rice areas where slave coopers and first came led by an old driver carrying a whip forty of the largest and strongest women i ever saw together they were all in a simple uniform dress of a bluish check stuff the skirts reaching little below the knee.
they carried themselves loftily each having a hoe over the shoulder and walking with a free powerful swing.
next marched the plow hands with their mules the cavalry thirty strong mostly men but a few of them women finally a lean and vigilant white overseer on a brisk pony brought up the rear the gang labor system enhanced profits by increasing productivity.
because slaves in gangs finished tasks in thirty five minutes that took a white yeoman planter an hour to complete gang labor became ever more prevalent.
in one georgia county the percentage of blacks working in gangs doubled between 1830 and 1850.
as the price of raw cotton surged after 1846 the wealth of the planter class skyrocketed.
and no wonder nearly 2 million enslaved african americans now labored on the plantations of the cotton south and annually produced 4 million bales of the valuable fiber.
planters smallholding yeomen and tenants although the south was a slave society that is a society in which the institution of slavery affected all aspects of life most white southerners did not own slaves.
the percentage of white families who held blacks in bondage steadily decreased from 36 percent in 1830 to 31 percent in 1850 to about 25 percent a decade later.
however slave ownership varied by region.
in some cotton rich counties 40 percent of the white families owned slaves in the hill country near the appalachian mountains the proportion dropped to 10 percent.
chapter 12 the south expands slavery and society 1800 1860 and women.
these middling planters owned almost 40 percent of the enslaved laborers and produced more than 30 percent of the cotton.
often they pursued dual careers as skilled artisans or professional men.
thus some of the fifteen slaves owned by georgian samuel l moore worked in his brick factory while others labored on his farm.
dr thomas gale used the income from his medical practice to buy a mississippi plantation that annually produced 150 bales of cotton.
in alabama lawyer benjamin fitzpatrick used his legal fees to buy ten slaves.
like fitzpatrick lawyers acquired wealth by managing the affairs of the slave owning elite representing planters and merchants in suits for debt and helping smallholders and tenants register their deeds and contracts.
standing at the legal crossroads of their small towns they rose to prominence and regularly won election to public office.
less than 1 percent of the male population in 1828 lawyers made up 16 percent of the alabama legislature and an astounding 26 percent in 1849.
the inherent brutality of slavery like all systems of forced labor american racial slavery relied ultimately on physical coercion.
slave owners and overseers routinely whipped slaves who worked slowly or defied their orders.
on occasion they applied the whip with such ferocity that the slave was permanently injured or killed.

planter elites a privileged minority of 395 000 southern families owned slaves in 1860 their ranks divided into a strict hierarchy.
the top one fifth of these families owned twenty or more slaves.
this elite just 5 percent of the souths white population dominated the economy owning over 50 percent of the entire slave population of 4 million and growing 50 percent of the souths cotton crop.
the average wealth of these planters was 56 000 about 1 6 million in purchasing power today by contrast a prosperous southern yeoman or northern farmer owned property worth a mere 3 200.
substantial proprietors another fifth of the slaveowning population held title to six to twenty bondsmen smallholding planters and yeomen smallholding slave owners were much less visible than the wealthy grandees and the middling lawyer planters.
these planters held from one to five black laborers in bondage and owned a few hundred acres of land.
some smallholders were well connected young men who would rise to wealth when their fathers death blessed them with more land and slaves.
others were poor but ambitious men trying to pull themselves up by their bootstraps often encouraged by elite planters and proslavery advocates.
ours is a proslavery form of government and the proslavery element should be increased declared a georgia newspaper.
we would like to see every white man at the south the owner of a family of negroes some aspiring planters achieved modest prosperity.
a german settler reported from alabama in 1855 that nearly all his countrymen who emigrated with him were slaveholders.
they were poor on their arrival in the country but no sooner did they realize a little money than they invested it in slaves bolstered by the patriarchal ideology of the planter class yeomen farmers ruled their smallholdings with a firm hand.
the male head of the household had legal authority understand over all the dependents wives points of view children and slaves and accord by 1860 what different groups made up ing to one south carolina judge the souths increasingly the right on his property to be complex society.
how did as churlish as he pleases yeomen these groups interact.
wives had little power like women part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 in the north they lost their legal identity when they married.
to express their concerns many southern women joined churches where they usually outnumbered men by a margin of two to one.
women especially welcomed the message of spiritual equality preached in evangelical baptist and methodist churches and they hoped that the church community would hold their husbands to the same standards of christian behavior to which they conformed.
however most churches supported patriarchal rule and told female members to remain in wifely obedience whatever the actions of their husbands.
whatever their authority within the household most southern yeomen lived and died as hardscrabble farmers.
they worked alongside their slaves in the fields struggled to make ends meet as their families grew and moved regularly in search of opportunity.
thus in 1847 james buckner barry left north carolina with his new wife and two slaves to settle in bosque county texas.
there he worked part time as an indian fighter while his slaves toiled on a drought ridden farm that barely kept the family in food.
in south carolina w j simpson struggled for years as a smallholding cotton planter and then gave up.
he hired out one of his two slaves and went to work as an overseer on his fathers farm.
less fortunate smallholders fell from the privileged ranks of the slave owning classes.
selling their land and slaves to pay off debts they joined the mass of propertyless tenants who farmed the estates of wealthy landlords.
in 1860 in hancock county georgia there were 56 slave owning planters and 300 propertyless white farm laborers and factory workers in nearby hart county 25 percent of the white farmers were tenants.
across the south about 40 percent of the white population worked as tenants or farm laborers as the southern cultivator observed they had no legal right nor interest in the soil and no homes of their own poor freemen propertyless whites suffered the ill consequences of living in a slave society that accorded little respect to hardworking white laborers.

chapter 12 they hope for a better life for their children because slave owners refused to pay taxes to fund public schools.
moreover wealthy planters bid up the price of african americans depriving white laborers and tenants of easy access to the slave labor required to accumulate wealth.
finally planter dominated legislatures forced all white men whether they owned slaves or not to serve in the patrols and militias that deterred black uprisings.
the majority of white southerners frederick law olmsted concluded are poor.

their destitution is not material only it is intellectual and it is moral marking this moral destitution poor whites enjoyed the psychological satisfaction that they ranked above blacks.
as alfred iverson a u s senator from georgia 1855 1861 explained a white man walks erect in the dignity of his color and race and feels that he is a superior being with the more exalted powers and privileges than others to reinforce that sense of racial superiority planter james henry hammond told his poor white neighbors in a slave country every freeman is an aristocrat rejecting that half truth many southern whites fled planter dominated counties in the 1830s and sought farms in the appalachian hill country and beyond in western virginia kentucky tennessee the southern regions of illinois and indiana and missouri.
living as yeomen farmers they used family labor to grow foodstuffs for sustenance.
to obtain cash or store credit to buy agricultural implements cloth shoes salt and other necessities yeomen families sold their surplus crops raised hogs for market sale and when the price of cotton rose sharply grew a few bales.
their goals were modest on the family level they wanted to preserve their holdings and buy enough land to set up their children as small scale farmers.
as citizens smallholders wanted to control their local government and elect men of their own kind to public office.
however thoughtful yeomen understood that the slave based cotton economy sentenced family farmers to a subordinate place in the social order.
they could hope for a life of independence and dignity only by moving north or farther west where labor was free and hard work was respected.

by 1835 about 27 000 white americans and their 3 000 african american slaves were raising cotton and cattle in the well watered plains and hills of eastern and central texas.
they far outnumbered the 3 000 mexican residents who lived primarily near the southwestern texas towns of goliad and san antonio.
when mexico in 1835 adopted a new constitution creating a stronger central government and dissolving state legislatures the americans split into two groups.
the war party led by sam houston and recent migrants from georgia demanded independence for texas.
members of the peace party led by stephen austin negotiated with the central government in mexico city for greater political autonomy.
they believed texas could flourish within a decentralized mexican republic a federal constitutional system favored by the liberal party in mexico and advocated in the united states by jacksonian democrats.
austin won significant concessions for the texans including an exemption from a law ending slavery but in 1835 mexicos president general antonio lpez de santa anna nullified them.
santa anna wanted to impose national authority throughout mexico.
fearing central control the war party provoked a rebellion that most of the american settlers ultimately supported.

but the texans victory at san jacinto in april ended the war and secured de facto independence for the republic of texas 1836 1845.
however the annexation of texas to the united states sparked a war with mexico in 1846 and the states boundaries remained in dispute until the compromise of 1850 democratic ethos.
the alabama constitution of 1819 granted suffrage to all white men it also provided for a secret ballot rather than voice voting apportionment of legislative seats based on population and the election of county supervisors sheriffs and clerks of court.
given these democratic provisions political factions in alabama had to compete for votes.
when a whig newspaper sarcastically asked whether the states policies should be governed and controlled by the whim and caprice of the majority of the people democrats hailed the power of the common folk.
they called on farmers mechanics laboring men to repudiate whig aristocrats.
the soft handed and soft headed gentry taxation policy whatever the electioneering rhetoric most whig and democrat political candidates were men of substance.
in the early 1840s nearly 90 percent of alabamas legislators owned slaves testimony to the political power of the slave owning minority.
still relatively few lawmakers only about 10 percent were the south expands slavery and society 1800 1860 rich planters a group voters by and large distrusted.
a rich man cannot sympathize with the poor declared one candidate.
consequently the majority of elected state officials and most county officials in the cotton south came from the ranks of middle level planters and planter lawyers.
astute politicians they refrained from laying oppressive taxes on the people particularly the white majority who owned no slaves.
between 1830 and 1860 the alabama legislature obtained about 70 percent of the states revenue from taxes on slaves and land.
another 10 to 15 percent came from levies on carriages gold watches and other luxury goods and on the capital invested in banks transportation companies and manufacturing enterprises.
to win the votes of taxpaying slave owners alabama democrats advocated limited government and low taxes.
they attacked their whig opponents for favoring higher taxes and for providing government subsidies for banks canals railroads and other internal improvements.
voting against appropriations is the safe and popular side one democratic legislator declared and his colleagues agreed until the 1850s they rejected most of the bills that would have granted subsidies to transportation companies or banks.
if tax policy in alabama had a democratic thrust elsewhere in the south it did not.
in some states wealthy planters used their political muscle to exempt slave property from taxation.
or they shifted the burden to backcountry yeomen who owned low quality pasturelands by taxing farms according to acreage rather than value.
planter legislators also spared themselves the cost of building fences around their fields by enacting laws that required yeomen to fence in their livestock.
and during the 1850s wealthy legislators throughout the south used public funds to subsidize the canals and railroads in which they had invested ignoring the protests of yeoman backed legislators.
the paradox of southern prosperity even without these internal improvements the south had a strong economy.
indeed it ranked fourth in the world in 1860 with a per capita income among whites higher than that of france and germany.
as a contributor to a georgia newspaper argued in the 1850s planters and yeomen should not complain about tariffs and merchants and manufacturers because the most highly prosperous people now on earth are to be found in these very slave states such arguments tell only part of the story.
nearly all african americans 40 percent of the population lived in dire and permanent poverty.
and although the average southern white man was 80 percent richer than the average northerner in part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 1860 the southerners non slave wealth was only 60 percent of the northern average.

we want no manufactures we desire no trading no explain consequences mechanical or manufacturing classes.
as long as we have our rice our sugar our tobacco and our cotton we can command wealth to purchase all we want so wealthy southerners continued to buy land and slaves a strategy that neglected investments in the great technological innovations of the nineteenth century water and steam powered factories machine tools steel plows and crushed gravel roads that would have raised the souths productivity and wealth.
urban growth the key to prosperity in europe and the north occurred primarily in the commercial cities around the periphery of the south new orleans st louis and baltimore.
factories often staffed by slave labor appeared primarily in the chesapeake region which had a diverse agricultural economy and a surplus of bound workers.
within the cotton south wealthy planters invested in railroads primarily to grow more cotton when the western atlantic railroad reached the georgia upcountry the cotton colonel and mrs james a whiteside son charles and servants james a whiteside 1803 1861 was a tennessee lawyer politician land speculator and entrepreneur with investments in iron manufacturing banking steamboats and railroads.

cotton and agriculture remained king.
slavery also deterred europeans from migrating to the south because they feared competition from bound labor.
their absence deprived the region of skilled artisans and of hardworking laborers to drain swamps dig canals smelt iron and work on railroads.
when entrepreneurs tried to hire slaves for these dangerous tasks planters replied that a negros life is too valuable to be risked slave owners also feared that hiring out would make their slaves too independent.
as a planter told frederick law olmsted such workers had too much liberty.
and got a habit of roaming about and taking care of themselves thus despite its increasing size and booming exports the south remained an economic colony great britain and the north bought its staple crops and provided its manufactures financial services and shipping facilities.
in 1860 some 84 percent of southerners more than double the percentage in the northern states still worked in agriculture and southern factories turned out only 10 percent of the nations manufactures.
the souths fixation on an exclusive and exhausting system of cotton monoculture and slave labor filled south carolina textile entrepreneur william gregg with dark forebodings it has produced us such an abundant supply of all the luxuries and elegances of life with so little exertion on our part that we have become enervated unfitted for other and more laborious pursuits the african american world by the 1820s the cultural life of most slaves reflected both the values and customs of their west african ancestors and the language laws and religious beliefs of the souths white population.
this mix of africanand european derived cultural values persisted for decades because whites discouraged blacks from assimilating and because slaves prized their diverse african heritages.
evangelical black protestantism the emergence of black christianity illustrated the synthesis of african and european cultures.
from the 1790s to the 1840s the second great awakening swept over the south and evangelical baptist and methodist preachers converted thousands of white families and hundreds of enslaved blacks see chapter 8.
until that time african born blacks often identifiable by their the south expands slavery and society 1800 1860 ritual scars had maintained the religious practices of their homelands.
african religions and christian conversion africans carried their traditional religious practices to the united states.
some practiced islam but the majority relied on african gods and spirits.

and other superstitions brought from africa fearing for their own souls if they withheld the means of salvation from african americans jones and other zealous protestant preachers and planters set out to convert slaves.
other protestant crusaders came from the ranks of pious black men and women who had become christians in the chesapeake.
swept to the cotton south by the domestic slave trade they carried with them the evangelical message of emotional conversion ritual baptism and communal spirituality.

the domestic chapter 12 slave trade mingled blacks from many states erased regional differences and prompted the emergence of a core culture in the lower mississippi valley.
a prime example was the fate of the gullah dialect which combined words from english and a variety of african languages in an african grammatical structure.
spoken by blacks in the carolina low country well into the twentieth century gullah did not take root on the cotton plantations of alabama and mississippi.
there slaves from carolina were far outnumbered by migrants from the chesapeake who spoke black english.

white planters were not the source of this taboo cousin marriages were frequent among the 440 south carolina men and women who owned at least one hundred slaves in 1860 in part because such unions kept wealth within an extended family thinking like a historian p 398.
unlike white marriages slave unions were not legally binding.
according to a louisiana judge slaves have no legal capacity to assent to any contract.
because slaves are deprived of all civil rights nonetheless many african americans took marriage vows before christian ministers or publicly marked their union in ceremonies that included the west african custom of jumping over a broomstick together.

many american born parents chose names of british origin but they usually named sons after fathers uncles or grandfathers and daughters after grandmothers.
those transported to the cotton south often named their children for relatives left behind.
like incest rules and marriage rituals this intergenerational sharing of names evoked memories of a lost world and bolstered kin ties in the new one.

most slaves recognized that revolt would be futile they lacked the autonomous institutions such as the communes of european peasants for example needed to organize a successful rebellion.
moreover whites chapter 12 were numerous well armed and determined to maintain their position of racial superiority.
escape was equally problematic.
blacks in the upper south could flee to the north but only by leaving their family and kin.
slaves in the lower south escaped to sparsely settled regions of florida where some intermarried with the seminole indians.
elsewhere in the south escaped slaves eked out a meager existence in inhospitable marshy areas or mountain valleys.

in 1822 charleston authorities accused a free black denmark vesey of organizing a revolt to free the citys slaves.
although historians long accepted the truth of that charge recent scholarship suggests that veseys only offense was antagonizing some whites by claiming his rights as a free man and that fearful slave owners conjured up the plot.
regardless south carolina officials hanged vesey and thirty four alleged co conspirators and tore down the ame church where they allegedly plotted the uprising.

the proportion of free blacks rose from 8 percent of the african american population in 1790 to about 13 percent between 1820 and 1840 and then because of high birthrates among enslaved blacks fell to 11 percent.

summary in this chapter we focused on the theme of an expanding south.
beginning about 1800 planters carried the system of plantation slavery from its traditional home in the upper south to the mississippi valley and beyond.
powered by cotton this movement westward involved the forced migration of more than 1 million enslaved african americans and divided the planter elite into aristocratic paternalists and entrepreneurial capitalists.
we also examined the character of white and black societies in the cotton south.
after 1820 less than a third of white families owned slaves and another third were yeomen farmers propertyless tenant farmers and laborers made up the rest.
many whites joined evangelical protestant churches as did blacks who infused their churches with african modes of expression.
indeed church and family became core institutions of african american society providing strength and solace amid the tribulations of slavery.
finally we explored the initiatives taken by the free black population in both the northern and southern states to achieve individual mobility and to build community institutions.
these efforts resulted in a church based leadership class and a black abolitionist movement.

this energetic process of national expansion and purposeful state building spanned three decades and three periods often treated as distinct antebellum america the civil war and reconstruction.
in fact these decades constitute a single distinct period of american political and constitutional development that produced a consolidated national republic.
this era of state building began in the 1840s as the united states reconstruction 1865 1877 expanded to the pacific through a diplomatic deal with great britain and c h a p t e r 16 ened the conflict between free and slave states and led eventually to the conquering a continent 1854 1890 a war of conquest against mexico.

chapter 7 hammering out a federal republic 1787 1820 hamiltons system of public credit millions of dollars debts assets 75 6 million in bonds sold mostly to the wealthy creating a permanent national debt total debt 42 4 national war debt redemption of confederation securities 21 5 war debts assumed from states 11 7 owed to foreigners excise and other revenue 1 2 4 4 5 6 million gross revenue customs revenue 4 6 annual interest owed to bondholders on debt 1 0 net revenue for govt spending figure 7 1 hamiltons fiscal structure 1792 as treasury secretary alexander hamilton established a national debt by issuing government bonds and using the proceeds to redeem confederation securities and assume the war debts of the states.
to pay the annual interest due on the bonds he used the revenue from excise taxes and customs duties.
hamilton deliberately did not attempt to redeem the bonds because he wanted to tie the interests of the wealthy americans who owned them to the new national government.
british financiers.
however hamiltons redemption plan would give enormous profits to speculators who had bought up depreciated securities.
for example the massachusetts firm of burrell burrell had paid 600 for confederation notes with a face value of 2 500 it stood to reap a profit of 1 900.
such windfall gains offended a majority of americans who condemned the speculative practices of capitalist financiers.
equally controversial was hamiltons proposal to pay the burrells and other note holders with new interest bearing securities thereby creating a permanent national debt.
patrick henry condemned this plan to erect and concentrate and perpetuate a large monied interest and warned that it would prove fatal to the existence of american liberty james madison demanded that congress recompense those who originally owned confederation securities the thousands of shopkeepers farmers and soldiers who had bought or accepted them during the dark days of the war.
however it would have been difficult to trace the original owners moreover nearly half the members of the house of representatives owned confederation securities and would profit personally from hamiltons plan.
melding practicality with self interest the house rejected madisons suggestion.
hamilton then proposed that the national government further enhance public credit by assuming the war debts of the states.
this assumption plan costing 22 mil understand points lion also favored well to do cred of view itors such as abigail adams who why did hamilton believe had bought depreciated massa a national debt would chusetts government bonds with strengthen the united a face value of 2 400 for only a states and help to ensure few hundred dollars and would its survival.
reap a windfall profit.
still adams was a long term investor not a speculator like assistant secretary of the treasury william duer.
knowing hamiltons intentions in advance duer and his associates secretly bought up 4 6 million of the war bonds of southern states at bargain rates.
congressional critics condemned duers speculation.
they also pointed out that some states had already paid off their war debts in response hamilton promised to reimburse those states.
to win the votes of congressmen from virginia and maryland the treasury chief arranged another deal he agreed that the permanent national capital would be built along the potomac river where suspicious southerners could easily watch its operations.
such astute bargaining gave hamilton the votes he needed to enact his redemption and assumption plans.
part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 creating a national bank in december 1790 hamilton asked congress to charter the bank of the united states which would be jointly owned by private stockholders and the national government.
hamilton argued that the bank would provide stability to the specie starved american economy by making loans to merchants handling government funds and issuing bills of credit much as the bank of england had done in great britain.
these potential benefits persuaded congress to grant hamiltons bank a twenty year charter and to send the legislation to the president for his approval.
at this critical juncture secretary of state thomas jefferson joined with james madison to oppose hamiltons financial initiatives.
jefferson charged that hamiltons national bank was unconstitutional.
the incorporation of a bank jefferson told president washington was not a power expressly delegated to the united states by the constitution jeffersons argument rested on a strict interpretation of the constitution.
hamilton preferred a loose interpretation he told washington that article 1 section 8 empowered congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of the constitution.
agreeing with hamilton the president signed the legislation.
raising revenue through tariffs hamilton now sought revenue to pay the annual interest on the national debt.
at his insistence congress imposed excise taxes including a duty on whiskey distilled in the united states.
these taxes would yield 1 million a year.
to raise another 4 million to 5 million the treasury secretary proposed higher tariffs on foreign imports.
although hamiltons report on manufactures 1791 urged the expansion of american manufacturing he did not support high protective tariffs that would exclude foreign products.
rather he advocated moderate revenue tariffs that would pay the interest on the debt and other government expenses.
hamiltons scheme worked brilliantly.
as american trade increased customs revenue rose steadily and paid down the national debt.
controversies notwithstanding the treasury secretary had devised a strikingly modern and successful fiscal system as entrepreneur samuel blodget jr declared in 1801 the country prospered beyond all former example jeffersons agrarian vision hamilton paid a high political price for his success.
as washington began his second four year term in 1793 hamiltons financial measures had split the federalists into bitterly opposed factions.
most northern federalists supported the treasury secretary while most southern federalists joined a group headed by madison and jefferson.
by 1794 the two factions had acquired names.
hamiltonians remained federalists the allies of madison and jefferson called themselves democratic republicans or simply republicans.
thomas jefferson spoke for southern planters and western farmers.
well read in architecture natural history agricultural science and political theory jefferson embraced the optimism of the enlightenment.
he believed in the improvability of the human race and deplored the corruption and social divisions that threatened its progress.
having seen the poverty of laborers in british factories jefferson doubted that wageworkers had the economic and political independence needed to sustain a republican polity.
two visions of america thomas jefferson left and alexander hamilton confront each other in these portraits as they did in the political battles of the 1790s.
jefferson was pro french hamilton pro british.
jefferson favored farmers and artisans hamilton supported merchants and financiers.
jefferson believed in democracy and rule by legislative majorities hamilton argued for strong executives and judges.
still in the contested presidential election of 1800 hamilton who detested candidate aaron burr threw his support to jefferson and secured the presidency for his longtime political foe.

chapter 7 jefferson therefore set his democratic vision of america in a society of independent yeomen farm families.
those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of god he wrote.
the grain and meat from their homesteads would feed european nations which would manufacture and send us in exchange our clothes and other comforts jeffersons notion of an international division of labor resembled that proposed by scottish economist adam smith in the wealth of nations 1776.
to see a longer excerpt of jeffersons notes on the state of virginia along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
turmoil in europe brought jeffersons vision closer to reality.
the french revolution began in 1789 four years later the first french republic 1792 1804 went to war against a british led coalition of monarchies.
as fighting disrupted european farming wheat prices leaped from 5 to 8 shillings a bushel and remained high for twenty years bringing substantial profits to chesapeake and middle atlantic farmers.
our farmers have never experienced such prosperity remarked one observer.
simultaneously a boom in the export of raw cotton fueled by the invention of the cotton gin and the mechanization of cloth production in britain boosted the economies of georgia and south carolina.
as jefferson had hoped european markets brought prosperity to american agriculture.
the french revolution divides americans american merchants profited even more handsomely from the european war.
in 1793 president washington issued a proclamation of neutrality allowing u s citizens to trade with all belligerents.
as neutral carriers american merchant ships claimed a right to pass through britains naval blockade of french ports and american firms quickly took over the lucrative sugar trade between france and its west indian islands.
commercial earnings rose spectacularly averaging 20 million annually in the 1790s twice the value of cotton and tobacco exports.
as the american merchant fleet increased from 355 000 tons in 1790 to 1 1 million tons in 1808 northern shipbuilders and merchants provided work for thousands of shipwrights sailmakers dockhands and seamen.
carpenters masons and cabinetmakers in boston new york and philadelphia easily found work building warehouses hammering out a federal republic 1787 1820 and fashionable federal style town houses for newly affluent merchants.
ideological politics as americans profited from europes struggles they argued passionately over its ideologies.
most americans had welcomed the french revolution 1789 1799 because it abolished feudalism and established a constitutional monarchy.
the creation of the first french republic was more controversial.
many applauded the end of the monarchy and embraced the democratic ideology of the radical jacobins.
like the jacobins they formed political clubs and began to address one another as citizen however americans with strong religious beliefs condemned the new french government for closing christian churches and promoting a rational religion based on natural morality fearing social revolution at home wealthy americans condemned revolutionary leader robespierre and his followers for executing king louis xvi and three thousand aristocrats.
their fears were well founded because hamiltons economic compare and policies quickly sparked a domes contrast tic insurgency.
in 1794 western how did jeffersons idea of pennsylvania farmers mounted an agrarian republic differ the so called whiskey rebellion from the economic vision to protest hamiltons excise tax on put forward by alexander hamilton.
spirits thinking like a historian p 220.
this tax had cut demand for the corn whiskey the farmers distilled and bartered for eastern manufactures.
like the sons of liberty in 1765 and the shaysites in 1786 the whiskey rebels assailed the tax collectors who sent the farmers hardearned money to a distant government.
protesters waved banners proclaiming the french revolutionary slogan liberty equality fraternity to deter popular rebellion and uphold national authority president washington raised a militia force of 12 000 troops and dispersed the whiskey rebels.
jays treaty britains maritime strategy intensified political divisions in america.
beginning in late 1793 the british navy seized 250 american ships carrying french sugar and other goods.
hoping to protect merchant property through diplomacy washington dispatched john jay to britain.
but jay returned with a controversial treaty that ignored the american claim that free ships make free goods and accepted britains right to stop neutral ships.
the treaty also required the u s government to make full and complete compensation to british merchants for pre revolutionary war debts owed by american citizens.
in return the thinking like a historian the social life of alcohol alcohol was ubiquitous in post revolutionary america.
expensive wines and distilled spirits traveled through the channels of atlantic trade molasses was imported from the west indies and distilled into rum in american port towns and cider beer and whiskey were produced on a small scale everywhere in the countryside.
taverns were centers of social and political activity.
alcohol both mirrored and reinforced the economic and geographical divisions in american life.

during the whiskey rebellion tom the tinker pinned this notice to a tree near john reeds distillery.
reed had it published in a pittsburgh newspaper.
in taking a survey of the troops under my direction in the late expedition against that insolent exciseman john neville i find there were a great number of delinquents even among those who carry on distilling.
it will therefore be observed that i tom the tinker will not suffer any certain class or set of men to be excluded from the service of this my district when notified to attend on any expedition carried on in order to obstruct the execution of the excise law and obtain a repeal thereof.
and i do declare on my solemn word that if such delinquents do not come forth on the next alarm with equipments and give their assistance in opposing the execution and obtaining a repeal of the excise law he or they will be deemed as enemies and stand opposed to virtuous principles of republican liberty and shall receive punishment according to the nature of the offense.

part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 the whiskey rebellion 1794 this painting of washington reviewing the militia forces that would march against the whiskey rebels in western pennsylvania expresses a federalist vision of hierarchy in the form of officers on horseback and order represented by the ranks of troops.
the reality was messier militia was called up from four states but when volunteers were too few the states resorted to a draft which prompted protests and riots.
in the end the militia force of more than 12 000 men was larger than the continental army itself through much of the revolution.
upon its approach the rebellion evaporated.
twenty four men were indicted for treason two were sentenced to hang but washington pardoned them to encourage peaceful reconciliation.

the french revolution intensified conflict between planters and free blacks giving way to a massive slave uprising in 1791 that aimed to abolish slavery.
the uprising touched off years of civil war along with spanish and british invasions.
in 1798 black haitians led by toussaint louverture himself a former slave owning planter seized control of the country.
after five more years of fighting in 1803 saintdomingue became the independent nation of haiti the first black republic in the atlantic world.
the haitian revolution profoundly impacted the united states.

the rise of political parties toussaint louverture haitian revolutionary and statesman the american revolution of 1776 constituted a victory for republicanism the haitian revolt of the 1790s represented a triumph of liberty over slavery and a demand for racial equality.
after leading the black army that ousted french planters and british invaders from haiti toussaint formed a constitutional government in 1801.
a year later when french troops invaded the island he negotiated a treaty that halted haitian resistance in exchange for a pledge that the french would not reinstate slavery.
subsequently the french seized toussaint and imprisoned him in france where he died in 1803.
snark art resource ny.
philadelphia and new york while newspapers detailed the horrors of the unfolding war.
many slaveholders panicked fearful that the contagion of black liberation would undermine their own slave regimes.
u s policy toward the rebellion presented a knotty problem.
the first instinct of the washington administration was to supply aid to the islands white population.
adams strongly antislavery and no friend of france changed course aiding the rebels and strengthening commercial ties.
jefferson though sympathetic to moral arguments against slavery was himself a southern slaveholder he was moreover an ardent supporter of france.
when he became president he cut off aid to the rebels imposed a trade embargo and refused to recognize an independent haiti.
for many americans an independent nation of liberated citizen slaves was a the appearance of federalists and republicans marked a new stage in american politics what historians call the first party system.
colonial legislatures had factions based on family ethnicity or region but they did not have organized political parties.
nor did the new state and national constitutions make any provision for political societies.
indeed most americans believed that parties were dangerous because they looked out for themselves rather than serving the public interest.
but a shared understanding of the public interest collapsed in the face of sharp conflicts over hamiltons fiscal policies.
most merchants and creditors supported the federalist party as did wheat exporting slaveholders in the tidewater districts of the chesapeake.
the emerging republican coalition included southern tobacco and rice planters debt conscious western farmers germans and scots irish in the southern backcountry and subsistence farmers in the northeast.
party identity crystallized in 1796.
to prepare for the presidential election federalist and republican leaders called caucuses in congress and conventions in the states.
they also mobilized popular support by organizing public festivals and processions the federalists held banquets in february to celebrate washingtons birthday and the republicans marched through the streets on july 4 to honor the declaration of independence.
in the election voters gave federalists a majority in congress and made john adams president.
adams continued hamiltons pro british foreign policy and strongly criticized french seizures of american merchant ships.
when the french foreign minister talleyrand solicited a loan and a bribe from american diplomats to stop the seizures adams charged that talleyrands agents whom he dubbed x y and z had insulted americas honor.
in response to the xyz affair congress cut off trade with france in 1798 and authorized american privateering licensing private ships to seize french vessels.
this undeclared maritime war curtailed american trade with the french west indies and resulted in the capture of nearly two hundred french and american merchant vessels.
the naturalization alien and sedition acts of 1798 as federalists became more hostile to the french republic they also took a harder line against their republican critics.
when republican minded america c o m pa r e d the haitian revolution and the problem of race the slave uprising on the french island of saint domingue triggered international war created a refugee crisis and ended with the creation of a new republic.
the american revolution did all these things as well yet the united states did not support either the rebellion or the republic of haiti.

the federalists launched personal attacks on jefferson branding him an irresponsible pro french radical and because he opposed state support of religion in virginia the arch apostle of irreligion and free thought both parties changed state election laws to favor their candidates and rumors circulated of a federalist plot to stage a military coup.
the election did not end these worries.
thanks to a low federalist turnout in virginia and pennsylvania and the three fifths rule which boosted electoral votes in the southern states jefferson won a narrow 73 to 65 victory over adams in the electoral college.
however the republican electors also gave 73 votes to aaron burr of new york who was jeffersons vicepresidential running mate map 7 1.
the constitution specified that in the case of a tie vote the house of representatives would choose between the candidates.
for thirty five rounds of balloting federalists in the house blocked jeffersons election prompting rumors that virginia would raise a military force to put him into office.
ironically arch federalist alexander hamilton ushered in a more democratic era by supporting jefferson.
calling burr an embryo caesar and the most unfit man in the united states for the office of president hamilton persuaded key federalists to allow jeffersons election.
the federalists concern for political stability also played a role.
as senator james bayard of delaware explained it was admitted on all presidential elections quickly became a central focus of american political life.
political leaders used mental maps to envision those areas likely to support various candidates and to map their election strategies accordingly.
spa power to review congressional legislation was uncertain and because most of the justices were federalists.
instead madison and jefferson looked to the state legislatures.
at their urging the kentucky and virginia legislatures issued resolutions in 1798 declaring the alien and sedition acts to be unauthoritative void and of no force the virginia and kentucky resolutions set forth a states rights interpretation of the constitution asserting that the states had a right to judge the legitimacy of national laws.
the conflict over the sedition act set the stage for the presidential election of 1800.
jefferson once opposed on principle to political parties now asserted that they could watch and relate to the people the activities of an oppressive government.
meanwhile john adams reevaluated his foreign policy.
rejecting hamiltons advice to declare war against france and benefit from the resulting upsurge in patriotism adams put country ahead of party and used diplomacy to end the maritime conflict.

adams carried every new england state and reflecting federalist strength in maritime and commercial areas the eastern districts of the middle atlantic states jefferson won most of the agricultural based states of the south and west kentucky and tennessee.
new york was the pivotal swing state.
it gave its 12 electoral votes to adams in 1796 and thanks to the presence of aaron burr on the republican ticket bestowed them on jefferson in 1800.

the bloodless transfer of power showed that popularly elected governments could be changed in an orderly way even in times of bitter partisan conflict.
in his inaugural address in 1801 jefferson praised this achievement declaring we are all republicans we are all federalists understand points of view a republican empire is born in the treaty of paris of 1783 great britain gave up its claims to the trans appalachian region and said one british diplomat left the indian nations to the care of their american neighbours care was hardly the right word many white americans wanted to destroy native communities.

american negotiators used similar tactics to grab ohio valley lands.
at the treaties of fort mcintosh 1785 and fort finney 1786 they pushed the chippewas delawares ottawas wyandots and shawnees to cede most of the future state of ohio.
the tribes quickly repudiated the agreements justifiably claiming they were made under duress.
recognizing the failure of these agreements american negotiators arranged for a comprehensive agreement at fort harmar 1789 but it too failed.

however continuing indian resistance forced a compromise.
in the treaty of greenville 1795 american negotiators acknowledged indian ownership of the land and in return for various payments the western confederacy ceded most of ohio map 7 2.
the indian peoples also agreed to accept american sovereignty placing themselves under the protection of the united states and no other power whatever these american advances caused britain to agree in jays treaty 1795 to reduce its trade and military aid to indians in the trans appalachian region.
the greenville treaty sparked a wave of white migration.
kentucky already had a population of 73 000 in 1790 and in 1792 it was admitted to the union as the fifteenth state vermont entered a year earlier.
by 1800 more than 375 000 people had moved into the ohio and tennessee valleys in 1805 the new state of ohio alone had more than 100 000 residents.

the goal as one kentucky protestant minister put it was to make the indian a farmer a citizen of the united states and a christian most indians rejected wholesale assimilation even those who joined christian churches retained many ancestral values and religious beliefs.
to think of themselves as individuals or members of a nuclear family as white americans were demanding meant repudiating the clan the very essence of indian life.

handsome lakes teachings divided the senecas into hostile factions.
led by chief red jacket traditionalists condemned european culture as evil and demanded a complete return to ancestral ways.
most indians also rejected the efforts of american missionaries to turn warriors into farmers and women into domestic helpmates.
among eastern woodland peoples women grew corn beans and squash the mainstays of the indians diet and land cultivation rights passed through the female line.
consequently women exercised considerable political influence which they were eager to retain.
nor were indian men interested in becoming farmers.

after indian triumphs in battles in the early 1790s an american victory at the battle of fallen timbers 1794 and the subsequent treaty of greenville 1795 opened up the region for white farmers.
however the treaty recognized many indian rights because it was negotiated between relative equals on the battlefield.

the incroachment of settlers upon the indian territory during the 1790s two great streams of migrants moved out of the southern states map 7 3.
southern migrants one stream composed primarily of white tenant farmers and struggling yeomen families flocked through the cumberland gap into kentucky and tennessee.

between 1790 and 1820 migrants from these four regions carried their cultures into the trans appalachian west.
new england customs and institutions were a dominant influence in upstate new york and along the great lakes while the lower souths hierarchical system of slavery and heavy concentration of african americans shaped the character of the new states along the gulf of mexico.
the pattern of cultural diffusion was more complex in the ohio and tennessee river valleys which were settled by migrants from various core regions.
regional cultures move west 1790 1820 new england mid atlantic chesapeake lower south direction of cultural diffusion the kentucky territory had a more elitist vision.
although they allowed poor settlers to buy up to 1 400 acres of land at reduced prices they sold or granted huge tracts of 100 000 acres to twenty one groups of speculators and leading men.
in 1792 this landed elite owned one fourth of the state while half the white men owned no land and lived as quasi legal squatters or tenant farmers.
widespread landlessness and opposition to slavery prompted a new migration across the ohio river into the future states of ohio indiana and illinois.
in a free community thought peter cartwright a methodist lay preacher from southwestern kentucky who moved to illinois i would be entirely clear of the evil of slavery.
and could raise my children to work where work was not thought a degradation yet land distribution in ohio was almost exactly as unequal as in kentucky in 1810 a quarter of its real estate was owned by 1 percent of the population while more than half of its white men were landless.
meanwhile a second stream of southern planters and slaves from the carolinas moved along the coastal plain toward the gulf of mexico.
some set up new estates in the interior of georgia and south carolina while others moved into the future states of alabama mississippi and louisiana.
the alabama feaver rages here with great violence a north carolina planter remarked and has carried off vast numbers of our citizens cotton was the key to this migratory surge.

exodus from new england as southerners moved across the appalachians and along the gulf coast a third stream of migrants flowed out of the overcrowded communities of new england.
previous generations of massachusetts and connecticut farm families had moved north and east settling new hampshire vermont and maine.
now new england farmers moved west.
seeking land for their children thousands of parents migrated to new york.
the town of herkimer noted one traveler is entirely populated by families come from connecticut by 1820 almost 800 000 new englanders lived in a string of settlements stretching from albany to buffalo and many others had traveled on to ohio and indiana.
soon much of the northwest territory consisted of new england communities that had moved inland.
in new york as in kentucky and ohio wellconnected speculators snapped up much of the best land leasing farms to tenants for a fee.
imbued with the homestead ethic many new england families preferred to buy farms.
they signed contracts with the holland land company a dutch owned syndicate of speculators that allowed settlers to pay for their farms as they worked them or moved west again in an elusive search for land on easy terms.
innovation on eastern farms the new farm economy in new york ohio and kentucky forced major changes in eastern agriculture.
unable to compete with lower priced western grains farmers in new england switched to potatoes which were high yielding and nutritious.
to make up for the labor of sons and daughters who had moved inland middle atlantic farmers bought more efficient farm equipment.
they replaced metal tipped wooden plows with cast iron models that dug deeper and required a single yoke of oxen instead of two.
such changes in crop mix and technology kept production high.
easterners also adopted the progressive farming methods touted by british agricultural reformers.
improvers in pennsylvania doubled their average yield per acre by rotating their crops.
yeomen farmers raised sheep and sold the wool to textile manufacturers.
many farmers adopted a year round planting cycle sowing corn in the spring for animal fodder and then chapter 7 planting winter wheat in september for market sale.
women and girls milked the family cows and made butter and cheese to sell in the growing towns and cities.
whether hacking fields out of western forests or carting manure to replenish eastern soils farmers now worked harder and longer but their increased productivity brought them a better standard of living.
european demand for american produce was high in these years and westward migration the settlement and exploitation of indian lands boosted the farming economy throughout the country.
the jefferson presidency from 1801 to 1825 three republicans from virginia thomas jefferson james madison and james monroe each served two terms as president.
supported by farmers in the south and west and strong republican majorities in congress this virginia dynasty completed what jefferson had called the revolution of 1800.
it reversed many federalist policies and actively supported westward expansion.
when jefferson took office in 1801 he inherited an old international conflict.
beginning in the 1780s the barbary states of north africa had raided merchant ships in the mediterranean and like many european nations the united states had paid an annual bribe massive in relation to the size of the federal budget to protect its vessels.
initially jefferson refused to pay this tribute and ordered the u s navy to attack the pirates home ports.
after four years of intermittent fighting in which the united states bombarded tripoli and captured the city of derna the jefferson administration cut its costs.
it signed a peace treaty that included a ransom for returned prisoners and algerian ships were soon taking american sailors hostage again.
at home jefferson inherited a national judiciary filled with federalist appointees including the formidable john marshall of virginia the new chief justice of the supreme court.
to add more federalist judges the outgoing federalist congress had passed the judiciary act of 1801.
the act created sixteen new judgeships and various other positions which president adams filled at the last moment with midnight appointees the federalists have retired into the judiciary as a stronghold jefferson complained and from that battery all the works of republicanism are to be beaten down and destroyed jeffersons fears were soon realized.
when republican legislatures in kentucky and virginia repudiated the alien and sedition acts as unconstitutional hammering out a federal republic 1787 1820 marshall declared that only the supreme court held the power of constitutional review.
the court claimed this authority for itself when james madison the new secretary of state refused to deliver the commission of william marbury one of adamss midnight appointees.
in marbury v madison 1803 marshall asserted that marbury had the right to the appointment but that the court did not have the constitutional power to enforce it.
in defining the courts powers marshall voided a section of the judiciary act of 1789 in effect asserting the courts authority to review congressional legislation and interpret the constitution.
it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is the chief justice declared directly challenging the republican view that the state legislatures had that power.
ignoring this setback jefferson and the republicans reversed other federalist policies.
when the alien and sedition acts expired in 1801 congress branded them unconstitutional and refused to extend them.
it also amended the naturalization act restoring the original waiting period of five years for resident aliens to become citizens.
charging the federalists with grossly expanding the national governments size and power jefferson had the republican congress shrink it.
he abolished all internal taxes including the excise tax that had sparked the whiskey rebellion of 1794.
to quiet republican fears of a military coup jefferson reduced the size of the permanent army.
he also secured repeal of the judiciary act of 1801 ousting forty of adamss midnight appointees.
still jefferson retained competent federalist officeholders removing only 69 of 433 properly appointed federalists during his eight years as president.
jefferson likewise governed tactfully in fiscal affairs.
he tolerated the economically important bank of the united states which he had once condemned as unconstitutional.
but he chose as his secretary of the treasury albert gallatin a fiscal conservative who believed that the national debt was an evil of the first magnitude by limiting expenditures and using customs revenue to redeem government bonds gallatin reduced the debt from 83 million in 1801 to 45 million in 1812.
with jefferson and gallatin at the helm the nations fiscal affairs were no longer run in the interests of northeastern creditors and merchants.
jefferson and the west jefferson had long championed settlement of the west.
he celebrated the yeoman farmer in notes on the state of virginia 1785 wrote one of the confederations part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 america in the middle east 1804 to protect american merchants from capture and captivity in the barbary states president thomas jefferson sent in the u s navy.

as president jefferson pursued policies that made it easier for farm families to acquire land.
in 1796 a federalist dominated congress had set the price of land in the national domain at 2 per acre by the 1830s jefferson inspired republican congresses had enacted more than three hundred laws that cut the cost to 1 25 eased credit terms and allowed illegal squatters to buy their farms.
eventually in the homestead act of 1862 congress gave farmsteads to settlers for free.
the louisiana purchase international events challenged jeffersons vision of westward expansion.
in 1799 napoleon bonaparte seized power in france and sought to reestablish frances american empire.
in 1801 he coerced spain into signing a secret treaty that returned louisiana to france and restricted american access to new orleans violating pinckneys treaty.
napoleon also launched an invasion to restore french rule in saint domingue.
it was once the richest sugar colony in the americas but its civil war had ruined the economy and cost france a fortune.
napoleon wanted to crush the rebellion restore its planter class and destroy the new algiers that has been growing up in the middle of america napoleons actions in haiti and louisiana prompted jefferson to question his pro french foreign policy.
the day that france takes possession of new orleans we must marry ourselves to the british fleet and nation the president warned dispatching james monroe to chapter 7 britain to negotiate an alliance.
to keep the mississippi river open to western farmers jefferson told robert livingston the american minister in paris to negotiate the purchase of new orleans.
jeffersons diplomacy yielded a magnificent prize the entire territory of louisiana.
by 1802 the french invasion of saint domingue was faltering in the face of disease and determined black resistance a new war threatened in europe and napoleon feared an american invasion of louisiana.
acting with characteristic decisiveness the french ruler offered to sell the entire territory of louisiana for 15 million about 500 million today.
we have lived long livingston remarked to monroe as they concluded the louisiana purchase in 1803 but this is the noblest work of our lives the louisiana purchase forced jefferson to reconsider his strict interpretation of the constitution.
he had long believed that the national government possessed only the powers expressly delegated to it in the constitution but there was no provision for adding new territory.
so jefferson pragmatically accepted a loose interpretation of the constitution and used its treaty making powers to complete the deal with france.
the new western lands jefferson wrote would be a means of tempting all our indians on the east side of the mississippi to remove to the west secessionist schemes the acquisition of louisiana brought new political problems.
some new england federalists fearing that western expansion would hurt their region and party talked openly of leaving the union and forming a confederacy of northeastern states.
the secessionists won the support of aaron burr the ambitious vice president.
after alexander hamilton accused burr of planning to destroy the union the two fought an illegal pistol duel that led to hamiltons death.
this tragedy propelled burr into another secessionist scheme this time in the southwest.
when his term as vice president ended in 1805 burr moved west to avoid prosecution.
there he conspired with general james wilkinson the military governor of the louisiana territory either to seize territory in new spain or to establish louisiana as a separate nation.
but wilkinson himself a spanish spy and incipient traitor betrayed burr and arrested him.
in a highly politicized trial presided over by chief justice john marshall the jury acquitted burr of treason.
the louisiana purchase had increased party conflict and generated secessionist schemes in both new england and the southwest.
such sectional differences hammering out a federal republic 1787 1820 would continue challenging madisons argument in federalist no.

lewis and clark meet the mandans and sioux a scientist as well as a statesman jefferson wanted information about louisiana its physical features plant and animal life and native peoples.
he was also worried about intruders the british run hudsons bay company and northwest company were actively trading for furs on the upper missouri river.
so in 1804 jefferson sent his personal secretary meriwether lewis to explore the region with william clark an army officer.
from st louis lewis clark and their party of american soldiers and frontiersmen traveled up the missouri for 1 000 miles to the fortified earth lodge towns of the mandan and hidatsa peoples near present day bismarck north dakota where they spent the winter.
the mandans lived primarily by horticulture growing corn beans and squash.
they had acquired horses by supplying food to nomadic plains indians and secured guns iron goods and textiles by selling buffalo hides and dried meat to european traders.
however the mandans and neighboring arikaras had been hit hard by the smallpox epidemics that swept across the great plains in 1779 1781 and 1801 1802.
now they were threatened by sioux peoples tetons yanktonais and oglalas.
originally the sioux had lived in the prairie and lake region of northern minnesota.
as their numbers rose and fish and game grew scarce the sioux moved westward acquired horses and hunted buffalo living as nomads in portable skin tepees.
the sioux became ferocious fighters who tried to reduce the mandans and other farming tribes to subject peoples.
according to lewis and clark they were the pirates of the missouri soon the sioux would dominate the buffalo trade throughout the upper missouri region.
in the spring of 1805 lewis and clark began an epic 1 300 mile trek into unknown country.
their party now included toussaint charbonneau a french canadian fur trader and his shoshone wife sacagawea who served as a guide and translator.
after following the missouri river to its source on the idaho montana border they crossed the rocky mountains and venturing far beyond the louisiana purchase traveled down the columbia river to the pacific ocean.
nearly everywhere indian peoples asked for guns so they could defend themselves from other armed tribes.
part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 a mandan village this mandan settlement in north dakota painted by george catlin around 1837 resembled those in which the lewis and clark expedition spent the winter of 1804 1805.
note the palisade of logs that surrounds the village as protection from the sioux and other marauding plains peoples and the solidly built mud lodges that provided warm shelter from the bitter cold of winter.

in 1806 lewis and clark capped off their pathbreaking expedition by providing jefferson with the first maps of the immense wilderness and a detailed account of its natural resources and inhabitants map 7 4.
their report prompted some americans to envision a nation that would span the continent.
the war of 1812 and the transformation of politics the napoleonic wars that ravaged europe after 1802 brought new attacks on american merchant ships.
american leaders struggled desperately to protect the nations commerce while avoiding war.
when this effort finally failed it sparked dramatic political changes that destroyed the federalist party and split the republicans into national and jeffersonian factions.
conflict in the atlantic and the west as napoleon conquered european countries he cut off their commerce with britain and seized american merchant ships that stopped in british ports.
the british ministry responded with a naval blockade and seized american vessels carrying sugar and molasses from the french west indies.
the british navy also searched american merchant ships for british deserters and used these raids to replenish its crews a practice known as impressment.
between 1802 and 1811 british naval officers impressed nearly 8 000 sailors including many u s citizens.
in 1807 american anger boiled over when a british warship attacked the u s navy vessel chesapeake killing three wounding eighteen and seizing four alleged deserters.
never since the battle of lexington have i seen this country in such a state of exasperation as at present jefferson declared.
the embargo of 1807 to protect american interests jefferson pursued a policy of peaceful coercion.
the embargo act of 1807 prohibited american ships from leaving their home ports until britain and france stopped restricting u s trade.
a drastic maneuver the embargo overestimated the reliance of britain and france on american shipping and underestimated the resistance of merchants who feared the embargo would ruin them.
in fact the embargo cut the american gross national product by 5 percent and weakened the entire economy.
exports plunged from 108 million in 1806 to 22 million in 1808 hurting farmers as well as merchants.
all was noise and bustle in new york city before the embargo one visitor remarked afterward everything was closed up as if a malignant fever was raging in the place despite popular discontent over the embargo voters elected republican james madison to the presidency in 1808.

with britain assisting indians in the western territories and seizing american ships in the atlantic henry clay of kentucky the new speaker of the house of representatives and john c calhoun a rising young congressman from south carolina pushed madison toward war.
like other republican war hawks from the west and south they wanted to seize territory in british canada and spanish florida.
with national elections approaching madison issued an ultimatum to britain.
when britain failed to respond quickly the president asked congress for a declaration of war.
in june 1812 a sharply divided senate voted 19 to 13 for war and the house of representatives concurred 79 to 49.
the causes of the war of 1812 have been much debated.
officially the united states went to war because britain had violated its commercial rights as a neutral nation.
but the federalists in congress who represented the new england and middle atlantic merchants voted against the war and in the election of 1812 those regions cast their 89 electoral votes for the federalist presidential candidate de witt clinton of new york.
madison amassed most of his 128 electoral votes in the south and west where voters and congressmen strongly supported the war.
many historians therefore argue that the conflict was actually a western war with eastern labels american voices p 238.

these european conflicts posed two dangers to the united states.
first the naval blockades imposed by the british and the french hurt american commerce and prompted calls for a military response.
second european ideological and political struggles intensified party conflicts in the united states.
on three occasions the american republic faced danger from the combination of an external military threat and internal political turmoil.
in 1798 the federalist administration of john adams almost went to war with france to help american merchants and to undermine the republican party.
in 1807 thomas jeffersons embargo on american commerce shocked federalists and sharply increased political tensions.
and as the following selections show the political divisions during the war of 1812 threatened the very existence of the american republic.

this spirit unfortunately is inseparable from our nature having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind.
it exists under different shapes in all governments more or less stifled controlled or repressed but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.
the alternate dominion of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge.
is itself a frightful despotism but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.

will canada compensate the middle states for the loss of new york or the western states for the loss of new orleans.
let us not be deceived.
a war of invasion may invite a retort of invasion.
when we visit the peaceable and as to us innocent colonies of great britain with the horrors of war can we be assured that our own coast will not be visited with like horrors.

hezekiah niles a republican defends the war in 1814 what the federalists feared had come to pass british ships blockaded american ports and british troops invaded american territory.
in january 1815 republican editor hezekiah niles used the pages of his influential baltimore newspaper niles weekly register to explain current republican policies and blame the federalists for american reverses.
it is universally known that the causes for which we declared war are no obstruction to peace.
the practice of blockade and impressment having ceased by the general pacification of europe our government is content to leave the principle as it was.
we have no further business in hostility than such as is purely defensive while that of great britain is to humble or subdue us.
the war on our part has become a contest for life liberty and property on the part of our enemy of revenge or ambition.
what then are we to do.
are we to encourage him by divisions among ourselves to hold out the hope of a separation of the states and a civil war to refuse to bring forth the resources of the country against him.
i did think that in a defensive war a struggle for all that is valuable that all parties would have united.
but it is not so every measure calculated to replenish the treasury or raise men is opposed by federalists as though it were determined to strike the star spangled banner and exalt the bloody cross.
look at the votes and proceedings of congress and mark the late spirit to secede from the union.
that existed in massachusetts and see with what unity of action every thing has been done by new england federalists to harass and embarrass the government.
our loans have failed and our soldiers have wanted their pay because those new england merchants who had the greater part of the monied capital covenanted with each other to refuse its aid to the country.
they had a right legally to do this and perhaps also by all the artifices of trade or power that money gave them to oppress others not of their stamp and depress the national credit but history will shock posterity by detailing the length to which they went to bankrupt the republic.
to conclude why does the war continue.
it is not the fault of the government we demand no extravagant thing.
i answer the question and say it lasts because great britain depends on the exertions of her party in this country to destroy our resources and compel unconditional submission thus the war began and is continued by our divisions.

the convention also suggested amendments restricting commercial embargoes to sixty days and requiring a two thirds majority in congress to declare war prohibit trade or admit a new state to the union.
as a minority party the federalists could prevail only if the war continued to go badly a very real prospect.
the war had cost 88 million raising the national debt to 127 million.
and now as albert gallatin warned henry clay in may 1814 britains triumph over napoleon in europe meant that a well organized and large army is now ready.
to act immediately against us when an attack from canada came in the late summer of 1814 only an american naval victory on lake champlain stopped the british from marching down the hudson river valley.
a few months later thousands of seasoned british troops landed outside new orleans threatening american control of the mississippi river.
with the nation politically divided and under attack from north and south gallatin feared that the war might prove vitally fatal to the united states peace overtures and a final victory fortunately for the young american republic by 1815 britain wanted peace.
the twenty year war with france had sapped its wealth and energy so it began negotiations with the united states in ghent belgium.
at first the american commissioners john quincy adams gallatin and clay demanded territory in canada and florida while british diplomats sought an indian buffer state between the united states and canada.
both sides quickly realized that these objectives were not worth the cost of prolonged warfare.
the treaty of ghent signed on christmas eve 1814 retained the prewar borders of the united states.
that result hardly justified three years of war but before news of the treaty reached the united states a final military victory lifted americans morale.

hammering out a federal republic 1787 1820 the federalist legacy the war of 1812 ushered in a new phase of the republican political revolution.
before the conflict federalists had strongly supported alexander hamiltons program of national mercantilism a funded debt a central bank and tariffs while jeffersonian republicans had opposed it.
after the war the republicans split into two camps.
led by henry clay national republicans pursued federalist like policies.
in 1816 clay pushed legislation through congress creating the second bank of the united states and persuaded president madison to sign it.
in 1817 clay won passage of the bonus bill which created a national fund for roads and other internal improvements.
madison vetoed it.
reaffirming traditional jeffersonian republican principles he argued that the national government lacked the constitutional authority to fund internal improvements.
meanwhile the federalist party crumbled.
as one supporter explained the national republicans in the eastern states had destroyed the federalist party by the adoption of its principles while the favorable farm policies of jeffersonians maintained the republican partys dominance in the south and west.
no federal character can run with success gouverneur morris of new york lamented and the election of 1818 proved him right republicans outnumbered federalists 37 to 7 in the senate and 156 to 27 in the house.
westward expansion and the success of jeffersons revolution of 1800 had shattered the first party system.
marshalls federalist law however federalist policies lived on thanks to john marshalls long tenure on the supreme court.
appointed chief justice by president john adams in january 1801 marshall had a personality and intellect that allowed him to dominate the court until 1822 and strongly influence its decisions until his death in 1835.
three principles informed marshalls jurisprudence judicial authority the supremacy of national laws and traditional property rights table 7 1.
marshall claimed the right of judicial review for the supreme court in marbury v madison 1803 and the court frequently used that power to overturn state laws that in its judgment violated the constitution.
asserting national supremacy the important case of mcculloch v maryland 1819 involved one such law.
when congress created the second bank of the united states in 1816 it allowed the bank to set up state branches that competed with state chartered banks.
in response the maryland legislature imposed a part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 table 7 1 major decisions of the marshall court date case significance of decision judicial authority marbury v madison asserts principle of judicial review property rights fletcher v peck protects property rights through broad reading of constitutions contract clause dartmouth college v woodward safeguards property rights especially of chartered corporations mcculloch v maryland interprets constitution to give broad powers to national government gibbons v ogden gives national government jurisdiction over interstate commerce supremacy of national law tax on notes issued by the baltimore branch of the second bank.
the second bank refused to pay claiming that the tax infringed on national powers and was therefore unconstitutional.
the states lawyers then invoked jeffersons argument that congress lacked the constitutional authority to charter a national bank.
even if a national bank was legitimate the lawyers argued maryland could tax its activities within the state.
marshall and the nationalist minded republicans on the court firmly rejected both arguments.
the second bank was constitutional said the chief justice because it was necessary and proper given the national govunderstand ernments control over currency points of view and credit and maryland did not why do historians think have the power to tax it.
the decisions of the marthe marshall court again shall court constitute a federalist legacy.
asserted the dominance of national over state statutes in gibbons v ogden 1824.
the decision struck down a new york law granting a monopoly to aaron ogden for steamboat passenger service across the hudson river to new jersey.
asserting that the constitution gave the federal government authority over interstate commerce the chief justice sided with thomas gibbons who held a federal license to run steamboats between the two states.
upholding vested property rights finally marshall used the constitution to uphold federalist notions of property rights.
during the 1790s jefferson republicans had celebrated the will of the people prompting federalists to worry that popular sovereignty would result in a tyranny of the majority if state legislatures enacted statutes infringing on the property rights of wealthy citizens federalist judges vowed to void them.
marshall was no exception.
determined to protect individual property rights he invoked the contract clause of the constitution to do it.
the contract clause in article i section 10 prohibits the states from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts economic conservatives at the philadelphia convention had inserted the clause to prevent stay laws which kept creditors from seizing the lands and goods of delinquent debtors.
in fletcher v peck 1810 marshall greatly expanded its scope.
the georgia legislature had granted a huge tract of land to the yazoo land company.
when a new legislature cancelled the grant alleging fraud and bribery speculators who had purchased yazoo lands appealed to the supreme court to uphold their titles.
marshall did so by ruling that the legislative grant was a contract that could not be revoked.
his decision was controversial and far reaching.
it limited state power bolstered vested property rights and by protecting out of state investors promoted the development of a national capitalist economy.
the court extended its defense of vested property rights in dartmouth college v woodward 1819.
dartmouth college was a private institution created by a royal charter issued by king george iii.
in 1816 new hampshires republican legislature enacted a statute converting the school into a public university.
the dartmouth trustees opposed the legislation and hired daniel webster to plead their case.
a renowned constitutional lawyer and a leading federalist webster cited the courts decision in fletcher v peck and argued that the royal charter was an unalterable contract.
the marshall court agreed and upheld dartmouths claims.
chapter 7 hammering out a federal republic 1787 1820 john marshall by chester harding c 1830 even at the age of seventy five john marshall 1755 1835 had a commanding personal presence.
after he became chief justice of the u s supreme court in 1801 marshall elevated the court from a minor department of the national government to a major institution in american legal and political life.
his decisions on judicial review contract rights the regulation of commerce and national banking permanently shaped the character of american constitutional law.
boston athenaeum usa the bridgeman art library.
the diplomacy of john quincy adams even as john marshall incorporated important federalist principles into the american legal system voting citizens and political leaders embraced the outlook of the republican party.
the political career of john quincy adams was a case in point.
although he was the son of federalist president john adams john quincy adams had joined the republican party before the war of 1812.
he came to national attention for his role in negotiating the treaty of ghent which ended the war.
adams then served brilliantly as secretary of state for two terms under james monroe 1817 1825.
ignoring republican antagonism toward great britain in 1817 adams negotiated the rush bagot treaty which limited american and british naval forces on the great lakes.
in 1818 he concluded another agreement with britain setting the forty ninth parallel as the border between canada and the lands of the louisiana purchase.
then in the adams ons treaty of 1819 adams persuaded spain to cede the florida territory to the united states map 7 6.
in return the american government accepted spains claim to texas and agreed to a compromise on the western boundary for the state of louisiana which had entered the union in 1812.

these treaties eliminated the threat of border wars with neighboring states for a generation giving the united states a much needed period of peace and security.
western hemisphere.
at adamss behest monroe warned spain and other european powers to keep their hands off the newly independent republics in latin america.
the american continents were not subject for further colonization the president declared in 1823 a policy that thirty years later became known as the monroe doctrine.
in return monroe pledged that the united states would not interfere in the internal concerns of european nations.
thanks to john quincy adams the united states had successfully asserted its diplomatic leadership in the western hemisphere and won international acceptance of its northern and western boundaries.
the appearance of political consensus after two decades of bitter party conflict prompted observers to dub james monroes presidency 1817 1825 the era of good feeling this harmony was real but transitory.
the republican party was now split between the national faction led by clay and adams and the jeffersonian faction soon to be led by martin van buren and andrew jackson.
the two groups differed sharply over federal support for roads and canals and many other issues.
as the aging jefferson himself complained you see so many of these new national republicans maintaining in congress the rankest doctrines of the old federalists this division in the republican party would soon produce the second party system in which national minded whigs and state focused democrats would confront each other.
by the early 1820s one cycle of american politics and economic debate had ended and another was about to begin.
summary in this chapter we traced three interrelated themes public policy westward expansion and party politics.
we began by examining the contrasting public policies advocated by alexander hamilton and thomas chapter 7 jefferson.
a federalist hamilton supported a strong national government and created a fiscal infrastructure the national debt tariffs and a national bank to spur trade and manufacturing.
by contrast jefferson wanted to preserve the authority of state governments and he envisioned an america enriched by farming rather than industry.
jefferson and the republicans promoted a westward movement that transformed the agricultural economy and sparked new wars with indian peoples.
expansion westward also shaped american diplomatic and military policy leading to the louisiana purchase chapter review the war of 1812 and the treaties negotiated by john quincy adams.
finally there was the unexpected rise of the first party system.
as hamiltons policies split the political elite the french revolution divided americans into hostile ideological groups.
the result was two decades of bitter conflict and controversial measures the federalists sedition act the republicans embargo act and madisons decision to go to war with britain.
although the federalist party faded away it left as its enduring legacy hamiltons financial innovations and john marshalls constitutional jurisprudence.

white americans were ciples would replace those societal indeed fortunate.
they lived under a reprerules in americas new republican sentative republican government free society.
from arbitrary taxation and from domination by an established church.
the timing of the deaths of aging political leaders john adams and thomas jefferson seemed to many americans to confirm that god looked with favor on their experiment in self government.
what other than divine intervention could explain their nearly simultaneous deaths on july 4 1826 the fiftieth anniversary of the declaration of independence.
inspired by their political freedom many citizens sought to extend republican principles throughout their society.
but what were those principles.
for entrepreneurial minded merchants farmers and political leaders republicanism meant a dynamic market economy based on the private ownership of property and capital.
however they welcomed legislative policies that assisted private business and they claimed enhanced the common wealth of the society.
other americans in the northern states championed democratic republican cultural values such as equality in the family and in social relationships.
in the southern states sharply divided by class and race politicians and pamphleteers endorsed aristocratic republicanism.
it stressed liberty for whites rather than equality for all.
yet another vision of american republicanism emerged from the second great awakening religious revivals that swept the nation between 1790 and 1850.
as alexis de tocqueville reported in democracy in america 1835 the second great awakening gave the christian religion.
a greater influence over the souls of men than in any other country.
moreover religious enthusiasm what methodist bishop mcilvaine praised as the quickening of the people of god to a spirit and walk becoming the gospel prompted social reform on many fronts.
for those who embraced the awakening the united states was both a great experiment in republican government and a christian civilization destined to redeem the world a moral mission that would inform american diplomacy in the centuries to come.

part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 the capitalist commonwealth what did republicanism mean for economic life.
in early nineteenth century america it meant private property market exchange individual opportunity and activist governments.
throughout the nation and especially in the northeast republican state legislatures embraced a neomercantilist system of governmentassisted economic development.
and it worked.
beginning around 1800 the average per capita income of americans increased by more than 1 percent a year more than 30 percent in a single generation.
banks manufacturing and markets america was a nation of merchants a british visitor reported from philadelphia in 1798 keen in the pursuit of wealth in all the various modes of acquiring it acquire it they did making spectacular profits as the wars of the french revolution and napoleon 1793 1815 crippled european firms.
merchants john jacob astor and robert oliver became the nations first millionaires.
after working for an irish owned linen firm in baltimore oliver struck out on his own achieving affluence by trading west indian sugar and coffee.
astor who migrated from germany to new york in 1784 began by selling dry goods in western new york and became wealthy by carrying furs from the pacific northwest to china and investing in new york city real estate thinking like a historian p 252.
banking and credit to finance their ventures oliver astor and other merchants needed capital from either their own savings or loans.
before the revolution farmers relied on government sponsored land banks for loans while merchants arranged partnerships or obtained credit from british suppliers.
then in 1781 philadelphia merchants persuaded the confederation congress to charter the bank of north america and traders in boston and new york soon founded similar institutions that raised funds and lent them out.
our monied capital has so much increased from the introduction of banks the circulation of the funds philadelphia merchant william bingham boasted in 1791 that the necessity of soliciting credits from england will no longer exist that same year federalists in congress chartered the bank of the united states to issue notes and make commercial loans chapter 7 p 218.
by 1805 the bank had branches in eight seaport cities profits that averaged a handsome 8 percent annually and clients a cloth merchant 1789 originally a prosperous storekeeper in new milford connecticut elijah boardman 1760 1832 eventually became a u s senator.
like other american traders during the 1780s he imported huge quantities of cloth from britain.
when the wars of the 1790s cut off trade some merchants financed the domestic production of textiles.
others including boardman turned to land speculation.
in 1795 he joined the connecticut land company and bought huge tracts in connecticuts western reserve including the present towns of medina palmyra and boardman ohio.

with easy access to capital.
as trader jesse atwater noted the foundations of our merchant houses are laid in bank paper however jeffersonians attacked the bank as an unconstitutional expansion of federal power.
moreover they claimed it promoted a consolidated energetic government supported by public creditors speculators and other insidious men when the banks twenty year charter expired in 1811 the jeffersonian republican dominated congress refused to renew it.
chapter 8 creating a republican culture 1790 1820 the china trade following the revolution new england merchants traded actively with the major asian manufacturing centers of china and india.
in this painting by george chinnery 1774 1852 the american flag flies prominently alongside other national banners in front of the warehouse district in canton modern guangzhou.
there merchants exchanged bundles of american furs for cargoes of chinese tea silks and porcelain plates cups and serving dishes.
peabody essex museum salem massachusetts usa the bridgeman art library.
merchants artisans and farmers quickly persuaded state legislatures to charter banks in pennsylvania no fewer than 41.
by 1816 when congress now run by national republicans chartered a new national bank known as the second bank of the united states there were 246 state chartered banks with tens of thousands of stockholders and 68 million in banknotes in circulation.
these state banks were often shady operations that issued notes without adequate specie reserves made loans to insiders and lent generously to farmers buying overpriced land.
dubious banking policies helped bring on the panic of 1819 just as they caused the financial crisis of 2008 but broader forces were equally important.
as the napoleonic wars ended in 1815 americans sharply increased their consumption of english woolen and cotton goods.
however in 1818 farmers and planters faced an abrupt 30 percent drop in world agricultural prices.
the price of raw cotton in south carolina fell from 34 to 15 cents a pound and as britain closed the west indies to american trade wheat prices plummeted as well.
as farmers income declined they could not pay debts owed to stores and banks many of which went bankrupt.
a deep shadow has passed over our land lamented one new yorker as land prices dropped by 50 percent.
the panic gave americans their first taste of a business cycle the periodic boom and bust inherent to an unregulated market economy.
rural manufacturing the panic of 1819 devastated artisans and farmers who sold goods in regional or national markets.

john jacob astor died this morning at nine oclock in the eighty fifth year of his age.
and left reluctantly his unbounded wealth.
his property is estimated at 20 000 000 some judicious persons say 30 000 000 but at any rate he was the richest man in the united states in productive and valuable property and this immense gigantic fortune was the fruit of his own labor unerring sagacity and far seeing penetration.
he came to this country at twenty years of age penniless friendless without inheritance without education.
but with a determination to be rich and ability to carry it into effect.
his capital consisted of a few trifling musical instruments which he got from his brother george astor in london a dealer in music.

american entrepreneurs drove this expansion of rural manufacturing.

new technology initially played only a minor role in producing this boom in consumer goods.
take the case of textile production.
during the 1780s new england and middle atlantic merchants built waterpowered mills to run machines that combed wool and later cotton into long strands.
however until the 1810s they used the household based outwork system for the next steps farm women and children spun the machine combed strands into thread and yarn on foot driven spinning wheels and men in other households used foot powered looms to weave the yarn into cloth.
in 1820 more than 12 000 household workers labored full time weaving woolen cloth which waterpowered fulling mills then pounded flat giving the cloth a smooth finish.
by then the transfer of textile production to factories was gaining speed the number of water driven cotton spindles soared from 8 000 in 1809 to 333 000 in 1817.
the yankee peddler c 1830 even in 1830 many americans lived too far from a market town to go there regularly to buy goods.
instead they purchased their tinware clocks textiles and other manufactures from peddlers often from new england who traveled far and wide in small horse drawn vans like the one visible through the doorway.

ambitious new england farmers switched from subsistence crops of wheat and potatoes to raising livestock.
they sold meat butter and cheese to city markets and cattle hides to the booming shoe industry.
along the whole road from boston we saw women engaged in making cheese a polish traveler reported.
other families raised sheep and sold raw wool to textile manufacturers.
processing these raw materials brought new jobs and income to stagnating farming towns.

as the rural economy churned out more goods it altered the environment.
foul odors from stockyards and tanning pits wafted over concord and other leather producing towns.
nor was that all.
tanners cut down thousands of acres of hemlock trees using the bark to process stiff cow hides into pliable leather.
more trees fell to the ax to create pasturelands for huge herds of livestock dairy cows cattle and especially sheep.
by 1850 most of the ancient forests in southern new england and eastern new york were gone the hills had been stripped of their timber new yorks catskill messenger reported so as to present their huge rocky projections moreover scores of textile milldams dotted new englands rivers altering their flow and preventing fish already severely depleted from decades of overfishing from reaching upriver spawning grounds.
even as the income of farmers rose the quality of their natural environment declined.
in the new capitalist driven market economy rural parents and their children worked longer and harder.
they made yarn hats and brooms during the winter and returned to their regular farming chores during the warmer seasons.
more important these farm families now depended on their wage labor or market sales to purchase the textiles shoes and hats they had once made for themselves.
the new productive system made families and communities more efficient and prosperous and more dependent on a market they could not control.
new transportation systems the expansion of the market depended on improvements in transportation where governments also played a crucial role.
between 1793 and 1812 the massachusetts legislature granted charters to more than one hundred private turnpike corporations.
these charters gave the companies special legal status and often included monopoly rights to a transportation route.
pennsylvania issued fifty five charters including one to the lancaster creating a republican culture 1790 1820 turnpike company which built a 65 mile graded and graveled toll road to philadelphia.
the road quickly boosted the regional economy.
although turnpike investors received only about three percent annually henry clay estimated society as a whole actually reap ed fifteen or twenty percent a farm woman agreed the turnpike is finished and we can now go to town at all times and in all weather new turnpikes soon connected dozens of inland market centers to seaport cities.
water transport was even quicker and cheaper so state governments and private entrepreneurs dredged shallow rivers and constructed canals to bypass waterfalls and rapids.
for their part farmers in kentucky and tennessee and in southern ohio indiana and illinois settled near the ohio river and its many tributaries so they could easily get goods to market.
similarly speculators hoping to capitalize on the expansion of commerce bought up property in the cities along the banks of major rivers cincinnati louisville chattanooga and st louis.
farmers and merchants built barges to carry cotton grain and meat downstream to new orleans which by 1815 was exporting about 5 million in agricultural products yearly.
public enterprise the commonwealth system legislative charters for banks turnpikes and canal companies reflected the ideology of mercantilism government assisted economic development.
just as parliament had used the navigation acts to spur british prosperity so american legislatures enacted laws of great public utility to increase the common wealth these statutes generally took the form of special charters that bestowed legal privileges such as the power of eminent domain that allowed turnpike bridge and canal corporations to force the sale of privately owned land along their routes.
state legislatures also aided capital intensive flour millers and textile manufacturers who flooded adjacent farmland as they built dams to power their water driven machinery.
in massachusetts the mill dam act of 1795 deprived farmers of their traditional common law right to stop the flooding and forced them to accept fair compensation for their lost acreage.

critics condemned the legal privileges given to private enterprises as scheme s of an evident antirepublican tendency as some freeholder citizens in putney vermont put it.
such grants to business corporations they argued violated the equal rights of citizens and infringed on the sovereignty of the governments.
whatever power is given to a corporation is just so much power taken from the state argued a pennsylvanian.
nonetheless judges in state courts following the lead of john marshalls supreme court chapter 7 consistently upheld corporate charters and grants of eminent domain to private transportation companies.
the opening of good and easy internal communications is one of the highest duties of government declared a new jersey judge.
state mercantilism soon spread beyond transportation.
following jeffersons embargo of 1807 which cut off goods and credit from europe the new england states awarded charters to two hundred iron mining textile manufacturing and banking companies while pennsylvania granted more than eleven hundred.
by 1820 state governments had created a republican political economy a commonwealth system that funneled state aid to private businesses whose projects would improve the general welfare.
toward a democratic republican culture after independence many americans in the northern states embraced a democratic republicanism that celebrated political equality and social mobility.
these citizens primarily members of the emerging middle class redefined the nature of the family and of education by chapter 8 seeking egalitarian marriages and affectionate ways of rearing their children.
opportunity and equality for white men between 1780 and 1820 hundreds of well educated visitors agreed that the american social order was different from that of europe.
in his famous letters from an american farmer 1782 french born essayist j hector st jean de crvecoeur wrote that european society was composed of great lords who possess everything and of a herd of people who have nothing by contrast the united states had no aristocratical families no courts no kings no bishops the absence of a hereditary aristocracy encouraged americans to condemn inherited social privilege and to extol legal equality.
the law is the same for everyone noted one european traveler.
yet citizens of the new republic willingly accepted social divisions that reflected personal achievement a phenomenon that astounded many europeans.

when women and free blacks asked for voting rights male legislators wrote explicit race and gender restrictions into the law.

many existing states revised their constitutions and replaced a property qualification for voting with less restrictive criteria such as paying taxes or serving in the militia.
some new states in the west extended the suffrage to all adult white men.
as parties sought votes from a broader electorate the tone of politics became more open and competitive swayed by the interests and values of ordinary people.

as federalists and republicans competed for power they ignored customary gender rules and urged property owning single women and widows to vote.
sensing a threat to mens monopoly on politics the new jersey legislature in 1807 invoked both biology and custom to limit voting to men only women generally are neither by nature nor habit nor education nor by their necessary condition in society fitted to perform this duty with credit to themselves or advantage to the public toward republican families the controversy over womens political rights mirrored a debate over authority within the household.
british and american husbands had long claimed patriarchal power and legal control of the familys property.
however as john adams lamented in 1776 the republican principle of equality had spread where it was not intended encouraging his wife and other women to demand legal and financial rights.
patriot author and historian mercy otis warren argued that patriarchy was not a natural rule but a social contrivance and could be justified only for the sake of order in families to see a longer excerpt of the mercy otis warren document along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
republican marriages economic and cultural changes also eroded customary paternal authority.
in colonial america most property owning parents had arranged their childrens marriages.
they looked for a morally upright son or daughter in law with financial resources physical attraction and emotional compatibility between the young people were secondary considerations.
as landholdings shrank in long settled communities many yeomen fathers has less control over their childrens marriages because they had fewer resources to give them.
increasingly young men and women chose their own partners influenced by a new cultural attitude sentimentalism.
sentimentalism originated in europe as part of the romantic movement and after 1800 spread quickly through all classes of american society.
rejecting the enlightenments emphasis on rational thought sentimentalism celebrated the importance of feeling a physical sensuous appreciation of god nature and fellow humans.
this new emphasis on deeply felt emotions pervaded literary works popular theatrical melodramas and the passionate rhetoric of revivalist preachers.
as the passions of the heart overwhelmed the logic of the mind magazines praised companionate marriages marriages contracted from motives of affection rather than of interest many young people looked for a relationship based on intimacy and a spouse who was as eliza southgate of maine put it calculated to promote my happiness as young people fell in love and married many fathers changed from authoritarian patriarchs to watchful paternalists.
to guard against free spending sons in law wealthy fathers often placed their daughters inheritance in a legal trust.
one virginia planter told his lawyer to see the property settlement properly drawn before the marriage for i by no means consent that polly shall be left to the vicissitudes of life as voluntary contracts between individuals love marriages conformed more closely to republican principles than did arranged matches.
in theory such marriages would be companionate giving wives and husbands true equality as one boston man suggested.
in practice husbands dominated most marriages because male authority was deeply ingrained in cultural mores and because american common law gave husbands control of the familys property.
moreover the new love based marriage system discouraged parents from protecting young wives and governments refused to prevent domestic tyranny.
the marriage contract is so much more important in its consequences to females than to males a young man at the litchfield law school in connecticut astutely observed in 1820 for they subject themselves to his authority.
he is their all their only relative their only hope american voices p 260.
young adults who chose partners unwisely were severely disappointed when their spouses failed as providers or faithful companions.
before 1800 unhappy wives and husbands could do little officials granted divorces infrequently and then only in cases of neglect abandonment or adultery serious offenses against the moral order of society.
after 1800 most divorce petitions cited emotional issues.
one woman complained that her husband had ceased to cherish her while a man grieved that his wife had almost broke his heart responding to changing cultural values several states expanded the legal grounds for divorce to include drunkenness and personal cruelty.
republican motherhood traditionally most american women had spent their active adult years working as farmwives and bearing and nurturing children.
however after 1800 the birthrate in the northern states dropped significantly.

sturbridge in central massachusetts women now bore an average of six children their grandmothers had usually given birth to eight or nine.
in the growing seaport cities native born white women now bore an average of only four children.
the united states was among the first nations to experience this sharp decline in the birthrate what historians call the demographic transition.
there were several causes.
beginning in the 1790s thousands of young men migrated to the trans appalachian west which increased the number of never married women in the east and delayed marriage for many more.
women who married in their late twenties had fewer children.
in addition white urban middle class couples deliberately limited the size of their families.
fathers wanted to leave children an adequate inheritance while mothers influenced by new ideas of individualism and self achievement refused to spend their entire adulthood rearing children.
after having four or five children these couples used birth control or abstained from sexual intercourse.
even as women bore fewer children they accepted greater responsibility for the welfare of the family.
in his thoughts on female education 1787 philadelphia physician benjamin rush argued that young women should ensure their husbands perseverance in the paths of rectitude and called for loyal republican mothers who would instruct their sons in the principles of liberty and government to see a longer excerpt of thoughts on female education along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.

because of the general ideas of liberty and equality engraved on their hearts a polish aristocrat suggested around 1800 american children had scant respect for their parents.

permissive child rearing was not universal.
foreign visitors interacted primarily with well to do episcopalians and presbyterians who held an enlightenment conception of children.

families in the rapidly expanding middle class widely adopted this rationalist method of child rearing.

white southerners were horrified.
it is believed by some feared by others alabama senator john walker reported from washington that tallmadges amendment was merely the entering wedge and that it points already to a total emancipation of the blacks mississippi congressman christopher rankin accused his northern colleagues of brinksmanship you conduct us to an awful precipice and hold us over it underlining their commitment to slavery southerners used their power in the senate where they held half the seats to withhold statehood from maine which was seeking to separate itself from massachusetts.
constitutional issues in the ensuing debate southerners advanced three constitutional arguments.
first they invoked the principle of equal rights arguing that congress could not impose conditions on missouri that it had not imposed on other territories.
second they maintained that the constitution guaranteed a states sovereignty with respect to its internal affairs and domestic institutions such as slavery and marriage.
finally they insisted that congress had no authority to infringe on the property rights of individual slaveholders.
beyond those arguments southern leaders defended human bondage.

as the aging thomas to settle the missouri jefferson exclaimed during the crisis.
missouri crisis this momentous question like a fire bell in the night awakened and filled me with terror protestant christianity as a social force throughout the colonial era religion played a significant role in american life but not an overwhelming one.
then beginning around 1790 religious revivals planted the values of protestant christianity deep in the national character and gave a spiritual dimension to american republicanism.
these revivals especially changed the lives of blacks and of women.

previously only the quaker and baptistcontrolled governments of pennsylvania and rhode island had rejected a legally established church that claimed everyone as a member and collected compulsory religious taxes.
then a convergence of factors enlightenment principles wartime needs and baptist ideology eliminated most state support for religion and allowed voluntary church membership.
religious freedom events in virginia revealed the dynamics of change.
in 1776 james madison and george mason advanced enlightenment ideas of religious toleration as they persuaded the states constitutional convention to guarantee all christians the free exercise of religion this measure which ended the privileged legal status of the anglican church won presbyterian and baptist support for the independence struggle.
baptists who also opposed public support of religion convinced lawmakers to reject a tax bill supported by george washington and patrick henry that would have funded all christian churches.
instead in 1786 the virginia legislature enacted thomas jeffersons bill for establishing religious freedom which made all churches equal in the eyes of the law and granted direct financial support to none.
elsewhere the old order of a single established church crumbled away.
in new york and new jersey the sheer number of denominations episcopalian presbyterian dutch reformed lutheran and quaker among others prevented lawmakers from agreeing on an established church or compulsory religious taxes.
congregationalism remained the official church in the new england states until the 1830s but members of other denominations could now pay taxes to their own churches.
church state relations few influential americans wanted a complete separation of church and state because they believed that religious institutions promoted morality and governmental authority.
pure religion and civil liberty are inseparable companions a group of north carolinians understand advised their minister.
it is your points of view particular duty to enlighten manwhat were the main kind with the unerring principles principles of the new of truth and justice the main republican religious props of all civil government regime.
accepting this premise most state governments indirectly supported churches by exempting their property and ministers from taxation.
freedom of conscience also came with sharp cultural limits.
in virginia jeffersons religious freedom act prohibited religious requirements for holding public office but other states discriminated against those who were not protestant christians.
the north carolina constitution of 1776 disqualified from public office any citizen who shall deny the being of god or the truth of the protestant religion or the divine authority of the old or new testament new hampshires constitution contained a similar provision until 1868.
americans influenced by enlightenment deism and by evangelical protestantism condemned these religious restrictions.
jefferson franklin and other american intellectuals maintained that god had given humans the power of reason so that they could determine moral truths for themselves.
to protect society from ecclesiastical tyranny they demanded complete freedom of conscience.
the truth is great and will prevail if left to herself jefferson declared religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god many evangelical protestants likewise demanded religious liberty to protect their churches from an oppressive government.
isaac backus a new england minister warned baptists not to incorporate their churches or accept public funds because that might lead to state control.
in connecticut a devout congregationalist welcomed voluntarism the funding of churches by their members it allowed the laity to control the clergy he said while also supporting selfgovernment and the principles of republicanism republican church institutions following independence americans embraced churches that preached spiritual equality and governed themselves democratically while ignoring those with hierarchical and authoritarian institutions.
preferring luthers doctrine of the priesthood of all believers few citizens accepted the authority claimed by roman catholic priests and bishops.
likewise few americans joined the protestant episcopal church the successor to the church of england because wealthy lay members dominated many congregations and it too had a hierarchy of bishops figure 8 1.
the presbyterian church attracted more adherents in part because its churches elected lay members to synods the congresses that determined doctrine and practice.
evangelical methodist and baptist churches were by far the most successful institutions in attracting new members especially from the unchurched the chapter 8 creating a republican culture 1790 1820 share of all congregations anglican episcopalian 2 100 baptist 12 150 2 500 congregational 2 200 lutheran 2 100 methodist 20 000 6 400 2 447 47 450 catholic presbyterian 1 000 2 000 4 000 6 000 8 000 10 000 12 000 14 000 16 000 18 000 20 000 figure 8 1 number of church congregations by denomination 1780 and 1860 the growth of evangelical churches methodist and baptist transformed american christianity during the first half of the nineteenth century.
also noteworthy was the surge in the number of roman catholic congregations the result of catholic immigration from ireland and germany after 1830 great number of irreligious americans.
the baptists boasted a thoroughly republican church organization with self governing congregations.
also baptists and methodists as well developed an egalitarian religious culture marked by communal singing and emotional services.
these denominations formed a dynamic new force in american religion.
the second great awakening as americans adopted new religious principles a decades long series of religious revivals the second great awakening made the united states a genuinely christian society.
evangelical denominations began the revival in the 1790s as they spread their message in seacoast cities and the backcountry of new england.
a new sect of universalists who repudiated calvinism and preached universal salvation also gained tens of thousands of converts especially in massachusetts and northern new england.
after 1800 enthusiastic camp meetings swept the frontier regions of south carolina tennessee ohio and kentucky.
the largest gathering at cane ridge in kentucky in 1801 lasted for nine electrifying days and nights and attracted almost 20 000 people map 8 4.
with these revivals baptist and methodist preachers reshaped the spiritual landscape throughout the south.
offering a powerful emotional message and the promise of religious fellowship revivalists attracted both unchurched individuals and pious families searching for social ties as they migrated to new communities america compared p 272.
a new religious landscape the second great awakening transformed the denominational makeup of american religion.
the main colonial period churches the congregationalists episcopalians and quakers grew slowly through natural increase while methodist and baptist churches expanded spectacularly by winning converts.
in rural areas their preachers followed a regular circuit riding a hardy pony or horse with their bible hymn book and discipline to visit existing congregations.
they began new churches by searching out devout families bringing them together for worship and then appointing lay elders to lead the congregation and enforce moral discipline.
soon baptists and methodists were the largest denominations.
to attract converts evangelical ministers copied the practical preaching techniques of george whitefield and other eighteenth century revivalists chapter 4.

one of the preachers began in a low nasal tone and like all other methodist preachers assured us of the enormous depravity of man as he comes from the hands of his maker and of his perfect sanctification after he had wrestled sufficiently with the lord.

the critics who have from time to time reproached me with undue severity in my strictures on the domestic manners of the americans have said that a candid examination of matters at home would have shown me that what i reprobated might be found in england as well as in the united states.
in most cases i have felt that this might be rebutted.
by showing that what i complained of in the union as indicative of imperfect civilisation whereas if existing at all with us could only be met with among persons in a much lower station of life.
but on the subject treated in the present chapter justice compels me to avow that no such pleading can avail me.
that such fearful profanation of the holy name of religion has rapidly increased among us since the year 1827 in which i quitted england for america is most sadly certain.

women took charge of religious and charitable enterprises because of their exclusion from other public roles and because of their numbers.
after 1800 more than 70 percent of the members of new england congregational churches were women.
the predominance of women prompted congregational ministers to end traditional gender segregated prayer meetings and evangelical methodist and baptist preachers actively promoted mixed sex praying.

embracing the idea of republican motherhood christian women throughout the united states founded maternal associations to encourage proper child rearing.
by the 1820s mothers magazine and other newsletters widely read in hundreds of small towns and villages were giving women a sense of shared identity and purpose.
religious activism also advanced female education as churches sponsored academies where girls from the middling classes received intellectual and moral instruction.
emma willard the first american advocate of higher education for women opened the middlebury female seminary in vermont in 1814 and later founded girls academies in waterford and troy new york.
beginning in the 1820s women educated in these seminaries and academies displaced men as public school teachers in part because they accepted lower pay than men would.
female schoolteachers earned from 12 to 14 a month with room and board less than a farm laborer.
however as schoolteachers women had an acknowledged place in public life a status that previously had been beyond their reach.
just as the ideology of democratic republicanism had expanded voting rights and the political influence of ordinary white men in the north so the values of christian republicanism had bolstered the public authority of middling women.
the second great awakening made americans a fervently protestant people.
along with the values of republicanism and capitalism this religious impulse formed the core of an emerging national identity.
summary like all important ideologies republicanism has many facets.
we have explored three of them in this chapter.
we saw how state legislatures used governmentgranted charters and monopolies to support private businesses with the goal of enhancing the commonwealth of society.
this republican inspired commonwealth policy of state mercantilism remained dominant until the 1840s when classical liberal doctrines partially replaced it.
we also saw how republicanism influenced social and family values.
the principle of legal equality encouraged social mobility among white men and prompted men and women to seek companionate marriages.
republicanism likewise encouraged parents to provide their children with equal inheritances and to allow them to choose their marriage partners.
in the south republican doctrines of liberty and equality coexisted uneasily with racial slavery and class divisions and ultimately they benefitted only a minority of the white population.
chapter 8 finally we observed the complex interaction of republicanism and religion.
stirred by republican principles many citizens joined democratic and egalitarian denominations particularly methodist and baptist churches.
inspired by benevolent ideas and the enthusiastic preachers of the second great awakening chapter review many women devoted their energies to religious purposes and social reform organizations.
the result of all these initiatives in economic policy social relations and religious institutions was the creation of a distinctive american republican culture.

these scenes belong to history.
the wondrous epic of the coming of democracy as part 4 shows americans were making history in many ways between 1800 and 1860.
indeed these decades constitute a distinct period precisely because the pace of historical change accelerated especially between 1820 and 1860 as overlapping revolutions transformed american life.
one revolution was political the creation of a genuinely democratic polity.
a second was economic in 1800 the united states was predominantly an agricultural nation by 1860 the northern states boasted one of the worlds foremost industrial economies.
third these years witnessed far reaching cultural changes.
beginning about 1800 the second great awakening swept across the nation sparking great movements of social reform and intellectual ferment that revolutionized the culture of the north and midwest.
finally sectionalism increased in intensity as the south extended its slave labor system and the north developed a free labor society.
the overall result by 1860 was striking and alarming now more politically democratic economically prosperous and deeply religious the united states stood divided into antagonistic sections.
here in brief are the key aspects of those transformations.
transforming the economy society and culture creating a democratic polity impressive advances in industrial production transportation and commerce transformed the nations economy.
factory owners used water and steampowered machines and a new system of labor discipline to boost the output of goods.
manufacturers produced 5 percent of the countrys wealth in 1820 but nearly 25 percent by 1860.
as enterprising merchants entrepreneurs and government officials developed a network of canals and markets manufacturers sold these products throughout an expanding nation.
the new economy created a class based urban society in the north and midwest.
a wealthy elite of merchants manufacturers bankers and entrepreneurs rose to the top of the society.
to preserve social stability this elite embraced benevolent reform preaching the gospel of temperance sunday observance and universal elementary education.
simultaneously an expanding urban middle class created a distinct material and religious culture and promoted its ideology of individual responsibility and social mobility.
some middle class americans advocated radical causes joining utopian socialist communities and demanding equal rights for women and the immediate end of racial slavery.
a mass of propertyless wage earning workers including poor immigrants from germany and ireland devised a vibrant popular culture of their own.
this complex story of economic change and social fragmentation is the focus of chapter 9 and chapter 11.
beginning in the 1810s the rapid expansion of white male suffrage and political parties created a competitive and responsive democratic polity.
pressure came from ordinary citizens who organized political movements such as the anti masonic working mens and liberty parties to advance their interests and beliefs.
farmers workers and entrepreneurs persuaded state legislatures to improve transportation shorten workdays and award valuable charters to banks and business corporations.
catholic immigrants from ireland and germany entered the political arena to protect their cultural habits and religious institutions from restrictive legislation advocated by protestant nativists and reformers.
then during the 1830s andrew jackson and the democratic party led a political and constitutional revolution that cut federal and state government aid to financiers merchants and corporations.
to contend with the democrats the whig party devised a competing program that stressed state sponsored economic development moral reform and individual social mobility.
this party competition engaged the energies of the electorate helped to unify a fragmented social order and during the 1830s and 1840s lessened sectional tensions.
chapters 10 and 12 analyze this story of political change and party politics.
part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 growing sectional divisions thematic understanding however the party system could not overcome the increasingly sharp sectional divisions.
as the north developed into an urban industrial society based on free labor the south increasingly defended white supremacy and slavery as a positive good and expanded its plantation based agricultural society.
beginning in the 1820s the two sections had differed over economic issues and indian policy.
georgia and other southeastern states demanded and won over the objections of northeastern reformers the indian removal act of 1830 which resettled native peoples west of the mississippi river.
concurrently between 1816 and 1832 northern manufacturers workers and farmers won high protective tariffs which southern planters bitterly opposed.
eventually party politicians negotiated a compromise with the north accepting tariff reductions.
the sections had clashed again over the expansion of slavery into missouri and the louisiana purchase in the 1820s and into texas and the southwest in the 1840s and political leaders again devised compromises.
however by the 1850s slavery and the social system it symbolized increasingly divided the nation.
moreover because the democratic political revolution had engaged the passions of millions of ordinary americans the political system had become more volatile and resistant to compromise.
chapters 10 and 12 explain how national expansion led to increasing sectional struggle.

jerome bought out his indenture by making dials for clocks and then found a job with clockmaker eli terry.
a manufacturing wizard terry used water power to drive precision saws and woodworking lathes.
soon his shop and dozens of outworkers were turning out thousands of tall clocks with wooden works.
then in 1816 terry patented an enormously popular desk clock with brass parts an innovation that turned waterbury connecticut into the clockmaking center of the united states.
in 1822 chauncey jerome set up his own clock factory.
by organizing work more efficiently and using new machines that stamped out interchangeable metal parts he drove down the price of a simple clock from 20 to 5 and then to less than 2.
by the 1840s jerome was selling his clocks in england the hub of the industrial revolution a decade later his workers were turning out 400 000 clocks a year clear testimony to american industrial enterprise.
by 1860 the united states was not only the worlds leading exporter of cotton and wheat but also the third ranked manufacturing nation behind britain and france.
business is the very soul of an american the fountain of all human felicity author francis grund observed shortly after arriving from europe.
it is as if all america were but one gigantic workshop over the entrance of which there is the blazing inscription no admission here except on business stimulated by the entrepreneurial culture of early nineteenth century america thousands of artisan inventors like chauncey jerome propelled the country into the industrial revolution a new system of production based on water and steam power and machine technology.
simultaneously thousands of traders fashioned a second great economic advance a market revolution that exploited advances in transportation and business organization to expand trade in farm products and manufactured goods.
not all americans embraced the new business dominated society and many failed to share in the new prosperity.
moreover the increase in manufacturing commerce and finance created class divisions that challenged the founders vision of an agricultural republic with few distinctions of wealth.

part 4 overlapping revolutions 1800 1860 the american industrial revolution the industrial revolution came to the united states between 1790 and 1860 as merchants and manufacturers reorganized work routines built factories and exploited a wide range of natural resources.
as output increased goods that once had been luxury items became part of everyday life figure 9 1.
the rapid construction of turnpikes canals and railroads by state governments and private entrepreneurs working together in the commonwealth system chapter 8 distributed manufactures throughout the nation.
the division of labor and the factory increased output stemmed initially from changes in the organization of work that turned independent artisans into wage laborers.
traditionally new england shoemakers had turned leather hides into finished shoes and identify causes boots in small wooden shacks how did the division of called ten footers where they labor increase output worked at their own pace.
during and what was its impact on workers.
the 1820s and 1830s merchants in lynn massachusetts destroyed the businesses of these artisans by introducing an outwork system and a division of labor.
the merchants item value added by manufacture in millions product value millions cotton textiles 1.

53 8 boots and shoes 3.
49 2 flour and meal hired semiskilled journeymen and set them up in large shops cutting leather into soles and uppers.
they sent out the upper sections to rural massachusetts towns where women binders sewed in fabric linings.
the manufacturers then had other journeymen attach the uppers to the soles and return the shoes to the central shop for inspection packing and sale.
this more efficient system increased output and cut the price of shoes and boots even as it turned employers into powerful shoe bosses and eroded workers wages and independence.
for products not suited to the outwork system manufacturers created the modern factory which concentrated production under one roof.
for example in the 1830s cincinnati merchants built large slaughterhouses that processed thousands of hogs every month.
the technology remained simple but a division of labor increased output.
as a system of overhead rails moved the hog carcasses along a disassembly line one worker split the animals another removed the organs and others trimmed the carcasses into pieces.
packers then stuffed the pork into barrels and salted it to prevent spoilage.

we took out our watches and counted thirty five seconds from the moment when one hog touched the table until the next occupied its place.
the cincinnati system was so efficient processing sixty hogs an hour that by the 1840s the city was known as porkopolis by 1850 factories were slaughtering 334 000 hogs a year and 400 000 by 1860.
other factories boasted impressive new technology.
in 1782 oliver evans a prolific delaware inventor built a highly automated flour mill driven by water power.
his machinery lifted the wheat to the top of the mill cleaned the grain as it fell into hoppers ground it into flour and then cooled the flour as it was funneled into barrels.
evanss factory remarked one observer was as full of machinery as the case of a watch it needed only six men to mill 100 000 bushels of wheat a year perhaps ten times as much as they could grind in a traditional mill.
by the 1830s a new mineral based economy of coal and metal began to emerge.
manufacturers increasingly ran their machinery with coal burning stationary steam engines rather than with water power.
and they now fabricated metal products iron brass copper and tinplate tin coated rolled iron as well as pork leather wool cotton and other agricultural goods.
in chicago cyrus mccormick used steamdriven machines to make parts for farm reapers which workers assembled on a conveyor belt.
in hartford connecticut samuel colt built an assembly line to produce his invention the six shooter revolver.
other new england artisans designed machines that fabricated tinplate into pails pans pots and dozens of other inexpensive and useful household items.
these advances in technology and factory organization alarmed british observers the contriving and making of machinery has become so common in this country.
that it is to be feared that american manufacturers will become exporters not only to foreign countries but even to england the textile industry and british competition to protect the british textile industry from american competition the british government prohibited the export of textile machinery and the emigration of mechanics skilled craftsmen who invented and improved tools for industry.
lured by the prospect of higher wages though thousands of british mechanics transforming the economy 1800 1860 disguised themselves as laborers and sailed to the united states.
by 1812 at least three hundred british mechanics worked in the philadelphia area alone.
samuel slater the most important migr mechanic came to america in 1789 after working for richard arkwright who had invented the most advanced british machinery for spinning cotton.
a year later slater reproduced arkwrights innovations in merchant moses browns cotton mill in providence rhode island.
in competing with british mills american manufacturers had the advantage of an abundance of natural resources.
the nations farmers produced huge amounts of cotton and wool and the fast flowing rivers that cascaded down from the appalachian foothills to the atlantic coastal plain provided a cheap source of energy.
from massachusetts to delaware these waterways were soon lined with industrial villages and textile mills as large as 150 feet long 40 feet wide and four stories high map 9 1.
american and british advantages still british producers easily undersold their american competitors.
thanks to cheap transatlantic shipping and low interest rates in britain they could import raw cotton from the united states manufacture it into cloth and sell it in america at a bargain price.
as they did in india see america compared p.
the most important british advantage was cheap labor britain had a larger population about 12 6 million in 1810 compared to 7 3 million americans and thousands of landless laborers prepared to accept low paying factory jobs.
to offset these advantages american entrepreneurs relied on help from the federal government in 1816 1824 and 1828 congress passed tariff bills that taxed imported cotton and woolen cloth.
however in the 1830s congress reduced tariffs because southern planters western farmers and urban consumers demanded inexpensive imports.
better machines cheaper workers american producers used two other strategies to compete with their british rivals.
first they improved on british technology.
in 1811 francis cabot lowell a wealthy boston merchant toured british textile mills secretly making detailed drawings of their power machinery.
paul moody an compare and experienced american mechanic contrast what were the advantages then copied the machines and and strategies of british improved their design.
in 1814 and american textile lowell joined with merchants manufacturers.

thanks to moodys improvements walthams power looms operated at higher speeds than british looms and needed fewer workers.
the second strategy was to tap a cheaper source of labor.
in the 1820s the boston manufacturing company recruited thousands of young women from farm families providing them with rooms in boardinghouses and with evening lectures and other cultural activities.
to reassure parents about their daughters moral welfare the mill owners enforced strict curfews prohibited alcoholic beverages and required regular church attendance.
at lowell 1822 chicopee 1823 and other sites in massachusetts and new hampshire the company built new factories that used this labor system known as the waltham lowell system.
by the early 1830s more than 40 000 new england women were working in textile mills.
as an observer noted the wages were more than could be obtained by the hitherto ordinary occupation of housework the living conditions were better than those in crowded farmhouses and the women had greater independence.

other women operatives used wages to pay off their fathers farm mortgages send brothers to school or accumulate a marriage dowry for themselves.
to see a longer excerpt of the lucy larcom document along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
some operatives just had a good time.
susan brown who worked as a lowell weaver for eight months spent half her earnings on food and lodging and the rest on plays concerts lectures and a two day excursion to boston.
like most textile workers brown soon tired of the rigors of factory work and the never ceasing clatter of the machinery which ran twelve hours a day six days a week.
after she quit she lived at home for a time and then moved to another mill.
whatever the hardships waged work gave young women a sense of freedom.

by combining tariff protection with improved technology america c o m pa r e d the fate of the american and indian textile industries in 1776 the united states declared its independence from the british empire.
about the same time britain began to create in india what historians call the second british empire.
by 1860 britain had become the worlds leading industrial economy and dominated the princely states and peoples of the indian subcontinent.
the following tables trace the impact of political decisions on the american and indian textile industries.
as the legislature of an independent republic the u s congress could impose tariffs taxes on imported goods on british textiles as colonies indian governments could not do so.
