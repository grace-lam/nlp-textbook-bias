424 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 r ough and tumble combat of the raucous new democratic political culture.
i was born for a storm he once boasted.
a calm life does not suit me and jackson took the nation by storm.
no political figure was so widely loved or more deeply despised.
as a self made soldier lawyer planter and politician jackson helped create and shape the democratic party and he helped introduce modern presidential campaigning to electoral politics.
jackson symbolized what he called the emergence of the common man in politics by which he meant white men only and he stamped his name and more impor tant his ideas personality and values on an entire era of american history.
jacksonian democracy jacksons election marked the impact of thirty years of democratic innovations in politics.
during the 1820s and 1830s as america grew in population and people continued to move westward in ever larger numbers most white men whether they owned property or not were allowed to vote and hold office.
the principle of universal suffrage announced the u s magazine and democratic review meant that white males of age constituted the political nation such a democratization of voting rights was unique in the world for it gave previously excluded white men equal status as citizens regardless of wealth or background.
no longer was politics the arena for only the most prominent and wealthiest americans.
political democracy campaigning was also democratized.
politics became the most popular form of mass entertainment as people from all walks of life passionately engaged in elections and were remarkably well informed about public policy issues.
politics was the only pleasure an american knows observed visiting frenchman alexis de tocqueville.
even the women frequently attend public meetings and listen to political harangues as a recreation from their household labors jackson was the most openly partisan and politically involved president in history to that point.
unlike previous presidents who viewed political campaigning as unseemly he actively sought votes among the people lobbied congressmen and formed hickory clubs across the nation to campaign for him.
jackson also benefited from a powerful democratic party machine run by his trusted secretary of state later his vice president martin van buren a new york lawyer with a shrewd political sense.
democracy of course is a slippery and elastic concept and jacksonians rarely defined what they meant by the rule of the people noah webster the 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 424 24 10 15 1 51 pm jacksonian democracy 425 connecticut federalist who produced the nations first reliable dictionary complained that the men who have preached these doctrines of democracy have never defined what they mean by the people or what they mean by democracy nor how the people are to govern themselves jacksonian democrats also showed little concern for the undemocratic constraints on african americans native americans and women all of whom were denied basic political and civil rights.
anti democratic forces many southern slaveholders worried that the surge of democratic activism would eventually threaten the slave system.
virginian muscoe garnett a planter and attorney declared that democracy is indeed incompatible with slavery and the whole system of southern society his fellow virginian george fitzhugh was more explicit in his disdain for democratic ideals.
in every society he asserted some were born with saddles on their backs and others booted and spurred to ride them still in the face of such opposition jacksonian democrats helped expand economic opportunity and political participation for workingmen white factory laborers craftsmen and mechanics small farmers and l and hungry frontiersmen.
andrew jackson promised to protect the poor and humble from the tyranny of wealth and power his goal was to elevate the laboring classes of white men who love liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws democracy unleashed the rowdy inauguration of president jackson symbolized the democratization of political life.
dressed in a black mourning suit in honor of his recently deceased wife the s elf described peoples president stepped out of the u s capitol at noon on march 4 1829.
waiting for him in the cold were 15 000 people who collectively roared and waved their hats when they saw jackson emerge.
i never saw anything like it before marveled daniel webster the great senator from massachusetts.
once the wild cheering subsided jackson bowed before the crowd with great dignity acknowledging their excitement and urging them to settle down.
he then delivered a typically brief speech in which he promised that his administration would be committed to the task of reform in the federal government taking jobs out of unfaithful or incompetent hands and balancing states rights with the exercise of national power.
he also pledged to pursue the will of the people in exercising his new presidential powers.
after being sworn in by chief justice john marshall president jackson mounted his white horse and rode down a muddy pennsylvania avenue to the white house where his cherished democracy lost control in a wild 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 425 24 10 15 1 51 pm 426 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 celebration.
the huge crowd of jubilant western democrats partying in the white house and outside on the lawn quickly turned into a drunken mob as they consumed alcohol laced punch.
dishes glasses and furniture were smashed and muddy booted revelers broke windows ripped down draperies and trampled on rugs.
a washington lady marveled at the arrival of frontier democracy in the nations capital what a scene we did witness.
the majesty of the people had disappeared and a rabble a mob of boys negroes women children scrambling fighting romping.
what a pity what a pity those already skeptical of jacksons qualifications for office saw the boisterous inaugural party as a symbol of all that was wrong with the democratic movement.
supreme court justice joseph story said he had never seen such a mixture of rowdy people from the highest and most polished down to the most vulgar and gross in the nation here was jacksonian democracy at work he shuddered.
the reign of king mob seemed triumphant another guest reported that no arrangements had been made to handle such a large and misbehaving crowd at the white house.
at one point jacksons aides became so concerned for the presidents personal safety that they whisked him out a rear exit to a boardinghouse a few blocks away.
all creation going to the white house in this depiction of andrew jacksons inauguration party satirist robert cruikshank draws a visual parallel to noahs ark suggesting that people from all walks of life were now welcome in the white house.
213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 426 24 10 15 1 52 pm jackson as president 427 jackson as president jackson sought to increase the powers of the presidency at the expense of the legislative and judicial branches.
one of his opponents noted that previous presidents had assumed that congress was the primary branch of government.
jackson however believed that the presidency was superior the ruling political and economic elite must be removed he said for the people are the government and too many government officials had grown corrupt and self serving at the expense of the public interest.
to dislodge the corrupt eastern political elite jackson launched a policy he called rotation in office whereby he replaced many federal officials with his own supporters.
government jobs district attorneys federal marshals customs c ollectors belonged to the people not to career bureaucrats.
democracy he believed was best served when the winning partys newly elected officials appointed new government officials.
such partisan behavior came to be called the spoils system since as a prominent new york democrat declared to the victor belong the spoils jackson also sought to cut federal spending to help pay off the federal debt a national curse he supported internal improvements that were truly national in scope promoted a judicious tariff and called for the relocation of the ill fated race of indians still living in the east to new lands across the mississippi river so that they could be protected while their ancestral lands were confiscated sold and developed.
the eaton affair yet jackson soon found himself preoccupied with squabbles within his own cabinet.
from the outset his administration was divided between supporters of secretary of state martin van buren and those allied with vice president john c calhoun of south carolina both of whom wanted to succeed jackson as president.
jackson turned mostly to van buren for advice because he did not trust calhoun a yale graduate of towering intellect and fiery determination.
although earlier a nationalist calhoun now was focused on defending southern interests especially the preservation of the slave based cotton economy that had made him a wealthy planter.
in his rivalry with calhoun van buren took full advantage of a juicy social scandal known as the peggy eaton affair.
widower john eaton a former u s senator from tennessee was one of jacksons closest friends.
eaton had also long been associated with margaret peggy oneale timberlake an outspoken washington temptress married to john timberlake a naval officer frequently at sea.
213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 427 24 10 15 1 52 pm 428 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 the flirtatious peggy timberlake was devastatingly attractive to the men who kept her company while her husband was away.
the ambitious daughter of an innkeeper peggy enjoyed the attentions of men young and old she took special delight in senator john eaton.
in april 1828 john timberlake died at sea.
although the official cause of death was respiratory failure rumors swirled that he had committed suicide after learning of his wifes affair with eaton.
resident soon after the 1828 presidential election john eaton had written p elect jackson to alert him of the spiteful gossip aimed at himself and peggy timberlake.
jackson responded quickly and firmly marry her and you will be in a position to defend her eaton did so on january 1 1829.
eatons enemies quickly criticized the unseemly haste of the marriage and continued to savage peggy eaton as a whore.
louis mclane a u s senator from delaware who would later serve in jacksons cabinet gleefully sneered that eaton soon to be named jacksons secretary of war has just married his mistress and the mistress of eleven dozen others floride calhoun the vice presidents imperious wife especially objected to peggy eatons unsavory past.
at jacksons inaugural ball she openly ignored her as did the other cabinet members wives.
the constant gossip led jackson to explode shouting that i did not come here to washington to make a cabinet for the ladies of this place but for the nation in his view women had no right to mix politics with social life their doing so was nothing more than vicious meddling.
he demanded loyalty from his administrative team and their wives.
for his part calhoun acknowledged that his wife floride had a suspicious and fault finding temper that caused much vexation in the family upon hearing about the spat in washington louisa adams wife of the former president john quincy adams reported that war had been declared between some of the ladies in the city and ladies wars are always fierce and hot peggy eatons plight reminded jackson of the mean spirited gossip that had plagued his own wife rachel.
intensely loyal to john eaton the president defended peggy insisting that she was as pure as a virgin his cabinet members however were unable to cure their wives of what martin van buren dubbed the eaton malaria nor did peggy eaton help her own cause.
she once said that i never had a lover who was not a gentleman her social enemies she explained were so very jealous of me because none of them had beauty accomplishments or graces in society of any kind the rumoring and sniping continued month after month and became a time consuming distraction for the president.
jackson blamed the eaton scandal also known as the petticoat affair on his rivals henry clay and john c calhoun the latter whom he called a villain the president assumed that calhoun and his wife had targeted john eaton 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 428 24 10 15 1 52 pm jackson as president 429 because he did not support calhouns desire to be the next president.
one of calhouns friends wrote in april 1829 that the united states was governed by the president the president by the secretary of w ar and the latter by his wife jackson concluded that the scheming calhoun was one of the most dangerous men living a man devoid of principle who would sacrifice his friend his country and forsake his god for selfish personal ambition the maysville road veto when jackson was not dealing with the petticoat affair he deci sively used his executive authority to limit the role of the federal government while at the same time delivering additional blows to rivals john c calhoun and king andrew the first opponents henry clay.
in 1830 congress passed a bill considered jacksons veto of the maysville road bill an abuse of power.
pushed by calhoun and clay that autho this cartoon shows king andrew rized the use of federal monies to build trampling on the constitution internal a sixty mile long road across the state of improvements and the bank of the kentucky from the city of maysville to united states.
lexington clays hometown.
president jackson vetoed the bill on the grounds that the proposed road was a purely local matter being solely in the state of kentucky and thus outside the domain of congress because it was not an interstate project.
clay was stunned.
we are all shocked and mortified by the rejection of the maysville road he wrote a friend.
but he had no luck convincing congress to override the presidential veto.
the eastern indians president jacksons forcible removal of indians from their ancestral lands was his highest priority and one of his lowest moments.
like most white frontiersmen he saw indians as barbarians who were to be treated as subjects not nations his national republican opponent henry clay felt the same way arguing that the indians were destined to extinction and not worth preserving 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 429 24 10 15 1 52 pm 430 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 after jacksons election in 1828 he followed up on policies developed by previous presidents by urging that the eastern indians east of the mississippi river be moved to reservations west of the mississippi river in what became oklahoma.
jackson believed that moving the indians would serve their best interests as well as the national interest for the states in the lower south especially the carolinas georgia and alabama were aggressively restricting the rights of indian nations and taking their land.
president jackson often told indian leaders that he was their great father trying to protect them from the greedy state governments.
new state laws in alabama georgia and mississippi abolished tribal units stripped them of their civil rights rejected ancestral indian land claims and denied indians the right to vote or to testify in court.
jackson claimed that relocating the eastern indians was a wise and humane policy that would save them from utter annihilation if tribes tried to hold on to their lands in the face of state actions.
indian removal in 1830 jackson submitted to congress the indian removal act which authorized him to ignore treaty commitments made by previous presidents and to convince the indians remaining in the east and south to move to federal lands west of the mississippi river.
the federal government the new program promised would pay for the indian exodus and give them initial support in their new lands in oklahoma.
jacksons proposal provoked heated opposition not only among the indian peoples but also among reformers who distrusted the presidents motives and doubted the promised support from the federal government.
critics flooded congress with petitions that criticized the removal policy and warned that jacksons plan would bring enduring shame on the nation.
indian leaders were skeptical from the start.
as a federal agent reported they see that our professions are insincere that our promises are broken that the happiness of the indian is a cheap sacrifice to the acquisition of new lands the proposal also sparked intense debate in congress.
theodore frelinghuysen a new jersey national republican gave a s ix hour speech in the senate during which he asked do the obligations of justice change with the color of the skin.
is it one of the prerogatives of the white man that he may disregard the dictates of moral principles when an indian shall be concerned in the end congress answered yes.
the house of representatives and senate both narrowly approved the indian removal bill with most southerners voting for it and northerners against it.
jackson eagerly signed the measure and it became law on may 26 1830.
federal agents thereafter bribed and bullied tribal chiefs to get their consent to relocate to the west.
our doom is 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 430 24 10 15 1 52 pm jackson as president 431 indian removal 1820 1840 mis black hawk war 1832 u so iowa territory 1832 ri ri ver unorganized territory sauk lake huron l a k e m i c h i gan wisconsin terr.

sealed lamented a choctaw warrior.
there is no other course for us but to turn our faces to our new homes toward the setting sun resistance most northern indians gave in to federal threats and were relocated.
in illinois and the wisconsin territory however sauk and fox indians fought to regain their ancestral lands.
the black hawk war erupted 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 431 24 10 15 1 52 pm 432 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 in april 1832 when chief black hawk led 1 000 sauks men women and erritory back across the mischildren who had been relocated to the iowa t sissippi river to their homeland in illinois land shared with the fox nation.
after several skirmishes indiana and illinois militia chased the sauk and fox into the wisconsin territory and caught them on the eastern bank of the mississippi river a few miles downstream from the mouth of the bad axe river.
the soldiers misinterpreted the indians effort to surrender and fighting erupted.
in what became known as the bad axe massacre the militiamen murdered hundreds of women and children as they tried to escape.
the soldiers then scalped the dead indians and cut long strips of flesh from several of them for use as strops to sharpen razors.
six weeks later the sauk leader black hawk was captured and imprisoned.
in florida the seminoles led by osceola called by u s soldiers the still unconquered red man ferociously resisted the federal removal policy.
for eight years the seminoles would fight a hit and run guerrilla war in the swamps of the everglades the longest most costly and deadliest war ever fought by native americans.
some 1 500 americans were killed.
at times seminole women killed their children rather than see them captured.
but their heroic resistance waned after 1837 when osceola was treacherously captured under a white flag of truce imprisoned and left to die of malaria at fort moultrie near charleston south carolina.
after 1842 only a few hundred seminoles remained hiding in the swamps.
it was not until 1934 that the few surviving seminoles in florida became the last native american tribe to end its war with the united states.
the cherokees the cherokee nation also tried to defy the federal removal policy.
a largely agricultural people cherokees had long occupied northwest georgia and the mountainous areas of northern alabama eastern tennessee and western north carolina.
in 1827 relying upon their established treaty rights the cherokees adopted a constitution as an independent nation in which they declared that they were not subject to the laws or control of any state or federal government.
georgia officials had other ideas.
in 1828 shortly after jacksons election the georgia government announ ced that after june 1 1830 the authority of state law would extend to the cherokees.
they would no longer be a nation within a nation the barbarous and savage tribes must give way to the march of white civilization.
under the new state laws they would not be allowed to vote own property or testify against whites in court.
the discovery of gold in north georgia in 1829 had increased whites lust for cherokee land attracted trespassing prospectors and led to the new state 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 432 24 10 15 1 52 pm jackson as president 433 law.
it prohibited the cherokees from digging for gold on their own lands.
the cherokees sought relief in the supreme court arguing that we wish to remain on the land of our fathers.
we have a perfect and original right to remain without interruption or molestation in cherokee nation v georgia 1831 chief justice john marshall ruled that the cherokees had an unquestionable right to maintain control of their ancestral lands but the court could not render a verdict because of a technicality the cherokees had filed suit as a foreign nation when in marshalls view they were domestic dependent nations if it were true that wrongs have been inflicted marshall explained this is not the tribunal which can redress the past or prevent the future the following year the supreme court did rule in favor of the cherokees in worcester v georgia 1832.
the case arose when georgia officials arrested a group of white christian missionaries who were living among the cherokees in violation of a state law forbidding such interaction.
two of the missionaries samuel worcester and elihu butler were sentenced to four years at hard labor.
they appealed to the supreme court.
in the worcester case john marshall said the missionaries must be released.
the anti cherokee laws passed by the georgia legislature he declared had violated the constitution laws and treaties of the united states he added that the cherokee nation was a distinct political community within which georgia law had no force.
both supreme court decisions favored the cherokee argument that their ancestral lands could not be taken from them in part because they had cherokees divided while many earlier signed treaties with the state and cherokee elite fought against jacksons federal governments confirming their policies elias boudinot editor of the rights to those lands.
president jack first native american newspaper son however refused to enforce the cherokee phoenix signed the indian removal treaty in 1835.
he was courts wicked decisions claiming subsequently murdered.
that he had no constitutional authority 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 433 24 10 15 1 52 pm 434 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 to intervene in georgia.
a new york newspaper editor reported that jackson said john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it thereafter jackson gave the cherokees and other indian nations a terrible choice either abide by the discriminatory new state laws or relocate to government owned lands west of the mississippi river which would be theirs forever jackson told the creeks that they and whites could not live in harmony and peace if they remained on their ancestral lands and told them that a speedy removal to the west was their only option.
soon georgia officials began selling cherokee lands.
the irony of the new georgia policy was that of all the southern tribes the cherokees had come closest to adopting the customs of white america.
they had abandoned traditional hunting practices to develop farms build roads schools and churches and create trading posts and newspapers.
many cherokees had married whites adopted their clothing and food and converted to christianity.
and the cherokees owned some 2 000 enslaved african americans.
the trail of tears the federal officials responsible for implementing the indian removal act developed a strategy of divide and conquer with the cherokees.
in 1835 for example a minority faction of the cherokees trail of tears thousands of cherokees died on a nightmarish march from georgia to oklahoma after being forced from their native lands.
213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 434 24 10 15 1 52 pm jackson as president 435 signed the fraudulent treaty of new echota which was rejected by 90 percent of the cherokee people but readily accepted by the u s senate and enforced by the u s army.
in 1838 after president jackson had left office and martin van buren was president 17 000 cherokees were evicted and moved west under military guard on the trail of tears an 800 mile forced journey marked by the cruelty of soldiers and the neglect of irresponsible private contractors assigned to manage the process.
some 4 000 of the refugees died along the way.
van burens favorite niece was so upset by the treatment of the indians that she opposed her uncles reelection.
for his part president van buren told congress in december 1838 that he took sincere pleasure in reporting that the entire cherokee nation had been relocated.
the trail of tears was according to a white georgian the cruelest work i ever knew a few cherokees held out in the mountains of north carolina they became known as the eastern band of cherokees.
the creeks and chickasaws followed the trail of tears a few years later after alabama and mississippi used the same techniques as the georgia government to take control of their tribal lands.
some 100 000 eastern indians were relocated to the west during the 1820s and 1830s and the government sold some 100 million acres of indian land most of it in the prime cotton growing areas of georgia alabama and mississippi known as the old southwest.
the bank war jackson showed the same principled stubbornness in dealing with the national bank as he did in removing the indians.
the first bank of the united states b u s.
had been renewed in 1816 as the second bank of the united states which soon became the largest corporation in the nation and the only truly national business enterprise.
the second b u s.
the federal government owned only 20 percent of the banks capital was a private corporation with extensive public responsibilities and powers.
to benefit the government the b u s.
held all federal funds including tax collections mostly from land sales and tariff revenues and disbursed federal payments for its obligations all in exchange for an annual 1 5 million fee.
the b u s however conducted other business throughout the country like a commercial bank and was free to use the government deposits in its vaults as collateral for loans it made to businesses around the country.
headquartered in philadelphia and supported by twenty nine branches around the nation the b u s.
competed with state chartered banks for local business.

helped accelerate business expansion by making loans to individuals businesses and state banks.
it also helped promote a stable money supply and deter excessive lending by requiring the 464 state banks to keep enough gold and silver coins called specie in their vaults to back their own paper currency which they in turn loaned to individuals and businesses.
prior to the b u s.
being reestablished the number of unstable and unregulated state banks had increased dramatically.
most of them issued their own paper money and half of those created between 1810 and 1820 had gone bankrupt by 1825.
the primary benefit of the b u s.
was its ability to monitor and regulate many of the state banks.
with federal revenues soaring from land sales during the early 1830s the b u s led by the brilliant but arrogant nicholas biddle had accumu oney and economic power.
even though lated massive amounts of m the b u s.

is likened to fighting a hydra a many headed serpent from greek mythology.
just as the hydra would sprout two heads when one was severed for each b u s.
supporter that jackson subdued even more supporters would emerge to take his place.
213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 436 24 10 15 1 52 pm jackson as president 437 and west feared its growing monopolistic power.
critics claimed that b iddle and the b u s.
directors most of whom lived in the northeast were so focused on their own profits that they were restricting lending by state banks and impeding businesses from borrowing as much as they wanted.
andrew jackson had always hated banks and bankers whom he called vipers and thieves his prejudice grew out of his own experiences with banks in the 1790s when he had suffered huge financial losses.
now as a popularly elected president he claimed to speak for ordinary americans who felt that banks favored the rich and powerful in the east.
jackson also distrusted banks because they printed too much paper money causing prices to rise inflation.
he wanted only gold and silver coins to be used for economic transactions.
i think it right to be perfectly frank with you jackson told biddle in 1829.
i do not dislike your bank any more than i dislike all banks but jackson also disliked biddle because he was everything that jackson was not an easterner born to wealth highly educated financially sophisticated and a world traveler.
ironically biddle had voted for jackson.
the national bank may have become too powerful as jackson charged but the bank war between jackson and biddle revealed that the president never truly understood the national banks role or policies and he continued to let personal animosity drive many of his policy decisions.
had provided a stable monetary system for the expanding economy as well as a mechanism for controlling the pace and integrity of economic growth by regulating the ability of branch banks and state banks to issue paper currency.
the recharter effort although the charter for the b u s.
ran through 1836 nicholas biddle could not afford to wait until then for its renewal.
leaders of the national republican party especially senators henry clay and daniel webster who was a paid legal counsel to the b u s.
told biddle that the charter needed to be renewed before the 1836 presidential election.
they assured him that congress would renew the charter leading the impolitic biddle to grow overconfident about the banks future.
jackson he said thinks because he has scalped indians.
he is to have his way with the bank biddle and his political allies however failed to appreciate jacksons tenacity and the depth of his hatred for the b u s.
and most voters were on jacksons side.
in the end biddle clay and the national republicans unintentionally handed jackson a popular issue on the eve of the election.
at their nominating convention in december 1831 the national republicans endorsed clay as their presidential candidate and approved the renewal of the b u s.
213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 437 24 10 15 1 52 pm 438 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 early in the summer of 1832 both houses of congress passed the bank recharter bill in part because biddle provided bribes to win votes.
upon learning of such shenanigans jacksons chief of staff concluded that the b u s.
was becoming desperate caught in its own net biddle webster and clay assumed that jackson would not veto the recharter bill because doing so might cost him reelection.
should jackson veto the bill clay boasted i will veto him on july 10 1832 however jackson nixed the bill sending it back to congress with a blistering criticism of the banks directors for making the rich richer and the potent more powerful while discriminating against the humble members of s ociety the farmers mechanics and laborers daniel webster accused jackson of using the bank issue to stir up the poor against the rich to henry clay jacksons veto represented another example of the presidents desire to concentrate all power in the hands of one man clay and webster however could not convince the senate to override the veto thus setting the stage for a nationwide financial debate and a dramatic presidential campaign.
the overriding issue in the election was the future of the bank of the united states.
let the people decide jackson argued.
i have now done my duty to the citizens of this country he said in explaining his veto.
if sustained by my fellow citizens in the upcoming election i shall be grateful and happy if not i shall find in the motives which impel me ample grounds for contentment and peace nullification andrew jackson eventually would veto twelve congressional bills more than all previous presidents combined.
critics claimed that his behavior was monarchical in its frequent defiance of the will of congress.
jackson however believed that the president represented all of the people unlike congressmen who were elected locally.
his commitment to nationalism over sectionalism was nowhere more evident than in his handling of the nullification crisis in south carolina.
in that volatile situation he would greatly expand the scope of presidential authority by forcing the nullifiers to back down.
calhoun and the tariff vice president john c calhoun became president jacksons fiercest critic because of changing economic conditions in his home state of south carolina.
the financial panic of 1819 had sparked a nationwide depression.
through the 1820s south carolina continued to suffer from a collapse in cotton prices.
the state lost almost 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 438 24 10 15 1 52 pm nullification 439 70 000 people during that ten year period the result of residents moving west in search of cheaper and more fertile land for growing cotton.
twice as many would leave during the 1830s.
most south carolinians blamed their woes on the tariff of 1828 which was labeled the tariff of abominations.
by taxing british cloth coming into u s markets the tariff hurt southern cotton growers by reducing british demand for raw cotton from america.
it also hurt southerners by john c calhoun during the civil war raising the prices they had to pay for the confederate government printed imported products.
the tariff debate but never issued a one cent postage revealed how the north and south had stamp bearing this likeness of calhoun.
developed different economic interests and different ways of protecting those interests.
massachusetts was prospering while south carolina was struggling.
in a lengthy pamphlet called the south carolina exposition and protest 1828 calhoun claimed that the tariff of 1828 favored the interests of new england textile manufacturing over southern agriculture.
under such circumstances he argued a state could nullify or veto a federal law it deemed unconstitutional.
nullification was the ultimate weapon for those determined to protect states rights against federal authority.
as president jackson and others pointed out however allowing states to pick and choose which federal laws they would follow would create national chaos which he would not allow.
clash of t itans webster versus hayne the controversy over the tariff of 1828 simmered until 1830 when the webster hayne debate in congress sharpened the lines between states rights and national authority.
in a fiery speech senator robert y hayne of south carolina argued that the anti slavery yankees were invading the south making war upon her citizens and endeavoring to overthrow her principles and institutions in haynes view the union was created by the states and the states therefore had the right to nullify federal laws.
the independence of the states was to him more important than the preservation of the union.
massachusetts senator daniel webster quickly challenged haynes arguments.

abraham lincoln later called it the very best speech ever delivered even hayne was awestruck.
he told webster that a man who can make such speeches as that ought never to die in the end webster rather than hayne had the better argument.
president jackson did not attend the debate but he kept abreast of it from the white house.
when he asked an aide how webster was doing the answer was what he wanted he is delivering a most powerful speech.
demolishing our friend hayne the president was pleased.
as jackson said the constitution and its laws remained supreme calhoun versus jackson that jackson like calhoun was a cotton planting slaveholder led many southerners to assume that the president would support their resistance to the federal tariff.

he then turned on them with the same angry force he had directed toward the advancing british army at new orleans in 1815.
on april 13 1830 the democratic party hosted scores of congressmen and political leaders at the first annual jefferson day dinner.
when it was jacksons turn to salute jeffersons memory he rose to his feet raised his glass and while glaring at calhoun growled our union it must be preserved people gasped knowing that the vice president as if challenged to a duel must reply to jacksons threat to the southern weapon of nullification.
calhoun stood and trembling with emotion countered with a defiant toast to the union next to our liberty the most dear in that dramatic exchange jackson and calhoun laid bare the fundamental tension between federal authority and states rights that has remained one of the animating themes of the american republic.
soon thereafter another incident deepened the hatred between the two men.
on may 12 1830 the president saw for the first time a letter from 1818 in which calhoun then secretary of war in the monroe administration had wanted to discipline general jackson for his unauthorized invasion of spanish held florida.
after exchanging heated letters about the incident with calhoun jackson told a friend that he was finally through with the double dealing of j c c the rift between the two proud men prompted jackson to take a dramatic step suggested by secretary of state martin van buren his closest and most cunning adviser.
during one of their daily horseback rides together van buren offered himself up as a sacrifice as a way to remove all calhoun supporters from the cabinet and thereby end the ongoing eaton affair that had fractured the administration.
as the first step in the planned cabinet coup van buren convinced john eaton to resign as secretary of war on april 4 1831.
four days later van buren resigned as secretary of state.
the long agony is over crowed samuel ingham the secretary of the treasury in a letter to attorney general john berrien.
v b and major eaton have resigned what ingham and berrien did not realize was that a few days later jackson would force t hem both calhoun supporters to resign as well.
jackson now had a clean slate on which to create another cabinet.
never before had a president dismissed his entire cabinet.
critics saw through the secretary of states scheme mr.
van buren may be called the great magician wrote the new york courier for he raises his wand and the whole cabinet disappears others claimed that the cabinet purge showed ewspaper that jackson did not have the political skill to lead the nation.

the ousted treasury secretary chose instead to retreat to his home in pennsylvania.
after the eatons left washington d c a gloating henry clay retrieved william shakespeares characterization of egyptian queen cleopatra to mark peggys departure age cannot wither nor time stale her infinite virginity the rats leaving a falling house during his first term jackson was beset by dissension within his administration.
here public confidence in the stability of this administration is toppling.
new cabinets by the end of august 1831 jackson had appointed a new cabinet all of whom agreed to treat peggy eaton with respect.
at the same time jackson increasingly relied upon the advice of martin van buren and others making up the presidents so called kitchen cabinet an informal group of close friends and supporters many of them democratic newspaper editors.
the kitchen cabinet soon convinced jackson to drop his pledge to serve only one term.
they explained that it would be hard for van buren the presidents chosen successor to win the 1832 democratic nomination because calhoun would do everything in his power to stop h im and calhoun might win the nomination himself.
in early 1831 the washington globe a democratic newspaper announced that jackson would seek a second term.
the conquering hero is again in the field and it must now be seen who are his friends and who are his foes the anti masonic party in 1832 for the first time in a presidential election a third political party entered the field.
the anti masonic 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 442 24 10 15 1 52 pm nullification 443 party grew out of popular hostility toward the masonic fraternal order a large all male social organization that originated in great britain early in the eighteenth century.
the masons often claimed to be the natural leaders of their communities the best men by 1830 more than 2 000 masonic lodges were scattered across the united states with about 100 000 members including andrew jackson and henry clay.
the new anti masonic party owed its origins to a defrocked mason william morgan a fifty two year old unemployed bricklayer in batavia new york.
morgan had been thrown out of the masons because of his joblessness.
seeking revenge he convinced a local printer to publish a widely circulated pamphlet revealing the secret rituals of the masonic order.
masons then tried to burn down the print shop where the pamphlet had been published.
they also had morgan arrested on a trumped up charge of indebtedness.
soon thereafter on september 12 1826 someone paid for his release from jail and spirited morgan away in a waiting carriage.
a year later a mans decomposed body was found in oak orchard creek near lake ontario.
morgans grieving wife confirmed that it was her husband.
governor dewitt clinton himself a mason offered a reward for anyone who would identify the kidnappers.
the morgan mystery became a major political issue.
new york launched more than twenty investigations into morgans disappearance and presumed murder and conducted a dozen trials of several masons but never gained a conviction.
each legal effort aroused more public indignation because most of the judges lawyers and jurors were masons.
people began to fear that the masons had become a self appointed aristocracy lacking the education and character necessary for self denying civic leadership.
john quincy adams said that disbanding the masonic institution was the most important issue facing us and our posterity suspicions of the masonic order as a tyrannical secret brotherhood intent on subverting democracy gave rise to the grassroots political movement known as the anti masonic party whose purpose was to protect republican values from being corrupted by self serving power hungry masonic insiders.
the anti masons claimed that they were determined to hand down to posterity unimpaired the republic we inherited from our forefathers the new party drew most of its support from new englanders and new yorkers alienated by both the democratic and national republican parties.
anti masonic adherents tended to be rural evangelical protestants many of whom also opposed slavery.
opposition to a fraternal organization was hardly the foundation upon nti masonic party had which to build a lasting political coalition but the a three important firsts to its credit in addition to being the first third party 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 443 24 10 15 1 52 pm 444 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 the verdict of the people george caleb binghams painting depicts a socially diverse electorate suggesting the increasingly democratic politics of the jacksonian era.
with a national base of support it was the first political party to hold a national convention to nominate a presidential candidate and the first to announce a formal platform of specific policy goals.
the 1832 election in preparing for the 1832 election the democrats and the national republicans followed the example of the a nti masonic party by holding presidential nominating conventions of their own for the first time.
in december 1831 the national republicans gathered to nominate henry clay.
jackson endorsed the idea of a nominating convention for the democratic party as well because it gave the people a greater role in choosing nominees.
the democratic convention first adopted the two thirds rule for nomination which prevailed until 1936 when the requirement became a simple majority and then named new yorker martin van buren as jacksons vice presidential running mate.
the democrats unlike the other two parties adopted no formal platform and relied to a substantial degree upon the popularity of the president to carry their cause.
nicholas biddle invested the vast resources of the b u s.
into the campaign against jackson and paid for thousands of pamphlets promoting clay.
by the summer of 1832 clay declared that the campaign is over and i think we have 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 444 24 10 15 1 52 pm nullification 445 won the victory he spoke too soon.
his blinding ego prevented him from seeing the sources of jacksons popularity.
where he dismissed jackson as a power hungry military chief most americans saw the president as someone fighting for their own causes.
clay also failed to understand jacksons effectiveness as a new type of engaged political candidate.
the national intelligencer a newspaper that supported clay acknowledged that jacksons eager participation in campaign events was certainly a new mode of electioneering.
we do not recollect before to have heard of a president of the united states descending in person into the political arena jackson gave stump speeches dived into crowds to shake hands and walked in parades or ate barbecue with loving supporters who cheered and mobbed him.
in the end jackson earned 219 electoral votes to clays 49 and enjoyed a solid victory in the popular vote 688 000 to 530 000.
william wirt the anti masonic candidate carried only vermont winning 7 electoral votes.
dazzled by the presidents strong showing wirt observed that jackson could be president for life if he chooses the nullification crisis in the fall of 1831 jackson tried to defuse the confrontation with south carolina by calling on congress to reduce tariff rates.
congress responded with the tariff of 1832 which lowered rates on some products but kept them high on british cotton fabric and clothing.
the new tariff disappointed calhoun and others in his home state eager for the british to buy more southern cotton.
south carolinians seethed with resentment toward the federal government.
living in the only state where enslaved africans were a majority of the population they feared that if the northern representatives in congress were powerful enough to create such high tariffs that proved so harmful to the south they might eventually vote to end slavery itself.
calhoun declared that the peculiar domestic institutions of the southern states by which he meant slavery were at stake.
south carolina nullifiers in november 1832 just weeks after jackson was reelected a special convention in south carolina passed an ordinance of nullification that disavowed the unconstitutional federal tariffs of 1828 and 1832 declaring them null void and no law.
if federal authorities tried to use force to collect the tariffs on foreign goods unloaded in charleston harbor south carolina would secede from the union they vowed.
the state legislature then selected senator robert hayne as governor and named calhoun to replace him as u s senator.
at the end of december 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 445 24 10 15 1 52 pm 446 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 south carolina ordinance of nullification the 1832 ordinance repudiated two federal tariffs designed to protect northern industries.
though armed conflict was avoided the same tensions that led to nullification would later lead to south carolinas secession.
calhoun resigned as vice president so that he could openly defend his nullification theory in congress and oppose president jacksons tyrannical actions.
jackson says no to nullification president jacksons public response was moderate.
he promised to use firmness and forbearance with south carolina but stressed that nullification means insurrection and war and the other states have a right to put it down in private however jackson was furious.
he asked the secretary of war how many soldiers it would take to go to south carolina and crush the monster nullification in its cradle he also threatened to hang calhoun and other nullifiers if there were any bloodshed.
surely the president is exaggerating governor hayne of south carolina remarked to senator thomas hart benton of missouri.
benton who years before had been in a fistfight with jackson replied i have known general jackson a great many years and when he speaks of hanging it is time to look for a rope during the fall of 1832 most northern state legislatures passed resolutions condemning the nullificationists.
at the same time the s laveholder dominated southern states expressed sympathy for south carolina but none endorsed nullification.
we detest the tariff explained a mississippian but we will hold to the union south carolina was left standing alone against jackson.
on december 10 1832 the unyielding jackson issued his official response to the people of south carolina.
in his blistering proclamation he dismissed nullification as an absurdity a mad project of disunion that was incompatible with the existence of the union contradicted expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded and destructive of the great object for which it was formed he warned that nullification would lead to secession formal withdrawal of a state from the united states and secession meant civil war.

disunion by armed force is treason.
are you really ready to incur its guilt clay steps in president jackson then sent federal soldiers and a warship to charleston to protect the federal customhouse where tariffs were applied to imported products arriving on ships from europe.
governor hayne responded by mobilizing the state militia and the two sides edged toward a violent confrontation.
a south carolina unionist reported to jackson from charleston that many reckless and dangerous men were looking for civil war and scenes of bloodshed while taking forceful actions jackson still wanted peaceably to nullify the nullifiers in early 1833 the president requested from congress the authority to use the u s army to force compliance with federal law in south carolina.
calhoun exploded on the senate floor exclaiming that he and the others defending his states constitutional rights were being threatened by what they called the force bill to have our throats cut and those of our wives and children the greatest threat facing the nation he argued was not nullification but presidential despotism.
calhoun and the nullifiers however soon backed down and the south carolina legislature postponed the implementation of the nullification ordinances in hopes that congress would pass a more palatable tariff bill.
passage of a compromise bill however depended upon the support of senator henry clay himself a slaveholding planter who finally yielded to those urging him to step in and save the day for the union.
a fellow senator told clay that these south carolinians are good fellows and it would be a pity to see jackson hang them clay agreed.
on february 12 1833 he circulated a plan suggested by jackson to reduce gradually over several years the federal tariff on key imported items.
clay urged congress to treat south carolina with respect and display that great principle of compromise and concession which lies at the bottom of our institutions the tariff reductions were less than south carolina preferred but clays compromise helped the nullifiers out of the dilemma they had created.
calhoun supported the compromise he who loves the union must desire to see this agitating question the tariff brought to a termination on march 1 1833 jackson signed into law the compromise tariff and the force bill the latter being a symbolic statement of the primacy of the union.
calhoun rushed home to convince the rebels in his state to back down.
the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification of the tariff acts.
in a face saving gesture the delegates nullified the force bill which jackson no longer needed.

jackson had defended the supremacy of the union without firing a shot and south carolinas persistence had brought tariff reductions.
joel poinsett a south carolina unionist was overjoyed with the resolution.
we have beat the nullifiers and things are quiet for a time poinsett however added that the next crisis would force a choice between union and disunion while the immediate crisis was defused however its underlying causes persisted.
southern slaveholders felt increasingly threatened by a nti slavery sentiment in the north.
there is no liberty no security for the south groused south carolina radical robert barnwell rhett.
others agreed.
the struggle so far from being over a defiant calhoun wrote is not more than fairly commenced jackson concluded that the tariff was only the pretext for the nullification crisis and disunion and southern confederacy the real object.
the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question two days after the nullification crisis was resolved jackson was sworn in for a second term as president.
the triumphant jackson observed john quincy adams conquers every thing war over the b u s.
jackson interpreted his lopsided reelection as a decision of the people against the bank having vetoed the charter renewal of the b u s jackson ordered the treasury department to transfer federal monies from the national bank to twenty three mostly western state banks called pet banks by jacksons critics because many were run by the presidents friends and allies.
when the treasury secretary balked jackson fired him.
biddles response b u s.
head nicholas biddle responded by ordering the bank to quit making loans and demanded that state banks exchange their paper currency for gold or silver coins as quickly as possible.
through such deflationary policies the desperate biddle was trying to bring the economy to a halt create a depression and thus reveal the importance of maintaining the national bank.
an enraged jackson said the b u s.
under biddle was trying to kill me but i will kill it biddles plan to create a national financial crisis worked.
northern democrats worried that the presidents lawless and reckless bank war would ruin the party.
but jackson refused to flinch.
when state bankers visited the white house to plead for relief jackson told them to go see nicholas biddle.
we have no money here gentlemen.
biddle has all the money in the senate calhoun and clay led the fight against jackson.
they argued that jacksons transfer of government cash from the b u s.
to the pet banks was illegal.
on march 28 1834 clay convinced a majority in the senate to censure 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 448 24 10 15 1 52 pm war over the b u s.
449 jackson for his actions the only time a u s president has been reprimanded in this way as opposed to actual impeachment.
jackson was so angry about being censured that he wanted to challenge clay to a duel so that he could bring the rascal to a dear account the new whig party the presidents war on the bank led his opponents to create a new political party whose diverse members were unified by their hatred of jackson.
his critics claimed that he was ruling like a monarch they dubbed him king andrew the first and called his democratic supporters tories.
the new a nti jackson coalition called themselves whigs a name that linked them to the patriots of the american revolution as well as to the parliamentary opponents of the tories in britain.
andrew jackson preferred to call them federalists.
the whig party grew directly out of the national republican party led by john quincy adams henry clay and daniel webster.
the whigs also found support among the anti masons and even some democrats who resented jacksons war on the national bank.
of the forty one democrats in congress who had voted against jackson on rechartering the national bank twenty eight had joined the whigs by 1836.
the whigs like the national republicans they replaced were economic nationalists who wanted the federal government to promote manufacturing support a national bank and finance a national road network.
in the south the whigs tended to be bankers and merchants.
in the west the whigs were funded internal improvements.
mostly farmers who valued g overnment unlike the democrats who attracted catholic voters from germany and ire ative born protestants congregationalists presland whigs tended to be n byterians methodists and baptists who advocated social reforms such as the abolition of slavery and efforts to restrict alcoholic beverages.
for the next twenty years the whigs and the democrats would be the two major political parties.
in 1834 the editor of the richmond whig newspaper gave a c lass based explanation of the whig opposition to jacksonian democracy.
the jacksonians he wrote have denounced the rich and intelligent.
as aristocrats.
they have caressed soothed and flattered the heavy larger class of the poor and ignorant because they held the power which they wanted by appealing to the masses jacksonians had overturned the republican system created by the founding fathers the republic has degenerated into a democracy in general the democrats north and south were solidly in support of slavery while the whigs were increasingly divided on the issue.

jackson exulted in his glorious triumph in killing the bank that mammoth of corruption and power that could print the nations money.
ironically jacksons picture has been on the twenty dollar bill since 1929.
jacksons controversial efforts to destroy the b u s.
aroused so much opposition that some of his congressional opponents talked of impeaching him.
jackson received so many death threats that he decided his political opponents were trying to kill him.
in january 1835 the threat became real.
after attending the funeral service for a member of congress jackson was leaving the capitol when an unemployed english born housepainter named richard lawrence emerged from eart from only a few feet the shadows and pointed a pistol at the presidents h away.
when lawrence pulled the trigger however the gun misfired.
jackson lifted his walking stick and charged at the man who pulled out another pistol but it too miraculously misfired enabling police to arrest him.
jackson assumed that his political foes including john c calhoun had planned the attack.
a jury however decided that lawrence the first person to attempt the assassination of a u s president was insane and ordered him confined in an asylum.
the destruction of the b u s.
illustrated jacksons strengths and weaknesses.
when challenged he was a shrewd and ferocious fighter.
yet his determination to humble biddle and destroy the b u s.
ended up hurting the national economy.
had performed a needed service.
without it there was nothing to regulate the nations money supply or its banks.
the number of banks across the nation more than doubled between 1829 and 1837.
of even greater concern however was that the amount of loans made by these unregulated banks quadrupled preparing the way for a financial panic and a terrible depression.
jackson and the democrats grew increasingly committed to the expansion of slavery westward into the gulf coast states driven by an unstable banking system.
people here are run mad with land speculation wrote a traveler through northern mississippi.
they do business in a kind of frenzy gold was scarce but paper money was plentiful and people rushed to buy lands freed up by the removal of indians.
in 1835 federal land offices in mississippi sold more acres than had been sold across the entire nation just three years before.
the south and west were being flooded by cotton credit paper money and slaves all of which combined to produce mountains of debt.
people used paper money issued by reckless state banks to buy and sell land and slaves.
with the restraining effects of biddles national bank removed scores of new state banks sprouted like mushrooms in the cotton belt each irresponsibly printing its own paper currency that was often lent recklessly to land 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 450 24 10 15 1 52 pm war over the b u s.
451 s peculators and new businesses especially in cotton growing states like mississippi and louisiana.
the result was chaos.
too many banks emerged without adequate capital and with inadequate expertise and integrity.
as senator thomas hart benton one of jacksons most loyal supporters said in 1837 he had not helped his friend jackson kill the b u s.
to create a wilderness of local banks.
i did not join in putting down the paper currency of a national bank to put up a national paper currency of a thousand local banks but that is what happened.
the money question during the 1830s the federal government acquired huge amounts of money from the sale of g overnment owned lands.
initially the treasury department used the annual surpluses from land sales to pay down the accumulated federal debt which it eliminated completely in 1835 the first time that any nation had done so.
by 1836 the federal budget was generating an annual budget surplus which led to intense discussions about what to do with the increasingly worthless paper money flowing into the treasurys vaults.
the surge of unstable paper money peaked in 1836 when events combined to play havoc with the economy.
two key initiatives endorsed by the jackson administration would devastate the nations financial system and throw the surging economy into a sudden tailspin.
first in june 1836 congress approved the distribution act initially proposed by henry clay and daniel webster that required the federal government to distribute to the states surplus federal revenue from land sales.
the federal surplus would be deposited into eighty one state banks in proportion to each states representation in congress.
the state governments would then draw upon those deposits to fund roads bridges and other internal improvements including the construction of new public schools free to everyone.
second a month later in july jackson issued the specie circular 1836 which announced that the federal government would accept only specie gold or silver coins in payment for land purchased by speculators farmers could still pay with paper money.
westerners were upset by the specie circular because most of the government land sales were occurring in their states.
they helped convince congress to pass an act overturning jacksons policy.
the president however vetoed it.
once enacted the deposit and distribution act and the specie circular put added strains on the nations already tight supplies of gold and silver.
eastern banks had to transfer much of their gold and silver reserves to western banks.
as eastern banks reduced their reserves of gold and silver coins they 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 451 24 10 15 1 52 pm 452 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 new method of assorting the mail as practised by s outhern slave holders or attack on the post office charleston s c 1835 on the wall of the post office a sign reads 20 000 reward for tappan referring to the bounty placed on the head of arthur tappan founder and president of the american anti slavery society.
had to reduce their lending.
soon the o nce bustling economy began to slow into a recession as the money supply contracted and it proved much more difficult for individuals and businesses to get loans.
nervous depositors rushed to their local banks to withdraw their money only to learn that there was not enough specie in their vaults to redeem their deposits.
censoring the mail while concerns about the strength of the economy grew slavery emerged again as a flashpoint issue.
in 1835 northern organizations pushing for the immediate abolition of slavery began mailing anti slavery pamphlets and newspapers to prominent white southerners hoping to convince them to end the peculiar institution they found little support.
francis pickens of south carolina urged southerners to stop the abolitionists from spreading their lies angry p ro slavery south carolinians in charleston broke into the federal post office stole bags of the abolitionist mailings and ceremoniously burned them.
southern state legislatures passed laws banning such dangerous publications.
jackson asked congress to pass a 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 452 24 10 15 1 52 pm war over the b u s.
453 federal censorship law that would prohibit incendiary materials intended to incite the slaves to insurrection congress took action in 1836 but instead of banning abolitionist materials a bipartisan group of democrats and whigs reaffirmed the sanctity of the federal mail.
as a practical matter however southern post offices began censoring the mail anyway arguing that federal authority ended when the mail arrived at the post office door.
jackson decided not to enforce the congressional action.
his failure of leadership created what would become a growing split in the democratic party over the future of slavery.
some democrats decided that jackson for all of his celebrations of democracy and equality was no different from john c calhoun and other southern white racists.
the controversy over the mails proved to be a victory for the growing abolitionist movement.
one anti slavery publisher said that instead of stifling their efforts jackson and the southern radicals put us and our principles up before the world just where we wanted to be abolitionist groups started mailing their pamphlets and petitions to members of congress.
james hammond a pro slavery south carolinian called for congress to ban such a nti slavery petitions.
when that failed congress in 1836 adopted an informal solution suggested by martin van buren whenever a petition calling for the end of slavery was introduced someone would immediately move that it be tabled rather than discussed.
the plan van buren claimed would preserve the harmony of our happy union the supporters of this gag rule soon encountered a formidable obstacle in john quincy adams the former president who now was a congressman from massachusetts.
he devised an array of procedures to get around the rule to squelch all a nti slavery discussion.
henry wise a virginia opponent called adams the acutest the astutest the archest enemy of southern slavery that ever existed in the 1838 1839 session of congress thanks to adams some 1 500 anti slavery petitions were filed with 163 845 signatures.
andrew jackson dismissed adams his old rival as the most reckless and depraved man living the election of 1836 in 1835 eighteen months before the presidential election the democrats nominated jacksons handpicked successor vice president martin van buren.
the whig coalition united chiefly in its opposition to jackson adopted a strategy of multiple candidates hoping to throw the election into the house of representatives.
the whigs put up three regional candidates new englander daniel webster hugh lawson white of tennessee and william henry harrison of indiana.
but the multicandidate strategy failed.
in the popular vote of 1836 van buren 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 453 24 10 15 1 52 pm 454 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 defeated the entire whig field winning 170 electoral votes while the others combined to collect only 113 the eighth president martin van buren was a skillful politician whose ability to organize and manipulate legislators had earned him the nickname little magician elected governor of new york in 1828 he had resigned to join andrew jacksons cabinet first as secretary of state and then as vice president in 1833.

only for his short stature but also his van buren had been jacksons clos magical ability to exploit his political est political adviser and most trusted and social connections.
ally but many people considered him too self centered to do the work of the people.
john quincy adams wrote in his diary that van buren was by far the ablest of the jacksonians but that he had wasted most of his ability upon mere personal intrigues.
his principles are all subordinate to his ambition van burens rival john c calhoun was even more cutting.
he is not of the rder the fox race of the lion or the tiger rather he belongs to a lower o at his inauguration van buren promised to follow in the footsteps of the enormously popular president jackson.
before he could do so however the nations financial sector began collapsing.
on may 10 1837 several large state banks in new york running out of gold and silver suddenly refused to convert customers paper money into coins.
other banks across the nation quickly did the same creating a panic among depositors across the nation.
more than a third of the banks went under.
this financial crisis the worst yet faced by the young nation would become known as the panic of 1837.
it would soon mushroom into the countrys worst depression lasting some seven years.
the panic of 1837 the causes of the financial crisis went back to the jackson administration but van buren got the blame.
the problem actually started in europe.
during the mid 1830s great britain americas largest trading partner experienced an acute financial crisis when the bank of england worried about a run on the gold and silver in its vaults curtailed its loans.

on top of everything else in 1836 there had been a disastrous wheat crop.
in the spring of 1836 niles weekly register the nations leading business journal reported that the economy was approaching a momentous crisis as creditors hastened to foreclose on businesses and farms unable to make their debt payments government spending plunged.
many canals under construction were shut down.
in many cases state governments could not repay their debts.
in the crunch 40 percent of the hundreds of recently created state banks failed.

even the federal government itself having put most of its gold and silver in state banks was verging on bankruptcy.
the national intelligencer newspaper in washington d c reported in may that the federal treasury has not a dollar of gold or silver in the world the poor as always were particularly hard hit.
by the fall of 1837 one third of the nations workers were jobless and those still fortunate enough to be employed had their wages cut by 30 to 50 percent within two years.
at the same time prices for food and clothing soared.
as the winter of 1837 approached a new york city journalist reported that 200 000 people were in utter and hopeless distress with no means of surviving the winter but those provided by charity the nation had a poverty struck feeling politics amid the depression the unprecedented economic calamity would last seven years and send shock waves through the political system.
critics among the whigs called the president martin van ruin because he did not believe that he nor the federal government had any responsibility to rescue hard pressed farmers bankers or businessmen or to provide relief for the jobless and homeless.
any efforts to help people in distress must come from the states not the national government.
he did call a special session of congress in 1837 which canceled the distribution of the federal surplus to the states because there was no surplus to distribute.
how best to deal with the unprecedented depression clearly divided democrats from whigs.
unlike van buren whig henry clay insisted that suffering people were entitled to the protecting care of a parental government to him an enlarged role for the federal government was the price of a maturing expanding republic in which elected officials had an obligation to promote the safety convenience and prosperity of the people.
van buren and the democrats believed that the government had no such obligations.
henry clay among others savaged the president for his cold and heartless attitude.
an independent treasury van buren believed that the federal government should stop risking its cash deposits in the insecure pet state banks that jackson had selected.
instead he wanted to establish an independent treasury system whereby the government would keep its funds in its own vaults and do business entirely in gold or silver not paper currency.
van buren wanted the federal government to regulate the nations supply of gold and silver and let the marketplace regulate the supply of paper currency.
it took van buren more than three years to convince congress to pass the independent treasury act on july 4 1840.

moreover it did nothing to end the widespread suffering caused by the deepening depression.

the continuing hot potato of texas produced considerable damage.

van burens decision outraged his political mentor andrew jackson and aroused strong criticism among southern democrats.
at the same time the depression continued to deepen and the suffering spread leading whigs to grow confident they could win the presidency.
at their nominating convention they passed over henry clay the celebrated kentucky legislator who had been jacksons consistent foe in favor of william henry harrison whose credentials were impressive victor at the battle of tippecanoe against tecumsehs shawnees in 1811 former governor of the indiana territory and former congressman and senator from ohio.

they did however seize upon a catchy campaign slogan tippecanoe and tyler too when a democratic newspaper declared that general harrison was the kind of man who would spend his retirement in a log cabin sipping apple cider on the banks of the ohio river the whigs chose the cider and log cabin symbols to depict harrison as a simple man sprung from the people in contrast to van burens aristocratic lifestyle.
harrison was actually from one of virginias wealthiest families.
harrison defeated van buren easily winning 234 electoral votes to 60.
the whigs had promised a return to prosperity without explaining how it would happen.
it was simply time for a change.
what was most remarkable about the election of 1840 was the turnout.
more than 80 percent of white american men voted many for the first t ime the highest turnout before or since as by this time almost every state had dropped property qualifications for voting.
jacksons legacy the nation that the new p resident elect william henry harrison prepared to govern was vastly different from the one led by george washington and twenty four states thomas jefferson.
in 1828 the united states boasted and nearly 13 million people many of them recent arrivals from germany and ireland.
the national population was growing at a phenomenal rate doubling every twenty three years.
during the so called jacksonian era the unregulated economy witnessed booming industrialization rapidly growing cities rising tensions between the north and south over slavery accelerating westward expansion and the emergence of the second two party system this time featuring democrats and whigs.
a surge in foreign demand for southern cotton and other american goods along with substantial british investment in an array of new american enterprises helped fuel an economic boom and a transportation revolution.
that president elect jackson rode to his inauguration in a horse drawn carriage and left washington d c eight years later on a train symbolized the dramatic changes occurring in american life.
a new political landscape a transformational figure in a transformational era andrew jackson helped reshape the american political landscape.
even his ferocious opponent henry clay acknowledged that jackson had swept over the government.
like a tropical tornado 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 459 24 10 15 1 52 pm 460 chapter 10 the jacksonian era 1828 1840 like all great presidents however jackson left a mixed legacy.
yes he helped accelerate the democratization of american life.
in his 1837 farewell address he stressed his crusade on behalf of the farmer the mechanic and the laboring classes of society the bone and sinew of the country men who love liberty and desire nothing but equal rights and equal laws jackson championed opportunities for the common man to play a greater role in the political arena at the same time that working men were forming labor unions to increase their economic power and political clout.
he helped establish the modern democratic party and attracted to it the working poor and immigrants from eastern cities as well as farmers from the south and east.
through a nimble combination of force and compromise he saved the union by suppressing the nullification crisis.
and with great fanfare on january 1 1835 jackson announced that the government had paid off the national debt accumulated since the revolutionary war which he called a national curse it was the first time in history that a nation had eliminated a large debt.
the washington globe celebrated the momentous occasion by noting that it coincided with the twentieth anniversary of the battle of new orleans writing that new orleans and the national debt the first of which paid off our scores to our enemies whilst the latter paid off the last cent to our friends jacksons concept of the people however was limited to a white mens democracy as it had been for all earlier presidents and the phenomenon of andrew jackson the heroic symbol of the common man and the democratic ideal continues to spark historical debate as it did during his own lifetime.
in 1828 william p anderson a former army officer who had been one of jacksons tennessee horse racing friends and political supporters but had turned into an outspoken opponent wrote an open letter to the presidential candidate that was published in several newspapers.
he attacked jackson for having killed a man in a duel then brutally outlined old hickorys faults your besetting sins are ambition and the love of money.
you are naturally and constitutionally irritable overbearing and tyrannical.
when you become the enemy of any man you will put him down if you can no matter by what means fair or foul.
you are miserably deficient in principle and have seldom or never had power without abusing it although the criticism was too harsh it contained more than a grain of truth.
jackson was so convinced of the rightness and righteousness of his ideals that he was selectively willing to defy constitutional limits on his authority when it suited his interests and satisfied his rage.
he was both the instrument of democracy and its enemy protecting the humble people and the union by expanding presidential authority in ways that the founders had never envi 213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 460 24 10 15 1 52 pm jacksons legacy 461 sioned including removing federal money from the national bank replacing government officials with party loyalists censoring the mails and ending nullification in south carolina.
jackson often declared that the only justification for using governmental power was to ensure equal treatment for everyone the high and the low the rich and the poor yet his own use of government force was at times contradictory and even hypocritical.
while threatening to kill the b u s.
and hang john calhoun and other south carolina nullifiers he refused to intervene when georgia officials violated the legal rights of cherokees.
his aggressive use of presidential authority was less principled than it was political and personal.
his inconsistent approach to executive power both symbolized and aggravated the perennial tension in the american republic between a commitment to democratic ideals and the exercise of presidential authority.
213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 461 24 10 15 1 52 pm chapter review summary jacksons views and policies the jacksonians sought to democratize the political process and expand economic opportunity for the common man that is poor and humble white men.
as the representative of the people andrew jackson expanded the role of the president in economic matters reducing federal spending and eliminating the powerful second bank of the united states.
his bank war painted the national bank as full of vipers and thieves and was hugely popular but jackson did not understand its long term economic consequences.
in addition his views on limited government were not always reflected in his policies.
he left the high taxes from the tariff of abominations 1828 in place until opposition in the south created a national crisis.
indian removal act of 1830 the indian removal act of 1830 authorized the relocation of eastern indians to federal lands west of the mississippi river.
the cherokees used the federal court system to try to block this relocation.
despite the supreme courts decisions in their favor president jackson forced them to move the event and the route they took came to be known as the trail of tears.
by 1840 only a few seminoles and cherokees remained in remote areas of the southeast.
nullification controversy the concept of nullification developed by south carolinas john c calhoun enabled a state to disavow a federal law.
when a south carolina convention nullified the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 jackson requested that congress pass a force bill authorizing the u s army to compel compliance with the tariffs.
after south carolina under the threat of federal military force accepted a compromise tariff put forth by henry clay the state convention nullified the force bill.
the immediate crisis was over with both sides claiming victory.
democrats and whigs jacksons arrogant behavior especially his use of the veto led many to regard him as king andrew the first groups who opposed him coalesced into a new party known as the whigs thus producing the countrys second two party system.
two acts the distribution act and the specie circular ultimately destabilized the nations economy.
jacksons ally and vice president martin van buren succeeded him as president but jacksonian bank policies led to the financial panic of 1837 and an economic depression.
van buren responded by establishing an independent treasury to safeguard the nations economy but offered no help for individuals in distress.
the economic calamity ensured a whig victory in the election of 1840.

213003 10 422 463 r4 th indd 463 24 10 15 1 52 pm the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 the old south one of the enduring myths of the old south is captured in this late nineteenth century painting of a plantation on the mississippi river muscular slaves tending the lush cotton fields a steamboat easing down the wide river and the planters family relaxing in the cool shade of their white columned mansion.
novels and films like gone with the wind 1939 would perpetuate the notion of the old south as a stable paternalistic agrarian society led by white planters who were the natural aristocracy of virtue and talent within their communities.
o f all the regions of the united states during the first half of the nineteenth century the p re civil war old south was the most distinctive.
what had once been a narrow band of settlements along the atlantic coast dramatically expanded westward and southward to form a subcontinental empire rooted in cotton.
the southern states remained rural and agricultural long after the rest of the nation had embraced cities immigrants and factories.
yet the old south was also instrumental in enabling the nations capitalist development and its growing economic stature.
after the war of 1812 s outhern grown cotton became the key raw material driving industrial growth feeding the textile mills of great britain and new england where wage workers toiling over newly invented machines fashioned it into thread yarn and clothing.
the price of raw cotton doubled in the first year after the war and the profits made by cotton producers flowed into the hands of northern and british bankers merchants and textile mill owners.
investors in boston new york city and philadelphia provided loans to southerners to buy more land and more slaves.
northerners also provided the cotton industry with other essential needs insurance financing and shipping.
the story of how southern cotton clothed the world spurred the expansion of global capitalism and transformed history was woven with the threads of tragedy however.
the revolution spawned by the mass production of cotton was rooted in the explosive expansion of slavery across the south and into texas as native americans were pushed off their ancestral lands and relocated focus questions 1.
what factors made the south distinct from the rest of the united states during the early nineteenth century.
what role did cotton production and slavery play in the souths economic and social development.
what were the major social groups within southern white society.
why was each group committed to the continuation and expansion of slavery.
what was the impact of slavery on african americans both free and enslaved throughout the south.
how did enslaved peoples respond to the inhumanity of their situation.
466 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 across the mississippi river.
a group of slaves in virginia recognized the essential role they played in the surging national economy when they asked didnt we clear the land and raise the crops of corn of tobacco rice of sugar of everything.
and then didnt the large cities in the north grow up on the cotton and the sugars and the rice that we made the distinctiveness of the old south people have long debated what set the old south apart from the rest of the nation.
most arguments focus on the regions climate and geography in shaping its culture and economy.
the souths warm humid climate was ideal for cultivating profitable crops such as tobacco cotton rice indigo and sugarcane which led to the plantation system of large commercial agriculture and its dependence upon enslaved labor.
unlike the north the south had few large cities few banks few railroads few factories and few schools.
most southern commerce was related to the storage distribution and sale of agricultural products especially cotton.
with the cotton economy booming investors focused on buying land and slaves there was little reason to create a robust industrial sector.
we want no manufactures we desire no trading no mechanical or manufacturing classes an alabama politician told an english visitor.
profitable farming thus remained the souths ideal pursuit of happiness.
education was valued by the planter elite for their own sons but there was little interest in public schooling for the masses.
the illiteracy rate in the south was three times higher than in the north.
a biracial culture what made the old south most distinctive was not its climate or soil but its expanding system of r ace based slavery.
the majority of southern whites did not own slaves but they supported what john c calhoun called the souths peculiar institution because slavery was so central to their societys way of life.
calhouns carefully crafted phrase allowed southerners to avoid using the charged word slavery while the adjective peculiar implied that slavery was unique to the south as it essentially was.
the profitability and convenience of owning slaves created a sense of social unity among whites that bridged class differences.
poor whites who owned no slaves and resented the planters cotton snobs could still claim racial superiority over enslaved blacks niggers.
because of r ace based slavery explained georgia attorney thomas reade cobb every white feels that he belongs to an elevated class.
it matters not that he is no slaveholder he is not of the inferior race he is a free born citizen the distinctiveness of the old south 467 the old south also differed from other sections of the country in its high proportion of native born americans.
the region attracted few european immigrants after the revolution in part because of geography.
the main shipping routes from britain and europe took immigrants to northern port cities.
because most immigrants were penniless they could not afford to travel to the south.
moreover european immigrants most of whom were manual laborers could not compete with slave labor.
conflicting myths southerners a north carolina editor wrote are a mythological people created half out of dream and half out of slander who live in a still legendary land myths are beliefs made up partly of truths and partly of lies formed with accurate generalizations and willful distortions.
during the nineteenth century a powerful myth emerged among white southerners that the south was both different from and better than the north.
this blended notion of distinctiveness and superiority became central to the self image of many southerners.
even today many southerners tenaciously cultivate a defiant pride and separate identity from the rest of the nation.
in defending the south and slavery from northern critics southerners claimed that their region was morally superior.
kind planters according to the prevailing myth provided happy slaves with food clothing shelter and security in contrast to a north populated with greedy bankers and heartless factory owners who treated their wage laborers worse than slaves.
john c calhoun insisted that in the northern states the quality of life for free people of color had become worse since slavery there had been banned whereas in the south the standard of living among enslaved african americans had improved greatly in every respect in this mythic version of the old south slavery was defended as being beneficial to both slaves and owners.
in aunt philliss cabin or southern life as it is 1852 novelist mary henderson eastman stressed the necessity of the existence of slavery at present in our southern states and claimed that as a general thing the slaves are comfortable and contented and their owners humane and kind the agrarian ideal and the southern passion for guns horsemanship hunting and the military filled in the self gratifying image of the old south as a region of honest small farmers and aristocratic gentlemen young belles and beautiful ladies who led leisurely lives of well mannered graciousness honor and courage all the while sipping mint juleps in a carefree romantic world of w hite columned mansions.
the contrasting myth of the old south was much darker.
northern abolitionists those who wanted an immediate end to slavery pictured the region 468 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 as being built on an immoral economic system dependent on the exploitation of blacks and the displacement of native americans.
in this version of the southern myth the white planters were rarely natural aristocrats like thomas jefferson who were ambivalent about slavery.
more often the planters were viewed as ambitious s elf made men who had seized opportunities to become rich by planting and selling cotton and trading in slaves.
northern abolitionists such as harriet beecher stowe portrayed southern planters as cunning capitalists who raped enslaved women brutalized slaves and lorded over their communities with arrogant disdain.
they treated slaves like cattle broke up their families and sold slaves down the river to toil in the louisiana sugar mills and on rice plantations.
an english woman traveling in the south in 1830 noted that what slaves in virginia and maryland feared most was being sent to the south and sold.
the sugar plantations in louisiana and more than all the rice grounds of georgia and the carolinas are the terror of the american negroes many souths the contradictory elements of these conflicting myths continue to fight for supremacy in the south each pressing its claim to legitimacy in part because the extreme descriptions are both built upon half truths and fierce prejudices.
the south has long been defined by two souls two hearts two minds competing for dominance.
the paradoxes associated with this southern mythmaking provided much of the regions variety for the old south like the new south was not a single culture but a diverse section with multiple interests and perspectives and it was rapidly growing and changing.
the old south included three distinct subsections with different patterns of economic development and diverging degrees of commitment to slavery.
throughout the first half of the nineteenth century the seven states of the lower south south carolina georgia florida alabama mississippi louisiana and parts of texas grew increasingly dependent upon commercial cotton production supported by slave labor.
a traveler in mississippi observed in 1835 that ambitious whites wanted to sell cotton in order to buy n egroes to make more cotton to buy negroes by 1860 slaves represented nearly half the population of the lower south largely because they were the most efficient producers of cotton in the world.
the states of the upper south virginia north carolina tennessee and arkansas had m ore varied agricultural e conomies a mixture of large commercial plantations and small family farms or yeoman farms where crops were grown mostly for household use.
many southern states also had large areas without slavery especially in the mountains of virginia the western car the cotton kingdom 469 atop the cotton kingdom this photograph offers a glimpse of the staggering scale of cotton production.
these 500 pound cotton bales are so densely packed and plentiful that men are walking upon them at this galveston texas port.
olinas eastern tennessee and northern georgia where the soil and climate were not suited to cotton or tobacco.
in the border south delaware maryland kentucky and missouri slavery was slowly disappearing because cotton could not thrive there.
by 1860 approximately 90 percent of delawares black population and half of marylands were already free.
slave owners in the lower south however had a much larger investment in slavery.
they believed that only constant supervision intimidation and punishment would keep the f ast growing population of enslaved workers under control in part because the working and living conditions for the enslaved were so brutal.
id rather be dead said a white overseer in louisiana than a nigger in one of those big sugarcane plantations the cotton kingdom after the revolution as the w orn out tobacco fields in virginia and maryland lost their fertility tobacco farming spread into kentucky and as far west as missouri.
rice continued to be grown in the coastal areas low country of 470 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 the carolinas and georgia where fields could easily be flooded and drained by tidal rivers flowing into the ocean.
sugarcane like rice was also an expensive crop to produce requiring machinery to grind the cane to release the sugar syrup.
during the early nineteenth century only southern louisiana focused on sugar production.
in addition to such cash crops the south led the nation in the production of livestock hogs horses mules and cattle.
southerners both black and white fed themselves largely on pork.
it was the king of the table john s wilson a georgia doctor called the region the republic of porkdom southerners ate pork or bacon morning noon and night corn was on southern plates as often as pork.
during the early summer corn was boiled on the cob by late summer and fall it was ground into cornmeal a coarse flour.
cornbread and hominy as well as a mush or porridge made of whole grain corn mixed with milk were almost daily fare.
king cotton during the first half of the nineteenth century cotton surpassed rice as the most profitable cash crop in the south.
southern cotton called white gold drove much of the national economy and the industrial revolution feeding the mechanized textile mills in new england and great britain.
in fact cotton became one of the transforming forces in n ineteenth century history.
it shaped the lives of the enslaved who cultivated it the planters who grew rich by it the mill girls who sewed it the merchants who sold it the people who wore it and the politicians who warred over it.
cotton is king exclaimed the southern cultivator in 1859 and wields an astonishing influence over the worlds commerce in 1832 over eighty of americas largest companies were new england textile mills converting cotton into thread and cloth.
the cotton kingdom resulted largely from two crucial developments.
until the late eighteenth century cotton fabric was a rarity produced by women in india using hand looms.
then british inventors developed machinery to convert raw cotton into thread and cloth in textile mills.
the mechanical production of cotton made great britain the worlds first industrial nation and the number of british textile mills centered in lancashire grew so fast that owners could not get enough cotton fiber to meet their needs.
american eli whitney solved the problem by constructing the first cotton gin which mechanized the l abor intensive process of manually removing the sticky seeds from the bolls of what was called short staple cotton.
taken together these two breakthroughs helped create the worlds largest industry and transformed the south in the process.
by 1815 just months after andrew jacksons victory over british troops at new orleans some thirty the cotton kingdom 471 british ships were docked at the citys wharves because as an american merchant reported europe must and will have cotton for her manufacturers during that year alone more than 65 000 bales of cotton were shipped down the mississippi river to new orleans.
to be sure other nations joined the global c otton producing revolution india egypt brazil and china but the american south was the driving force of cotton capitalism.
the old southwest because of its warm climate and plentiful rainfall the lower south became the global leader in cotton production.
the regions cheap fertile land and the profits to be made in growing cotton generated a frenzied mobility in which people constantly searched for more opportunities and even better land.
henry watson a new englander who moved to alabama complained in 1836 that nobody seems to consider himself settled here they remain one two three or four years must move on to some other spot the cotton belt moved south and west during the first half of the nineteenth century and hundreds of thousands of l and hungry southerners moved with it.
as the oldest southern states virginia and the carolinas experienced soil exhaustion from the overplanting of tobacco and cotton restless farmers and many sons of planters moved westward to the old southwest western georgia alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas and eventually texas.
in 1820 the coastal states of virginia the carolinas and georgia had produced two thirds of the nations cotton.
by 1830 the old southwest states were producing two thirds of americas cotton.
an acre of land in south carolina produced about 300 pounds of cotton while one acre in alabama or in the mississippi delta a 200 mile wide strip of fertile soil between the yazoo and mississippi rivers could generate 800 pounds.
it was the most profitable farmland in the world.
such profits however required backbreaking labor most of it performed by enslaved blacks.
a white virginian noted in 1807 that there is a great aversion amongst our negroes to be carried to distant parts and particularly to our new countries in the old southwest in marshy areas near the gulf coast slaves were put to work removing trees and stumps from the swampy muck.
none but men as hard as a savage said one worker could survive such wearying conditions.

474 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 enslaved blacks had many of the same reservations about relocating.
almost a million captive african americans in maryland virginia and the carolinas were forced to move to the old southwest during the first half of the nineteenth century.
herded onto steamboats or slave ships or forced to walk hundreds of miles manacled in iron collars and chains they lived in perpetual dread of the gulf states harsh working conditions and broiling summer heat and humidity.
the sight of slave coffles being driven southward aroused a sense of shame in some observers.
one described a wretched cavalcade.
marching half naked women and men loaded with chains without being charged with any crime but that of being black from one section of the united states to another hundreds of miles slaves sent downriver were also despondent about being torn from their wives children and friends.
one song expressed their anguish massa sell poor negro ho heave o.
leave poor wife and children ho heave o some tried to run away.
others maimed themselves to avoid being sent south a woman killed herself because they have carried my children off with em the frontier environment in the old southwest was rude rough and lively.
men had a hell of a lot of fun they often drank gambled and fought.
in 1834 a south carolina migrant urged his brother to move west and join him because you can live like a fighting cock with us most old southwest plantations had their own stills to manufacture whiskey and alcoholism ravaged many frontier families.
violence was commonplace and the frequency of stabbings shootings and murders shocked visitors.
shocking too were the ways that white men abused women both black and white.
an alabama woman was outraged by the beastly passions of the white men who fathered slave children and then sold them like livestock.
she also recorded in her diary instances of men regularly beating their wives.
another woman wrote about a friend whose husband abused her explaining that she had little choice but to suffer in silence for she was wholly dependent upon his care the contrasting gender experiences in the old southwest were highlighted in a letter in which a woman reported all the men is very well pleased but the women is not very well satisfied the spreading cotton kingdom by 1860 the center of the cotton kingdom stretched from eastern north carolina south carolina and georgia through the fertile a labama mississippi black belt so called for the color of the fertile soil through louisiana on to texas and up the mississippi valley as far as southern illinois.
steamboats made the mississippi river the cotton highway by transporting millions of bales downriver from kentucky tennessee arkansas mississippi and louisiana to new orleans where sailing ships took the cotton to the cotton kingdom 475 new york new england great britain and france.
king cotton accounted for more than half of all u s exports.
by 1860 alabama mississippi and louisiana were the three top producing cotton states and two thirds of the richest americans lived in the south.
more millionaires per capita lived in natchez mississippi along the great river than anywhere in the world.
the rapid expansion of the cotton belt ensured that the south became more dependent on enslaved black workers.
more than half of the slaves in the south worked in cotton production.
the dynamic system of slavery was as john quincy adams wrote in his diary the great and foul stain upon the nations commitment to liberty and equality.
it persisted because it was such a powerful engine of economic development and the most tangible sign of economic success.
enterprising young white men judged wealth and status by the number of slaves owned.
by 1860 the dollar value of enslaved blacks outstripped the value of all american banks railroads and factories combined.
the soaring profitability of cotton fostered a false sense of security.
in 1860 a mississippi newspaper boasted that the south safely entrenched behind her cotton bags.
can defy the w orld for the civilized world depends on the cotton of the south cotton bred cockiness.
in a speech to the u s senate in 1858 south carolinas former governor james henry hammond who owned a huge cotton plantation worked by more than 100 slaves warned the critics of slavery in the north you dare not make war on cotton.
no power on earth dares make war upon it.
cotton is king king cotton captured this engraving shows cotton being trafficked in louisiana.
476 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 what hammond failed to acknowledge was that the southern economy had grown dangerously dependent on european demand for raw cotton.
by 1860 great britain was importing more than 80 percent of its cotton from the american south.
hammond and other southern leaders did not anticipate what they could least afford a sudden collapse in world demand for southern cotton.
in 1860 the expansion of the british textile industry peaked and the price paid for southern cotton began a steady decline.
by then however the lower south was committed to l arge scale cotton production for generations to come.
whites in the old south over time the culture of cotton and slavery shaped the souths social structure and provided much of its political power.
unlike in the north and midwest southern society was dominated by an elite group of planters and merchants.
white planters although there were only a few giant plantations in each southern state their owners exercised overwhelming influence.
as a virginian observed in the m id 1830s the old slaveholding families exerted a great deal of control.
and they affected the manner and prejudices of the slaveholding part of the state the large planters behaved like an aristocracy viewing their poor white neighbors with a contempt that was readily reciprocated.
they often spent their time hunting and fishing gambling and racing horses hosting elaborate parties and importing wines and furnishings.
in short they indulged expensive habits and tastes that they often could neither afford nor control.
living the storied life of a planter was the focus of their energies their honor and often their indebtedness.
as a plantation slave recalled his master on sundays liked to gamble run horses or fight g ame cocks discuss politics and drink whisky and brandy and water all day long the richest planters and merchants were determined to retain their control over southern society in part because of self interest and in part because they assumed they were the regions natural leaders.
inequality is the fundamental law of the universe declared one planter.
james henry hammond was even more blunt declaring that the south carolina planters are essentially what the nobility are in other countries.
they stand at the head of society and politics slavery he argued does indeed create an aristocracy an aristocracy of talents of virtue of generosity and courage whites in the old south 477 in addition to its size what distinguished a plantation from a farm was the use of a large number of slaves supervised by drivers and overseers.
planters themselves rarely engaged in manual labor.
they focused on managing the overseers and handling the marketing and sale of the cotton tobacco rice or sugar.
most planters had begun their careers as land traders investors cotton merchants called factors and farmers.
over time they made enough money to acquire a plantation worked by slaves.
frederick stanton a cotton broker near natchez mississippi became a planter with 444 slaves working 15 000 acres of cotton.
success required careful monitoring of the markets for cotton land and slaves as well as careful management of the workers and production.
if as historians have agreed one had to own at least twenty slaves to be called a planter only one out of thirty whites in the south in 1860 was a planter.
eleven planters among the wealthiest people in the nation owned 500 slaves each and one planter a south carolina rice grower owned 1 000.
the 10 000 most powerful planters accounting for less than 3 percent of white men in the south held more than half the slaves.
the gap between the planters and the rest of southern society was wide.
two thirds of white southern families in 1830 owned no slaves.
over time planters and their wives referred to as mistresses grew accustomed to being waited on by slaves day and night.
a virginia planter told a british visitor that a slave girl slept in the master bedroom with him and his wife.
when his british guest asked why he replied good heaven.
if i wanted a glass of water during the night what would become of me from colonial times most southern white men embraced an unwritten social code centered on a prickly sense of personal honor in which they were expected to defend their reputations with words fists knives or guns.
duels to the death called affairs of honor were the ultimate expression of manly honor.
many prominent southern leaders congressmen senators governors editors and planters engaged in duels with pistols although dueling was technically illegal in many states.
the roster of participants included president andrew jackson of tennessee and senator henry clay of kentucky.
but men of all classes were ready to fight at the first sign of disrespect.
the plantation mistress the south like the north was a ale dominated society only more so because of the slave system.
a promm inent georgian christopher memminger explained that slavery heightened the need for a hierarchical social and family structure.
white wives 478 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 and children needed to be as subservient and compliant as enslaved blacks.
each planter he declared is in fact a p atriarch his position compels him to be a ruler in his household and he requires obedience and subordination the plantation mistress seldom led a life of idle leisure nor was she a frail helpless creature focused solely on planning parties and balls.
although she had slaves to attend to her needs she supervised the domestic household in the same way as the planter took care of the cotton business.
overseeing the supply and preparation of food and linens she also managed the housecleaning and care of the sick the birthing of babies and the operations mary boykin chesnut her diary of the dairy.
a plantation slave rememdescribing life in the confederacy bered that her mistress was with all during the civil war was republished in the slave women every time a baby 1981 and won the pulitzer prize.
or when a plague of misery hit the folks she knew what to do and what kind of medicine to chase off the aches and pains the son of a tennessee slaveholder remembered that his mother and grandmother were the busiest women i ever saw in part because they themselves had babies every year or so often birthing over a dozen children during their lifetimes.
mary boykin chesnut a plantation mistress in south carolina complained that there is no slave after all like a wife she admitted that she had few rights in the large household she managed since her husband was the master of the house a wife was expected to love honor obey and serve her husband.
virginian george fitzhugh a celebrated virginia attorney and writer spoke for most southern men when he said that a man loves his children because they are weak helpless and dependent.
he loves his wife for similar reasons planters had little interest in an educated wife.
when people tried to raise funds for a womans college in georgia a planter angrily refused to contribute explaining that all that a woman needs to know is how to read the new testament and to spin and weave clothing for her family.
i would not have one of your graduates for a wife and i will not give you a cent for any such project whites in the old south 479 white women living in a slaveholding culture confronted a double standard in terms of moral and sexual behavior.
they were expected to be examples of christian morality and sexual purity even as their husbands brothers and sons often engaged in self indulgent hedonism gambling drinking carousing and sexually assaulting enslaved women.
under slavery mary chesnut wrote in her famous diary we live surrounded by prostitutes yet she did not blame enslaved women for playing that role.
they were usually forced to do so.
in fact many planters justified their behavior by highlighting the additional money they were creating by impregnating enslaved women.
god forgive us chesnut added but ours is a monstrous system.
like the patriarchs of old our men live all in one house with their wives and their enslaved concubines lovers and the mulattoes people of mixed races one sees in every family partly resemble the white children.
any lady is ready to tell you who is the father of all the mulatto children in everybodys household but her own.
those she seems to think drop from the clouds such a double standard reinforced the arrogant authoritarianism of many white planters.
in the secrecy of her diary mary chesnut used sexual metaphors to express the limitations of most of the carolina planters writing that they are nice fellows but slow to move impulsive but hard to keep moving.
they are wonderful for a spurt but that lets out all of their strength yet for all their private complaints and daily burdens few plantation mistresses including mary chesnut spoke out against the male dominated social order and racist climate.
they largely accepted the limited domestic role assigned them by men such as george howe a south carolina religion professor.
in 1850 he complimented southern women for understanding their subordinate place.
born to lean upon others rather than to stand independently by herself and to confide in an arm stronger than hers the southern woman had no desire for power outside the home he said.
the few women who were demanding equality were unsexing themselves and were despised and detested by their families and communities.
most plantation mistresses agreed with howe.
with but a few exceptions observed julia gardiner tyler the northern born wife of president john tyler a virginia slaveholder women should limit themselves to the roles that god designed for them as wife mother mistress another prominent southern woman mary howard schoolcraft described herself and other plantation wives in south carolina as old fogies who refused to believe that slavery is a sin she could not imagine doing without the comforts and conveniences afforded by slaves overseers and drivers on large plantations overseers managed the slaves and were responsible for maintaining the buildings fences 480 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 and grounds.
they usually were white farmers or skilled workers the sons of planters or simply poor whites eager to rise in stature.
some were themselves slaveholders.
the overseers moved often in search of better wages and cheaper land.
a mississippi planter described white overseers as a worthless set of vagabonds likewise frederick douglass a mulatto who escaped from slavery in maryland said his overseer was a miserable drunkard a profane swearer and a savage monster always armed with a b lood stained bullwhip and a club that he used so cruelly that he even enraged the plantation owner.
the overseer tolerated no excuses or explanations.
to be accused was to be convicted and to be convicted was to be punished douglass said.
usually the highest managerial position a slave could hope for on a plantation was that of driver a favored man whose job was to oversee a small group gang of slaves getting them up and organized each morning by sunrise and then directing their work and punishing them until dark.
over the years there were numerous examples of slaves murdering drivers for being too cruel.
there were a few black overseers.
francis frederic a slave in kentucky remembered that his grandmothers white master was a hard one he appointed her son a slave as the plantations overseer.
after the planter discovered that frederics grandmother had committed the crime of attending an outlawed prayer meeting he ordered her son to give her forty lashes with a thong of a raw cow s hide her master standing over her the whole time blaspheming and threatening what he would do if her son did not lay it on plain white folk about half of white southerners were small farmers plain white folk who were usually uneducated often illiterate and forced to scratch out hardscrabble lives of bare self sufficiency.
these small farmers yeomen typically lived with their families in simple two room cabins on fifty acres or less.
they raised a few pigs and chickens and grew enough corn and cotton to live on.
they traded with neighbors more than they bought from stores.
women on these small farms worked in the fields during harvest time but spent most of their days doing household chores while raising lots of children.
farm children grew up fast.
by age four they could carry a water bucket from the well to the house and collect eggs from the henhouse.
young boys could plant weed and harvest crops feed livestock and milk cows.
the average slaveholder was a small farmer working alongside five or six slaves.
such middling farmers usually lived in a log cabin rather than a columned mansion.
in the backcountry and mountainous regions of the south where slaves and plantations were scarce small farmers dominated the social structure.
southern farmers tended to be fiercely independent and suspicious of government authority and they overwhelmingly identified with the democratic black society in the south 481 party of andrew jackson.
although only a minority of middle class white farmers owned slaves most of them supported the slave system.
they feared that slaves if freed would compete with them for land and jobs and although not wealthy the farmers enjoyed the privileged social status that race based slavery afforded them.
as a white farmer told a northern traveler now suppose they slaves was free.
you see theyd all think themselves as good as we james henry hammond and other rich white planters frequently reminded their white neighbors who owned no slaves that in a slave country every freeman is an aristocrat because blacks are beneath them in the social order.
such racist sentiments pervaded the lower s outh and much of the rest of the n ation throughout the nineteenth century.
poor whites visitors to the old south often had trouble telling small farmers apart from the poor whites a category of desperately poor people who were relegated to the least desirable land and lived on the fringes of society.
the poor whites often derided as crackers hillbillies or trash were usually day laborers or squatters who owned neither land nor slaves.
some 40 percent of white southerners worked as tenants renting land from others or as farm laborers toiling for others.
they frequently took refuge in the pine barrens mountain hollows and swamps after having been pushed aside by the more enterprising and the more successful.
they usually lived in log cabins or shacks and often made their own clothing barely managing each year to keep their families clothed dry and fed.
black society in the south southern society was literally black and white.
whites had the power and enslaved blacks were often treated as property rather than people.
the system of slavery relied on overwhelming force and fear and was intentionally dehumanizing.
we believe the negro to belong to an inferior race one planter declared.
southern apologists for slavery often stressed that african americans were inferior beings incapable of living on their own.
thomas reade cobb proclaimed that they were better off in a state of bondage effective slave management therefore required teaching slaves to understand that they were supposed to be treated like animals.
as henry garner an escaped slave explained the aim of slaveholders was to make you as much like brutes as possible others justified slavery as a form of benevolent paternalism.
george fitzhugh said that the enslaved black was but a grown up child and must be governed as a child 482 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 such self serving paternalism had one ultimate purpose profits.
planters explained a southerner care for nothing but to buy negroes to raise cotton raise cotton to buy negroes in 1818 james steer in louisiana predicted that enslaved blacks would be the best investment that southerners could make.
eleven years later in 1829 the north carolina supreme court declared that slavery existed to increase the profit of the master the role of the slave was to toil while another the owners reap the fruits those in the business of buying and selling slaves reaped huge profits.
one of them reported in the 1850s that a nigger that wouldnt bring over 300 seven years ago will fetch 1000 cash quick this year thomas clemson of south carolina the s on in law of john c calhoun candidly explained that my object is to get the most i can for the property slaves.
i care but little to whom and how they are sold whether together as families or separated owning working and selling slaves was the quickest way to wealth and social status in the south.
the wife of a louisiana planter complained in 1829 that white people talked constantly about how the profits generated by growing cotton enabled them to buy plantations negrows in 1790 the united states had fewer than 700 000 enslaved african americans.
by 1830 it had more than 2 million and by 1860 almost 4 million virtually all of them in the south and border states.
the slave system as the enslaved population grew slaveholders developed an increasingly complex system of rules regulations and restrictions.
formal slave codes in each state regulated the treatment of slaves in order to deter runaways or rebellions.
slaves could not leave their owners land or household without permission or stay out after dark without an identification pass.
some codes made it a crime for slaves to learn to read and write for fear that they might pass notes to plan a revolt.
frederick douglass noted that slaveholders assumed that allowing slaves to learn to read and write would spoil the best nigger in the world slaves in most states could not testify in court legally marry own firearms or hit a white man even in self defense.
they could also be abused tortured and whipped.
despite such restrictions and brutalities however the enslaved managed to create their own communities and cultures within the confines of the slave system forging bonds of care solidarity recreation and religion.
free persons of color african americans who were not enslaved were called free persons of color.
they occupied an uncertain and black society in the south 483 often vulnerable social status between bondage and freedom.
many of them lived in constant fear of being kidnapped into slavery.
to be sure free blacks had more rights than slaves.
they could enter into contracts marry own property including slaves of their own and pass on their property to their children.
but they were not viewed or treated as equal to whites.
in most states they could not vote own weapons attend white church services or testify against whites in court.
in south carolina free people of color had to pay an annual tax and were not allowed to leave the state.
after 1823 yarrow mamout as an enslaved they were required to have a white african muslim mamout purchased his freedom acquired property guardian and an identity card.
and settled in present day some slaves were able to pur washington d c charles willson chase their freedom and others were peale painted this portrait in 1819 when freed manumitted by their owners.
mamout was over 100 years old.
by 1860 approximately 250 000 free blacks lived in the slave states most of them in coastal cities such as baltimore charleston savannah mobile and new orleans.
many were skilled workers.
some were tailors shoemakers or carpenters others were painters bricklayers butchers blacksmiths or barbers.
still others worked on the docks or on steamships.
free black women usually worked as seamstresses laundresses or house servants.
eople among the free black population were a large number of mulattoes p of mixed racial ancestry.
the census of 1860 reported 412 000 mulattoes in the united states or about 10 percent of the black p opulation probably a drastic undercount.
in cities such as charleston and especially new orleans colored society occupied a shifting status somewhere between that of blacks and that of whites.
although most free people of color were poor some mulattoes built substantial fortunes and even became slaveholders themselves.
william ellison was the richest freedman in the south.
liberated by his white father in 1816 he developed a thriving business in south carolina making cotton gins while managing his own 900 acre plantation worked by more than sixty slaves.
ellison 484 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 free blacks this badge issued in charleston south carolina was worn by a free black so that he would not be mistaken for someones property the trade in slaves like other wealthy mulattoes came to view himself as a brown aristocrat he yearned to be accepted as an equal in white society during the civil war he supported the confederacy.
in louisiana a mulatto cyprien ricard paid 250 000 for an estate that had ninety one slaves.
in natchez mississippi william johnson son of a white father and a mulatto mother operated three barbershops owned 1 500 acres of land and held several slaves.
black or mulatto slaveholders were few in number however.
the 1830 census reported that 3 775 free blacks about 2 percent of the total free black population owned 12 760 slaves.
many of the african american slaveholders were men who bought or inherited their own family members.
the rapid rise in the slave population during the early nineteenth century mainly occurred naturally through slave births especially after congress and president thomas jefferson outlawed the african slave trade in 1808.
by 1820 over 80 percent of slaves were american born.
once the african slave trade was outlawed the s lave trading network within the united states became much more important and profitable.
between 1800 and 1860 the average price of slaves quadrupled in large part because of the dramatic expansion of the cotton culture in the old southwest.
breeding and selling slaves became a big business.
over a twenty year period a virginia plantation owned by john tayloe iii recorded 252 slave births and 142 slave deaths thus providing tayloe with 110 extra slaves to be deployed on the plantation given to his sons or sold to traders.
to manage the growing slave trade markets and auction houses sprang up in every southern city.
new orleans alone had twenty slave trading businesses.
each year thousands of slaves circulated through the citys slave pens there they were converted from people into products with prices.
they were bathed black society in the south 485 and groomed fattened up with bacon milk and butter like cattle assigned categories such as prime no.
2 and second rate and packaged for sale by being dressed in identical blue suits or dresses.
on auction day they were paraded into the sale room.
the tallest strongest and blackest young men brought the highest prices.
as a slaver stressed i must have if possible the jet black negroes for they stand the the business of slavery this advertisement for the blount dawson trading company climate best buyers physically inspected each guarantees its clients secure and good accommodations for all negroes left with us for slave on the auction block as if they sale or s afe keeping in its newly acquired jail were horses or cattle.
they squeezed opposite the state bank.
their muscles felt their joints worked their fingers back and forth pried open their mouths to examine their teeth and gums.
they then forced the slaves to strip and carefully inspected their naked bodies looking for signs of disease or deformities.
they particularly focused on any scars from whipping.
as solomon northup noted scars on a slaves back were considered evidence of a rebellious or unruly spirit and hurt his chances for sale during the 1830s slave traders began advertising fancy girls among the slaves to be auctioned.
the term referred to young african american women distinctive for their beauty who would fetch higher prices because of their sexual attractiveness.
as a historian of the slave trade noted slaverys frontier was a white mans sexual playground once the crude inspections ended buyers bid on the slaves purchased them and then transported them to their new homes.
almost a million captive african americans many of them children were sold south or downriver and taken to the old southwest during the first half of the nineteenth century.
planters purchasing slaves knew what they wanted.
it is better to buy none in families said a mississippi buyer but to select only choice first rate young hands from 16 to 25 years of age buying no children or aged negroes the worst aspect of the domestic slave trade was the separation of children from parents and husbands from wives.
children were often taken from their parents and sold to new masters.
in missouri one enslaved woman saw six of her seven children ages one to eleven sold to six different owners.

slavery as a way of life the lives of slaves differed greatly from place to place depending in part on the personality of their owner in part on whether the enslaved were focused on growing rice sugar tobacco or cotton and in part on whether they were on farms or in cities.
although many slaves were artisans or craftsmen carpenters blacksmiths furniture makers butchers boatmen house servants cooks nurses maids weavers basket makers etc.
the vast majority were field hands who were often organized into work gangs supervised by a black driver or white overseer.
some slaves were hired out to other planters or to merchants churches or businesses.
others worked on sundays or holidays to earn cash of their own.
plantation slaves were usually housed in one or two room wooden shacks with dirt floors.
the wealthiest planters built slave cabins out of brick.
beds were a luxury even though they were little more than boards covered with straw.
most slaves were expected to sleep on the cold damp floor with only a cheap blanket for warmth.
a set of inexpensive linen or cotton clothes was distributed twice a year but shoes were generally provided only in winter.
about half of all slave babies died in their first year a rate more than twice that of whites.
the weekly or monthly food allotment was cheap and monotonous corn meal and pork often served in bowls placed on the ground as if the slaves were livestock.
planters were quite varied in their personalities and practices.
philip jones a louisiana slave observed that many planters were humane and kind others were not.
massa was purty good one e x slave recalled.
he treated us jus bout like you would a good mule another said his master fed us reglar on good stantial food jus like youd tend to your hoss horse if you had a real good one a slave born in 1850 had a life expectancy of thirty six years the life expectancy of whites was forty years.
solomon northup a freeborn african american from new york with a wife and three children was kidnapped in 1845 by slave traders taken first to washington d c and then to new orleans and eventually sold to a repulsive and coarse louisiana cotton planter.
more than a decade later northup was able to regain his freedom.
in twelve years a slave 1853 northup described his living and working conditions.
his bed was a plank twelve inches wide and ten feet long.
my pillow was a stick of wood.
the bedding was a coarse blanket the log cabin where he and others slept had a dirt floor and no windows.
each day an black society in the south 489 hour before daylight the horn is blown.
then the slaves arouse prepare their breakfast.
and hurry to the field if found in their quarters after daybreak slaves were flogged.
it was rarely that a day passed by without one or more whippings.
the crack of the lash and the shrieking of the slaves can be heard from dark till bed time field hands worked from sunrise to sunset six days a week.
at times they were worked at night as well ginning cotton milling sugarcane grinding corn or doing other indoor tasks.
women remembered a slave had to work all day in de fields an den come home an do the housework at night sundays were precious days off.
slaves used the sabbath to hunt fish dance to banjo and fiddle music tell stories or tend their own small gardens.
beginning in august and lasting several months the focus was on picking cotton.
the productivity per slave increased dramatically during the first half of the nineteenth century in large part because of the implementation of the pushing system during harvest season each slave was assigned a daily quota of cotton to be picked an amount that increased over the years.
gangs of slaves men and women would sweep across a field pull the bolls from the thorny pods and stuff them in large sacks or baskets which they dragged behind them.
all the while they were watched and prodded by an overseer bullwhip in hand forcing them to keep up the pace.
solomon northup remembered picking cotton until it was too dark to see and when the moon is full they oftentimes labor till the middle of the night each evening the baskets would be weighed and the number of pounds recorded on a slate board by each pickers name.
those who fell short of their quota were scolded and whipped.
the violence of slavery although some owners and slaves developed close and even affectionate relationships slavery on the whole was a system rooted in brutal force.
the difference between a good owner and a bad one according to one slave was the difference between one who did not whip you too much and one who whipped you till hed bloodied you and blistered you one overseer in south carolina whipped eight women simply for hoeing bad corn others were whipped for not picking cotton for not picking as well as he can or for picking very trashy cotton bennett barrow a louisiana planter on average had a slave whipped every four days as a means of symbolizing his absolute control.
allen sidney a slave recalled an incident on a mississippi plantation that illustrated the ruthlessness of cotton production.
a slave who fell behind while picking cotton resisted when a black driver started to whip him up upon seeing the fracas the white overseer mounted on horseback galloped over 490 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 and shot the resisting slave killing him.
none of the other slaves sidney noted said a word or turned their heads.
they kept on hoeing as if nothing had happened at times whites turned the punishment of slaves into grisly spectacles to strike fear into anyone considering rebellion or escape.
in louisiana whippings often followed a horrific procedure as a visitor reported three stakes is drove into the ground in a triangular manner about six feet apart.
the culprit slave is told to lie down.

a city slave is almost a freeman claimed a maryland slave.
slaves in urban households tended to be better fed and clothed and had more privileges.
they interacted not only with their white owners but with the extended interracial c ommunity shopkeepers and police neighbors and strangers.
some were hired out to others and were often allowed to keep a portion of their wages.
generally speaking slaves in cities enjoyed greater mobility and freedom than their counterparts in rural areas.
enslaved women although enslaved men and women often performed similar chores especially on farms they did not experience slavery in the same way.
once slaveholders realized how profitable a fertile female slave could be by giving birth to babies that could later be sold they encouraged black society in the south 491 female slaves to have as many children as possible.
a south carolina planter named william johnson explained in 1815 that the interest of the owner is to obtain from his slaves labor and increase in their numbers sometimes a woman would be locked in a cabin with a male slave whose task was to impregnate her.
pregnant slaves were given less work and more food.
some plantation owners rewarded new mothers with dresses and silver dollars.
but if motherhood provided enslaved women with greater stature and benefits it also was exhausting.
within days after childbirth mothers were put back to work spinning weaving or sewing.
a few weeks thereafter they were sent back to the fields breast feeding mothers were often forced to take their babies with them strapped to their backs.
enslaved women were expected to do mans work cut trees haul logs spread fertilizer plow fields dig ditches slaughter animals hoe corn and pick cotton.
many of them in fact were more productive cotton pickers than the men.
as an escaped slave reported women who do outdoor work are used as bad as men once women passed their childbearing years their workload increased.
slaveholders put middle aged women to work f ull time in the fields or performing slave family in a georgia cotton field the invention of the cotton gin sent cotton production soaring deepening the souths dependence on slavery in the process.
492 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 other outdoor labor.
on large plantations elderly women called grannies kept the children during the day and slave women also worked as cooks and seamstresses midwives and nurses healers and folk doctors.
enslaved girls and women also faced the constant threat of sexual abuse.
james henry hammond the prominent south carolina planter and former governor confessed that he was a powerful man of passion who nurtured a system of roguery among his female slaves.
he had a long affair with one of his young female slaves sally johnson who bore several of his children.
later to the horror of his l ong suffering wife hammond began another affair with one of his and sallys daughters twelve year old louisa and fathered more children with her.
hammond also had scandalous affairs with four lovely and luscious t een aged nieces and two daughters of his sister in law.
celia the tragic story of a slave girl named celia reveals the moral complexity of slavery for african american women and the limited legal options available to the enslaved.
as celia discovered slaves often could improve their circumstances only by making horrible choices that offered no guarantee of success.
in 1850 f ourteen year old celia was purchased by robert newsom a missouri farmer who told his daughters that he had bought the girl to be their servant.
in fact however the recently widowed newsom wanted a sexual slave.
after purchasing celia he raped her and for the next five years he treated her as his mistress even building her a brick cabin fifty yards from his house.
during that time she gave birth to two children.
on june 23 1855 the s ixty five year old newsom entered celias cabin ignored her frantic appeals and kept assaulting her until she struck and killed him with a large stick and then burned his body in the fireplace.
celia was not allowed to testify at her murder trial because she was a slave.
the judge and jury all white men pronounced her guilty and on december 21 1855 she was hanged.
the grim story of celias abusive owner and her own brief life illustrates the lopsided power structure in southern society at the time.
celia bore a double burden that of being a slave and also of being a woman living in a male dominated society rife with racism and sexism.
forging a slave community despite being victims of terrible injustice and abuse enslaved african americans displayed endurance resilience and achievement.
wherever they could they forged their own sense of community asserted their individuality and forging a slave community 493 devised ingenious ways to resist their confinement.
many slaves especially those on the largest plantations would gather at secret night meetings usually after midnight where they would drink stolen alcohol dance sing and tell stories of resistance.
many of the stories were derived from african tales such as that of brer brother rabbit a smart little rabbit who used his wits to elude the larger animals stalking him by hiding in a patch of prickly briars.
such frequently told stories impressed upon slaves the importance of deceiving those with power over them.
many religious spirituals the predecessors to the blues also contained double meanings often expressing a longing to get to a free country what slaves called sweet canaan or the promised land the spiritual wade in the water for example contained underlying instructions to runaways about how to evade capture.
avoiding dry land and running in creek beds wading in the water were common ways to throw off pursuing bloodhounds.
songs such as the gospel train and swing low sweet chariot included disguised references to the underground railroad the secret organization that helped slaves escape to the north.
frederick douglass recalled that the spirituals not only helped runaways but also were a form of protest.
they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls overflowing with the bitterest anguish.
the songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart rather than his joys.
like tears they were a relief to aching hearts the slave family although states did not recognize slave marriages they did not prevent men and women from choosing life partners and forging families within the constraints of the slave system.
many slaveholders accepted unofficial marriages as a stabilizing influence a black man who supported a family they assumed would be more reliable and obedient.
sometimes slaveholders performed wedding ceremonies in the slave quarters or had a minister conduct the service.
whatever the formalities the norm for the slave community as for the white was the nuclear family with the father as the head of the household.
a slaves childhood did not last long.
at five or six years of age children were put to work they collected trash and firewood picked cotton scared away crows from planted fields and ran errands.
by age ten they were f ull time field hands.
enslaved african americans often extended the fellowship of family to those who worked with them with older slave women being addressed as granny or coworkers as sis or brother such efforts to create a sense of extended family resembled kinship practices in africa.
one white teacher visiting a slave community observed that they all belonged to one immense family 494 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 religion in the old south the old south was made up of g od fearing people whose faith sustained them.
although there were pockets of catholicism and judaism in the large coastal c ities baltimore richmond charleston savannah and new orleans the vast majority of southerners white and black embraced evangelical protestant denominations such as baptists and methodists both of which wanted to create a kingdom of god on earth before the millennium when jesus would return the second coming.
slavery and religion in the late eighteenth century baptists and methodists had condemned slavery welcomed blacks to their congregations and given women important roles in their churches.
many slaveholders led by george washington and thomas jefferson had agonized over the immorality of slavery.
by the 1830s however criticism of slavery in the southern states had virtually disappeared.
most preachers switched from attacking slavery to defending it as a divinely ordained bible sanctioned social system that was a blessing to both master and slave.
alexander glennie a white minister told slaves that their life of bondage was the will of god most ministers who refused to promote slavery left the region.
plantation burial 1860 the slaves of mississippi governor tilghman tucker gather in the woods to bury and mourn for one of their own.
the painter of this scene englishman john antrobus would serve in the confederate army during the civil war.
forging a slave community 495 frederick douglass stressed that all of the men who owned him were christians but their faith never made a difference in how they treated their slaves.
in 1832 douglasss master experienced a powerful conversion to christianity at a methodist revival and became a religious exhorter himself.
he prayed morning noon and night but his devotion to christ had no effect on how he treated his slaves.
in fact he was even more cruel and hateful quoting a bible verse as he whipped a lame young woman the servant that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes african american religion among the most important elements of african american culture was its dynamic religion a mixture of african caribbean and christian elements often practiced in secret because many slaveholders feared enslaved workers might use group religious services to organize rebellions.
religion provided slaves both relief for the soul and release for their emotions.
most africans brought with them to the americas belief in a creator or supreme god whom they could recognize in the christian god and whom they might identify with christ the holy ghost and the saints.
but they also believed in spirits magic charms and conjuring the casting of spells.
a conjurer it was believed was like a witch doctor or a voodoo priest who could suddenly make someone sick or heal the afflicted.
whites usually tried to eliminate african religion and spirituality from the slave experience.
slaves responded by gathering secretly in what were called camp meetings or bush meetings to worship in their own way and share their joys pains and hopes.
by 1860 about 20 percent of adult slaves had joined christian denominations.
many others practiced aspects of the christian faith but were not considered christians.
as a white minister observed some slaves had heard of jesus christ but who he is and what he has done for a ruined world they cannot tell but few whites fully understood the dynamics or mysteries of slave religion or its power.
slaves found the bible inspiring in its support for the poor and oppressed and they embraced its promise of salvation through the sacrifice of jesus.
likewise the lyrics of religious spirituals helped slaves endure the strain of field labor and express their dreams of gaining freedom in the promised land spirituals offered musical deliverance from worldly woes and strengthened solidarity among slaves.
one popular spiritual go down moses derived from the plight of the ancient israelites held captive in egypt says we need not always weep and moan let my people go.
and wear these slavery chains forlorn let my people go another spiritual gave song to hope i do believe.
i do believe.
i will overcome some day.
496 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 many white planters assumed that christianized slaves would be more passive and obedient.
a south georgia planter declared that a christian slave is more profitable than an unfaithful one.
he will do more and better work be less troublesome and even less liable to disease planter james henry hammond despised the emotional singing ecstatic shouting raucous clapping and energetic prayers that animated african american worship.
he banned dancing and the beating of drums.
hammond however wanted his heathen slaves to become christians.
to do so he hired itinerant white ministers plantation preachers to conduct christian services for them and constructed a methodist church on his plantation.
a white visitor who attended the church reported that there were no religious excesses or hysteria among the worshipping slaves.
hammond had forced them to display the religious passivity he desired.
slave rebellions the greatest fear of whites in the lower south was an organized slave revolt as had occurred in 1791 in the french controlled sugar colony of saint domingue which eventually became the independent republic of haiti.
in a rebellion unprecedented in history slaves rose up and burned plantations destroyed cane fields and killed white planters and their families.
the rebellion in saint domingue the worlds richest colony and the leading source of sugar and coffee was the first successful slave revolt in the western hemisphere.
it sent shock waves across the united states.
many terrified whites who fled haiti arrived in charleston where they told of the horrors they had experienced.
despite repeated attempts by both french and british armies to reconquer haiti the former slaves led by toussaint louverture defeated them all.
the revolt in haiti was the southern slaveholders greatest nightmare.
as a prominent virginian explained a slave uprising would deluge the southern country with blood any sign of resistance or rebellion among the enslaved therefore risked a brutal and even gruesome response.
in 1811 for example two of thomas jeffersons nephews lilburn and isham lewis tied a seventeen year old slave named george to the floor of their kentucky cabin and killed him with an axe in front of seven other slaves all because george had run away several times.
they then handed the axe to one of the slaves and forced him to dismember the body and put the pieces in the fireplace.
the lewises who had been drinking heavily wanted to set an example for any other uppity slaves the prosser conspiracy the overwhelming authority and firepower of southern whites made organized resistance risky.
the nineteenth forging a slave community 497 c entury south witnessed only four major slave insurrections.
the first occurred in 1800 when a slave named gabriel prosser a blacksmith on a plantation near richmond virginia hatched a revolt involving hundreds of slaves.
they planned to seize key points in the city capture the governor james monroe and overthrow the white elite.
gabriel expected the poor white people to join their effort.
but someone alerted whites to the scheme and a ferocious rainstorm forced gabriels army to scatter.
gabriel and twenty six of his fellow soldiers were captured and hanged while ten others were deported to the west indies.
a white virginian who observed the executions noted that the rebels on the gallows displayed a sense of their natural rights and a contempt for danger revolt in louisiana in early 1811 the largest slave revolt in american history occurred just north of new orleans where powerful sugarcane planters had acquired one of the largest populations of slaves in north america.
many of those slaves were ripe for revolt.
sugarcane was known as a killer crop because working conditions were so harsh that many slaves died from laboring in the intense heat and humidity.
late on january 8 a group of slaves led by charles deslondes a trusted black overseer broke into their owners plantation house along the east bank of the mississippi river.
the planter was able to escape but his son was hacked to death.
deslondes and his fellow rebels seized weapons horses and militia uniforms.
reinforced by more slaves and emboldened by liquor the rebels headed toward new orleans some fifty miles away.
along the way they burned houses killed whites and gathered more recruits.
over the next two days their ranks swelled to more than 200.
their success was short lived however.
the territorial governor mobilized a group of angry whites as well as several free blacks who were later praised for their tireless zeal and dauntless courage to suppress the insurrection.
u s army units and militia joined in.
dozens of slaves were killed or wounded and most of those who fled were soon captured.
we made considerable slaughter reported one white planter.
deslondes had his hands chopped off and was then shot in both thighs and his chest.
as he was slowly bleeding to death a bale of hay was scattered over him and ignited.
as many as 100 slaves were tortured killed and beheaded and the severed heads were placed on poles along the mississippi river.
a month after the rebellion was put down a white resident noted that all the negro difficulties have subsided and gentle peace prevails denmark vesey the denmark vesey plot in charleston south carolina involved a similar effort to assault the white population.
vesey was 498 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 a caribbean slave who in 1785 was taken to charleston where like many urban slaves he was allowed to work for pay in his free time at nights and on sundays.
in 1799 he purchased a lottery ticket and won 1 500 which he used to buy his freedom and start his own carpentry shop.
he thereafter learned to read and write and organized a bible study class for other free blacks in the african methodist episcopal ame church.
yet he retained a simmering hatred for whites and for the slave system they imposed on blacks.
in 1822 vesey and several other blacks including the colorful african born gullah jack developed a plan for a massive slave revolt.
they would first capture the citys arsenal and distribute its hundreds of rifles to both free and enslaved blacks.
all whites in the city would then be killed along with any blacks who refused to join the rebellion.
vesey then planned to burn the city seize ships and head for the black republic of haiti.
the vesey plot never got off the ground however.
a slave who had been secretly recruited by vesey told his master about the planned rebellion and soon vesey and 135 others were captured arrested and tried.
the court found vesey guilty of plotting to trample on all laws human and divine to riot in blood outrage rapine.
and conflagration and to introduce anarchy and confusion in their most horrid forms vesey and t hirty four others were executed three dozen more were transported to spanish controlled cuba and sold into slavery.
the ame church in charleston was closed and demolished.
when told that he would be hanged vesey replied that the work of insurrection will go on veseys planned rebellion led south carolina officials to place additional restrictions on the mobility of free blacks and black religious gatherings.
it also influenced john c calhoun to abandon the nationalism of his early political career and become the souths most outspoken advocate for states rights and slavery.
nat turners rebellion veseys thwarted slave rebellion was not the last however.
news of the nat turner insurrection of august 22 1831 in southampton county virginia where blacks were the majority panicked whites throughout the south.
turner a trusted black overseer was also a preacher and healer who believed god had instructed him to proclaim liberty to the captive slaves and lead a rebellion that would enact the day of vengeance of our god he interpreted a solar eclipse in february 1831 as gods signal for him to act.
turner chose august 21 as the day to launch his insurrection in part because it was the fortieth anniversary of the haitian slave rebellion.
the revolt began when turner in the middle of the night unlocked the door of his masters house and let in a small group of slaves armed with axes.
remember that ours is not a war for robbery nor to satisfy our passions he forging a slave community 499 instructed them it is a struggle for freedom they methodically murdered the owner joseph travis and his wife sally their twelve year old son a young apprentice and a baby all sleeping in their beds.
they then repeated the process at other farmhouses where more slaves and some free blacks joined in.
some slaves tried to protect or hide their owners.
before the two day revolt ended fifty seven whites had been killed most of them women and children including ten students at a school.
federal troops virginia militiamen and volunteers crushed the revolt indiscriminately killing scores of slaves in the process.
a newspaper described the behavior of the white vigilantes as comparable in barbarity to the atrocities of the insurgents twenty african americans were hanged including three free blacks several were decapitated and their severed heads were placed on poles along the road.
turner called the blood stained monster avoided capture for six weeks.
he then was tried found guilty and hanged.
his dead body was dismembered with body parts given to the victims families.
more than any other slave uprising nat turners rebellion terrified whites by making real the lurking fear that enslaved blacks might launch organized revolts.
a virginia state legislator claimed that people suspected that a nat turner might be in every family that the same bloody deed could be acted over at any time the virginia legislature responded by barring slaves from learning to read and write and from gathering for religious meetings.
the city of mobile alabama prohibited gatherings of three or more slaves and white ministers were dispatched to preach obedience to enslaved workers.
in addition states created more armed patrols to track down runaways.
a former slave highlighted the the confessions of nat turner thousand obstacles thrown in the published account of turners rebellion written by turners lawyer thomas way of the flying slave.
every white gray.
mans hand is raised against him the 500 chapter 11 the south slavery and king cotton 1800 1860 patrollers are watching for him the hounds are ready to follow on his track and the nature of the country is such as renders it impossible to pass through it with any safety running away meant exposing oneself to flogging or much worse.
the lure of freedom yet stealthy and silent as fog thousands of escaped slaves called fugitives made it to freedom in spite of the obstacles facing them.
the fugitive slaves were a powerful example of the enduring lure of freedom and the extraordinary courage of those who yearn for it.
on average some 50 000 enslaved people tried to escape each year.
others ran away for short periods of time usually to avoid being beaten by fl ash tempered owners or overseers.
a house cook named bertcha was so frightened that her owner was going to kill her that she ran for the woods and hid there and stayed three weeks frederick douglass decided that risking death was better than staying in bondage i had as well be killed running as die standing the odds were stacked against escape in part because most slaves could not read had no maps and could not use public transportation such as stagecoaches steamboats and railroads.
blacks whether free or enslaved had to have an identity pass or official emancipation papers to go anywhere on their own.
runaways the vast majority of whom were young males often were forced to return when they ran out of food or lost their way.
others were tracked down by bloodhounds or bounty hunters.
only about 1 000 slaves each year safely made it to freedom.
many slaveholders could not understand why any slave would run away.
scottish born william dunbar ordered that two of his runaways poor ignorant devils in mississippi be given 500 lashes and then had logs chained to their ankles.
why would they try to escape he asked in a letter.
they are well clothed work easy and have all kinds of plantation produce for free.
slaves who did not escape found other ways to resist.
they often exasperated enraged and manipulated their owners.
some faked illness stole or broke tools destroyed crops or secretly slaughtered and ate livestock.
others slacked off when unsupervised.
as a slave song confessed you may think im working but i aint yet there were constraints on such rebellious behavior for laborers would likely eat better on a prosperous plantation than on a struggling one.
and the shrewdest slaveholders knew that offering rewards was more profitable than inflicting pain.
the s outh a region apart the rapid settlement of the western territories during the first half of the nineteenth century set in motion a ferocious competition between north and south for political influence in the west.
would the new western territories forging a slave community 501 and states be slave or free.
congressmen from the newly admitted western states would tip the delicate political balance in washington d c one way or the other slave or free.
because of the rapidly growing profitability of slave grown cotton southerners exercised immense political power both to protect the system of slavery and expand it into new lands made available by the removal of indians and to embed the economy of cotton into national and world markets.
the aggressive efforts to expand slavery westward in the face of growing criticism from the north ignited a prolonged political controversy that would end in civil war.
as the 1832 nullification controversy in south carolina had revealed southerners despised being told what to do by outsiders and they especially resented the growing demands for the abolition of slavery.
to cement the slave system in the culture of the south many in the 1850s imagined every white family in the region owning slaves.
ours is a p ro slavery form of government explained a georgia newspaper editor.
for our part we would like to see every white man in the south the owner of a family of negroes the recurring theme of southern politics and culture from the 1830s to the outbreak of civil war in 1861 was the regions determination to remain a society dominated by whites who lorded over people of color.
a south carolinian asserted that slavery with us is no abstraction but a great and vital fact.
without it our every comfort would be taken from us protecting their right to own transport and sell slaves in the new western territories became the overriding focus of southern political leaders during the 1830s and after.
race based slavery provided the souths prosperity as well as its growing sense of separateness and defensiveness from the rest of the nation.
throughout the 1830s southern state legislatures were one and indivisible in their efforts to preserve r ace based slavery.
they shouted defiance against northern abolitionists.
virginias general assembly for example declared that only the southern states had the right to control slavery and that such control must be maintained at all hazards the georgia legislature agreed announcing that upon this point there can be no d iscussion no compromise no doubt with each passing year the leaders of the old south equated the survival of their distinctive region with the preservation of slavery.
as the governor of mississippi insisted in 1850 slavery is entwined with our political system and cannot be separated from it the increasingly militant efforts of northerners to restrict or abolish slavery helped reinforce southern unity while provoking an emotional defensiveness that would result in secession and w ar and the unexpected end of slavery and the cotton kingdom it enabled.
chapter review summary southern distinctiveness the south remained rural and agricultural in the first half of the nineteenth century as the rest of the nation embraced urban industrial development.
the regions climate favored the growth of cash crops such as tobacco rice indigo and increasingly cotton.
these crops led to the spread of the plantation system of large commercial agriculture dependent on enslaved labor.
the southern planter elite not only sought to preserve slavery but to expand it despite growing criticism of the peculiar institution a cotton economy the old south became increasingly committed to a cotton economy.
despite efforts to diversify the economic base the wealth and status associated with cotton as well as soil exhaustion and falling prices from virginia to georgia prompted the westward expansion of the plantation culture to the old southwest.
slaves worked in harsh conditions as they prepared the terrain for cotton cultivation and experienced the breakup of their families.
by 1860 the cotton kingdom stretched from the carolinas and georgia through eastern texas and up the mississippi river to illinois.
more than half of all slaves worked on cotton plantations.
as long as cotton prices rose southern planters searched for new land and invested in slaves to increase their cotton output.
southern white culture white society was divided between the planter elite those who owned twenty slaves or more and all the rest.
planters represented only around 4 percent of the white population but they exercised a disproportionately powerful political and social influence.
other whites owned a few slaves but most owned none.
a majority of whites were plain white folk simple farmers who raised corn cotton hogs and chickens.
southern farmers were highly mobile and willing to move west.
southern white women spent most of their time on household chores.
the plantation mistress supervised her home and household slaves.
most whites were fiercely loyal to the institution of slavery.
even those who owned no slaves feared the competition they believed they would face if slaves were freed and they enjoyed the privileged status that race based slavery gave them.
southern black culture as slavery spread and the southern economy became more dependent on slave labor the enslaved faced more regulations and restrictions on their behavior.
the vast majority of southern blacks served as field hands.
they had few rights and could be bought and sold at any time.
their movements were severely limited and they had no ability to defend themselves.
any violations could result in severe punishments.
most southern blacks were slaves but a small percentage were free.
many of the free blacks were mulattoes having m ixed race parentage.
free blacks often worked for wages in towns and cities.
african american resistance and resilience originally slaves were treated more as indentured servants and were eligible for freedom after a specified number of years.
but slave codes eventually codified the practice of treating slaves as property rather than as people.
the enslaved responded in a variety of ways.
although many attempted to escape only a few openly rebelled because the consequences were so harsh.
organized revolts such as nat turners rebellion in virginia were rare.
most slaves survived by relying on their own communities family ties and christian faith and by developing their own culture such as the singing of spirituals to express frustration sorrow and hope for their eventual deliverance.

europeans traveling in america marveled at the nations restless energy and expansive optimism its commitment to democratic ideals and its remarkable capitalist spirit.
however visitors also noticed that the dynamic young republic was experiencing growing pains as the market revolution continued to excite a lust for profits and to widen economic inequality.
sectional tensions over economic policies such as tariffs and the regulation of banks and increasingly heated debates over the morality and future of slavery made for a combative political scene.
unlike the nations of europe which were steeped in history and romance the united states was a young society whose founding leaders had embraced the central ideas of the enlightenment liberty equality and reason which in turn led to the american ideals of representative government and the pursuit of happiness most vividly set forth in thomas jeffersons declaration of independence.

556 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 of course the west was not empty land waiting to be developed.
others had been there long before the american migration.
but the indian and hispanic inhabitants of the region soon found themselves swept aside by american settlers all facilitated by u s presidents and congressmen who encouraged the nations continental expansion.
westward expansion was especially important to southerners many of whom wanted cheap new lands to plant using slave labor.
in addition southerners had long enjoyed disproportionate political power because of the provision in the u s constitution that counted slaves as part of the population in determining the number of congressional seats for each state.
thirteen of the first sixteen presidents were from the south and most congressional leadership positions were held by southerners.
but southern political influence began dwindling as the industrializing midwest and northeast grew and increased their representation in congress.
southerners wanted new western states to boost pro southern representation and ensure that slavery was never threatened.
as a mississippi senator said i would spread the blessings of slavery.
to the uttermost ends of the earth such motives made the addition of new western territory especially controversial.
would the territory be slave or free.
moving west during the mid nineteenth century america remained a nation in motion.
in 1845 new york newspaper editor and d emocratic party propagandist john l osullivan gave a catchy name to the nations aggressive expansion.
our manifest destiny he wrote is to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which providence has given us for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.
and for the great experiment of liberty osullivan spoke for many americans who saw no reason not to take control of all of north america yes more more more.
until our national destiny is fulfilled the concept of manifest destiny assumed that the united states had a god given mission to extend its christian republic and capitalist civilization from the atlantic to the pacific and beyond.
it also took for granted the superiority of american ideals and institutions including the opportunity to bring liberty and prosperity to native peoples.
this widely embraced notion of manifest self evident destiny offered a moral justification for territorial expansion and the expansion of slavery.
but god was not driving american expansion americans were.
however idealized manifest destiny for many americans was in essence a cluster of flimsy rationalizations and racist attitudes justifying the conquest of weaker peoples.
moving west 557 the western frontier most western pioneers during the second quarter of the nineteenth century were a merican born whites from the upper south and the midwest.
only a few free african americans joined in the migration.
what spurred the massive migration westward was the continuing population explosion in the united states and the desire for land and wealth.
although some people traveled by sea to the pacific coast most went overland.
between 1841 and 1867 some 350 000 men women and children made the difficult trek to california or oregon while hundreds of thousands of others settled in such areas as colorado texas and arkansas.

by 1845 some 5 000 people were making the s ix month journey annually.
the discovery of gold in california in 1848 brought some 30 000 pioneers along the oregon trail in 1849.
by 1850 the peak year of travel along the trail the annual count had risen to 55 000 plains indians more than 325 000 indians inhabited the southwest the great plains california and the pacific northwest in 1840 when the great migration of white settlers into the region began.
the native americans were divided into more than 200 nations each with its own language religion c ultural practices and system of governance.
plains indians included the arapaho blackfoot cheyenne kiowa and sioux.
some were primarily farmers others were nomadic following buffalo herds across the prairie grasslands.
in the arid southwest region that today includes arizona new mexico and southern utah the peaceful pueblo n ations acoma hopi laguna taos zia zuni were sophisticated farmers who lived in adobe villages along rivers that irrigated their crops of corn beans and squash.
their rivals were the apache and the navajo warlike hunters who roamed the countryside in small bands and preyed upon the pueblos.

many indian nations were hostile to each other resulting in frequent wars and raids.
to the north in the great basin paiutes and gosiutes struggled to survive in the harsh arid region of what is today nevada utah and eastern california.
they traveled in family groups and subsisted on berries pine nuts insects and rodents.
along the california coast indians lived in small villages.
they gathered wild plants and acorns and were experts at fishing.
the native americans in the pacific n orthwest the nisqually spokane yakama chinook klamath and nez perce pierced nose enjoyed the most abundant natural resources and the most temperate climate.
the ocean and rivers provided whales seals salmon and crabs and lush inland forests harbored game berries and nuts.
majestic forests of fir redwood and cedar offered wood for cooking and shelter.
all these indian societies eventually felt the unrelenting pressure of white expansion and conquest and the influx of white settlers and hunters posed a direct threat to the indians cultural survival.
when federal officials could not coerce cajole or confuse indian leaders into selling the title to their tribal lands fighting ensued.
and after the discovery of gold in california in early 1848 the tidal wave of white expansion flowed all the way to the west coast violently engulfing native americans and mexicans in its wake.
mexico and the spanish west as american settlers trespassed across indian lands they also encountered spanish speaking peoples.
many whites were as prejudiced toward hispanics as they were toward indians.
senator lewis cass from michigan who would be the democratic candidate for president in 1848 expressed the common bias among white expansionists we do not want the people of mexico either as citizens or as subjects.
all we want is their.
territory the centuries old spanish efforts at colonization in the northernmost provinces of mexico had been less successful in arizona and texas than in new mexico and florida.
the yuma and apaches in arizona and the comanches and apaches in texas thwarted spanish efforts to establish catholic missions.
by 1790 the hispanic population in texas numbered only 2 510 while in new mexico it exceeded 20 000.
in 1807 french forces led by napolon had occupied spain and imprisoned the king creating confusion throughout spains colonial possessions in the western hemisphere including mexico.
miguel hidalgo y costilla a creole priest born in mexico of european ancestry took advantage of the fluid situation to convince indians and hispanics to revolt against spanish rule in mexico.
but the poorly organized uprising failed miserably.
560 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 in 1820 mexican creoles again tried to liberate themselves from spanish authority.
facing a growing revolt the last spanish officials withdrew in 1821 and mexico became an independent nation.
however the infant republic struggled to develop a stable government and an effective economy.
americans eagerly took advantage of mexicos instability especially in its sparsely populated northern provinces areas that included present day texas new mexico arizona nevada california and portions of colorado oklahoma kansas and wyoming.
american fur traders streamed into new mexico and arizona developing a profitable trade in beaver pelts along the santa fe trail to st louis.

the trek was not for the fainthearted.
in 1847 alone marauding indians killed f orty seven americans destroyed 330 wagons and stole 6 500 horses cattle and oxen along the trail.
the overland trails during the early nineteenth century the far northwest consisted of the nebraska washington and oregon territories.
the oregon country included what became the states of oregon idaho and washington parts of montana and wyoming and the canadian province of british columbia.
it was an unsettled region claimed by both great britain and the united states.
by the convention of 1818 the two nations agreed to joint occupation of the oregon country each drawn there initially by the profitable trade in fur pelts.
during the 1820s and 1830s the fur trade inspired a reckless breed of mountain men to abandon civilization and embrace a primitive existence in the wilderness.
the rugged trappers were the first whites to find their way around the rocky mountains and they pioneered the trails that settlers would moving west 561 fur traders descending the missouri 1845 originally titled french trader half breed son this oil painting depicts a white settler sailing down the river with his half native american son not an uncommon sight in western america.

the great migration word of oregons fertile soil plentiful rainfall and magnificent forests gradually spread eastward.
by 1840 a trickle of emigrants farmers missionaries teachers fur traders and s hopkeepers was flowing along the oregon trail a 2 000 mile footpath that formed the great highway west connecting the missouri river near st louis with oregon.
soon oregon fever swept the nation.
to an ohio woman going to the far west seemed like the entrance to a new world one of freedom happiness and prosperity some pioneers desperately sought to escape debts or dull lives or bad marriages.
we had nothing to lose wrote one woman and we might gain a fortune for whatever reason tens of thousands of americans began pulling up stakes and moving their families west.
in 1841 and 1842 the first sizable wagon trains made the long trip across half the continent and in 1843 the movement became a mass migration.
one pioneer said that the wagon trains sometimes six miles long were like mobile communities.
everybody was supposed to rise at daylight and while the women were preparing breakfast the men rounded up the cattle took down the tents yoked the oxen to the wagons and made everything ready to start the oregon bound wagon trains followed the trail west from independence missouri then along the winding north platte river into what is now 562 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 wyoming through south pass down to fort bridger abode of the celebrated mountain man jim bridger then down the meandering snake river through what is now idaho to the salmon filled columbia river.
from there they moved through the cascade mountains to their goal oregons fertile willamette valley.
life on the trail traveling in prairie schooners sturdy canvas covered wagons pulled by teams of tramping oxen sunburned settlers bumped and jostled their way across the rugged trails mountains and plains blackened by vast herds of buffaloes.
indians rarely attacked the wagon trains they allowed most settlers to pass through their tribal lands unmolested.
many wagon trains received generous aid from indians who served as guides advisers or traders.
the indians one female pioneer noted proved better than represented to be sure as the number of pioneers increased dramatically during the 1850s disputes with indians over land and water increased but never to the degree portrayed in novels films and television shows.
still the long journey west usually five to six months was extraordinarily difficult an exodus of grinding hardship during broiling summers fierce thunderstorms and bitterly cold winters reliable for their heavy snows.
wagons broke down oxen died and diseases like cholera and dysentery took their toll on pioneers.
the cowards never started a popular saying went and the weak died on the way women pioneers the diary of amelia knight who set out for oregon in 1853 with her husband and seven children reveals the mortal threats along the trail chatfield quite sick with scarlet fever.

women cooked washed sewed and monitored the children while men drove the wagons tended the horses and cattle and did the heavy labor.
but the unique demands of the western trails soon dissolved such neat distinctions.
women found themselves gathering buffalo dung for fuel driving wagons working to dislodge wagons mired in mud helping to construct makeshift bridges pitching tents or participating in a variety of other unladylike tasks.

divorces soared in the west.
many a tired pioneer could identify with the following comment in a girls journal poor ma said only this morning oh i wish we had never started she looks so sorrowful and dejected another woman wondered what had possessed my husband anyway that he should have thought of bringing us away out through this god forsaken country some of the emigrants turned back but most continued on.

the malick family for example left illinois in 1848 and started a farm in the oregon territory.
george malick the father died soon thereafter as did three of the older children.
we are all well widow abigail malick wrote in 1855 to relatives back in illinois.
all that are left of us the settlement of california california was also a powerful magnet for settlers and adventurers.
it had first felt the influence of european culture in 1769 when spain grew concerned about russian seal traders moving south along the pacific coast from alaska.
to thwart russian intentions spain sent a naval expedition to settle the region.
the spanish discovered san francisco bay and constructed presidios military garrisons at san diego and monterey.
even more important franciscan friars led by junpero serra established a catholic mission at san diego.
over the next fifty years franciscans built twenty more missions spaced a days journey apart along the coast from san diego northward to san francisco.
the mission centered culture created by the hispanic settlers who migrated to california from mexico was quite different from those in texas and new mexico where the original missions were converted into secular communities and the property was divided among the indians.
in california however the missions were much larger more influential and longer lasting.
by the nineteenth century spanish catholic missionaries aided by spanish soldiers controlled most of the indians living along the california coast.
the friars priests enticed the indians into missions by offering gifts or impressing them with their magical religious rituals.
once inside the missions the indians were baptized as catholics taught spanish and stripped of their cultural heritage.
moving west 565 catholic missions the california catholic missions served as churches villages fortresses homes schools shops farms and outposts of spanish rule.
the missions also quickly became agricultural enterprises producing crops livestock clothing and household goods both for profit and to supply the neighboring presidios.
indians provided most of the labor.
the franciscans viewed forced indian labor as both a practical necessity and a morally enriching responsibility essential to transforming unproductive indians into industrious christians.
a missions daily routine began at dawn with the ringing of a bell which summoned the community to prayer.
work began an hour later and did not end until an hour before sunset.
most indian men worked in the fields.
some were trained in special skills such as masonry carpentry or leatherwork.
women handled domestic chores but during harvest season everyone was expected to help in the fields.
instead of wages the indians received clothing food housing and religious instruction.
the franciscans used force to control their captive laborers.
rebellious indians were whipped or imprisoned and mission indians died at an alarming rate.
one franciscan friar reported that of every four indian children born three die in their first or second year while those who survive do not reach the age of t wenty five infectious disease was the primary threat but the grueling labor regimen took a high toll as well.
the native american population along the california coast declined from 72 000 in 1769 to 18 000 by 1821.
saving souls cost many lives.
with mexican independence in 1821 the spanish missions slowly disintegrated and fell into disuse.
by the time the first americans began to trickle into california they found a vast beautiful province with only a small scattered population of 6 000 mexicans ruled by a few dominant caballeros or rancheros gentlemen who owned the largest ranches in the province much like the planters who lorded over the lower south.
hispanic californians called californios took comfort that mexico city the capital was too far away to exercise effective control over them.
between 1821 when mexico gained its independence and 1841 spanish speaking californians as well as many recent american arrivals staged ten revolts against mexican governors.
among the white immigrants in california in the m id nineteenth century was john a sutter a swiss settler who had founded a colony of european emigrants.
at the junction of the sacramento and american rivers later the site of the city of sacramento sutter built an enormous fort with walls eighteen feet tall to protect the settlers and their shops.
566 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 new helvetia americans called it sutters fort completed in 1843 stood at the end of what became the california trail which forked southward off the oregon trail and crossed the sierra nevada a soaring mountain range running north south along eastern california.
by the start of 1846 there were perhaps 800 americans in california along with approximately 10 000 c alifornios.
the americans learned to speak spanish often embraced catholicism won mexican citizenship and spouses and participated in local politics.
the donner party the most tragic story of the efforts to get to california using the overland trails involved the party headed by george donner a prosperous s ixty two year old farmer from illinois who in some respects epitomized the restless mobility of nineteenth century americans.
born in north carolina he had moved first to kentucky then indiana and eventually illinois.
now he was determined to relocate to california.
in m id april 1846 donner led his family and a train of s eventy four other settlers and twenty three wagons to the oregon trail.
early on donners wife reported that the indians were friendly and the prairie beautiful beyond description her outlook was optimistic indeed if i do not experience something far worse than i have yet done i shall say that the trouble all is in getting started but the trouble soon appeared for the donner party made several fatal mistakes starting too late in the year overloading their wagons and taking a foolish shortcut to california across the wasatch mountains in the utah territory.
they had inadequate food water clothing and experience for the journey ahead.
in the wasatch range the donner party got lost taking a supposed shortcut and was forced to backtrack losing three precious weeks in the process.
an early september snow further slowed their progress.
they eventually found their way across the wasatch mountains and into the desert leading to the great salt lake but crossing the parched desert exacted a terrible toll.
they lost more than 100 oxen and were forced to abandon several wagons and their precious supplies.
most important they had lost valuable time as winter weather began to set in.
when the donner party reached truckee pass in eastern california the last mountain barrier before the sacramento valley a two week long blizzard trapped them in two separate camps.
by december the pioneers half of them children were marooned with only enough food to last through the end of the month.
seventeen of the strongest members calling themselves the forlorn hope decided to cross the pass on their own but they were trapped by more snow.
two of them turned back eight more died of exposure and starvation.
moving west 567 just before he died billy graves urged his daughters to eat his body.
the daughters were appalled at first but soon saw no other choice.
when two more died they too were eaten.
only seven lived to reach the sacramento valley.
back at the main camps the survivors had slaughtered and eaten the last of the livestock then boiled hides and bones.
they had also killed two indian guides and eaten them.
when a rescue party finally reached them two months later they discovered a grisly scene.
thirteen people had died and cannibalism had become commonplace one pioneer had noted casually in his diary mrs.
murphy said here yesterday that she thought she would commence on milt and eat him as the rescuers led the forty seven survivors over the pass george donner so weakened and distressed that he was unable to walk stayed behind to die.
his wife chose to remain with him.
the pathfinder john frmont despite the hardships and dangers of the overland crossing the far west proved an irresistible attraction for hundreds of thousands of pioneers.
the most enthusiastic champion of american settlement in mexican california and the far west was john charles frmont an impetuous junior army officer who during the 1840s became americas most famous celebrity and a notorious troublemaker.
born out of wedlock in savannah georgia and raised in the south frmont developed a robust love of the outdoors.
in 1838 after attending the college of charleston he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the u s topographical corps an organization whose mission was to explore and map new western territories.
frmont soon excelled at surveying mapmaking and woodcraft while becoming versed in geology botany ornithology and zoology.
in 1841 frmont courted and married seventeen year old jessie b enton the feisty daughter of thomas hart benton the powerful missouri s enator.
once bentons anger at his daughter subsided he became frmonts foremost booster and helped arrange the the pathfinder john charles frmont explorations that would bring frmont became a national hero as a result of his fame as the nations leading scientific explorations in the far west.
e xplorer adventurer.
568 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 in 1842 the fearless frmont who believed he was a man of destiny set out from present day kansas city with two dozen soldiers to map the eastern half of the oregon trail.
they spent five months collecting plant and animal specimens and drawing maps in uncharted territory.
with his wifes considerable help frmont published in newspapers across the nation excerpts from a rip roaring account of his explorations titled a report on an exploration of the country lying between the missouri river and the rocky mountains on the line of the kansas and great platte rivers.
in describing the great plains the frmonts wrote that the indians and buffalo were the poetry and life of the prairie and our camp was full of exhilaration the popular stories of frmonts adventures made him an instant national celebrity and earned him the nickname the pathfinder after reading about the expedition henry wadsworth longfellow the nations most popular poet announced that frmont has touched my imagination.
what a wild life and what a fresh kind of existence.
but ah the discomforts the success of frmonts first western explorations quickly led to another expedition this time intended to map the second and more difficult half of the oregon trail from the south pass a 20 mile gap in the rocky mountains in present day wyoming.
the expedition would then go down the snake river to the columbia river and into oregon eventually making its way south through the sierra nevada to sutters fort near what would become sacramento california before heading back.
frmonts group was the first to cross the snow and i ce covered sierra nevada in the winter a spectacular feat.
his report of his expedition and the maps it generated spurred massive migrations to utah oregon and california throughout the 1840s including the trek of the mormons from illinois to salt lake city utah.
rarely one to follow orders keep promises or admit mistakes the impulsive iron willed frmont surprised his superior officers when he launched a military expedition on his own.
in august 1845 frmont now a captain and sixty two heavily armed soldiers sailors scientists hunters and frontiersmen headed west from st louis on another mysterious expedition.
in december frmonts adventurers swept down the western slopes of the sierra nevada and headed southward through the central valley of mexican controlled california.
frmont told mexican authorities that his mission was strictly scientific and that his men were civilians.
in monterey in january 1846 frmont received secret instructions from president james k polk indicating that the united states intended to take control of california from mexico.
frmont was ordered to encourage a spontaneous uprising among the americans living there.
moving west 569 suspicious mexican officials ordered frmont to leave the province.
he did so leading his explorers into oregon attacking indian villages along the way.
but the americans soon returned.
to cover his efforts to spark a revolution among the english speaking californians most of whom were americans frmont officially submitted his resignation from the army so that he thereafter would be acting as a private citizen rather than as a member of the u s government.
then frmont and his band of soldiers and rough leather jacketed frontiersmen began stirring unrest.
on june 14 1846 american settlers captured sonoma in northern california and proclaimed the republic of california.
they hoisted a linen flag featuring a grizzly bear and star a version of which would later become the california state flag.
on june 25 frmont and his band marched into sonoma.
all of california was in american control when news arrived there of the outbreak of the mexican american war.
american settlements in texas the american passion for new western land focused largely on texas the closest of all the northern american pioneers this 1850 photograph captures some of the many pioneers who headed west for brighter futures.
570 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 mexican borderlands and an area of rich soil lush prairie grass plentiful timber abundant wildlife and numerous creeks and rivers.
during the 1820s the united states had twice offered to buy texas but the mexican government refused to sell.
mexicans were frightened and infuriated by the idea of yankees acquiring their sacred soil but that is what happened.
the leading promoter of american settlement in the coastal plain of texas was stephen fuller austin a visionary land developer empresario who convinced the mexican government that he could recruit 300 american families to settle between the colorado and brazos rivers along the gulf coast of texas and create a buffer on the northern frontier between the feared comanche indians and the mexican settlements to the south.
americans eagerly settled in austins anglo colony in east texas.
they each received 177 free acres and had access to thousands of acres of common pasture for ranching austin received 65 000 acres for his efforts.
most of the anglos were ranchers or farmers drawn to the fertile inexpensive lands in the river valleys.
a few of the settlers were wealthy planters who brought large numbers of slaves with them at a time when mexico was prohibiting the importation of slaves.
an american reported that eastern texas was literally alive with all kinds of game.
we have only to go out a few miles into a swamp.
to find as many wild cattle as one could wish there were as many buffalo in the area as cattle.
by 1830 coastal texas had far more americans living there than hispanics tejanos or i ndians about 20 000 white settlers called anglos or texians and 1 000 enslaved blacks brought to grow and harvest cotton.
by 1835 there were 35 000 texians 3 000 african american slaves and a booming cotton economy.
so many people in the carolinas georgia alabama tennessee and missouri had migrated to texas that the phrase gone to texas or its initials gtt were often carved into the doors of cabins left behind.
the flood of americans into texas led to numerous clashes with indians as well as mexican officials who began having second thoughts about their tolerated guests a mexican congressman issued an accurate warning in 1830 mexicans.
watch closely for you know all too well the anglo saxon greed for territory.
we have generously granted land to these nordics they have made their homes with us but their hearts are with their native land.
we are continually in civil wars and revolutions we are weak and know i t and they know it also.
they may conspire with the united states to take texas from us.
from this time be on your guard the texas war for independence mexican officials were so worried about the behavior and intentions of americans living in texas that moving west 571 in april 1830 they suddenly outlawed further immigration from the united states.
but americans who viewed the mexicans their army and their fractured and incompetent government with contempt kept coming.
by 1835 the texians and their enslaved blacks outnumbered the tejanos spanish speaking texans ten to one.
in a letter to his cousin in 1835 stephen austin left no doubt about his plans it is very evident that texas should be effectually and fully americanized that is settled by a population that will harmonize with their neighbors on the east in language political principles common origin sympathy and even interest.
texas must be a slave country.
it is no longer a matter of doubt a changing political situation in mexico aggravated the growing tensions.
in 1834 general antonio lpez de santa anna the mexican president suspended the national congress and became a dictator calling himself the napoleon of the west texans feared that santa anna planned to free our slaves and to make slaves of us when santa anna imprisoned austin in 1834 texans decided that the mexican ruler had to go.
upon his release from jail eighteen months later austin called for texans to revolt war is our only resource.
there is no other remedy.
we must defend our rights ourselves and our country by force of arms he urged that texas become fully american promote slavery and join the united states.
in the fall of 1835 texans followed austins lead and rebelled against santa annas despotism an infuriated santa anna ordered all americans expelled all texans disarmed and all rebels arrested and executed as pirates as sporadic fighting erupted hundreds of armed volunteers from southern states rushed to assist the 30 000 texians and tejanos fighting for their independence against a mexican nation of 7 million people.
the sword is drawn austin proclaimed.
the alamo at san antonio the provincial capital in southern texas general santa annas 3 000 man army assaulted a group of fewer than 200 texians tejanos and members of the texas volunteer army holed up in an abandoned catholic mission called the alamo.
the outnumbered and outgunned texas rebels were led by three colorful adventurers with checkered pasts james jim bowie william barret travis and david crockett.
they symbolized the role of texas as a haven for people wanting second chances.
the sandy haired bowie born in kentucky but raised in louisiana had become a ruthless slave trader and deceitful land speculator.
however he was most famous for the bowie knife he used to wound and kill men in n umerous 572 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 fights.
bowie claimed he had never started a fight nor lost one.
and he was hard to bring down.
in his most famous brawl he was shot twice stabbed and impaled by a sword before he killed his opponent with his knife.
bowie wore out his welcome in louisiana and migrated to texas in 1828 settled near san antonio and came to own about a million acres of texas land.
he married a prominent mexican woman became a mexican citizen and learned spanish but a cholera epidemic killed his wife and two children as well as his in laws.
upon learning of the texas revolution bowie joined the volunteer army and fought in several battles before arriving in san antonio in january 1836.
bowie often roaring drunk commanded the texas volunteers in the alamo while william travis a hot tempered twenty six year old lawyer and teacher led the texian regular army soldiers.
travis had come to texas by way of alabama where he had left behind a failed marriage a pregnant wife a t wo year old son considerable debts and rumors claimed a man he had killed.
travis pledged that he would redeem his life by doing something great and honorable in texas or die trying.
his determination to face an honorable death led him to refuse orders to retreat from the alamo.
the most famous american at the alamo was david crockett the tennessee frontiersman sharpshooter bear hunter and storyteller who had fought under andrew jackson and served in congress as an anti jackson whig.
in his last speech before congress after being defeated for reelection crockett who was not called davy until long after his death told his colleagues that he was done with politics for the present and that they might go to hell and i would go to texas he told his son and daughter that he planned to make a fortune for myself and family in texas.
soon after arriving in texas with his trusty rifle old betsy crockett the lion of the west was told he would receive 4 000 acres of land for his service as a fighter.
he then was assigned to join the garrison at the alamo.
full of bounce and brag the forty nine year old crockett was thoroughly expert at killing.
as he once told his men pierce the heart of the enemy as you would a feller that spit in your face knocked down your wife burnt up your houses and called your dog a skunk what crockett travis and bowie shared with the other defenders of the alamo was a commitment to liberty in the face of santa annas growing despotism.
in late february 1836 santa anna demanded that the alamos defenders surrender.
by then bowie had fallen seriously ill was bedridden and had turned over his command to travis who answered the mexican ultimatum with cannon fire.
he then sent urgent appeals to texian towns for supplies and more men while promising that i shall never surrender or retreat.
victory or death moving west 573 the alamo david crockett pictured fighting with his rifle over his head joined the legendary effort to defend the alamo against the mexican armys repeated assaults.
help did not come however and santa anna launched a series of assaults against the outnumbered defenders.
for twelve days the mexicans were thrown back and suffered heavy losses.
the ferocious fighting at the alamo turned the rebellion into a war for texan independence.
on march 2 1836 delegates from all fifty nine texas towns most of them american immigrants met at the tiny village of washington on the brazos some 150 miles northeast of san antonio.
there they signed a declaration of independence and drafted a constitution for the new republic of texas.
the delegates then named sam houston as the commander of their disorganized but growing army four days later the defenders of the alamo were awakened at four oclock in the morning by the sound of mexican bugles playing the dreaded degello no mercy to the defenders.
colonel travis shouted the mexicans are upon us give em hell the climactic battle of the alamo was fought in the predawn dark.
wave after wave of santa annas men attacked.
they were twice forced back but on the third try they broke through the battered north wall.
travis was killed by a bullet between the eyes.
some of the texans took the fight outside the alamo with tomahawks knives rifle butts and fists but in the end virtually all of them were killed or wounded.
574 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 seven alamo defenders perhaps including crockett survived and were captured.
santa anna ordered them hacked to death with swords.
a mexican officer wrote that the captives died without complaining and without humiliating themselves before their torturers by dawn the battle was over.
the only survivors were a handful of women and children and joe traviss slave.
it was a costly victory however as more than 600 mexicans died.
the battle of the alamo also provided a rallying cry for vengeful texians.
while santa anna proclaimed a glorious victory and ordered the bodies of the revolutionaries burned his aide wrote ominously in his diary one more such glorious victory and we are finished goliad two weeks later at the battle of coleto a mexican force again defeated a smaller texian army many of them recently arrived volunteers from southern states.
the mexicans marched the 465 captured texians to a fort in the nearby town of goliad.
despite pleas from his own men to show mercy santa anna ordered the captives killed as pirates and outlaws on palm sunday march 27 1836 more than 300 texians were marched out of goliad and murdered.
the massacres at the alamo and goliad fueled a burning desire for revenge among the texians.
sam houston the fate of the texas revolution was now in the hands of the already legendary sam houston a hulking rowdy larger than life frontier statesman born in virginia to scots irish immigrants.
at age fourteen after his father died houston had moved with his mother and siblings to eastern tennessee.
two years later he ran away from home and lived among the cherokees earning the nickname the raven like david crockett houston had served under general andrew jackson during the war of 1812 where he was grievously wounded at the battle of horseshoe bend.
thereafter he returned to tennessee and soon became a federal indian agent an attorney a u s congressman commanding general of the tennessee militia and at the ripe age of thirty governor.
unlike his friend david crockett however houston adored andrew jackson and became his devoted disciple and surrogate son leading many people to speculate that he might become the next president.
like jackson however houston was at heart an oddball ruffian he had an untamed yet gallant personality and violent temper cloaked in a charming brashness.
a friend called him a magnificent barbarian he drank.
he gambled.
he chased women.
and he brawled.
moving west 575 after learning that william stanbery an a nti jackson ohio congressman had questioned his integrity congressman houston assaulted him with a hickory cane on a washington d c street.
stanbery pulled a pistol pushed it into houstons stomach and pulled the trigger only to have it misfire.
houston then beat him about the head before ending the fight with a swift kick between stanberys thighs.
stanbery filed charges and the speaker of the house ordered houston arrested and put on trial in congress.
found guilty of assault he was reprimanded and fined.
controversy dogged houston thereafter.
in 1829 he suddenly resigned the governorship of tennessee because eliza allen his beautiful aristocratic and much younger wife had left him soon after their wedding and returned to her fathers plantation near nashville.
houston never revealed the cause of the dispute sudden calamities but elizas family did its best to destroy his reputation accusing him of dishonoring her.
he in turn kept silent because he explained to president jackson doing so reinforced his notion of honor if his character could not stand the shock of mean spirited gossip he said then let me lose it for years wild rumors circulated about what had happened on houstons wedding night.
some claimed that eliza had discovered to her horror that houston had sustained a dreadful injury true a wound in the groin from an indian arrowhead in the creek war that had left him scarred and impotent a falsehood.
others reported that his bride had confessed she was in love with someone else and had only married him to please her family.
whatever the cause houston later wrote that his ugly public divorce threw him into an agony of despair over his private afflictions that ruined his political career and exiled him from nashville society.
jackson wrote houston a consoling letter oh what a reverse of fortune his friend had experienced.
oh how unstable are human affairs having shouldered the blame for the mysterious scandal the disconsolate houston was now an outcast.
he decided that suicide was his only option.
as he was preparing to kill himself however an eagle suddenly swooped down and then soared upward into the sunset.
then and there houston later wrote i knew that a great destiny waited for me in the west in 1829 houston boarded a steamboat and headed west to cairo illinois.
he then traveled on a flatboat down the mississippi then up the arkansas river to little rock where he bought a horse and made his way several hundred miles to the arkansas territory along the oklahoma border.
there he rejoined the cherokee adopted their clothing customs and language changed his name married a cherokee woman and was formally adopted 576 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 sam houston houston was commander in chief of the forces fighting for texass independence.
by the cherokee nation.
as he recalled he felt like a weary wanderer returned at last to his fathers house houston proved adept at helping rival indian tribes cherokee creek osage and choctaws negotiate differences among themselves and with the federal government.
he also grew addicted to alcohol the cherokees called him big drunk in december 1832 houston moved to texas at jacksons behest.
two months later he sent a secret report to the president indicating that texas was ripe for revolt from unstable mexico which was then embroiled in a civil war.
houston joined the rebellion against mexico and his fearlessness was a quality sorely needed by the texians.
the battle of san jacinto after learning of the massacre at the alamo houston led his outnumbered troops on a long strategic retreat to buy time while hoping that santa annas pursuing army would make a mistake.
on april 21 1836 the cocky mexican general walked into houstons trap when his army of 900 whooping fighters caught the 1 600 mexicans napping near the san jacinto river about t wenty five miles southeast of the modern city of houston.
the texians and tejanos charged yelling remember the alamo they overwhelmed the p anic stricken mexicans most of whom were sleeping.
general santa anna left his army leaderless that afternoon while he retreated to his tent accompanied some said by a mistress.
the battle lasted only eighteen minutes but houstons troops spent the next two hours slaughtering fleeing mexican soldiers.
it was said a texian a frightful sight to behold some 630 mexicans were killed and 700 captured.
the texians lost only nine men.
santa anna escaped but was captured the next day.
he bought his freedom by signing a treaty recognizing the independence of the republic of texas with the rio grande as its southern boundary with mexico.
the texas revolution had been accomplished in seven weeks.
the lone star republic in 1836 the lone star republic as texians called their new nation legalized slavery banned free blacks elected sam houston as its first president and voted overwhelmingly for annexation to moving west 577 the united states.
no one expected the republic of texas with only 40 000 people to remain independent for long.
but statehood for texas soon became embroiled in the explosive sectional dispute over slavery.
john c calhoun told the senate in 1836 that there were powerful reasons why texas should be part of this union.
the southern states owning a slave population were deeply interested in preventing that country from having the power to annoy them anti slavery northerners disagreed.
in 1837 the vermont state legislature solemnly protested against the admission of any state whose constitution tolerates domestic slavery the american president at the time was houstons old friend and former commander andrew jackson who eagerly wanted texas to join the union.
old hickory however decided it was better to wait a few years.
he knew that adding texas as a slave state would ignite an explosive quarrel between north and south that would fracture the democratic party and endanger the election of new yorker martin van buren his handpicked successor.
worse any effort to add texas to the union would likely mean a war with mexico which refused to recognize texan independence.
so jackson delayed official recognition of the republic of texas until his last day in office early in 1837.
van buren jacksons successor did as predicted he avoided all talk of texas annexation during his single term as president.
whigs and democrats when william henry harrison succeeded martin van buren as president in 1841 he was the oldest man 68 and the first whig to win the office.
the whigs who now controlled both houses of congress had first emerged in opposition to andrew jackson and continued to promote strong federal government support for industrial development and economic growth high tariffs to deter imports and federal funding for roads bridges and canals.
yet harrison was elected primarily on his prominence as a military hero.
he had avoided taking public stances on controversial issues.
in the end it mattered little as harrison served the shortest term of any president.
on april 4 1841 exactly one month after his inauguration he died of pneumonia and vice president john tyler became president.
the surprising turn of events pleased former president andrew jackson.
a kind and overruling providence had interfered he wrote a friend to prolong our glorious union and happy republican system which general harrison and his cabinet was sic preparing to destroy under the dictation of that profligate demagogue henry clay another former president john quincy adams had the opposite reaction.
he dismissed tyler the new president as a political sectarian of the s lave driving virginian jeffersonian school of politics whose talents were barely above mediocrity 578 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 henry clay hoped to dominate the mild mannered new president.
tyler dares not resist the imperious clay threatened or i will drive him before me tyler however was not willing to be dominated.
after an argument in the white house over a proposed new national bank he told clay go back down pennsylvania avenue to the capitol and perform his duties in congress.
so help me god i shall do mine at this end of it as i shall think proper john tyler the tall thin s lave owning virginian was a political maverick and the youngest president to date fifty one but he had lots of political experience having served as a state legislator governor congressman and senator.
he also fathered fifteen children the most of any president.
perhaps most important he was a man of stubborn independence and considerable charm.
a political acquaintance said tyler was approachable courteous always willing to do a kindly action or to speak a kindly word originally a democrat who had endorsed the jeffersonian commitment to states rights strict construction of the constitution and opposition to national banks tyler had broken with the party and joined the whigs over president jacksons condemnation of south carolinas attempt to nullify federal laws.
tyler believed that south carolina had a constitutional right to secede from the nation.
yet he never truly embraced the whigs.
as president tyler opposed everything associated with henry clays m uch celebrated program of economic nationalism the american system that called for high tariffs a national bank and internal improvements.
when congress met in a special session in 1841 clay introduced a series of controversial resolutions.
he called for the repeal of the independent treasury act and the creation of another bank of the united states proposed to revive the distribution program whereby the money generated by federal land sales was given to the states and urged that tariffs be raised on imported goods to hamper foreign competitors.
clay might have avoided a nasty dispute with tyler over financial issues had he been more tactful.
but for once driven by his compulsive quest to be president clay the great compromiser lost his instinct for compromise.
although tyler agreed to the repeal of the independent treasury act and signed a higher tariff bill he vetoed clays pet project the new national bank.
an incensed clay responded by calling tyler a traitor who had disgraced his party.
he claimed that the president was left solitary and alone shivering by the pitiless storm against his veto.
the dispute was so heated that scuffles and fistfights between whigs and democrats broke out in congress.
clay then convinced tylers entire cabinet to resign with the exception of secretary of state daniel webster.
a three year long war between clay and tyler had begun.
moving west 579 tyler replaced the defectors in his cabinet with a nti jackson democrats who like him had become whigs.
the whigs then expelled tyler from the party calling him his accidency and the executive ass sixty whig members of congress signed a statement denouncing tyler and declaring him no longer their representative.
some even talked of impeachment.
an exasperated tyler confided to a friend his frustration did you ever expect to see your old friend under trial for high crimes and misdemeanors by 1842 tyler had become a president without a party shunned by both whigs and democrats.
the political turmoil coincided with the ongoing economic depression that had begun in the late 1830s.
bank failures mounted businesses shut down and unemployment soared.
yet tyler refused to let either the sputtering economy or an international crisis with great britain deter him from annexing more territory into the united states.
tensions with britain in late 1841 slaves being transported from virginia to louisiana on the american ship creole revolted and took charge of the ship.
they sailed into nassau in the bahamas where british authorities set 128 of them free.
great britain had abolished slavery throughout its empire in 1834.
it was the most successful slave revolt in american history.
southerners were infuriated and the incident mushroomed into an international crisis.
secretary of state daniel webster demanded that the slaves be returned as american property but the british refused.
rather than risk a war that the united states might lose tyler and webster acquiesced to the british refusal to return the slaves.
this only made southern slaveholders more furious.
james henry hammond the south carolina planter lashed out at the tyler administration with such a stupid imbecile as tyler at the head of affairs and such an unprincipled and cowardly sec.
of state as webster we should fare badly for a time.
they are bent on peace at this point the british government decided to send alexander baring lord ashburton head of a major bank to meet with secretary of state webster who viewed good relations with britain as essential for the america economy.
the meetings concluded with the signing of the webster ashburton treaty 1842 which provided for joint naval patrols off africa to police the outlawed slave trade.
the treaty also resolved a l ong standing dispute over the northeastern u s boundary with british canada.
but it did nothing about returning the freed slaves.
the dispute was not settled until 1853 when england paid 110 000 to the owners of the freed slaves.
the extension of our empire texas from the moment he became president john tyler had his eyes fixed on annexing the 580 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 austin texas in 1840 a view of the capital of the newly formed republic of texas the citys population at the time numbered less than a thousand.
republic of texas into the united states.
his wife julia later said that texas was the great object of his ambition to secure his place in history.
in tylers first address to congress he pledged to do so explaining that there was nothing to fear from the extension of our empire tylers efforts to recruit senators to approve an annexation treaty exhilarated texas leaders who had long been frustrated that their lone star republic had not yet been welcomed into the united states.
sam houston threatened to expand the republic of texas to the pacific.
but with little money a rising government debt and continuing tensions with mexico this was mostly talk.
the lone star republic had no i nfrastructure no banks no schools no industries.
it remained largely a frontier community.
houston decided that the rickety republic of texas had only two choices annexation to the united states or closer economic ties to great britain which extended formal diplomatic recognition to the republic and began buying cotton from texas planters.
meanwhile thousands more americans poured into texas enticed by the republics offer of 1 280 acres of land to each white family.
the population more than tripled between 1836 and 1845 from 40 000 to 150 000 and the enslaved black population grew even faster than the white population.
a tragic cruise on february 28 1844 president tyler and a group ropeller driven steam of 300 dignitaries boarded the u s s.
princeton a new p warship for an excursion on the potomac river.
as sailors fired the ships huge moving west 581 fteen foot long cannons one of them the peacemaker exploded killing fi eight people including the secretary of state the secretary of the navy and a new york state legislator.
more than a dozen others were seriously wounded.
president tyler who was below deck at the time of the accident rushed to see what had happened a more heart rending scene scarcely ever occurred he wrote.
what a loss i have sustained.
after the funerals for the accident victims tyler seized the opportunity created by the tragic accident to reorganize his entire cabinet by naming southern democrats to key positions.
he appointed john c calhoun secretary of state primarily because he wanted the prominent south carolinian to complete the annexation of texas.
on april 12 1844 calhoun signed a treaty of annexation with the republic of texas and tyler submitted it to the senate for approval.
texas would become an american territory in exchange for the united states assuming all of its debts.
tyler explained that the addition of texas would add to national greatness and wealth and would strengthen rather than weaken the union calhoun however unwittingly undermined the annexation treaty by writing the british ambassador what he thought was a confidential letter in which he declared that blacks were inferior to whites and better off enslaved than free.
slavery calhoun insisted was essential to the peace safety and prosperity of the south.
adding texas he concluded was necessary to keep the south in the union.
on june 8 1844 outraged northerners in the senate voted down calhouns annexation treaty 35 to 16 the election of 1844 thereafter leaders in both political parties hoped to keep the divisive texas issue out of the 1844 presidential campaign.
whig henry clay and democrat martin van buren the leading candidates for each partys nomination agreed that adding texas to the union would be a mistake.
for his part tyler having alienated both parties initially announced that he would run for reelection as an independent using the campaign slogan tyler and texas within a few weeks however he realized he had little support and dropped out of the race giving his endorsement to polk.
van burens southern supporters including former president andrew jackson abandoned him because he opposed the annexation of texas.
they instead nominated james knox polk former speaker of the house and former governor of tennessee.
like tyler polk was an enthusiastic expansionist who wanted to make the united states a transcontinental global power.
unlike tyler polk was a loyal democrat who hated whigs.

figure m13 2 1st proof nomination.
the democrats platform called for the annexation of texas and declared that the united states had a clear and unquestionable claim to all of the oregon country.
the 1844 presidential election proved to be one of the most significant in history.
by promoting southern and western expansionism the democrats offered a winning strategy one so popular it forced clay the whig candidate to alter his position on texas at the last minute he now claimed that he had no personal objection to the annexation if it could be achieved without dishonor without war with the common consent of the union and upon just and fair terms clays waffling on texas shifted more a nti slavery votes to the new liberty party the anti slavery party formed in 1840 which increased its count in the presidential election from about 7 000 in 1840 to more than 62 000 in 1844.
in moving west 583 the western counties of new york the liberty party drew enough votes away from clay and the whigs to give the crucial state to polk.
had clay carried new york he would have won the election by 7 electoral votes.
instead polk won a narrow national plurality of 38 000 popular votes the first president since john quincy adams to win without a majority but a clear majority of the electoral college 170 to 105.
julia tyler the presidents wife was overjoyed with the outcome hurrah for polk.
what will become of henry clay and of the downfall of our whig friends a devastated clay had lost his third and last presidential election.
he could not understand how he lost to polk whom he considered a third rate politician lacking leadership abilities.
james k polk yet james k polk had been surprising people his whole career.
born near charlotte north carolina the oldest of ten children he graduated first in his class at the university of north carolina then moved to tennessee where he became a successful lawyer and planter entered politics and served fourteen years in congress four as speaker of the house and two years as governor.
at age forty nine polk was americas youngest president up to that time.
short thin and humorless he was called young hickory because of his admiration for andrew jackson.
and like jackson he believed that any efforts by the federal government to promote economic growth necessarily helped some people and regions and hurt others.
he was thus opposed to tariffs a national bank and federally funded roads.
polks greatest virtue was his relentless work ethic.
i am the hardest w orking man in this country he declared.
true to his word he often worked from dawn to midnight and rarely took a vacation.
such unrelenting intensity eventually wore him out however.
polk would die in 1849 at fifty three years old just three months after leaving office.
the state of texas texas the hottest political potato had been added as a new state just before polk was sworn in as president.
in his final months in office president john tyler had taken an unusual step by asking congress to annex texas by joint resolution which required only a simple majority in each house rather than the t wo thirds senate vote needed to ratify a treaty of annexation.
the resolution narrowly passed with most whigs opposed.
on march 1 1845 in his final presidential action tyler signed the resolution admitting texas to the union as the twenty eighth state and fifteenth slave state on december 29 1845.
six weeks later on february 16 1846 the lone star flag of the republic of texas was lowered and the flag of the united states was raised over the largest state in the nation.
584 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 at the time texas had a population of 100 000 whites and 38 000 enslaved blacks.
by 1850 the population both white and black had soared by almost 50 percent.
the census then did not include native americans.
by 1860 texas had 600 000 people most of them from southern states focused on growing cotton.
polks goals perhaps because he pledged to serve only one term polk was a president in a hurry.
he focused on four major objectives all of which he accomplished.
he managed to 1 reduce tariffs on imports 2 reestablish the independent treasury we need no national banks 3 settle the oregon boundary dispute with britain and 4 acquire california from mexico.
his top priority was territorial expansion.
he wanted to add oregon california and new mexico to the union to fill out the continent.
in keeping with l ong standing democratic beliefs polk wanted lower tariffs to allow more foreign goods to compete in the american marketplace and thereby help drive consumer prices down.
congress agreed by approving the walker tariff of 1846 named after robert j walker the secretary of the treasury.
in the same year polk persuaded congress to restore the independent treasury act that martin van buren had signed into law in 1840 and the tariff of 1846 this political cartoon illustrates the public outcry represented by a quaker woman ready to whip p olk against the tariff of 1846 one of the lowest in the nations history.
the mexican a merican war 585 hig dominated congress had repealed the next year.
the act established w independent treasury deposit offices to receive all federal government funds.
the system was intended to replace the second bank of the united states which jackson had killed so as to offset the chaotic growth of unregulated state banks whose reckless lending practices had helped cause the depression of the late 1830s.
the new independent treasury entrusted the federal government rather than state banks with the exclusive management of government funds and required that all disbursements be made in gold or silver or paper currency backed by gold or silver.
polk also twice vetoed whig passed bills for federally funded infrastructure projects.
his efforts to reverse whig economic policies satisfied the slaveholding south but angered northerners who wanted higher tariffs to protect their industries from british competition and westerners who wanted federally financed roads and harbors.
oregon meanwhile the dispute with great britain over the oregon country boundary heated up as expansionists insisted that polk take the whole region rather than split it with the british.
polk was willing to go to the brink of war to achieve his goals.
if we do have war the president blustered it will not be our fault fortunately neither polk nor the british were willing to risk war.
on june 15 1846 james buchanan polks secretary of state signed what was called the buchanan pakenham treaty which extended the border between the united states and british canada westward to the pacific coast along the 49th parallel.
once the treaty was approved by both nations the new york herald announced that now we can thrash mexico into decency at our leisure the m exican a merican war the settlement of the oregon country boundary dispute allowed the united states to turn its attention southward.
on march 6 1845 two days after james polk took office the mexican government broke off relations with the united states to protest the annexation of texas.
polk was willing to wage war against mexico to acquire california and new mexico but he did not want americans to fire the first shot.
nor did polk want a war that might produce a military hero who would become a whig candidate for the presidency.
senator thomas hart benton of missouri a powerful democrat disclosed that polk wanted a small war just large enough to require a treaty for peace and not large enough to create military reputations that might pose a political challenge after the war.

figure m13 3 what were the terms of the buchanan pakenham treaty.
1st proof why were both the americans and the british eager to settle the disagreement over the vast oregon territory.
so polk ordered several thousand u s troops under general zachary taylor to take up positions around corpus christi near the rio grande.
the u s troops were knowingly in disputed territory and mexico viewed the arrival of u s troops along the rio grande as an act of war.
on the evening of may 9 1845 polk learned that mexican troops had attacked u s soldiers north of the rio grande.
eleven americans were killed five wounded and the remainder taken prisoner.
hostilities may now be considered as commenced taylor reported.
the mexican a merican war 587 polks scheme to provoke an attack had worked.
to avoid the risk that congress would vote down a declaration of war polk simply declared that the mexicans had started a war that now needed to be funded.
mexico he reported has invaded our territory and shed american blood upon the american soil congress quickly authorized the recruitment of 50 000 soldiers.
some congressmen however were skeptical of polks explanation.
whig garret davis of kentucky asserted that the rio grande was a part of mexico not texas it is our own president who began this war even democrats were concerned about the presidents account of what had happened.
a new york senator john dix said he would not be surprised if the next accounts should show that there is no mexican invasion of our soil the war he later added was begun in fraud.
and i think will end in disgrace president polk steadfastly denied that the war against mexico had anything to do with the expansion of slavery.
he argued instead that his efforts to extend americas boundaries to the pacific were intended to replace sectional tensions with national unity.
for polk the notion of manifest destiny was a means of promoting national unity.
after all he stressed slavery could not flourish in places like new mexico and california because cotton could not be grown there because of the climate.
with the outbreak of fighting most americans accepted the presidents account of what happened along the mexico texas border and rushed to support the military.
let us go to war screamed a new york newspaper.
another headline blared mexico or death the new york j ournalist poet walt whitman got caught up in the war fever urging those enlisting in the army to show the world that america knows how to crush as well as how to expand the south was especially excited over the war because of the possibility of acquiring more territory.
so many southerners wild reckless young fellows rushed to volunteer that thousands had to be turned away.
eventually 112 000 whites served in the war blacks were banned.
in tennessee there were so many volunteers that it became difficult even to purchase a place in the ranks among the warriors were young army officers who would later distinguish themselves as opposing leaders in the civil war pierre beauregard braxton bragg ulysses s grant joseph hooker thomas jackson james longstreet robert e lee george mcclellan george meade william t sherman and george thomas.
opposition to the war in new england and among northern abolitionists there was much less enthusiasm for mr.
polks war congressman john quincy adams called it a most unrighteous war designed to extend slavery into new territories.
many other new englanders involved with the growing 588 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 a bolitionist movement denounced the war as an unjustified act of aggression designed to satisfy pro slavery southerners eager for more cotton territory.
william lloyd garrison the fiery boston abolitionist charged that the war was one of aggression of invasion of conquest a few miles away in concord henry david thoreau spent a night in jail rather than pay taxes that might help fund the war.
thoreaus mentor ralph waldo emerson predicted that the united states will conquer mexico but it will be as the man who swallows arsenic which brings him down in turn.
mexico will poison us most northern whigs including a young illinois congressman named abraham lincoln opposed zachary taylor like andrew jackson the m exican american war arguing taylor was a popular war hero whose that polk had maneuvered the meximilitary exploits paved the way to the cans into attacking.
the united states presidency.
they insisted had no reason to place its army in the disputed border region between texas and mexico.
in what came to be called spot resolutions lincoln repeatedly asked the president to locate the precise spot where the american troops were fired upon implying that they may have illegally crossed into mexican territory.
whig leader henry clay called the war unnatural and lamentable expressing concern that the nation was becoming a warlike and conquering power while daniel webster charged that the wars disputed origins were unconstitutional both clay and webster would lose sons in the war.
preparing for battle the united states was again ill p repared for a major war.
at the outset the regular army numbered barely more than 7 000 in contrast to the mexican force of 32 000.
before the war ended the u s military had grown to almost 79 000 troops many of whom were frontier toughs who lacked uniforms equipment and discipline.
repeatedly these soldiers engaged in plunder rape and murder.
yet they outfought the larger mexican forces which had their own problems with training discipline morale supplies and munitions.
the mexican a merican war 589 the mexican american war would last two years from march 1846 to april 1848 and would be fought on four fronts southern texas northern mexico central mexico new mexico and california.
early in the fighting the u s army scored two victories north of the rio grande at palo alto may 8 and resaca de la palma may 9.
on may 18 taylors army crossed the rio grande and occupied matamoros.
these quick victories brought taylor a whig instant popularity and polk agreed to public demand that taylor be made overall commander.
it was an excellent choice since taylor old rough and ready had spent t hirty eight years in the army and had earned the respect and affection of his men.
the annexation of california president polks foremost objective through the war was not the defeat of mexico but the acquisition of california.
not only did the mexican province along the pacific have wonderful harbors san francisco monterey and san diego but the president also feared that great britain or france would take control of california if the united states did not.
polk had sent secret instructions to commodore john d sloat commander of the pacific naval squadron telling him that if war erupted with mexico he was to use his warships to gain control of the port of san francisco and blockade or occupy such other ports as your force may permit in may 1846 sloat having heard of the outbreak of hostilities along the rio grande set sail for california.
in early july u s sailors and troops went ashore in san francisco took down the flag of the republic of california raised the american flag and claimed california as part of the united states.
soon thereafter sloat turned his command over to commodore robert f stockton who sailed south to capture san diego and los angeles.
by m id august mexican resistance had evaporated.
at the same time another american military expedition headed for california.
on august 18 general stephen kearnys army captured santa fe the capital of new mexico then moved on to join stocktons forces.
they took control of los angeles on january 10 1847 and the remaining mexican forces surrendered three days later.
stockton and kearny then quarreled over who was in command since each had similar orders to conquer and govern california.
in the meantime the unpredictable john c frmont arrived from sonoma with 400 newly recruited troops and claimed that stockton was in charge.
stockton responded by naming frmont governor of california and the power hungry frmont immediately set about giving orders making proclamations and appointing officials.
this left kearny in a bind president polk had ordered him to be the governor but frmont defied his orders.
590 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 two months later in june 1847 general kearny had seen enough.
he had governor frmont arrested charged him with insubordination and mutiny and transported him across the country for a c ourt martial.
in washington d c kearny was hailed as a hero while the jailed frmont awaited the military trial.
in the most celebrated trial since that of vice president aaron burr in 1807 frmont was found guilty of mutiny and insubordination and dismissed from the army.
president polk however quickly reversed the sentence in light of frmonts meritorious and valuable services he urged frmont to remain in the army and resume the sword but the pathfinder was so enraged at the court ruling that he resigned his commission and settled in california where he would become the states first u s senator.
war in northern mexico both california and new mexico had been taken from mexican control before general zachary taylor fought his first major battle in northern mexico.
in september 1846 taylors army assaulted the fortified city of monterrey which surrendered after a fi ve day siege.
then general antonio lpez de santa anna who had been forced out of power in 1845 sent word to polk from his exile in cuba that he would end the war if he were allowed to return.
polk assured the exiled mexican leader that the u s government would pay well for any territory taken from mexico.
in august 1846 on polks orders santa anna was permitted to return to mexico.
but the crafty santa anna had lied.
soon he was again president of mexico and in command of the mexican army.
as it turned out however he was much more talented at raising armies than leading them in battle.
in october 1846 santa anna invited the outnumbered americans to surrender.
taylor responded tell him to go to hell that launched the h ard fought battle of buena vista february 22 23 1847 in northern mexico.
both sides claimed victory but the mexicans suffered five times as many casualties as the americans.
thereafter the mexicans continued to lose battles but they refused to accept polks terms for surrender.
the united states may triumph said a mexican newspaper but its prize like that of the vulture will lie in a lake of blood frustrated by taylors inability to win a decisive victory polk authorized an assault on mexico city the nations capital.
on march 9 1847 a large american force led by winfield scott the general in chief of the u s army landed on the beaches south of veracruz.
it was considered to be the strongest fortress in north america with three forts guarding the approaches to the port city.
the american assault on veracruz was the largest amphibious operation ever attempted by u s military forces and was carried out without loss.
the news of the american victory made general scott a national hero.

in august general scotts formidable invasion force set out on the route taken by corts and his spanish troops in their assault on the aztec empire more than 300 years earlier marching toward the heavily defended mexican capital 200 miles away.
in england the duke of wellington who had defeated e 592 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 fall of mexico city general winfield scott formally enters mexico city upon its capture by american soldiers on september 14 1847.
napolon at the battle of waterloo more than thirty years before predicted that scott is l ost he cannot capture the city and he cannot fall back upon his base yet the english hero could not have been more wrong.
after four brilliantly orchestrated battles in which they overwhelmed the mexican defenders u s forces arrived at the gates of mexico city in early september 1847.
the duke of wellington now changed his tune calling general scott the worlds greatest living soldier ulysses s grant also applauded his commander pointing out that with only half as many troops as the mexicans scott had won every battle he captured the capital and conquered the government the saint patricks battalion general scotts triumphant assault on mexico city was not without problems however.
since the start of the war some 7 000 soldiers had deserted the highest of any foreign war.
several hundred of them mostly poor catholic irish and german immigrants who had recently arrived in new york city crossed over to form the saint patricks battalion in the mexican army which included many foreign fighters.
why the american soldiers called san patricios in spanish chose to switch sides remains in dispute but several factors were at work many of the catholic defectors resented the abuse harsh and cruel handling they received from native u s protestant officers and the atrocities they saw committed the mexican a merican war 593 against catholic americans.
some were also attracted by the higher wages land grants and promises of citizenship provided by the mexican government which claimed that it was the victim of americas barbarous aggression the mexican army circulated leaflets to american soldiers which urged the foreign born to switch sides and fight for their shared sacred imperiled religion.
if you are catholic the same as we if you follow the doctrines of our savior why are you murdering your brethren.
why are you antagonistic to those who defend their country and your own god whatever their motives the san patricios fought tenaciously against the americans.
during one of the battles for mexico city the americans captured seventy two defectors fighting in the st patricks battalion.
they were quickly tried and most of them were sentenced to death.
although military law at the time called for traitors to be shot by a firing squad general scott ordered that about fifty of the deserters be hanged.
the others were whipped and branded with a d on each cheek.
at dawn on september 13 1847 twenty nine of the captured san patricios their hands and feet bound were taken in wooden carts to stand in the hot sun under a gallows in sight of chapultepec the last mexican fortress protecting mexico city.
there they were forced to watch the battle unfold over four hours.
when the american troops finally scaled the walls of the fortress and raised the u s flag the san patricios were all hanged simultaneously.
st patricks battalion the men of st patricks battalion continue to be celebrated in mexico as martyrs with numerous cities schools and streets bearing the name san patricio.
594 chapter 13 western expansion 1830 1848 just before the mass executions the army surgeon reported to colonel william harney an officer infamous for his brutality that one of the san patricios francis oconnor had lost both legs in the fighting.
the doctor asked what should be done with the man.
harney yelled bring the damned son of a bitch out.
my order was to hang 30 and by god ill do it the mexican government which erected a monument in honor of the san patricios described the executions as improper in a civilized age and ironic for a people who aspire to the title of illustrious and humane the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo after the fall of mexico city santa anna resigned from office and fled the country.
the mexican government was left in turmoil.
peace talks began on january 2 1848 at the village of guadalupe hidalgo just outside the capital but dragged on for weeks in part because different people claimed to be in charge of the mexican government.
when the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo was signed on february 2 a humiliated mexican government was forced to agree that the border with texas would be the rio grande and to transfer control of all or parts of the future states of california new mexico nevada utah arizona wyoming and colorado.
this represented over half of the entire nation of mexico.
with the addition of territory in southern arizona and new mexico through the gadsden purchase of 1853 these annexations rounded out the continental united states doubled its size and provided routes for eventual transcontinental rail lines.
in return for what polk called an immense empire that encompassed more than half a million square miles the united states agreed to pay 15 million.
the senate ratified the treaty on march 10 1848.
by the end of july the last remaining u s soldiers had left mexico.
the wars legacies the mexican american war was americas first major military intervention outside the united states and the first time that u s military forces had conquered and occupied another country.
more than 13 000 americans died 11 550 of them from disease especially measles and dysentery.
the war remains the deadliest in american history in terms of the percentage of soldiers lost.
out of every 1 000 soldiers in mexico some 110 died.
the next highest death rate would be in the civil war with 65 dead out of every 1 000 participants.
the victory also helped end americas prolonged economic depression.
as the years passed however the mexican american war was increasingly seen as a shameful war of conquest directed by a president bent on territorial expansion for the sake of slavery.
ulysses s grant later called it one of the mexican a merican war 595 the most unjust wars ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation he wrote his wife that she would not believe how many mexican civilians had been murdered by american soldiers.
the number would startle you even general zachary taylor called it an unnecessary and senseless war.
news of the victory over mexico however thrilled american expansionists.
the editor john osullivan who had coined the term manifest destiny shouted more more more.
why not take all of mexico treasury secretary robert walker was equally giddy about the addition of california and the oregon country.
asia has suddenly become our neighbor.
inviting our steamships upon the trade of a commerce greater than all of europe combined the acquisition of the northern mexican provinces made the united states a transcontinental nation and required a dramatic expansion of the federal government.
in 1849 congress created the department of the interior to supervise the distribution of land the creation of new territories and states and the protection of the indians and their reservations.
americans now had their long coveted western empire.
but what were they to do with it.
president polk had naively assumed that the expansion of american territory to the pacific would strengthen the bonds of union he was wrong.
no sooner was texas annexed and gold was discovered in california than a violent debate erupted over the extension of slavery into the territories acquired from mexico.
that debate would enflame sectional rivalries that would nearly destroy the union.
chapter review summary westward migration in the 1830s americans came to believe in manifest destiny that the west was divinely ordained to be part of the united states.
although populated by indians and hispanics the west was portrayed as an empty land.
but a population explosion and the lure of cheap fertile land prompted americans to move along the overland trails enduring great physical hardships toward oregon oregon fever and california.
traders and trappers were the first americans to move into california during the 1830s.
the discovery of gold there in 1848 brought a flood of people from all over the world.
many southerners also moved to the mexican province of texas to grow cotton taking their slaves with them.
the mexican government opposed slavery however and in 1830 forbade further immigration.
texians rebelled winning their independence from mexico in the texas revolution but statehood would not come for another decade because political leaders were determined to avoid war with mexico over the territory and the issue of adding another slave state to the union.
mexican american war when the united states finally annexed texas in 1845 mexico was furious.
the newly elected u s president james k polk sought to acquire california and new mexico as well but negotiations soon failed.
when mexican troops crossed the rio grande polk urged congress to declare war.
american forces eventually won despite high casualties.
in 1848 in the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo mexico ceded california and new mexico to the united states and gave up claims to land north of the rio grande.
the vast acquisition did not strengthen the union however.
instead it ignited a fierce dispute over the role of slavery in the new territories.

the gathering storm 1848 1860 bleeding kansas 1856 this engraving depicts the sack of lawrence kansas in may 1856 by p ro slavery border ruffians the violence sparked by these slave holding missourians proved to be a foreboding sign of the destruction that would engulf the nation in the coming decade.
a t midcentury political storm clouds were forming over the fate of slavery.
the united states was a powerful nation but as henry clay said it was an unhappy country torn by the uproar confusion and menace caused by the deepening agony over slavery.
without intending to the united states had developed two quite different societies one in the north and the other in the south and the two sections increasingly disagreed over the nations future.
in 1833 andrew jackson had predicted that southerners intend to blow up a storm on the slave question he added that pro slavery firebrands like john c calhoun would do any act to destroy this union and form a southern confederacy bounded north by the potomac river by 1848 jacksons prediction seemed close to reality.
at midcentury the sectional tensions over slavery generated constant political conflict.
the compromise of 1850 provided a short term resolution of some of the issues dividing north and south but new controversies such as the fate of slavery in the kansas territory the creation of the anti slavery republican party and the growing militancy of abolitionists led more and more people to decide that the united states could not continue to be a nation half slave and half free as abraham lincoln insisted.
the result was first the secession of eleven southern states and then a bloody civil war to force them back into the union.
in the process the volatile issue of slavery was resolved by ending the peculiar institution slavery in the territories the wilmot proviso on august 8 1846 soon after the m exican merican war erupted david wilmot an obscure democratic congressman a from pennsylvania delivered a speech to the house of representatives in which he endorsed the annexation of texas as a slave state.
but if any new territory should be acquired as a result of the war with mexico he declared god focus questions 1.
how did the federal government try to resolve the issue of slavery in the western territories during the 1850s.
what appealed to northern voters about the republican party.
how did this lead to abraham lincolns victory in the 1860 presidential contest.
why did seven southern states secede from the union shortly after lincolns election in 1860.
506 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 that states were democratizing the political process.
s o called freewill ministers insisted that everyone regardless of their wealth or circumstances could choose to be saved by embracing jesuss promise of salvation just as more men who owned no property were allowed to choose their elected officials.
evangelicals assumed that the american republic had a g od mandated mission to provide a shining example of representative government much as puritan new england had once stood as an example of an ideal christian community.
the concept of america having a special god given mission to create an ideal society often called manifest destiny still carried strong spiritual overtones.
the sense of america being on a god directed mission also contained an element of perfectionism people could become more and more perfect through a commitment to reforming themselves and society.
throughout the first half of the nineteenth century reformers fanned out across the united states and the combination of widespread religious energy and intense social activism brought major advances in human rights.
it also at times triggered cynicism and disillusionment.
a more democratic religion the energies of the rational enlightenment and the spiritual great awakening flowed from the colonial period into the nineteenth century.
in different ways these two powerful modes of thought one scientific and rational and the other religious and optimistic eroded the old calvinist view that people were innately sinful and that god had chosen only a select few for heavenly salvation a doctrine referred to as predestination.
during the nineteenth century many christians embraced a more democratic religious outlook.
just as enlightenment rationalism stressed humanitys natural goodness and encouraged a belief in progress through democratic reforms and individual improvement protestant churches stressed that all people were capable of perfection through the guiding light of christ and their own activism.
rational religion enlightenment ideas including the religious concept of deism inspired prominent leaders such as thomas jefferson and benjamin franklin.
deists believed in a rational god creator of the rational universe and that all people were created as equals.
they prized science and reason over traditional religion and blind faith.
interest in deism increased after the american revolution.
through the use of reason and scientific research deists believed people might grasp the natural laws governing the universe.
deists rejected the belief that every statement in the bible was literally true and questioned the divinity of jesus.
they also defended free speech and opposed religious coercion.
a more democratic religion 507 unitarianism and universalism the same ideals of enlightenment rationalism that excited deists soon began to make deep inroads into american protestantism.
the old churches in and around boston proved especially vulnerable to the appeal of anti puritan religious liberalism.
by the end of the eighteenth century w ell educated new englanders most of them congregationalists were embracing unitarianism a liberal faith that emphasized the oneness unity and compassion of a loving god the natural goodness of humankind the superiority of calm reason over emotional forms of worship the rejection of the calvinist belief in predestination and a general rather than literal reading of the bible.
unitarians abandoned the concept of the trinity god the father the son and the holy ghost that had long been central to the christian faith.
unitarians believed that god and jesus are separate jesus was a saintly man but not divine who set a shining example of a good life.
people are not inherently sinful unitarians stressed.
by following the teachings of jesus and trusting the guidance of their own consciences all people are eligible for the gift of salvation from a god who is not angry and unforgiving but blessed with boundless love.
boston became the center of the organized unitarian movement which initially emerged within congregational churches.
during the early nineteenth century liberal churches adopted the name unitarian.
many of its early supporters were among the best educated and wealthiest new englanders.
a parallel anti calvinist religious movement universalism attracted a different and much l arger social group the working poor.
in 1779 john murray a british clergyman founded the first universalist church in gloucester massachusetts.
like the unitarians universalists proclaimed the dignity and worth of all people.
they stressed that people must liberate themselves from the rule of priests and ministers and use their own capacity to reason to explore the mysteries of existence.
to universalists and unitarians hell did not exist.
salvation was universal available to everyone through the sacrifice of jesus.
in essence universalists thought god was too good and caring to damn people to hell while unitarians thought themselves too good to be damned.
the two denominations would combine in 1961 becoming the unitarian universalist faith.
the second great awakening the rise of universalism and unitarianism did not mean that traditional religious beliefs were waning.
in fact evangelism was widespread.
during the first great awakening in the early 1700s traveling revivalists had promoted a more intense and personal relationship with god.
in addition anglicanism suffered from being aligned 508 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 with the church of england it lost its status as the official religion in most states after the american revolution.
to help erase their pro british image virginia anglicans renamed themselves episcopalians.
but even the new name did not prevent the episcopal church from losing its leadership position in the south.
newer denominations especially baptists and methodists 20 percent of whom were african american emerged and attracted masses of excited followers.
these christian sects were organized in accord with more d emocratic principles they allowed john wesley wesleys gravestone individual congregations to exercise reads lord let me not live to be useless more power on their own than did the anglican church.
in 1784 methodists met in baltimore and announced that they were abandoning episcopalianism and forming a distinct new denomination committed to the aggressive conversion of all people men women indians and african americans.
the r eform minded methodists inspired by their founder the english anglican priest john wesley abandoned the gloomy predestination of calvinism in favor of a life of cheerful activism around 1800 the united states experienced a huge wave of religious revivals called the second great awakening.
without religion revivalists warned the american republic would give way to unbridled appetites and lust while all denominations grew as a result of the second great awakening the evangelical s ects baptists methodists and presbyterians experienced explosive popularity.
in 1780 the nation had only 50 methodist churches by 1860 there were 20 000 far more than any other denomination.
the percentage of americans who joined protestant churches increased sixfold between 1800 and 1860.
the second great awakening involved two different centers of activity.
one developed among the elite new england colleges that were founded as religious centers of learning then spread across western new york into pennsylvania and ohio indiana and illinois.
the other center emerged in the b ackwoods of tennessee and kentucky and spread in every direction across rural america.
both the urban and rural phases of protestant revival a more democratic religion 509 ism shared a simple message salvation is available not just to a select few as the calvinist puritans had claimed but to anyone who repents and embraces christ.
frontier revivals in its frontier phase the second great awakening like the first generated tremendous excitement and emotional excesses.
it gave birth to two religious p henomena the traveling backwoods evangelist and the frontier camp meeting that helped keep the fires of revivalism and spiritual intensity burning.
people in the early nineteenth century found the supernatural inside as well as outside of churches they readily believed in magic dreams visions miraculous healing and speaking in tongues a spontaneous babbling precipitated by the workings of the holy spirit.
evangelists and exhorters spiritual speakers who were not formal ministers with colorful nicknames such as jumpin jesus or crazy dow or mad isaac found ready audiences among lonely frontier folk hungry for spiritual intensity and a sense of community.
mass revivals were family oriented community building events they bridged social economic political and even racial divisions.
women especially flocked to the rural revivals and served as the backbone of religious life on the frontier.
at the end of the eighteenth century ministers visiting the western territories reported that there were few frontier churches and few people attending them.
to remedy the situation traveling evangelists emerged.
the first large camp meeting occurred in august 1801 on a kentucky hillside called cane ridge east of lexington.
a presbyterian minister named james mcgready invited protestants in the region to attend and as many as 20 000 frontier folk came from miles around camping in tents for nine days.
white and black ministers mostly baptists and methodists preached day and night often chanting their sermons in ways that prompted listeners to cry amen hallelujah lord have mercy the frontier revivals generated intense emotions as people experienced on the spot conversions.
one participant at cane ridge observed that some of the people were singing others praying some crying for mercy as news of the cane ridge gathering spread protestant evangelists especially methodists organized similar revivals in other states.
one participant reported that the revivals created such a gust of the power of god that it seemed the very gates of hell would give way not all were swept up in the religious emotionalism.
frances trollope a distinguished english writer who toured the united states in 1827 attended a frontier revival and thought the participants behaved like raving lunatics.
she 510 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 religious revivalism frontier revivals and prayer meetings ignited religious fervor within both ministers and participants.
in this 1830s camp meeting the women are so intensely moved by the sermon that they shed their bonnets and fell to their knees.
fled the roiling scene in panic.
similarly a catholic priest in kentucky scoffed at the absurd mob fanaticism of the camp meetings.
the revivals however were quite popular with many americans.
hell is trembling and satans kingdom falling reported a south carolinian in 1802.
the sacred flame of religious revival is extending far and wide in 1776 about one in six americans belonged to a church by 1850 it was one in three.
when asked to reflect on the social changes that had occurred during his life william grayson a south carolina planter commented that religion had revived.
the churches were filled denominational growth among the established denominations presbyterianism was entrenched among those with s cots irish backgrounds from pennsylvania to georgia.
presbyterians gained further from the plan of union with the congregationalists.
since the presbyterians and the congregationalists agreed on theology they were able to form unified congregations and call recruit a minister from either denomination.
the result through much of the old northwest ohio michigan indiana and illinois a more democratic religion 511 was that new englanders became presbyterians by way of the presbygational churches.
the frontier revivals were dominated by baptist and methodist factions.
there were primitive baptists hardshell baptists freewill baptists and methodists particular baptists and many others.
the baptist theology was grounded in biblical f undamentalism a certainty that every word and story in the bible are divinely inspired and literally true.
unlike the earlier puritans however the baptists believed that everyone could gain salvation by choosing via free will to receive gods grace and by being baptized as adults.
the baptists also stressed the social equality of all before god regardless of wealth status or education.
the methodists who shared with baptists the belief in free will developed the most effective evangelical method the circuit rider a traveling evangelist itinerant on horseback who sought converts in remote frontier settlements.
the itinerant system began with francis asbury a tireless b ritish born revivalist who traveled across fifteen states and preached thousands of sermons.
after asbury peter cartwright emerged as the most successful circuit rider.
cartwright grew up in one of the most violent and lawless regions of frontier kentucky.
his brother was hanged as a murderer and his sister was said to be a prostitute.
cartwright himself had been a hellion until at age fifteen he decided to attend a frontier revival meeting in the midst of a solemn struggle of soul an impression was made in my mind as though a voice said to me thy sins are all forgiven thee divine light flashed all around me unspeakable joy sprung up in my soul.
i rose to my feet opened my eyes and it really seemed as if i was in heaven.
my mother raised the shout my christian friends crowded around me and joined me in praising god and though i have been since then in many instances unfaithful yet i have never for one moment doubted that the lord did then and there forgive my sins and give me religion.
the following year cartwright became a religious exhorter preaching the faith even though he was not yet an ordained minister.
at age eighteen cartwright began roaming across kentucky tennessee ohio and indiana as a methodist circuit rider.
for more than twenty years he preached a sermon a day three hours at a time.
crowds flocked to hear his simple message salvation is free for all to embrace.
at one revival in illinois cartwright who was running for congress as an anti slavery jacksonian democrat asked those who thought they were going 512 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 black methodists holding a prayer meeting 1811 this caricature of an african american methodist meeting in philadelphia shows a preacher in the church doorway while his congregation engages in exuberant prayer.
to heaven to stand.
he then asked those who did not desire to go to hell to do the same.
the only person in the crowd who did not stand for either choice was a tall t hirty seven year old whig attorney named abraham lincoln cartwrights opponent in the election.
may i inquire of you mr lincoln asked cartwright where are you going lincoln replied that he was going to congress soon thereafter he defeated cartwright.
revivalism and african americans the revivals broke down conventional social barriers.
free african americans were especially attracted to the emotional energies of the methodist and baptist churches in part because many white circuit riders were opposed to slavery.
african american richard allen a freed slave in philadelphia said in 1787 that there was no religious sect or denomination that would suit the capacity of the colored people as well as the methodist he decided that the plain and simple gospel suits best for any people for the unlearned can understand it even more important the methodists actively recruited blacks.
they were the first people allen noted that brought glad tidings to the colored people in 1816 allen helped found the african methodist episcopal ame church the first black denomination in america.
a more democratic religion 513 camp meetings and women the energies of the great revival as the second great awakening was called spread through the western states and into m ore settled regions back east.
the fastest growth was along the frontier where camp meetings were an expression of the frontiers democratic spirit.
revivals were typically held in late summer or fall when farmwork eased.
baptist methodist and presbyterian ministers often worked as a team and crowds would frequently number in the thousands.
mass excitement swept up even the most skeptical onlookers and infusions of the spirit sparked strange behavior.
some went into trances others contracted the jerks babbled in unknown tongues or got down on all fours and barked like dogs to tree the devil the camp meetings also offered a social outlet to isolated rural folk especially women for whom the gatherings provided a welcome alternative to the rigors and loneliness of farm life.
evangelical ministers repeatedly applauded the spiritual energies of women and affirmed their right to give public witness to their faith and to play a leading role in efforts at social reform.
at a time when women were banned from preaching jarena lee a free black who lived in the philadelphia area was the first african american woman to become a minister in the african methodist episcopal church ame.
as she wrote if the man may preach because the saviour died for him why not the woman.
seeing as he died for her also lee became a tireless revivalist during the 1830s according to her own records she traveled 2 325 miles and preached 178 sermons the organizational needs of large revivals offered ample opportunities for women.
phoebe worrall palmer for example hosted prayer meetings in her new york city home and eventually traveled across the country as a camp meeting exhorter assuring listeners that they could gain a life without sin.
women like palmer found public roles within evangelical denominations because of their emphasis on individual religious experiences rather than conventional male dominated church structures.
palmer claimed a womans right to preach by citing the biblical emphasis on obeying god rather than man.
it is always right to obey the holy spirits command she stressed and if that is laid upon a woman to preach the gospel then it is right for her to do so it is a duty she cannot neglect without falling into condemnation such opportunities reinforced womens self confidence and their religious enthusiasm often inspired them to pursue social reforms for women including greater educational opportunities and the right to vote.
religion and reform regions roiled by revival fever were compared to forests devastated by fire.
western new york in fact experienced 514 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 such fiery levels of evangelical activity that it was labeled the burned over district.
one reason the area was such a hotbed of evangelical activity was the erie canal which opened in 1825.
both the construction of and traffic on the canal turned many towns into rollicking scenes of lawlessness gambling prostitution public drunkenness and crime.
such widespread sinfulness made the region ripe for revivalism.
charles g finney the most successful evangelist in the b urned ver district was a former attorney turned presbyterian minister named charles o grandison finney.
in the winter of 1830 1831 he theatrically preached with a clear shrill voice pouring out fire for six months in rochester then in a canal boomtown in upstate new york.
in the process he generated some 100 000 conversions became the most celebrated minister in the country and perfected religious revivals as well organized and orchestrated spectacles.
while rural camp meeting revivals attracted farm families and other working class groups finneys audiences in the northeast attracted more prosperous seekers.
the lord finney declared was aiming at the conversion of the highest classes of society in 1836 he built a huge church in new york city to accommodate his rapidly growing congregation.
finney focused on the question that had preoccupied protestantism for centuries what role can the individual play in earning salvation.
finney and other freewill evangelists wanted to democratize the opportunity for salvation by insisting that everyone rich or poor black or white could choose to be saved simply by embracing the promise of jesus and rejecting the lure of sinfulness.
finneys democratic gospel combined embracing faith and doing good works.
for him revivalism led first to personal reform and then to the improvement of society.
by embracing christ a convert could thereafter be free of sin but christians also had an obligation to improve society by perfecting themselves.
the evangelical revivals provided much of the energy behind the sweeping reform impulse that characterized the age of jacksonian democracy.
catharine beecher a leading advocate for evangelical religion and social reform stressed that the success of american democracy depends upon the intellectual and moral character of the mass of people.
if they are intelligent and virtuous democracy is a blessing but if they are ignorant and wicked it is only a curse the mormons the spiritual stirrings of the second great awakening also spawned new religious groups.
the b urned over district in new york gave rise to several religious movements the most important of which was mormonism.
its founder a more democratic religion 515 joseph smith jr was the child of intensely religious vermont farm folk who settled in the village of palmyra in western new york amid the hyperemotional revivalism of the second great awakening.
in 1823 the e ighteen year old smith reported that an angel named moroni appeared by his bedside and announced that god needed smiths help.
moroni had led him to a hillside near his fathers farm where he had unearthed a box containing golden plates on which was etched in an ancient language a lost gospel explaining the history of ancient america.
it described a group of israelites nephites who crossed the atlantic on barges and settled america 2 100 years before columbus.
smith set about laboriously translating the reformed egyptian inscriptions on the plates.
much of the language he transcribed was in fact drawn from the bible.
but that mattered not to his earnest followers.
in 1830 smith convinced a friend to mortgage his farm to pay for the publication of the first 5 000 copies of the 500 page text he called the book of mormon an account written by the hand of mormon upon plates taken from the plates of nephi.
young smith began gathering thousands of converts saints.
eventually convinced that his authority came directly from god he formed what he called the church of jesus christ of latter day saints more popularly known as the mormons.
smith maintained that god angels and people were all members of the same flesh and blood species.
in his s elf appointed role as the mormon prophet smith criticized the sins of the rich preached universal salvation denied that there was a hell urged his followers to practice a strict code of personal morality by avoiding liquor tobacco and caffeine and asserted that the second coming of christ was looming.
he promised followers a nation a new israel a people bound as much by heritage and identity as by belief within a few years smith had gathered thousands of converts most of them poor new england farmers who had migrated to western new york.
years of persecution from the outset the mormon saints upset both their gentile neighbors and the civil authorities.
mormons stood out with their secret rituals their refusal to abide by local laws and conventions and their clannishness.
smith denied the legitimacy of civil governments and the u s constitution.
as a result no community wanted to host him and his peculiar people a term taken from the new testament.
in their search for a refuge from persecution and for the promised land the ever growing contingent of mormons moved from western new york to ohio then to missouri where the governor called for them to be exterminated or driven from the state forced out smith and the mormons moved in 1839 to the half built town of commerce illinois on the mississippi river.
516 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 they renamed the town nauvoo a crude translation of a hebrew word meaning beautiful land.
within five years nauvoo had become the second largest city in the state and joseph smith the prophet became nauvoos religious dictator.
he owned the hotel and general store published the newspaper served as mayor chief justice and commander of the citys 2 000 strong army and was the trustee of the church.
smiths lust for power and for women grew as well.
he began excommunicating dissidents and in 1844 he announced his intention to become president of the united states.
smiths remarkable sexual energy led him to practice plural marriage polygamy he accumulated more than two dozen wives many of them already married to other men and he encouraged other mormon leaders to do the same.
in 1844 a crisis arose when mormon dissenters including smiths first wife emma denounced his polygamy.
the result was not only a split in the church but also an attack on nauvoo by non mormons.
when smith ordered mormons to destroy an opposition newspaper he and his brother hyrum were arrested and charged with treason.
on june 27 1844 a mob stormed the jail and killed the smith brothers.
the new york herald predicted that his death would kill mormonism.
brigham young brigham young young headed the mormons from 1847 to 1877.
in brigham young however the mormons found a new and in many ways better leader.

strong minded intelligent authoritarian and charismatic young was an early convert to mormonism.
smith he remembered took heaven.
and brought it down to earth because nauvoo continued to arouse the suspicions of non mormons young began to look for another home for his flock.
their new destination turned out to be 1 300 miles away near the great salt lake in utah a vast sparsely populated area that was part of mexico.

by the end of 1848 the mormons had developed an efficient irrigation system for their farms and over the next decade they brought about a spectacular greening of the desert.
at first they organized their own state named deseret meaning land of the honeybee and elected young governor.
but their independence was short lived.
in 1848 mexico signed the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo transferring to the united states what is now california nevada utah texas and parts of arizona new mexico colorado and wyoming.
two years later congress incorporated the utah territory into the united states.
nevertheless when young was named the territorial governor the new arrangement gave the mormons virtual independence.

out of its eerily secret beginnings and early struggles mormonism today is the fourth largest religious denomination in the world.
romanticism in america the revival of religious life during the early 1800s was one of many efforts throughout the united states and europe to unleash the stirrings of the spirit.
another great cultural shift was the romantic movement in thought literature and the arts.
the movement began in europe as young people rebelled against the w ell ordered rational world promoted by the enlightenment.
were there not after all more things in the world than reason science and logic could explain spontaneous moods impressions and feelings mysterious unknown and h alf seen things.
in areas in which science could neither prove nor disprove concepts the romantics believed that people were justified in having faith.
they preferred the stirrings of the heart over the calculations of the head nonconformity over traditional behavior and the mystical over the rational.
americans embraced the romantics emphasis on individualism and the virtues of common people.
transcendentalism the most intense american advocates of romantic ideals were the transcendentalists of new england the first group of rebellious intellectuals committed to reshaping the nations cultural life.
the word transcendentalism came from an emphasis on thoughts and behaviors that transcend or rise above the limits of reason and logic.
to transcendentalists the inner life of the spirit took priority over science.
transcendentalism said one of its champions meant an interest in areas a little beyond the scope of reason.
transcendentalism at times seemed irrational rejecting both religious orthodoxy and the corpse cold rationalism of unitarianism.
transcendentalists believed that reality was not simply what you can touch and see it included the innate promptings of the mind and the spiritual world.
above all they believed in self reliance and embraced a pure form of personal spirituality intuitions of the soul uncorrupted by theological dogma.
the miracles described in the bible were much less important to transcendentalists than the evidence of an individuals own intuitive spirituality.
transcendentalists wanted individuals to look within themselves for spiritual insights.
ralph waldo emerson the movements leader stressed that romanticism in america 519 its aim was to purify ones own soul and live with full integrity becoming a model rather than a nagging goad to others transcendentalists also wanted to nurture a romantic spirituality in harmony with nature.
natural beauty they believed had the transcendent power to startle people into self awareness.
as henry david thoreau described his own n ature inspired spirituality i believe in the forest and in the meadow and in the night in which the corn grows all people transcendentalists believed had the capacity for s elf realization enabling them to tap the divine spark present in all of gods creations.
in short transcendentalists wanted everyone to summon the courage to think their own thoughts and develop their own beliefs.
s elf discovery was the essential step in fulfilling potential.
by the 1830s new england transcendentalism had become the most influential force in american culture.
ralph waldo emerson more than anyone else ralph waldo emerson embodied the transcendentalist gospel which rejected conventional religion in favor of individual spiritual growth and self culture to emerson s elf knowledge opened the doors to self improvement and self realization.
the indians vespers 1847 asher b durands painting of a native american saluting the sun captures the romantic ideals of personal spirituality and the uncorrupted natural world that swept america during the early nineteenth century.
520 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 emerson became the most popular speaker in the united states during the 1840s.
we have listened too long to the courtly muses of europe he said.
we will walk on our own feet we will work with our own hands we will speak with our own minds he exhorted the young american republic to shed its cultural inferiority complex and create its own distinctive literature art and thought.
the son of a unitarian preacher emerson graduated from harvard college in 1821 and became a unitarian parson in 1829 but three years later he turned away from all organized religions because they stifled free thinking.
he sought instead to cultivate a ralph waldo emerson emerson a poet personal spirituality in communion and philosopher is most remembered with nature.
for leading the transcendentalist after traveling in europe where he movement.
met englands greatest romantic writers emerson settled in concord massachusetts to take up the life of an essayist poet and lecturer preacher to the world.
he found god in nature and came to believe not in damnation but in human perfectibility.
impossibly optimistic emerson celebrated the virtues of self reliance and the individuals unlimited potential.
in 1836 emerson published the pathbreaking book nature which helped launch the transcendental movement.
in it he stressed that sensitive people could transcend the material world and discover the spirit animating the universe.
individuals in other words could exercise godlike powers.
the spirit of s elf reliant individualism in emersons lectures and writings provided the energetic core of the transcendentalist outlook.
the american scholar a speech he delivered at harvard in 1837 urged young americans to put aside their reverence for european culture and explore the beauties and freedoms of their own world.
emersons essay self reliance 1841 expresses the distinctive transcendentalist outlook whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.
nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.
it is easy in the world to romanticism in america 521 live after the worlds opinion it is easy in solitude to live after our own but the great man is he who in the midst of a crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.
a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.
speak what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict everything you said today.
to be great is to be misunderstood.
emersons belief that every man and woman possessed godlike virtues inspired generations.
he championed a self reliant individualism that reinforced the democratic energies inspiring jacksonian america.
the transcendental club in 1836 an informal discussion group that came to be called the transcendental club began to meet in boston and nearby concord to discuss philosophy literature and religion.
the transcendentalists teasingly called themselves the club of the like minded quipped james freeman clarke a boston preacher and abolitionist because no two of us thought alike except perhaps in their shared rejection of traditional forms of authority.
the diverse club included cultural rebels and social critics all of whom displayed extravagant idealism and moral urgency in striving for uniqueness and originality.
they were liberal clergymen utopian reformers militant abolitionists innovative writers and brilliant women such as elizabeth peabody her sister sophia who married writer nathaniel hawthorne and margaret fuller the author of woman in the nineteenth century 1845.
fluent in six languages the dynamic fuller was one of americas first feminists a brilliant conversationalist who organized a transcendentalist discussion group that met in elizabeth peabodys boston bookstore.
their conversations were designed to embolden the citys brightest women to think and act for themselves.
fuller helped launch and edit the dial 1840 1844 a transcendentalist magazine that introduced american readers to european romanticism.
henry david thoreau emersons young friend and neighbor henry david thoreau practiced the thoughtful s elf reliance and pursuit of perfection that emerson preached.
i like people who can do things emerson said and thoreau fourteen years his junior could do many things carpentry masonry painting surveying sailing gardening.
thoreau displayed a powerful sense of uncompromising integrity and prickly individuality.
if a man does not keep pace with his companions he wrote perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer 522 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 thoreau described himself as a mystic a transcendentalist and a natural philosopher who questioned tradition and challenged authority.
emerson said his younger friend was stubborn and implacable always manly and wise but rarely sweet a neighbor was more blunt.
i love henry said elizabeth hoar but i do not like him born in concord in 1817 thoreau attended harvard where he exhausted the librarys resources.
after a brief stint as a teacher he worked with his father a pencil maker.
like emerson however thoreau viewed the indescribable innocence of nature as a living bible the earth to him was a form of poetry full of hidden meanings henry david thoreau thoreau was and l ife giving energies.
walks in the a social rebel environmentalist and woods inspired him more than attendlifelong abolitionist.
ing church.
christianity he believed was a dying institution.
his priorities were inward.
he once described himself as a realometer working his feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and delusion and appearances.
to a hard bottom thoreau showed little interest in friends or marriage and no interest in wealth which he believed corrupted the pursuit of happiness by making p eople slaves to materialism.
the mass of men he wrote lead lives of quiet desperation because they were preoccupied with making money.
thoreau yearned to experience the extremities of life and not be bound by stuffy tradition unjust laws good behavior or the opinions of his elders.
he committed himself to leading what emerson called a simple life centered on plain living and high thinking he loved to be alone free to think for himself.
thoreau rented a room at the emersons home where he tended the family garden worked as a handyman and took long walks with his host.
i delight much in my young friend emerson wrote who seems to have as free and erect a mind as any i have ever met in 1844 when emerson bought fourteen acres along walden pond thoreau decided to embark upon an unusual experiment in self reliance.
on july 4 1845 at age twenty seven thoreau took to the woods to live in a tiny one room cabin he had built for t wenty eight dollars at walden pond romanticism in america 523 just over a mile outside of concord.
his goal was to demonstrate that nature was sufficient for his needs.
i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately he wrote in walden or life in the woods 1854.
and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived during thoreaus two years at walden pond the united states declared war against mexico largely to acquire texas then part of mexico.
he felt it was an unjust war pushed by southern cotton planters eager to add more slave territory.
his disgust for the war led him to refuse to pay taxes for which he was put in jail for only one night an aunt paid the tax.
this incident inspired thoreau to write his now classic essay civil disobedience 1849 which would influence martin luther king jr in shaping the civil rights movement a hundred years later.
if the law is of such a nature that it requires you to be an agent of injustice to another thoreau wrote then i say break the law until his death in 1862 thoreau attacked slavery and applauded those who worked to undermine it.
the continuing influence of thoreaus creed of taking individual action against injustice shows the impact that a thoughtful person can have on the world.
an american literature thoreau and emerson portrayed the transcendentalist movement as an expression of moral idealism critics dismissed it as outrageous self centeredness.
although the transcendentalists attracted only a small following in their own time they inspired a generation of writers that produced the first great age of american literature.
the half decade of 1850 to 1855 witnessed an outpouring of extraordinary writing in the united states a nation that had long suffered an inferiority complex about the quality of its arts.
those five years saw the writing of representative men by emerson walden or life in the woods by thoreau the scarlet letter and the house of the seven gables by nathaniel hawthorne moby dick by herman melville leaves of grass by walt whitman and hundreds of unpublished poems by emily dickinson.
literary giants national hawthorne nathaniel hawthorne the supreme writer of the new england group never shared the sunny optimism of his neighbors or their perfectionist belief in reform.
a native and longtime inhabitant of salem massachusetts he was haunted by the knowledge of evil bequeathed to him by his puritan forebears one of whom john hathorne had been a judge at the salem witchcraft trials.
after college nathaniel hawthorne worked in obscurity in salem gradually selling a few stories and finally earning a degree of fame with twice told tales 1837.
in these stories as in most of his later 524 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 work his central themes e xamined sin and its consequences pride and selfishness secret guilt and the impossibility of rooting sin out of the human soul.
emily dickinson emily dickinson the most strikingly original of the new england poets never married.
in fact as she wrote she enjoyed the habit of shunning men and women from her birth in 1830 to her death in 1886 she lived with her parents and sister in amherst massachusetts.
there in a spartan corner bedroom on the second floor of the family house the slim r ed haired poet found s elf expression in poetry ever grateful that one is ones self not somebody else emily dickinson dickinson offered the dickinson lived what her niece world of new england literature a fresh called a life of exquisite s elf containfemale voice.
ment she often refused to meet visitors or even leave her room.
fired by the light of insight and the fire of emotion she wrote verse remarkable for its simplicity and brevity.
only a handful of her almost 1 800 poems were published before her death.
as she famously wrote success is counted sweetest by those who neer succeed whether her solitary existence was the result of severe eye trouble aching despair generated by her love for a married minister or fear of her possessive father dickinsons isolation and lifelong religious doubts led her in the solitude of space.
that polar privacy to probe the white heat of her h eartbreak and disappointment in ways unusual for the time.
her often abstract themes were elemental life death fear loneliness nature and above all the withdrawal of god a distant stately lover who no longer could be found.
edgar allan poe edgar allan poe was even more fascinated by the deepening menace of death.
born in boston in 1809 and orphaned as a child he was raised by foster parents the allans who gave him his middle name in richmond virginia.
poe was a misfit who led a stormy life.
although a top student and popular storyteller at the university of virginia he left the romanticism in america 525 school after ten months having racked up excessive gambling debts.
after a two year stint in the army he enrolled at the u s military academy at west point where in 1831 he was expelled for missing classes and disobedience.
after spending time in new york city and then in baltimore poe relocated in 1835 to richmond where he became an assistant editor of the southern literary messenger.
he secretly married virginia clemm his thirteen year old cousin claiming that she was twenty one.
they moved to philadelphia in 1837 where he edited magazines and wrote scathing reviews and terrifying mystery stories.
as the creator of the detective story his influence on literature has been enormous.
in 1844 poe moved to new york city.
the following year he published the raven a poem about a man who once upon a midnight dreary having lost his lover a sainted maiden named lenore responds to a rapping at his door only to find darkness there and nothing more scanning the darkness dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before he confronts a silence punctuated only by his mumbled query lenore the man closes the door only to hear the strange knocking again.
both angered and perplexed he flings open the door and with many a flirt and flutter in flies a raven that grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore the raven utters but one haunting word nevermore the raven was so popular that poe became a household name across america although he received only two dollars for publishing the poem.
in 1847 however tragedy struck when poes young wife died of tuberculosis.
thereafter he was seduced as much by alcohol and drug abuse as by writing.
he died at age forty of mysterious causes.
poe left behind an extraordinary collection of unworldly tales and haunting poems.
he used horror to explore the darkest corners of human psychology and to satisfy his lifelong obsession with death.
to him fear was the most powerful emotion so he focused on making the grotesque and the supernatural seem disturbingly real.
anyone who has read the t ell tale heart or the pit and the pendulum can testify to his success.
herman melville herman melville the author of moby dick was a new yorker who went to sea as a youth.
after eighteen months aboard a whaler he arrived in the marquesas islands in the south seas and jumped ship with a companion.
he spent several weeks with natives in the valley of the typees before signing on with an australian whaler.
he joined a mutiny in tahiti and finally returned home as a seaman aboard a u s navy frigate.
an account of his exotic adventures typee 1846 became an instant success which he repeated in omoo 1847.
526 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 in 1851 the t hirty two year old melville produced moby dick one of the worlds greatest novels.
in the story of captain ahabs obsessive quest for an accursed white whale that had devoured his leg melville explored the darker recesses of the soul.
on one level the book is a ripping good yarn of adventure on the high seas.
on another level however it explores the unfathomable depths and darkness of human complexity as the vengeful ahabs crazed obsession with finding and killing the massive white whale turns the captain into a monster of destruction who sacrifices his ship the pequod and his crew.
walt whitman the most controversial writer during the nineteenth century was walt whitman a new york journalist and poet.
the swaggering whitman was a self promoting robust personality.
after meeting whitman thoreau wrote that he was not only eager to talk about himself but reluctant to have the conversation stray from the subject for long unlike thoreau whitman did not fear the age of steam and wrote excitedly about industrial development urban life working men sailors and simple humanity born in 1819 on a long island farm whitman moved with his family to brooklyn where he worked as a carpenter teacher democratic party activist and editor of the brooklyn eagle.
he frequently took the ferry across the east river to bustling manhattan where he was fascinated by the citys restless energy.
by the time he met ralph waldo emerson whitman had been simmering simmering but emerson brought him to a boil with his emphasis on defying tradition and celebrating the commonplaces of life including sexuality and the body.
all of these themes found their way into whitmans controversial first book of unconvenwalt whitman this engraving of a tional free verse poems leaves of thirty seven year old walt whitman grass 1855.
in its first year it sold appeared in his acclaimed poetry all of ten copies.
one reviewer called collection leaves of grass.
it an intensely vulgar nay absolutely romanticism in america 527 beastly book leaves of grass however became more influential with each passing year.
the brash whitman introduced his book by declaring that i celebrate myself and sing myself he was unapologetically an american one of the roughs.
disorderly fleshy and sensual.
eating drinking and breeding like emerson he was a self proclaimed pioneer on behalf of a new mightier world a varied world a bustling world of labor dignified by common people his poems were remarkable for their energy exuberance and intimacy and were seasoned with frank sexuality and homoerotic overtones.
they expressed the color and texture of american democracy immense in passion pulse and power thoreau for one viewed whitman as a liberating force in american culture and described him as the greatest democrat the world has seen although leaves of grass was banned in boston because of its explicit sexuality emerson found it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that america has yet contributed more conventional literary critics however shuddered at the shocking grossness of whitmans homosexual references manly love the love of comrades for the friend i love lay sleeping by my side.
yet whitman could never be truly honest about such matters for homosexuality was a felony in the nineteenth century.
in the colonial period at least five men had been executed for sodomy and many states retained the death penalty in the nineteenth century as the most severe punishment for crimes against nature thomas jefferson had unsuccessfully urged that castration be substituted as the punishment in virginia.
newspapers the flowering of american literature coincided with a massive expansion in newspaper readership sparked by rapid improvements in printing technology.
the emerging availability of newspapers costing only a penny transformed daily reading into a form of popular entertainment.
the penny dailies explained one editor politics in an oyster house 1848 commissioned by social activist john h b latrobe this painting captures the public debates that were fueled by newspapers and magazines.
528 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 are to be found in every street lane and alley in every hotel tavern countinghouse and shop by 1850 the united states had more newspapers than any nation in the world and they forged a network of communications across the republic.
as readership soared the content of the papers expanded beyond political news and commentary to include society gossip sports and reports of sensational crimes and accidents.
the proliferation of newspapers was largely a northern and western phenomenon as literacy rates in the south lagged behind those of the rest of the country.
the reform impulse in 1842 the united states was awash in reform movements led by dreamers and activists who saw social injustice or immorality and fought to correct it.
lyman beecher a champion of evangelical christian revivalism as well as the father of writer harriet beecher stowe stressed that the second great awakening was not focused simply on promoting individual conversions it was also intended to reform human society while an impulse to perfect people and society helped excite the reform movements social and economic changes invigorated many reformers most of whom were women.
the rise of an urban middle class enabled growing numbers of women to hire cooks and maids thus freeing them to devote more time to societal concerns.
many women used their free time to join churches and charitable organizations most of which were led by men.
both women and men belonging to evangelical societies fanned out across america to organize sunday schools spread the gospel and distribute bibles to the children of the working poor.
other reformers tackled issues such as awful conditions in prisons and workplaces care of the disabled temperance reducing the consumption of alcoholic beverages womens rights and the abolition of slavery.
transcendentalists broadened their initial emphasis on individual perfectionism to include reforms designed to improve the lot of the poor the disenfranchised and the enslaved.
that these earnest social reformers often met resistance persecution violence and even death testified to the sincerity of their convictions and the power of their example.
as ralph waldo emerson said never mind the ridicule never mind the defeat up again old heart for there is victory yet for all justice temperance the temperance crusade was the most widespread of the reform movements in large part because many people argued that most social problems were rooted in alcohol abuse.
william cobbett an english reformer who traveled in the united states noted in 1819 that one could go into hardly the reform impulse 529 any mans house without being asked to drink wine or spirits even in the morning in 1826 a group of ministers in boston organized the american society for the promotion of temperance which sponsored lectures press campaigns and the formation of local and state societies.
a favorite device was to ask each person who took the pledge to put by his or her signature a letter t for total abstinence with that a new word entered the language teetotaler.
in 1833 the society held a national convention in philadelphia where the american temperance union was formed.
like nearly every reform movement of the day temperance had a wing of absolutists.
they would accept no compromise with demon rum and passed a resolution that liquor ought to be prohibited by law.
the temperance union at its spring convention in 1836 called for abstinence from all alcoholic beverages which caused moderates to abstain from the movement.
prisons and asylums the temperance crusade a mid nineteenth century temperance banner depicts a young man being tempted by a woman offering him a glass of wine.
the romantic impulse often included the liberal belief that people are innately good and capable of perfection.
such an optimistic view brought about major changes in the treatment of prisoners the disabled and dependent children.
public institutions often called asylums emerged for the treatment of social ills.
if removed from society the theory went the needy and deviant could be made whole again.
unhappily however the underfunded and understaffed asylums often became breeding grounds for brutality and neglect.
gradually the idea of the penitentiary a place where the guilty paid for their crimes but also underwent rehabilitation developed as a new approach to reforming criminals.
an early model of the system was the auburn penitentiary which opened in new york in 1816.
the prisoners at auburn had separate cells and gathered only for meals and group labor.
discipline was severe.
the men marched in lockstep and were never put f ace to face or allowed to talk.
but they were reasonably secure 530 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 from abuse by their fellow prisoners.
the system its advocates argued had a beneficial effect on the prisoners and saved money since the facilitys workshops supplied prison needs and produced goods for sale at a profit.
by 1840 there were twelve auburn type penitentiaries across the nation.
the romantic reform impulse also found an outlet in the care of the insane.
before 1800 the insane were usually confined at home with hired keepers or in jails or almshouses where homeless debtors were housed.
in the years after 1815 however asylums that separated the disturbed from the criminal began to appear.
the most important figure in boosting awareness of the plight of the mentally ill was dorothea lynde dix.
a pious boston schoolteacher she was asked to instruct a sunday school class at the east cambridge house of correction in 1841.
there she found a roomful of insane people who had been completely neglected.
the scene so disturbed dix that she began a t wo year investigation of jails and almshouses in massachusetts.
in a report to the state legislature in 1843 dix revealed that insane people were confined in cages closets cellars stalls pens.
chained naked beaten with rods and lashed into obedience she won the support of leading reformers and proceeded to carry her campaign on behalf of the miserable the desolate and the outcast throughout the country and abroad.
in the process she helped to transform social attitudes toward mental illness.
womens rights while countless middle class women devoted t hemselves to improving the quality of life in america some argued that women should first focus on enhancing home life.
in 1841 harriet beecher stowes sister catharine beecher a leader in the education movement published a treatise on domestic economy which became the leading handbook promot iddle class ing the cult of domesticity a powerful ideology that called upon m women to accept and celebrate their role as manager of the household and the children separate from the mans sphere of work outside the home.
while beecher upheld high standards in womens education she and many others argued that young women should be trained not for the workplace but in the domestic arts managing a kitchen running a household and nurturing the children.
women explained a philadelphia doctor were crucial to the future of the republic because they instructed their children in the principles of liberty and government the official status of women during the first half of the nineteenth century remained much as it had been in the colonial era.
they were barred from the ministry and most other professions.
higher education was hardly an option.
the reform impulse 531 elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony stanton left in 1856 was a young mother who organized the seneca falls convention while anthony right in 1848 started as an anti slavery and temperance activist in her twenties.
the two would meet in 1851 and form a lifelong partnership in the fight for womens suffrage.
women could not serve on juries nor could they vote.
a wife often had no control over her property or even her children.
she could not make a will sign a contract or bring suit in court without her husbands permission.
her subordinate legal status was similar to that of a minor or a free black.
seneca falls gradually however women began to protest and men began to listen.
the organized movement for womens rights emerged in 1840 when the anti slavery movement split over the question of womens right to participate.
in 1848 two prominent advocates of womens rights lucretia mott a philadelphia quaker abolitionist and elizabeth cady stanton a new york abolitionist called a convention of men and women to gather in stantons hometown of seneca falls new york to discuss the social civil and religious condition and rights of women on july 19 1848 when the seneca falls convention convened revolution was in the air.
in italy germany and other european states militant nationalists including many women rebelled against monarchies and promoted unification.
in france the society for the emancipation for women demanded 532 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 that women receive equal political rights.
in april the french government abolished slavery in its caribbean colonies and in june european feminists called for the complete radical abolition of all the privileges of sex of birth of race of rank and of fortune the activists at seneca falls did not go that far but they did issue a clever paraphrase of the declaration of independence.
the declaration of rights and sentiments proclaimed that all men and women are created equal all laws that placed women in a position inferior to that of men are contrary to the great precept of nature and therefore of no force or authority its most controversial demand was the right to vote.
such ambitious goals and strong language were too radical for most of the 300 delegates and only about a third of them signed the declaration of rights and sentiments.
one newspaper dismissed the convention as the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of womanity the philadelphia public ledger sneeringly asked why women would want to climb down from their domestic pedestal and get involved with the dirty world of politics a woman is nothing.
a wife is everything.
a pretty girl is equal to ten thousand men and a mother is next to god all powerful despite such opposition however the seneca falls gathering represented an important first step in the evolving campaign for womens rights.
from 1850 until the civil war leaders of the womens rights movement held annual conventions delivered lectures and circulated petitions.
the movement struggled in the face of meager funds and widespread a nti feminist sentiment.
a mother and housewife criticized the women reformers for aping mannish manners and wearing absurd and barbarous attire the typical feminist she claimed struts and strides and thinks that she proves herself superior to the rest of her sex the womens movement was eventually successful because of the work of a few undaunted women.
susan b anthony susan b anthony already active in temperance and anti slavery groups joined the crusade in the 1850s.
unlike stanton and mott she was unmarried and therefore able to devote most of her attention to the womens crusade.
as one observer put it stanton forged the thunderbolts and miss anthony hurled them both were young when the movement started and both lived into the twentieth century focusing after the civil war on demands for womens suffrage the right to vote.
women did not gain the vote in the nineteenth century but they did make legal gains.
in 1839 mississippi became the first state to grant married women control over their property by the 1860s eleven more states had done so.
still the only jobs open to educated women in any number were nursing and the reform impulse 533 teaching.
both professions brought relatively lower status and pay than mens work despite the skills training and responsibilities involved.
early public schools early america like most rural societies offered few educational opportunities for the masses.
that changed in the first half of the nineteenth century as reformers lobbied for public schools to serve all children rich or poor.
the working poor wanted free schools to give their children an equal chance to pursue the american dream.
in 1830 the workingmens party of philadelphia called for a system of education that shall embrace equally all the children of the state of every rank and condition education people argued would improve manners while reducing crime and poverty.
aw ell informed well trained citizenry was considered one of the basic premises of a republic.
a vermont newspaper editor stressed that education was the standing army of republics if political power resided with the people as the constitution asserted then the citizenry needed to be well educated.
by 1830 however no state had a public school system.
horace mann of massachusetts a state legislator and attorney led the early drive for statewide tax supported public school systems.
he proposed that these schools be free to all children regardless of class race or ethnicity including immigrant children.
he sponsored the creation of a state board of education and then served as its leader.
universal access to education mann argued was the great equalizer of the conditions of men the b alance wheel of the social machinery mann went on to promote the first state supported normal school for the training of teachers a state association of teachers and a minimum school year of six months.
he saw the public school system as a way not only to ensure that everyone had a basic level of knowledge and skills but also to reinforce values such as hard work and clean living.
if we do not prepare children to become good citizens if we do not enrich their minds with knowledge mann warned then our republic must go down to destruction such a holistic education mann argued would enhance social stability and equal opportunity as well as give women opportunities for rewarding work outside the home as teachers.
mann said they could become mothers away from home for the children they taught.
by the 1840s most states in the north and midwest but not the south had joined the public school movement.
the initial conditions for public education however were seldom ideal.
funds for buildings books and equipment were limited teachers were poorly paid and often poorly prepared.
most students going beyond the elementary grades attended private academies 534 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 often organized by churches.
such schools begun in colonial days multiplied until there were more than 6 000 of them by 1850.
in 1821 the boston english high school opened as the nations first free public secondary school set up mainly for students not going on to college.
by a law of 1827 massachusetts required every town of 500 or more residents to have a high school in towns of 4 000 or more the school had to offer latin greek rhetoric and other college preparatory courses.
public high schools became well established only after the civil war.
in 1860 there were barely 300 in the whole nation.
by 1850 half of the white children between ages five and nineteen were enrolled in schools the highest percentage in the world.
but very few of those students were southerners.
public schools were scarce in the south until after the civil war.
in most states enslaved children were prohibited from learning to read and write or attend school.
a former slave recalled that his owner didnt teach em nuthin but work the south had some 500 000 illiterate whites more than half the total in the country.
in the south north carolina led the way in s tate supported the george barrell emerson school boston ca.
1850 although higher education for women initially met with some resistance in the 1820s and 1830s seminaries like this one were established to teach women mathematics physics and history as well as music art and social graces.
the reform impulse 535 e ducation enrolling more than two thirds of its white school age population by 1860.
but the school year was only four months long because of the rural states need for children to do farmwork.
the prolonged disparities between north and south in the number and quality of educational opportunities help explain the growing economic and cultural differences between the two regions.
then as now undereducated people were more likely to remain economically deprived less healthy and less engaged in political life.
food and sex the widespread reform impulse in the early nineteenth century excited causes and cranks of all sorts including an array of health reformers the most popular of whom was sylvester graham a controversial preacher turned lecturer who blamed most of americans problems on their bad eating and drinking habits.
born in 1794 in west suffield connecticut graham was the youngest of seventeen children.
soon after his minister father died in 1796 his mother broke down under the strain of single parenting and young sylvester was farmed out to be raised by strangers as a young man he worked as a farmhand clerk and teacher before attending amherst college in massachusetts.
he was expelled for his aggressive eccentricities which did not prevent him from becoming a presbyterian minister.
but religion inspired graham less than nutrition did.
he soon gave up preaching the gospel of christ in order to preach the gospel of bran and fiber.
although he had no medical training graham became the nations leading health reformer after a cholera epidemic ravaged the nation in 1832 and led panicked people to embrace his odd explanations for the killer disease.
graham attributed cholera to people eating chicken pot pie and engaging in excessive lewdness thereafter on the lecture circuit in books and in grahams journal of health and longevity graham preached convincingly against the dangers of alcohol and coffee white flour meat gluttony obesity and body odor.
grahams system for a healthier america called for a diet of whole grains fresh fruits and nuts.
the graham diet banned all meats and spices including p epper and salt as well as butter cream and soups.
alcohol and tobacco were also prohibited.
the centerpiece of grahams celebrated vegetarian diet was the graham cracker made of coarsely ground wheat bathed in molasses and baked.
graham stressed that daily meals of his crackers needed to be precisely six hours apart with no snacking in between.
the graham system also prescribed fresh air daily bathing in cold water drinking only when thirsty not with meals and singing and dancing for exercise.
he discouraged excessive sexual activity meaning more than once a week for married couples because it would cause indigestion headache feebleness of circulation pulmonary 536 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 c onsumption spinal diseases epilepsy and insanity.
like a cult leader graham urged his followers to avoid medicine and p hysicians if you value your life the vain and egotistical graham most of his siblings disowned him became one of the most famed and hated of the professional reformers.
butchers and bakers threatened to kill him and many people laughed at his ideas.
yet others called grahamites passionately embraced his health system.
there were grahamite hotels in new york city boston and philadelphia as well as stores boarding houses college dining halls and a newspaper promoting his diet and ideas.
one of grahams followers called him an eccentric and wayward genius utopian communities amid the pervasive climate of reform the quest for u topia communities with innovative social and economic relationships flourished.
plans for ideal communities had long been an american passion and more than 100 utopian communities sprang up between 1800 and 1900.
many of them were communitarian experiments that emphasized the welfare of the entire community rather than individual freedom.
some experimented with free love socialism and special diets.
the shakers communities founded by the shakers officially the united society of believers in christs second appearing proved to be long lasting.
ann lee known as mother ann lee arrived in new york from england with eight followers in 1774.
believing religious fervor to be a sign of inspiration from the holy ghost mother ann and her followers had strange fits in which they saw visions and issued prophecies predictions about the future.
these manifestations later evolved into a ritual d ance hence the name shakers shaker doctrine held god to be a dual personality.
in christ the masculine side was revealed in mother ann the feminine element.
that mother ann preached celibacy to prepare shakers for the perfection that was promised them in heaven helps explain why their membership declined over time.
mother ann died in 1784 but the group found new leaders and the movement spread from new york into new england ohio and kentucky.
by 1830 about twenty groups were flourishing.
in these shaker communities all property was held in common.
shaker farms were among the nations leading sources of garden seed and medicinal herbs and many of their products especially furniture were prized for their simple beauty.
the reform impulse 537 oneida john humphrey noyes founder of the oneida community had a very different vision of the ideal community.
the son of a vermont congressman noyes attended dartmouth college and yale divinity school.
but in 1834 he was expelled from yale and his license to preach was revoked after he announced that he was perfect and free of all sin.
in 1836 noyes gathered a group of perfectionists around his home in putney vermont.
ten years later noyes announced a new doctrine complex marriage which meant that every man in the community was married to every woman and vice versa.
in a holy community he claimed there is no more reason why sexual intercourse should be restrained by law than why eating and drinking should be authorities thought otherwise and noyes was charged with adultery for practicing his theology of free love he coined the term.
he fled to new york and in 1848 established the oneida community which had more than 200 members by 1851 and became famous for its production of fine silverware.
brook farm brook farm in massachusetts was the most celebrated utopian community because it grew out of the transcendental movement.
george ripley a unitarian minister and transcendentalist conceived of brook farm as a kind of e arly day think tank combining high philosophy and plain living and manual labor.
in 1841 he and several dozen l ike minded utopians moved to the 175 acre farm eight miles southwest of boston.
brook farm became americas first secular utopian community.
one of its members novelist nathaniel hawthorne called it our beautiful scheme of a noble and unselfish life he later would satirize the community in his novel the blithedale romance.
its residents shared the tasks of maintaining the buildings tending the fields and preparing the meals.
they also organized picnics dances lectures and discussions.
emerson thoreau and margaret fuller were among the visiting lecturers.
in 1846 however brook farms main building burned down and the community spirit died in the ashes.
in the end utopian communities had little impact on the outside world where reformers wrestled with the sins of the multitudes.
among all the targets of the reformers zeal one great evil would take precedence over the others human bondage.
transcendentalist reformer theodore parker declared that slavery was the blight of this nation the curse of the north and the curse of the south the paradox of american freedom being coupled with american slavery what novelist herman melville called the worlds fairest hope linked with mans foulest crime would inspire the climactic crusade of the age abolitionism which would ultimately sweep the nation into an epic civil war.
538 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 the a nti s lavery movement the men who drafted the u s constitution in 1787 hoped to keep the new nation from splitting apart over the question of slavery.
to that end they negotiated compromises that avoided dealing with the issue.
but most of the founders knew that there eventually would be a day of reckoning.
that day approached as the nineteenth century unfolded and growing numbers of americans decided that the daily horrors of slavery must come to an end.
early opposition to slavery the first organized emancipation movement appeared in 1816 with the formation of the american colonization society acs in washington d c whose mission was to raise funds to repatriate free blacks back to africa.
its supporters included james madison james monroe andrew jackson henry clay john marshall and daniel webster.
some supported the colonization movement because they opposed slavery others saw it as a way to get rid of free blacks.
we must save the negro as one missionary explained or the negro will ruin us white supremacy remained a powerful assumption even among many anti slavery reformers.
leaders of the free black community denounced the colonization idea from the start.
the united states they stressed was their native land and they had as valid a claim on u s citizenship as anyone else.
nevertheless the acs acquired land on the ivory coast of west africa and on february 6 1820 the elizabeth sailed from new york with the first eighty eight emigrants who formed the nucleus of a new nation the republic of liberia.
thereafter however the african colonization movement waned.
during the 1830s only 2 638 african americans migrated to liberia.
in all only about 15 000 resettled in africa.
from gradualism to abolitionism the fight against slavery started in great britain in the late eighteenth century and the movements success in ending british involvement in the african slave trade helped spur the anti slavery cause in america.
british abolitionists lectured across the northern united states and often bought freedom for runaway slaves.
at the same time most of the leading american abolitionists visited great britain and came away inspired by the breadth and depth of anti slavery organizations there.
the british example helped convince black and white leaders of the cause in america to adopt an aggressive new strategy in the early 1830s.
equally important was the realization that slavery in the cotton states of the south was not dying out it was rapidly growing.
this hard reality led to a change the a nti slavery movement 539 in tactics among a nti slavery organizations many of which were energized by evangelical religions and the emerging social activism of transcendentalism.
their initial efforts to promote a gradual end to slavery by prohibiting it in the western territories and using moral persuasion to convince owners to free their slaves gradually gave way to demands for immediate abolition everywhere.
william lloyd garrison a white massachusetts activist named william lloyd garrison drove the william lloyd garrison a militant movement.
in 1831 free blacks helped abolitionist and a committed pacifist.
convince garrison to launch an a nti slavery newspaper the liberator which became the voice of the nations first civil rights movement.
in the boston based newspapers first issue garrison condemned the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual emancipation he dreamed of true equality in all spheres of american life including the status of women.
in pursuing that dream he vowed to be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.
i am in e arnest i will not e quivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard garrisons courage in denouncing slavery forced the issue onto the national agenda and outraged slaveholders in the south as well as some whites in the north.
in 1835 a mob of angry whites dragged him through the streets of boston.
the south carolina and georgia legislatures promised a reward to anyone who kidnapped garrison and brought him south for trial.
a southern slaveholder warned him to desist your infamous endeavors to instill into the minds of the negroes the idea that men must be free the violence of the southern reaction wrecked the assumption of garrisonians that moral righteousness would trump evil and that their fellow americans would listen to reason.
the pacifist garrison remained opposed to the use of force.
we do not preach rebellion he stressed.
the prospect of a bloody insurrection in the south fills us with dismay but if any people were ever justified in throwing off the yoke of their tyrants the slaves are the people during the 1830s garrison became the nations most unyielding foe of slavery.
through his unflagging efforts he helped make the impossible abolition seem possible to more and more people.
two wealthy new york 540 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 city evangelical silk merchants arthur and lewis tappan provided financial support for garrison and the liberator.
in 1833 they joined with garrison and a group of quaker reformers free blacks and evangelicals to organize the american anti slavery society aass.
that same year parliament freed some 800 000 enslaved colonial p eoples throughout the british empire by passing the emancipation act whereby slaveholders were paid to give up their human property in 1835 the tappans hired revivalist charles g finney to head the a nti slavery faculty at oberlin a new college in northern ohio that would be the first to admit black students.
the american anti slavery society financed by the tappans created a national network of newspapers offices and 300 chapters almost all of which were affiliated with a local christian church.
by 1840 some 160 000 people belonged to aass which stressed that slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of god and that the duty safety and best interests of all concerned require its immediate abandonment the aass even argued that blacks should have full social and civil rights.
in 1835 the group began flooding the south with a nti slavery pamphlets and newspapers.
the anti slavery materials so enraged southern slaveholders that a louisiana community offered a 50 000 reward for the capture of the notorious abolitionist arthur tappan of new york post offices throughout the south began destroying what was called anti slavery propaganda david walker the most radical figure among the largely white garrisonians was david walker a free black man who owned a used clothing store in boston.
in 1829 he published his appeal to the colored citizens of the world a pamphlet that denounced the hypocrisy of christians in the south for defending slavery and urged slaves to follow the example of the haitian rebels and revolt against the planters.
the whites want slaves and want us for their slaves walker warned but some of them will curse the day they ever saw us walker challenged african americans slave and free to act like men and use the crushing arm of power to gain their freedom.
woe woe will be to you he threatened whites if we have to obtain our freedom by fighting copies of walkers appeal were secretly carried to the south by black sailors but whites in major cities seized the vile pamphlet.
in 1830 the state of mississippi outlawed efforts to print write circulate or put forth.
any book paper magazine pamphlet handbill or circular intended to arouse the colored population by exciting riots and rebellion a split in the movement as the abolitionist movement spread debates over tactics intensified.
the garrisonians for example felt that slavery had corrupted virtually every aspect of american life.
they therefore the a nti slavery movement 541 embraced every important reform movement of the day abolition temperance pacifism and womens rights.
garrisons unconventional religious ideas and social ideals led him to break with the established protestant churches which to his mind were in league with slavery the federal government all the more so.
the u s constitution he charged was a covenant with death and an agreement with hell garrison was such a moral purist that he even refused to vote and encouraged others to do the same arguing that the american republic could not continue to proclaim the ideal of liberty while tolerating the reality of slavery.
he fiercely believed that the south could be shamed into ending slavery.
other reformers were more practical and single minded.
they saw american society as fundamentally sound and concentrated on purging it of slavery.
garrison struck them as an unrealistic fanatic whose radicalism hurt the cause.
even harriet beecher stowe who would write uncle toms cabin 1852 called garrisonians most of whom were unitarians quakers or transcendentalists moral mono maniacs the powerful tappan brothers broke with garrison over religion.
they argued that the anti slavery movement should be led only by men of evangelical piety and they declared that the unitarians and universalists in new england failed to meet that standard.
the grimk sisters a showdown between the rival anti slavery camps erupted in 1840 over the issue of womens rights.
women had joined the abolition movement from the start but largely in groups without men.
during the early nineteenth century women were rarely allowed to speak to organizations that included men.
then the activities of the grimk sisters brought womens rights to center stage.
sarah and angelina grimk daughters of a wealthy south carolina family grew up being served by slaves.
in 1821 soon after her fathers death sarah moved from charleston to philadelphia joined the society of friends quakers and renounced slavery.
angelina soon joined her.
in 1835 the sisters joined the abolitionist movement speaking to northern womens groups in what were called parlor meetings after they appealed to southern christian women to end slavery the mayor of charleston told their mother that they would be jailed if they ever returned home.
the grimk sisters traveled widely speaking first to audiences of women and eventually to groups of both sexes.
their unconventional promiscuous behavior in speaking to m ixed gender audiences prompted sharp criticism from ministers in the a nti slavery movement.
the chairman of the connecticut anti slavery society declared that no woman shall speak or vote.
it is enough for women to rule at home catharine beecher reminded the grimk sisters that women occupied a subordinate relation in society to the other sex 542 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 sarah left and angelina right grimk after moving away from their south carolina slaveholding family the grimk sisters devoted themselves to abolitionism and feminism.
and that they should limit their activities to the domestic and social circle rather than public organizations.
angelina grimk firmly rejected such arguments.
for centuries she noted women had been raised to view themselves as inferior creatures now she insisted it is a womans right to have a voice in all laws and regulations by which she is to be governed whether in church or in state soon she and her sister began linking their efforts to free the slaves with their desire to free women from centuries of male domination.
men and women are created equal sarah grimk said.
whatever is right for man to do is right for woman the role of women the debate over the role of women in the anti slavery movement finally exploded at the american a nti slavery societys meeting in 1840 where the garrisonians convinced a majority of delegates that women should participate equally in the organization.
the tappans and their supporters walked out and formed the american and foreign a nti s lavery society.
a third faction of the american anti slavery society had grown skeptical that the nonviolent moral suasion promoted by garrison would ever lead the a nti slavery movement 543 to abolition.
they decided that political action was the most effective way to pursue their goal.
in 1840 activists formed the liberty party in an effort to elect an american president who would abolish slavery.
their nominee james gillespie birney executive secretary of the american a nti slavery society was a former alabama slaveholder turned abolitionist.
his slogan was vote as you pray and pray as you vote the platform called for an end to slavery in the western territories and the district of columbia and a ban on intrastate slave trading.
yet the liberty party found few supporters.
in the 1840 election birney polled only 7 000 votes.
in 1844 however he would win 60 000.
from that time forward an anti slavery party contested every national election until the thirteenth amendment officially ended slavery in 1865.
black a nti s lavery activity although many whites worked courageously to end slavery most of them unlike garrison still insisted that blacks were socially inferior to whites.
freedom for slaves in other words did not mean social equality and many white abolitionists expected free blacks to take a backseat in the movement.
william wells brown yet free african americans were active in white anti slavery societies.
former slaves such as henry bibb and william wells brown both runaways from kentucky and frederick douglass who had escaped from maryland became the most effective critics of the souths peculiar institution much of the energy and appeal of the abolitionist movement derived from the compelling testimonies provided by former slaves.
brown was just twenty years old when he escaped from his owner a steamboat pilot on the ohio river.
an ohio quaker named wells brown provided shelter to the runaway and brown adopted the mans name in the process of forging a new identity as a free man.
he settled in cleveland ohio where he was a dockworker.
he married had three children and helped runaway slaves cross the border into canada.
by 1842 he had learned to read and write begun to publish columns in abolitionist newspapers and was in great demand as a speaker at a nti slavery meetings.
in 1847 brown moved to boston where the massachusetts a nti slavery society hired him as a traveling lecturer.
that same year the organization published browns autobiography narrative of william w brown a former slave written by himself which became a best seller.
brown gave thousands of speeches in america and europe calling for an end to slavery and equality for both blacks and women.
he repeatedly 544 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 stressed that african americans were endowed with those intellectual and amiable qualities which adorn and dignify human nature frederick douglass frederick douglass was an even more effective spokesman for abolitionism.
having escaped from slavery in baltimore maryland douglass made his way to massachusetts where he began speaking at anti slavery meetings in black churches.
through his writings and dazzling presentations he became the best known black man in america.
i appear before the immense assembly this evening as a thief and a robber he told a massachusetts group in 1842.
i stole this head these limbs this body from my master and ran off with them fearful of capture after publishing his narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave written by himself 1845 he left for an extended lecture tour of the british isles returning two years later with enough money to purchase his official freedom.
he then started an abolitionist newspaper for blacks the north star in rochester new york.
he named the newspaper after the star that runaway slaves used to guide them at night toward freedom.
sojourner truth the female counterpart to frederick douglass was sojourner truth.
born to enslaved parents in upstate new york in 1797 she was given the name isabella bell hardenbergh but renamed herself in frederick douglass left and sojourner truth right both former slaves douglass and truth were leading african american abolitionists and captivating orators.
the a nti slavery movement 545 1843 after experiencing a conversation with god who told her to travel up and down the land preaching against slavery.
having been a slave until she was freed in 1827 sojourner truth was able to speak with conviction and knowledge about the evils of the peculiar institution as well as the inequality of women.
truth traveled and spoke throughout the north during the 1840s and 1850s.
as she told the ohio womens rights convention in 1851 i have plowed and planted and gathered into barns and no man could head m e and arnt i a woman.
i have borne thirteen children and seen em mos all sold off into slavery and when i cried out with a mothers grief none but jesus heard and arnt i a woman through such compelling testimony sojourner truth demonstrated the powerful intersection of abolitionism and feminism.
in the process she tapped the distinctive energies that women brought to reformist causes.
if the first woman god ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone she concluded in her address to the ohio gathering these women together ought to be able to turn it back and get it right side up again the underground railroad between 1810 and 1850 tens of thousands of southern slaves fled north.
runaway slaves would make their way usually at night from one station or safe house to the next.
the organizations and the systems of safe houses and shelters along the routes to freedom were referred to as the underground railroad.
the conductors helping the runaways included freeborn blacks white abolitionists former slaves and native americans.
many were motivated by religious concerns.
quakers presbyterians methodists and baptists participated.
in many northern cities blacks and whites organized vigilance committees to thwart the slave catchers.
in february 1851 shadrach minkins a stout c opper colored man who worked as a waiter at a boston coffee house was seized by u s marshals who claimed that he was a runaway slave from virginia.
during a court hearing black and white members of the anti slavery boston vigilance and safety committee active in the underground railroad rushed in overcame armed guards and snatched the trembling prey of the slave hunters an outraged president millard fillmore issued a proclamation demanding that citizens obey the law and that those responsible for kidnapping minkins be prosecuted.
none of the bostonians charged in the case were convicted.
a few courageous runaway slaves returned to the south to organize more escapes.
harriet tubman the most celebrated member of the underground railroad was born a slave in maryland in 1820 but escaped to philadelphia in 1849.
she would return to the south nineteen times to help some 300 fugitive 546 chapter 12 religion romanticism and reform 1800 1860 slaves including her parents.
she never lost a passenger during her legendary acts of bravery.
elijah p lovejoy despite the growing efforts of a nti slavery organizations racism remained widespread in the north especially among the working poor.
abolitionist speakers confronted hostile white crowds who disliked blacks or found a nti slavery agitation bad for business.
in 1837 a mob in illinois killed elijah p lovejoy editor of an a nti slavery newspaper giving the movement a martyr to the causes of both abolition and freedom of the press.
lovejoy had begun his career as a presbyterian minister in new england.
after receiving a sign by god to focus his life on the destruction of slavery he moved to st louis in slaveholding missouri where his newspaper denounced alcohol catholicism and slavery.
when a pro slavery mob destroyed his printing office he moved across the mississippi river to a warehouse in alton illinois where he tried to start an anti slavery society.
there mobs twice more destroyed his printing press.
when a new press arrived lovejoy and several supporters armed themselves and took up defensive positions.
on november 7 1837 thugs began hurling stones and firing shots into the building.
one of lovejoys allies fired back killing a rioter.
the mob then set fire to the warehouse shouting kill every damned abolitionist as he leaves a shotgun blast killed lovejoy and his murder aroused a frenzy of indignation.
at one of the hundreds of memorial services across the north a grizzled john brown rose raised his right hand and declared here before god in the presence of these witnesses from this time i consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery brown and other militants decided that only violence would dislodge the sin of slavery.
abigail kelley the powerful appeal of abolitionism and the broader reform impulse is illustrated in the colorful life of abigail abbie kelley.
a teacher born in pelham massachusetts in 1811 she initially became a grahamite giving up coffee alcohol meat and tea in favor of vegetables and graham crackers.
soon thereafter she attended a lecture by william lloyd garrison and embraced abolitionism joining the female anti slavery society.
in 1837 she wrote her sister that she was supporting a variety of moral e nterprises grahamism abolition and peace kelley was a compelling speaker.
in 1840 she was the first woman to be elected an officer in the american anti slavery society.
many male abolitionists were furious.
one of them described kelley as being one of those women of masculine minds and aggressive tendencies.
who cannot be satisfied in domestic life the prejudice she experienced among male officers revealed to her that she and other women were manacled chained ourselves the a nti slavery movement 547 during the 1850s kelley while still a passionate abolitionist began to champion womens rights and temperance.
she spoke at the fourth national womans rights convention in cleveland.
lucy stone one of the womens rights leaders called kelley a heroine who stood in the thick of the fight for the slaves and at the same time she hewed out that path over which women are now walking toward their equal political rights the defense of slavery the growing strength and visibility of the abolitionist movement coupled with the profitability of cotton growing prompted southerners to launch an aggressive defense of slavery.
some of them even called for the reopening of the african slave trade.
during the 1830s and after pro slavery leaders worked out an elaborate rationale for what they considered the benefits of slavery.
the bible was frequently cited in support of slavery had not the patriarchs of the hebrew bible held people in bondage.
had not saint paul advised servants to obey their masters and told a runaway servant to return to his master.
and had not jesus remained silent on the subject.
soon even bolder arguments emerged.
in february 1837 south carolinas john c calhoun the most prominent southern political leader told the senate that slavery was good a great good rooted in the bible.
he asserted that the savage africans brought to america had never existed in so comfortable so respectable or so civilized a condition as that which is now enjoyed in the southern states if slavery were abolished calhoun warned the principle of white racial supremacy would be compromised.
calhoun and other defenders of slavery also claimed that blacks could not be expected to work under conditions of freedom.
they were too shiftless the argument went and if freed they would be a danger to themselves and to others.
white workers on the other hand feared the competition for jobs if slaves were freed.
calhouns strident defense of slavery led henry clay of kentucky himself a slaveholder to describe calhoun as a rigid fanatic ambitious selfishly partisan and sectional turncoat with too much genius and too little common sense who will either die a traitor or a madman the increasingly heated debate over slavery drove a deep wedge between north and south.
in 1831 william lloyd garrison predicted that an eventual separation between the free and slave states was unavoidable by midcentury a large number of americans had decided that southern slavery was an abomination that should not be allowed to expand into the western territories.
the militant reformers who were determined to prevent slavery from expanding outside the south came to be called free soilers their crusade would reach a fiery climax in the civil war.
chapter review summary religious developments starting in the late eighteenth century unitarians and universalists in new england challenged the christian notion of predestination and advocated that all humans not just the select few were capable of good deeds and could receive salvation.
echoing these ideas with their conception of salvation by free will the preachers of the second great awakening generated widespread interest among protestants in frontier revivals.
the more democratic sects such as baptists and methodists gained huge numbers of converts.
religion went hand in hand with reform in the burned over district in western new york which was also the birthplace of several religious movements including the church of jesus christ of l atter day saints the mormons.
transcendentalists a group of new england writers ministers and reformers who embraced a moral and spiritual idealism romanticism in reaction to scientific rationalism and christian orthodoxy.
in their writings they sought to transcend reason and the material world and encourage more independent thought and reflection.
at the same time transcendentalism influenced the works of novelists essayists and poets who created a uniquely american literature.
social reform movements the cult of domesticity celebrated a womans sphere in the home and argued that young women should be trained not for the workplace but in the domestic arts managing a kitchen running a household and nurturing the children.
however the rise of an urban middle class offered growing numbers of women more time to devote to societal concerns.
social r eformers many of them women sought to improve society and eradicate social evils.
the most widespread movement was for temperance the elimination of excessive drinking.
many activists focused on reforming prisons and asylums.
with the seneca falls convention of 1848 social reformers launched the womens rights movement with the declaration of rights and sentiments.
in many parts of the country reformers called for greater access to education through public schools.
amid the pervasive climate of reform more than 100 utopian communities were established including the shakers brook farm and the oneida community.
a nti slavery movement northern opponents of slavery promoted several solutions including the american colonization societys call for gradual emancipation and the deportation of african americans to colonies in africa.
abolitionism emerged in the 1830s demanding an immediate end of slavery.
some abolitionists went even further calling for full social and political equality among the races although they disagreed over tactics.
abolitionist efforts in the north provoked fear and resentment among southern whites.
yet many northerners shared the belief in the racial inferiority of africans and were hostile to the tactics and essage of the abolitionists.
african americans in the north joined with abolim tionists to create an underground railroad a network of safe havens to help slaves escape bondage in the south.

a house divided and rebuilt pa r t four during the first half of the nineteenth century americans restless and energetic were optimistic about the future.
the united states was the worlds largest republic.
its population continued to grow rapidly economic conditions were improving and tensions with great britain had eased.
above all americans continued to move westward where vast expanses of cheap land lured farmers ranchers miners and missionaries.
by the end of the 1840s the united states had again dramatically expanded its territory from texas west to california and the pacific northwest.
america had become a transcontinental nation from the atlantic to the pacific.
this extraordinary surge of territorial expansion was a mixed blessing however.
how to deal with slavery in the new western territories emerged as the nations flashpoint issue as differences grew among americas three distinctive regions north south and west.
a series of political compromises had glossed over the fundamental issue of slavery but anti slavery activists opposed efforts to extend slavery into the west and an emerging generation of politicians proved less willing to compromise.
the continuing debate over allowing slavery into new territories eventually led many americans to decide with abraham lincoln that the nation could not survive h alf slave and half free.
something had to give.
in a last ditch effort to preserve the institution of slavery eleven southern states seceded from the union and created a separate confederate nation prompting northerners such as abraham lincoln to risk a civil war to restore the union.
no one realized in 1861 how costly the war would be more than 700 000 soldiers and sailors would die in the struggle.
nor did a nyone envision how sweeping the wars effects would be upon the nations future.
the northern victory in 1865 restored the union and helped accelerate americas transformation into a modern nation state.
a national consciousness began to replace the sectional divisions of the prewar era and a republican led congress passed legislation to promote industrial and commercial development and western expansion.
although the civil war ended slavery the status of the freed african americans remained precarious.
former slaves found themselves legally free but few had property homes education or training.
although the fourteenth amendment 1868 guaranteed the civil rights of african americans and the 553 fifteenth amendment 1870 declared that black men could vote southern officials often ignored the new laws as did some in northern states as well.
the restoration of the former confederate states to the union did not come easily.
bitterness and resistance grew among the defeated southerners.
although confederate leaders were stripped of voting rights they continued to exercise considerable authority.
in 1877 when the last federal troops were removed from the occupied south former confederates declared themselves redeemed from the stain of northern military occupation.
by the end of the nineteenth century most states of the former confederacy had developed a system of legal discrimination against blacks that r e created many aspects of slavery.
western expansion 1830 1848 emigrants crossing the plains or the oregon trail 1869 german american painter albert bierstadt captures the majestic sights of the frontier though the transcontinental trek was also often grueling and bleak.
i n the american experience the westward march of settlement was always a source of energy hope and yearning.
henry david thoreau exclaimed that americans go westward as into the future with a spirit of enterprise and adventure and the hope of freedom.
the west whether imagined as the enticing lands over the allegheny mountains that became ohio and kentucky or later the black belt farmlands of the old southwest the fertile prairies watered by the mississippi river or the spectacular area along the pacific coast that became the states of california oregon and washington served as a powerful magnet for adventurous people dreaming of freedom self fulfillment and economic gain.
the pacific northwest teemed with fish forests and f ur bearing animals.
acquiring the ports along the pacific coast would also allow the united states to expand its trade with asia.
during the 1840s and after waves of people moved westward seeking a better chance and more space in the west.
if hell lay to the west one pioneer declared americans would cross heaven to get there millions of people endured unrelenting hardships to fulfill their providential destiny to subdue the entire continent even if it meant displacing the indians in the process.
by 1860 some 4 3 million people had settled in the trans mississippi west.
emigrants moved west largely for economic reasons.
to make money was their chief object said a pioneer woman in texas all things else were subsidiary to it waves of enterprising trappers and farmers miners merchants and clerks hunters ranchers teachers household servants and prostitutes among others headed west to seek their fortunes.
others sought religious freedom or new converts to christianity.
whatever the reason the pioneers formed an unceasing migratory stream flowing across the great plains and the rocky mountains.

304 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 at the end of the revolutionary war george washington predicted that americans would move westward across the mountains into the ohio valley faster than any other ever did or any one would imagine by 1840 more than 40 percent of the population lived west of the appalachian mountains in eight new states.
the woods are full of new settlers marveled a traveler in upstate new york in 1805.
thomas jefferson described the united states in the early nineteenth century as an empire of liberty spreading westward.
in 1800 people eager to own their own farms bought 67 000 acres of government owned land the next year they bought 498 000 acres.
native americans fiercely resisted the invasion of their ancestral lands but ultimately succumbed to a federal government and army determined to relocate them.
most whites however were less concerned about taking land owned by indians and hispanics than they were about seizing their own economic opportunities.
isaac weld a british visitor remarked that the americans at the beginning of the nineteenth century were a restless people always on the lookout for something better or more profitable restless mobility and impatient striving soon came to define the american way of life.
jeffersonian republicanism on march 4 1801 the fifty seven year old thomas jefferson was inaugurated without incident leading some people to call his fiercely contested election the peaceful revolution it was the first democratic election in modern history that saw the orderly transfer of power from one political party to another.
jeffersons installation marked the start of a long period of supremacy of the nations political life by republicans and virginians.
virginia literally dominates the government one federalist claimed.
the nations most populous state virginia supplied a quarter of the republican congressmen in the house of representatives that convened in early 1801.
politics in the young republic was becoming increasingly sectional.
another federalist former secretary of state timothy pickering of massachusetts acknowledged that the northeastern states where federalism was centered could no longer reconcile their habits views and interests with those of the south and west two f ast growing regions that were beginning to rule the nation with a rod of iron jefferson was the first president inaugurated in the new national capital of washington district of columbia.
the unfinished city of barely 3 000 people was crisscrossed with muddy avenues connecting a few buildings clustered around two centers capitol hill and the presidents palace jeffersonian republicanism 305 the new federal city plan of washington d c from 1792 the peoples president during his inauguration jefferson emphasized his connection to the plain and simple ways of the common people.
instead of wearing a ceremonial sword and riding in an elegant h orse drawn carriage as george washington and john adams had done at their inaugurations jefferson a widower left his boardinghouse on new jersey avenue and walked to the capitol building escorted by members of congress and virginia militiamen.
he read his inaugural address in a femininely soft high pitched voice then took the presidential oath administered by chief justice john marshall his virginia cousin with whom he shared a cordial hatred.
jeffersons deliberate display of republican simplicity set the tone for his administration.
he wanted americans to notice the difference between the monarchical style of the federalists and the down to earth simplicity and frugality of the republicans.
as president he did not wear fancy clothes or host elegant parties.
jefferson often answered the door of the presidents house himself wearing a robe and slippers.
a french official reported that the president greets guests in slovenly clothes and without the least formality charming and brilliant jefferson was trained as an attorney read greek and latin and was head of the american philosophical society.
he was also an 306 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 inventive genius of wide learning and many s elf taught abilities including my delight architecture.
jefferson helped design the state capitol in richmond virginia the new university of virginia and his t hirty three room mountaintop mansion called monticello little mountain near charlottesville.
in his eloquent inaugural address the tall thin jefferson his red hair now streaked with grey imagined america as a rising nation spread over a wide and fruitful land traversing all the seas with the productions of their industry engaged in commerce with nations across the globe.
although determined to overturn many federalist policies and programs he urged americans to work together.
we are all r epublicans we are all federalists jefferson stressed noting that every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle it was a splendid message but jeffersons appeal for a united nation proved illusory in part because he retained his own fierce partisanship and bitter a nti federalist prejudices.
in a letter to a british friend jefferson described the federalists as insane men their leaders are a hospital of incurables he still feared that federalists were determined to destroy the liberties of the people and convert the republic into a monarchy he called them monocrats.
a more democratic america the inauguration of thomas jefferson ushered in a more democratic political culture in which common people played a much larger role.
during and after the revolutionary war an increasing proportion of white males especially small farmers and wage laborers artisans mechanics and apprentices gained the right to vote or hold office as states reduced or eliminated requirements that voters and candidates own a specified amount of property.
an enlarged and more engaged citizenry of white male voters many of them landless and illiterate was not universally welcomed however.
since the war a massachusetts federalist complained blustering ignorant men.
have been attempting to push themselves into office a virginian was greatly worried by the rising evidence of the turbulence and follies of democracy of all the states south carolina steadfastly resisted efforts to shift political power away from the slaveholding planter elite to the working poor.
many among the founding generation of political leaders especially federalists but some republicans as well became openly anti democratic worried that men of humble origins some of whom were uneducated and illiterate were replacing the social and political elite natural aristocracy in the state legislatures.
as the nineteenth century unfolded voters were not content to be governed solely by their betters they wanted to do the governing themselves.
george cabot a boston federalist called unchecked democracy the govern jeffersonian republicanism 307 ment of the worst he was convinced that jefferson was going to unleash the terrible evils of democracy when the pot boils another federalist noted the scum will rise over half of the members of the republican controlled congress elected in 1800 were first time legislators little known outside their districts.

thy contempt of wisdom and virtue and overweening admiration of fools and knaves.
the never failing effects of democracy a contradictory genius thomas jefferson who owned hundreds of slaves was a bundle of contradictions and inconsistencies.
he was progressive and enlightened in some areas self serving and hypocritical in others.
jefferson who had written in the declaration of independence that all men are created equal also bought bred flogged and sold slaves while calling slavery an abominable crime and unremitting despotism he never freed his slaves for the simple reason that he was too dependent on their forced the capitol building this 1806 watercolor was painted by the buildings architect benjamin henry latrobe and inscribed to thomas jefferson.
a prominent dome would be added later after the building was damaged in the war of 1812.
308 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 labor.
we have the wolf by the ear he confessed and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go jefferson was also a man of expensive tastes who repeatedly condemned national indebtedness while deepening his own indebtedness.
although he celebrated the ideal of republican simplicity he actually lived in an elegant mansion monticello in virginia where he indulged expensive tastes in food wine books artwork silverware and furnishings all of which eventually bankrupted him.
as president jefferson the foremost defender of states rights and the greatest critic of executive power would display his peculiarly divided nature by exercising extraordinary presidential authority in negotiating the louisiana purchase and in enforcing a nationwide embargo shutting off all trade with warring europe.
such inconsistencies led federalists in the massachusetts legislature to put jefferson on trial for hypocrisy in 1805 jefferson in office the imperfect thomas jefferson was a consistently hardworking new president spending ten to thirteen hours each day on his executive duties often engaged in lobbying congressmen to support his legislation.
in jeffersons cabinet the leading figures were secretary of state james madison his best friend virginia neighbor and political ally and secretary of the treasury albert gallatin a pennsylvania republican congressman whose financial skills had won him the respect of federalists and republicans alike.
in filling lesser offices however jefferson often succumbed to pressure from the republicans to remove federalists only to discover that there were few qualified candidates to replace some of them.
when gallatin asked if he might appoint able women to some posts jefferson revealed the limits of his liberalism the appointment of a woman to office is an innovation for which the public is not prepared nor am i marbury v madison in one a rea the federal j udiciary the new president decided to remove most of the offices altogether in part because the court system was the only branch of the government still controlled by federalists.
in 1802 at jeffersons urging the republican controlled congress repealed the judiciary act of 1801 which the federalists had passed just before the transfer of power to the jeffersonian republicans.
the judiciary act was intended to ensure federalist control of the judicial system by creating sixteen federal circuit courts and appointing for life a new federalist judge for each.
jeffersons controversial effort to repeal the judgeships sparked the pathbreaking case of marbury v madison 1803.
jeffersonian republicanism 309 the case went to the supreme court which was presided over by chief justice john marshall a gifted virginia federalist.
marshall served at valley forge during the revolutionary war attended law school at the college of william and mary and became a respected richmond attorney.
in 1788 he helped madison convince virginians to ratify the u s constitution.
he also later served in congress and became secretary of state under president adams who appointed him chief justice early in 1801.
blessed with a keen intellect and an analytical mind marshall was a fierce critic and lifelong enemy of his cousin thomas jefferson whom he considered a w ar shirking aristocrat posing as a democrat.
during the 1790s john jay the first chief justice admitted that the supreme court did not have the energy weight and dignity necessary to serve its role in balancing the powers of congress and the presidency.
marshall set out to fix the problem.
by the time he completed t hirty five years of service on the supreme court 1801 1835 spanning the terms of five presidents he had made it the most powerful court in the world.
the marbury case involved the appointment of the maryland federalist william marbury a prominent land speculator as justice of the peace in the district of columbia.
marburys letter of appointment called a commission signed by president adams two days before he left office was still undelivered when james madison took office as secretary of state and jefferson directed him to withhold it.
marbury then sued for a court order directing madison to deliver his commission.
in the unanimous marbury v madison ruling marshall and the court held that marbury deserved to be awarded his judgeship.
then however marshall denied that the court had jurisdiction in the case.
the federal judiciary act of 1789 which gave the court authority in such proceedings was unconstitutional marshall ruled because the constitution specified that the court should have original jurisdiction only in cases involving foreign ambassadors or nations.
the court therefore could issue no order in the case.
with one bold stroke marshall had remarkably elevated the stature of the court by reprimanding jefferson while avoiding an awkward confrontation with an administration that might have defied his order.
more important the ruling subtly struck down a federal law the judiciary act of 1789 on the grounds that it violated provisions of the constitution the fundamental and paramount law of the nation marshall stressed that the supreme court was emphatically empowered to say what the law is even if it meant overruling both congress and the president.
the marbury decision granted to the supreme court a power not mentioned in the constitution the right of what came to be called judicial review 310 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 or deciding whether acts of congress and the presidency are constitutional.
marshall established that the supreme court was the final authority in all constitutional interpretations.
president jefferson fumed over what he called marshalls irregular ruling.
giving judges the right to decide which laws are constitutional and what not he wrote abigail adams would make the judiciary a despotic branch jefferson however would lose that argument.
although the court did not declare another federal law unconstitutional for fi fty four years it has since struck down more than 150 acts of congress and more than 1 100 unconstitutional acts of state legislatures all in an effort to protect individual liberties and civil rights.
jeffersons economic policies although john marshall got the better of thomas jefferson in court the presidents first term did include a series of triumphs.
surprisingly he did not dismantle alexander hamiltons federalist economic program despite his harsh criticism of it and his ongoing feud with hamilton.
instead following the advice of treasury secretary albert gallatin jefferson learned to accept the national bank as essential to economic growth.
jefferson however did reject hamiltons argument that a federal debt was a national blessing if the debt were not eliminated jefferson told treasury secretary gallatin we shall be committed to the english career of debt corruption and rottenness closing with revolution to pay down the government debt jefferson slashed the federal budget.
in his first message to congress in 1801 he criticized the national government as being too complicated too expensive he fired all federal tax collectors and cut the military budget in half saying that state militias and small navy gunboats provided the nation with adequate protection against foreign enemies.
jeffersons was the first national government in history to reduce its own scope and power.
jefferson also repealed the whiskey tax that hamilton and george washington had implemented in 1791.
in doing so he admitted that he had a peculiar affection for the men from the western side of the mountains grain farmers and backwoods distillers for whom whiskey was often the primary source of income.
the prosperous economy helped the federal budget absorb the loss of the whiskey taxes.
in addition revenues from federal tariffs on imports rose with rising european trade and the sale of g overnment owned western lands soared as americans streamed westward.
ohios admission to the union in 1803 increased the number of states to seventeen.
jeffersonian republicanism 311 burning of the frigate philadelphia lieutenant william decatur set fire to the captured philadelphia during the united states standoff with tripoli over the enslavement of american sailors in north africa.
ending the slave trade while shrinking the federal budget and reducing the national debt jefferson in 1807 signed a landmark bill that outlawed the importation of enslaved africans into the united states in part because southerners had come to believe that a frican born slaves were more prone to revolt.
the new law took effect on january 1 1808 the earliest date possible under the constitution.
at the time south carolina was the only state that still permitted the purchase of enslaved africans.
for years to come however illegal traffic in african slaves would continue as many as 300 000 were smuggled into the united states between 1808 and 1861 the barbary pirates upon assuming the presidency jefferson promised peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations but some nations preferred war.
on the barbary coast of north africa the islamic rulers of morocco algiers tunis and tripoli had for years engaged in piracy and extortion preying upon unarmed european and american merchant ships.
the u s government made numerous blackmail payments to these barbary pirates in exchange for captured american ships and crews.
312 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 in 1801 however the ruler of tripoli upped his blackmail demands and declared war on the united states.
jefferson sent warships to blockade tripoli.
nothing will stop these pirates he wrote but the presence of an armed force a sporadic naval war dragged on until 1805 punctuated in 1804 by the notable exploit of lieutenant stephen decatur who slipped into tripoli harbor by night and set fire to the frigate philadelphia which had been captured after it ran aground.
the tripoli ruler finally settled for a 60 000 ransom and released the philadelphias crew.
it was still blackmail called tribute in the nineteenth century but less than the 300 000 the pirates had demanded and much less than the cost of an outright war.
western expansion thomas jefferson often looked to the west for his inspiration across the appalachian mountains and even across the mississippi river areas that he himself never visited.
only by expanding westward he believed could america avoid becoming overcrowded along the atlantic coast.
westward expansion however meant invading areas long inhabited by native a mericans and the spanish and french.
the louisiana purchase in 1801 american diplomats in europe heard rumors that spain had been forced to transfer its huge louisiana province to its domineering ally france now led by the brilliant napolon bonaparte.
short of stature but a giant on the battlefield napolon was a war loving military genius who had become the most feared ruler in the world the conqueror of egypt and italy.
after taking control of the french government the ambitious napolon set out to restore his countrys north american empire canada and louisiana that had been lost to great britain in 1763.
president jefferson referred to napolon as both a scoundrel and a gigantic force threatening the future of the united states.
a weak spain in control of the territory west of the mississippi river could have been tolerated jefferson explained but napoleonic france in control of the mississippi valley would lead to eternal friction and eventually war with the united states.
to prevent france from seizing control of the mississippi river the greatest of evils jefferson sent new yorker robert r livingston to paris in 1801 to serve as the u s ambassador to france.
the president told livingston that his primary objective should be to acquire the port city of new orleans strategically situated at the mouth of the mississippi the magisterial river that begins in northern minnesota and flows 2 552 miles south to the gulf of m exico.
jefferson told livingston that purchasing new orleans and west florida the territory along the gulf coast from pensacola florida to new jeffersonian republicanism 313 orleans was of absolute importance for the day that france takes possession of new orleans.
we must marry ourselves to the british fleet and nation for protection against napoleonic france.
over the years new orleans under spanish and then french rule had become a prosperous port city and a dynamic crossroads where people of all races and classes intermingled.
for years americans living in tennessee and kentucky had begged the american government to ensure that they could send their crops and goods down the river to new orleans.
in early 1803 jefferson grew so concerned about the stalled negotiations in paris over new orleans that he sent james monroe his trusted friend and virginia neighbor to undertake an extraordinary mission to assist the sixty six year old livingston in paris.
all eyes all hopes are now fixed on you jefferson told him as he prepared to depart for france.
no sooner had monroe arrived than the french made a startling proposal napolon offered to sell not just new orleans but all of the immense unmapped louisiana territory from the mississippi river west to the rocky mountains and from the canadian border south to the gulf of mexico.
the unpredictable napolon had reversed himself because the large french army on the caribbean island of saint domingue haiti had been decimated by epidemics of malaria and yellow fever and by a massive slave revolt led by touissant louverture who had proclaimed the republic of haiti.
it was the first successful slave rebellion in history and it panicked slaveholders in the southern states who feared that news of the haitian revolt would spread to america.
napolon had tried to regain control of saint domingue because it was a phenomenally profitable source of coffee and sugar.
he also had hoped to connect new orleans and haiti as a first step in expanding frances north american trading empire.
but after losing more than 50 000 soldiers to disease and warfare napolon decided to cut his losses by selling the louisiana territory to the united states and using the proceeds to finance his inevitable next war with great britain.
by the treaty of cession dated may 2 1803 the united states agreed to pay 15 million for the entire louisiana territory.
when livingston and monroe asked charles maurice de talleyrand napolons negotiator about the precise extent of the territory they were buying the frenchman replied i can give you no direction.
you have made a noble bargain for yourselves.
i suppose you will make the most of it a delighted livingston the u s negotiator said that from this day the united states take their place among the powers of the first rank the arrival of the signed treaty in washington d c presented jefferson who for years had harshly criticized the federalists for stretching the meaning of the constitution with a frustrating political dilemma.
nowhere did the constitution mention the purchase of territory.
was such an action even legal.
314 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 jefferson admitted that the purchase was not authorized by the constitution but in the end his desire to double the size of the american republic trumped his concerns about an unconstitutional exercise of executive power.
acquiring the louisiana territory the president explained would serve the immediate interests of our western citizens and promote the peace and security of the nation in general by removing the french threat and creating a protective buffer separating the united states from the rest of the world.
jefferson also imagined that the region might be a place to relocate indian nations or freed slaves since he feared a multiracial society.
besides jefferson and his republican supporters argued if the nation waited to pass a constitutional amendment to enable the acquisition napolon might change his mind.
new england federalists strongly opposed the purchase however.
fisher ames of massachusetts argued that the louisiana territory was a waste of money a howling wilderness unpeopled with any beings except wolves and wandering indians ames feared that adding a vast new empire in the west would weaken new england and the federalist party since the new western states were likely to vote republican.
new england federalists also worried that new territories would likely be settled by southern slaveholders who were jeffersonian republicans.
as a newspaper editorialized will jefferson and the republicans who glory in their sacred regard to the rights of human nature purchase an immense wilderness for the purpose of cultivating it with the labor of slaves in a reversal of traditional stances federalists found themselves arguing for strict construction of the constitution in opposing the louisiana purchase.
we are to give money of which we have too little for land of which we already have too much argued a bostonian in the columbian centinel.
a pennsylvania federalist declared that jefferson and the republicans in congress had done more to strengthen the executive branch than federalists dared think of even in george washingtons day eager to close the deal jefferson called a special session of congress on october 17 1803 at which the senate ratified the treaty with the french by an overwhelming vote of 26 6.
on december 20 1803 u s officials took formal possession of the sprawling louisiana territory the indians living there were not consulted.
the purchase included 875 000 square miles of land 529 402 880 acres.
six states in their entirety and most or part of nine more would eventually be carved out of the louisiana purchase from louisiana north to minnesota and west to montana.
the louisiana purchase was the most significant event of jeffersons presidency and one of the most important developments in american history.
it spurred western exploration and expansion and especially enticed jeffersonian republicanism 315 cotton growers to settle in the old s outhwest alabama mississippi and louisiana.
andrew jackson a slaveholding planter in tennessee congratulated jefferson on acquiring the louisiana territory.
every face wears a smile and every heart leaps with joy lewis and clark to learn more about the louisiana territorys geography plants and animals as well as its prospects for trade and agriculture jefferson asked congress to fund a scientific expedition.
the president then appointed two army officers virginians meriwether lewis and william clark to lead what came to be known as the lewis and clark expedition.
the twenty nine year old lewis was jeffersons private secretary.
jefferson admired his boldness enterprise and discretion clark was also an accomplished frontiersman.
he was it was said a youth of solid and promising parts and as brave as caesar on a rainy may morning in 1804 lewis and clarks corps of discovery numbering nearly fifty men set out from a small village near the former french town of st louis in several large canoes called pirogues and one large flat bottomed keelboat filled with food weapons medicine and gifts to share with indians.
they traveled up the missouri river through some of the most rugged wilderness in north america.
unsure of where they were going and what or whom they might encounter they were eager to discover if the missouri the longest river in north america made its way to the pacific ocean.
one of lewis and clarks maps in their journals lewis and clark sketched detailed maps of unexplored regions in the far west.
316 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 six months later near the mandan sioux villages in what would become north dakota the corps of discovery built fort mandan and wintered in relative comfort sending downriver a barge loaded with maps soil samples the skins and skeletons of weasels wolves and antelope and live specimens of prairie dogs and magpies previously unknown in america.

near the future site of astoria oregon at the mouth of the columbia river they built fort clatsop where they spent a cold rainy winter.
the following spring they headed back having been forced to eat their dogs and horses and having weathered blizzards broiling sun fierce rapids raging grizzly bears numerous injuries and illnesses and swarms of mosquitoes.
the expedition returned to st louis in 1806 having been gone nearly 28 months and covered some 8 000 miles.
lewis and clark brought back extensive journals describing their experiences and observations while detailing some 180 plants and 125 animals.
their maps attracted traders and trappers to the region and led the united states to claim the oregon country by right of discovery and exploration.
political schemes sacagawea of the many memorials devoted to sacagawea this statue by artist alice cooper was unveiled at the 1905 lewis and clark centennial exposition.
the lewis and clark expedition and the louisiana purchase strengthened jeffersons already solid support in the south and west.
in new england however federalists panicked because they assumed that new states carved out of the louisiana territory would be dominated by jeffersonian republicans.
to protect their interests federalists hatched a 318 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 c omplicated scheme to link new york politically to new england by trying to elect vice president aaron burr jeffersons ambitious republican rival as governor of new york.
the cunning burr chose to drop his republican affiliation and run for governor as an independent candidate.
several leading federalists opposed the scheme however.
alexander hamilton urged federalists not to vote for burr calling him a dangerous man and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government burr ended up losing the election to the republican candidate who had been endorsed by jefferson.
a furious burr blamed hamilton for his defeat and challenged him to a duel.
at dawn on july 11 1804 the two met near weehawken new jersey on the hudson river above new york city.
hamilton whose son had been killed in a duel at the same location fired first but intentionally missed as a demonstration of his religious and moral principles.
burr showed no such scruples.
he shot hamilton in the hip the bullet ripped through his liver and lodged in his spine.
he died the next day.
burr who was still the vice president was charged with murder by new jersey authorities.
he fled to south carolina where his daughter lived hoping to ride out the storm.
jefferson reelected in the meantime the presidential campaign of 1804 began.
a congressional caucus of republicans renominated jefferson and chose george clinton of new york as the vice presidential candidate.
to avoid the problems associated with parties running multiple candidates for the presidency in 1803 congress had ratified the twelfth amendment to the constitution stipulating that the members of the electoral college must use separate ballots to vote for the president and vice president.
given jeffersons first term achievements the federalist candidates south carolinian charles c pinckney and new yorker rufus king never had a chance for jefferson had accomplished much the louisiana purchase a prosperous economy and a reduced federal government budget and national debt.
a massachusetts republican claimed that the united states was never more respected abroad.
the people were never more happy at home jefferson and clinton won 162 of 176 electoral votes carrying every state but delaware and connecticut.
divisions in the republican party jeffersons landslide victory however created problems within his own party.
freed from strong opposition federalists made up only a quarter of the new congress in 1805 the republican majority began to divide into two warring factions one jeffersonian republicanism 319 calling itself the jeffersonian or nationalist republicans and the other the anti jeffersonian southern republicans choosing the name old republicans.
fiery young virginian john randolph was initially a loyal jeffersonian but over time he emerged as the most colorful of the radically conservative old republicans a group formed mostly of southern agrarian political purists for whom protecting states rights was more important than the need for a strong national government.
randolph for example detested madison for his role in drafting and winning approval of the u s constitution and broke with jefferson over the louisiana purchase.
the imperious randolph another jefferson cousin stood out as the senates most colorful character.
he often entered the chamber wearing a long white coat and white boots with spurs carrying a horsewhip and trailed by a hunting hound that would sleep under his desk.
he lubricated his speeches with gulps of whiskey.
randolph quickly became the wittiest insulter in congress famously ordering opponents to sit down and shut up he and henry clay would engage in a duel in 1826.
he accurately described himself as an old fashioned aristocrat.
i love liberty.
i hate equality randolph and other old republicans were best known for what they opposed any compromise with the federalists any expansion of federal authority at the expense of states rights any new taxes or tariffs and any change in the souths agrarian way of life rooted in slavery.
the jeffersonian republicans on the other hand were more moderate pragmatic and nationalistic.
they were willing to compromise their states rights principles to maintain national tariffs on imports preserve a national bank and stretch the implied powers of the constitution to accommodate the louisiana purchase.
such compromises said randolph were catastrophic.
the old republican party he claimed is already ruined past redemption the burr conspiracy meanwhile aaron burr continued to plot and scheme.
after the controversy over his duel with alexander hamilton subsided he tried to carve out his own personal empire in the west.
what came to be known as the burr conspiracy was hatched when burr and general james wilkinson an old friend then serving as senior general of the u s army and secretly being paid by the spanish for spying plotted to use a w ell armed force of volunteers to separate part of the louisiana territory from the union and declare it an independent republic with new orleans as its capital and burr as its ruler.
burr claimed that the people of the western country were ready for revolt 320 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 in late 1806 burr floated down the ohio and mississippi rivers toward new orleans with 100 volunteers only to have wilkinson turn on him and alert jefferson to the scheme.
the president ordered that burr be arrested.
militiamen captured burr in february 1807 and took him to richmond virginia where in august he was tried for treason before chief justice john marshall.
jefferson declared that burr was guilty of trying to separate the western states from us of adding mexico to them and of placing himself at their head in the end however burr was acquitted because john marshall instructed the jury that a verdict of treason required an act of war against the united states confirmed by at least two witnesses.
aaron burr burr graduated from what again jefferson was disgusted with is now princeton university where marshalls ruling.
it now appears we he changed his course of study from have no law but the will of the judge theology to law.
he wrote a friend.
the president considered proposing a constitutional amendment to limit the power of the judiciary and even thought about asking congress to impeach the chief justice.
in the end however he did nothing.
with further charges pending the slippery burr deeply in debt skipped bail and took refuge first in england then in france.
he returned to america in 1812 and resumed practicing law in new york.
war in europe in the spring of 1803 soon after completing the sale of louisiana to america napolon bonaparte declared war on great britain.
the massive conflict would last eleven years and eventually involve all of europe.
most americans wanted to remain neutral and trade with both sides in the war but the british and french were determined to keep that from happening.
war in europe 321 naval harassment during 1805 the spreading war in europe reached a stalemate the french army controlled most of europe and the british navy dominated the seas.
in may 1806 britain issued a series of official declarations called orders in council which imposed a naval blockade of the entire european coast to prevent merchant ships from other nations including the united states from making port in france.
soon british warships began seizing american merchant ships bound for france.
an angry congress responded preparation for war to defend by passing the n on importation act commerce shipbuilders like those which banned the importation of brit pictured here constructing the ish goods.
in early 1807 napolon philadelphia played an important role in announced that french warships americas early wars.
would blockade the ports of great britain.
the british responded that they would no longer allow any foreign ships to trade with the french controlled islands in the caribbean.
soon thereafter british warships appeared along the american coast stopping and searching u s merchant vessels as they headed for the caribbean or europe.
the tense situation posed a terrible dilemma for american shippers.
if they agreed to british demands to stop trading with the french the french would retaliate by seizing u s vessels headed to and from great britain and if they agreed to french demands that they stop trading with the british the british would seize american ships headed to and from france.
lured by high profits many american merchants decided to risk becoming victims of the a nglo french war.
many of them paid a high price for their pursuit of overseas profits.
during 1807 hundreds of american ships and their cargoes were captured by british and french warships.
impressment for american sailors the danger on the high seas was heightened by the practice of impressment whereby british warships stopped u s vessels boarded them and kidnapped sailors they claimed were british citizens.
american merchant ships attracted british deserters because they paid seamen more than twice as much as did the royal navy fully half of all sailors on american ships about 9 000 men had been born in britain.
322 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 when the british stopped and searched american ships they often did not bother to determine the citizenship of those they impressed into service.
as a british naval captain explained it is my duty to keep my ship manned i will do so wherever i find men that speak the same language with me between 1803 and 1811 some 6 200 american sailors were impressed into the british navy.
the chesapeake incident 1807 the crisis boiled over on june 22 1807 when the powerful british warship hms leopard stopped a smaller u s vessel the chesapeake only eight miles off the virginia coast.
after the chesapeakes captain refused to allow the british to search his ship for english deserters the leopard opened fire without warning killing three americans and wounding eighteen.
a british search party then boarded the damaged chesapeake and seized four men one of whom an english deserter was hanged.
the attack on the chesapeake was both an act of war and a national insult.
the washington federalist screamed we have never on any occasion witnessed.
such a thirst for revenge in early july jefferson demanded an apology banned all british warships from u s waters and called on state governors to mobilize their militias.
like john adams before him however jefferson resisted war fever in part because the undersized american army and navy were not prepared to fight.
his caution infuriated his critics.
federalist congressman josiah quincy of massachusetts called jefferson a dish of skim milk curdling at the head of our nation the embargo president jefferson decided on a strategy of peaceable coercion to force britain and france to stop violating american rights.
late in 1807 he somehow convinced enough republicans in congress to cut off all american foreign trade.
as jefferson said his choices were war embargo or nothing the unprecedented embargo act december 1807 stopped all exports of american goods wheat flour pork fish and cattle among other items by prohibiting u s ships from sailing to foreign ports to keep our ships and seamen out of harms way jefferson and his secretary of state james madison mistakenly assumed that the embargo would quickly force the warring european nations to quit violating american rights.
they were wrong.
neither britain nor france yielded.
with each passing month the ill conceived embargo devastated the republicans and the economy while reviving the political appeal of the federalists especially in new england where merchants howled because the embargo cut off their primary industry oceangoing commerce.
the value of u s exports war in europe 323 anti jefferson sentiment this 1807 federalist cartoon compares george washington left flanked by a british lion and american eagle and thomas jefferson right with a snake and a lizard.
below jefferson are volumes of french philosophy while washingtons volumes simply read law order and religion.
plummeted from 48 million in 1807 to 9 million a year later and federal revenue from tariffs plunged from 18 million to 8 million.
shipbuilding declined by two thirds and prices for exported farm crops were cut in half.
new englands o nce thriving port cities became ghost towns as thousands of ships and sailors were out of work.
meanwhile smuggling soared especially along the border with canada.
americans raged at what critics called jeffersons embargo a bostonian accused the president of being one of the greatest tyrants in the whole world another letter writer told the president that he had paid four friends to shoot you if you dont take off the embargo while still another addressed the president as you red headed son of a bitch the embargo turned american politics upside down.
to enforce it jefferson the nations leading spokesman for reducing the power of the federal government now found himself expanding federal power into every aspect of the nations economic life.
in effect the united states used its own warships to blockade its own ports.
jefferson even activated the new york state militia in an effort to stop smuggling across the canadian border.
the outrage over jeffersons embargo eventually demoralized the president and other republicans and helped revive the federalist party in new england.
324 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 at the same time farmers and planters in the south and west also suffered they needed to sell their surplus grain cotton and tobacco abroad.
yet jefferson stubbornly refused to admit defeat.
as a critic noted the president was determined to hug the embargo and die in its embrace congress finally rebuked the president by voting 70 0 to end the ill conceived embargo effective march 4 1809 the day that the splendid misery of jeffersons second presidential term ended.
the dejected president left the white house feeling like a freed prisoner eager to retire to my family my books and my farms in virginia.
no one he said could be more relieved on shaking off the shackles of power his fellow virginian and stern critic congressman john randolph declared that never had a president left the nation in a state so deplorable and calamitous jefferson learned a hard lesson that many of his successors would also confront a second term is rarely as successful as the first.
as he admitted no man will ever carry out of that office the presidency the reputation which carried him into it in the election of 1808 the presidency passed to another prominent virginian secretary of state james madison.
the federalists again backing charles c pinckney of south carolina and rufus king of new york won only 47 electoral votes to madisons 122 james madison and the drift to war in his inaugural address president madison confessed that he inherited a situation full of difficulties he soon made a bad situation worse.
although madison had been a talented legislator and the father of the constitution he proved to be a weak indecisive chief executive.
when members of congress questioned several of his cabinet appointments he backed down and ended up naming s econd rate men to key positions.
madisons sparkling wife dolley was the only truly excellent member of the presidents inner circle.
seventeen years younger than her husband she was a superb first lady who excelled at using the white house to entertain political leaders and foreign dignitaries.
journalists called her the queen of washington city from the beginning madisons presidency was entangled in foreign affairs and crippled by his lack of executive experience.
like jefferson madison and his advisers repeatedly overestimated the young republics diplomatic leverage and military strength in shaping foreign policy.
the result was international humiliation.
madison insisted on upholding the principle of freedom of the seas for the united states and other neutral nations but he was unwilling to create a navy the war of 1812 325 strong enough to enforce it.
he continued the policy of peaceable coercion against the european nations which was as ineffective for madison as it had been for jefferson.
in place of the failed embargo congress passed the n on intercourse act 1809 which reopened trade with all countries except france and great britain and their colonies.
it also authorized the president to reopen trade with either france or great britain if it stopped violating american rights on the high seas.
in december 1810 france issued a vague promise to restore americas neutral rights whereupon madison gave great britain three months to do the same.
the british refused and the royal navy continued to seize american vessels and their cargoes and crews.
a reluctant madison asked congress to declare war against great britain on june 1 1812.
if the united states did not defend its rights as a neutral nation he explained then americans were not independent people but colonists and vassals thomas jefferson sent a letter of support to the president heaven help you through all your difficulties on june 5 the house of representatives voted for war 79 49.
two weeks later the senate followed suit 19 13.
every federalist in congress opposed what they called mr.
madisons war while 80 percent of republicans supported it.
the southern and western states wanted war the new england states opposed it.
by declaring war republicans hoped to unite the nation discredit the federalists and put an end to b ritish led indian attacks along the great lakes and in the ohio valley by conquering british canada.
to generate popular support thomas jefferson advised madison that he needed above all to stop indian barbarities.
the conquest of canada will do this jefferson presumed that the french canadians were eager to rise up against their british rulers.
with their help the republicans predicted american armies would easily conquer britains vast northern colony.
it did not work out that way.
the war of 1812 the war of 1812 marked the first time that congress had declared war.
great britain did not expect or want the war it was preoccupied with defeating napolon in europe.
in fact on june 16 1812 the british government promised to quit interfering with american shipping.
president madison and the republicans however were not satisfied only war they believed would put an end to the british practice of impressment and stop b ritish inspired indian attacks along the western frontier.
326 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 shipping rights and national honor why the united states chose to start the war remains a puzzle still debated among historians.
the main cause of the war the repeated british violations of american shipping rights and the practice of impressing sailors dominated president madisons war message.
most of the votes in congress for war came from legislators representing rural regions from pennsylvania southward and westward where farmers and planters grew surpluses for export to europe.
their economic interests were being hurt by the raids on american merchant ships.
however the representatives from the new england states which bore the brunt of british attacks on u s shipping voted against the declaration of war 20 12.
as a new england minister roared let the southern heroes fight their own battles one explanation for this seeming inconsistency is that many americans in the south and west especially tennessee kentucky and south carolina voted for war because they believed americas national honor was at stake.
andrew jackson a proud anti british tennessean who was the new states first congressman declared that he was eager to fight for the re establishment of our national character in the popular phrase of the time the war was needed to protect free trade and sailors rights native american conflicts another factor leading to tecumseh the shawnee leader who tried to unite native american peoples across the united states in defense of their lands was later killed in 1813 at the battle of the thames.
war was the growing number of indian attacks supported by the british in the ohio valley.
the story took a new turn with the rise of two remarkable shawnee leaders tecumseh and his brother tenskwatawa who lived in a large village called prophetstown on the tippecanoe river in northern indiana.
tecumseh shooting star knew that the fate of the native peoples depended on their being unified.
he the war of 1812 327 hoped to create a single indian nation powerful enough with british assistance to fend off further american expansion.
his half brother tenskwatawa the open door a o ne eyed recovering alcoholic with a fierce temper who was known as the prophet gained a large following among native americans for his predictions that white americans children of the devil were on the verge of collapse.
he demanded that the indigenous peoples abandon all things european clothing customs christianity and especially liquor.
if they did so the great spirit would reward them by turning the whites gunpowder to sand.
a trail of blood inspired by his brothers spiritual message tecumseh in 1811 made heroic efforts to form alliances with other native american nations throughout m id america.
in alabama he told a gathering of 5 000 indians that they should let the white race perish because they seize your land they corrupt your women they trample on the ashes of your dead the native peoples must join together to drive out the whites on a trail of blood the whites have driven us from the sea to the lakes he declared.
we can go no further tecumseh disavowed the many treaties whereby indigenous peoples had sold ancient indian lands.
no tribe he declared has the right to sell land even to each other much less to strangers.
sell a country.
why not sell the air the great sea as well as the earth.
didnt the great spirit make them all for the use of his children william henry harrison governor of the indiana territory learned of tecumsehs bold plans met with him twice and described him as one of those uncommon geniuses who spring up occasionally to produce revolutions and overturn the established order of things yet harrison vowed to eliminate tecumseh.
in the fall of 1811 he gathered 1 000 troops and advanced on prophetstown while the indian leader was away.
tenskwatawa was lured into making a foolish attack on harrisons encampment.
what became the battle of tippecanoe was a disastrous defeat for the native americans as harrisons troops burned the village and destroyed its supplies.
tecumsehs indian confederacy went up in smoke and he fled to canada.
the lust for canada and florida some americans wanted war with great britain in 1812 because they wanted to seize control of canada.
that there were nearly 8 million americans and only 300 000 canadians led many to believe that conquering canada would be quick and easy.
jefferson for instance wrote president madison that the acquisition of canada was simply a matter of marching north with a military force.
328 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 the british were also vulnerable far to the south.
east florida which the british had returned to spains control in 1783 posed a threat to the americans because spain was too weak or simply unwilling to prevent indian attacks across the border with georgia.
also in the absence of a strong spanish presence british agents and traders remained in east florida smuggling goods and conspiring with indians against americans.
spanish florida had also long been a haven for runaway slaves from georgia and south carolina.
many americans living along the florida georgia border hoped that the war against great britain would enable them to oust the british and the spanish from florida.
war hawks in the congress that assembled in late 1811 new young anti british representatives from southern and western districts shouted for war to defend national honor and rid the northwest of the indian problem among the most vocal war hawks were henry clay of kentucky and john c calhoun of south carolina.
clay the brash young speaker of the house of representatives was a tall rawboned man who was for resistance by the sword he boasted that the kentucky militia alone could conquer canada.
his bravado inspired others.
i dont like henry clay calhoun said.
he is a bad man an imposter a creator of wicked schemes.
i wouldnt speak to him but by god i love him for wanting war against britain.
when calhoun learned that president madison had finally decided on war he threw his arms around clays neck and led his war hawk colleagues in an indian war dance.
in new england and much of new york however there was little enthusiasm for war.
it threatened to cripple the regions dominant industry shipping since great britain remained the regions largest trading partner.
federalists actively undermined the war effort.
both massachusetts and connecticut refused to send soldiers to fight in the war and merchants openly sold supplies to british troops in canada.
war preparations as it turned out the united states was woefully unprepared for war both financially and militarily and the short soft spoken james madison lacked the leadership ability and physical stature to inspire public confidence and military resolve.
he was no george washington.
the national economy was weak too.
in 1811 republicans had let the charter of the bank of the united states expire.
many republican congressmen owned shares in state banks and wanted the b u s.
dissolved because it both competed with and regulated their local banks.
once the b u s.
shut down however the number of unregulated state banks mushroomed all with their own forms of currency creating commercial chaos.
treasury secretary albert the war of 1812 329 gallatin was so upset by the loss of the b u s.
that he wrote a scathing letter of resignation.
president madison begged him to reconsider which he did but the problems of waging a war with britain without adequate financial resources did not go away.
once war began it did not go well for the americans.
the mighty british navy blockaded american ports which caused federal tariff revenues to tumble.
in march 1813 albert gallatin u s.
naval victories john bull the warned madison that the u s trea personification of england as uncle sury had hardly enough money to sam was to america stung to agony last till the end of the month fur by wasp and hornet two american warships that clinched early victories in thermore republicans in congress the war of 1812 were so afraid of public criticism that they delayed approving tax increases needed to finance the war.
the military situation was almost as bad.
in 1812 the british had 250 000 professional soldiers and the most powerful navy in the world.
by contrast the u s army numbered only 3 287 ill trained and poorly equipped men led by mostly incompetent officers with little combat experience.
in january 1812 congress authorized an army of 35 000 men but a year later just 18 500 had been recruited many of them irish american immigrants who hated the english and then only by enticing them with promises of land and cash bounties.
president madison who refused to allow free blacks or slaves to serve in the army was forced to plead with the state governors to provide militiamen only to have the federalist governors in anti war new england decline.
the british on the other hand had thousands of soldiers stationed in canada and the west indies.
and as was true during the revolutionary war the british offering food guns and ammunition recruited more native american allies than did the americans.
the u s navy was in better shape than the army with able officers and well trained seamen but it had only sixteen tiny gunboats compared to britains 600 warships.
the lopsided military strength of the british led madison to mutter that the united states was in an embarrassing situation a continental war for these reasons and more the war of 1812 was one of the strangest wars in history.
in fact it was three wars fought on three 330 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 separate fronts.
one theatre of conflict was the chesapeake bay along the coast of maryland and virginia including washington d c.
the second theatre was in the south alabama mississippi and west and east florida where american forces led by general andrew jackson invaded lands owned by the creeks and the spanish.
the third front might be more accurately called the canadian american war.
it began in what is now northern indiana and ohio southeastern michigan and the contested border regions around the great lakes.
the fighting raged back and forth across the border as the united states repeatedly invaded british canada only to be embarrassingly repulsed.
the war in the north like the american revolution the war of 1812 often called americas second war for independence was very much a civil war.
the canadians thousands of whom were former american loyalists who had fled north after the revolutionary war remained loyal to the british empire while the americans and a few french canadians and irish canadians sought to push britain out of north america and annex canada.
in some cases americans fought former americans including families that were divided in their allegiances.
siblings even shot each other.
once after killing an american militiaman a canadian soldier began taking the clothes off the corpse only to realize that it was his brother.
he grumbled that it served him right to have died for a bad cause.
indians armed by the british dominated the heavily wooded borderlands around the great lakes.
michigans governor recognized that the british and their indian allies were dependent on each other the british cannot hold upper canada ontario without the assistance of the indians but the indians cannot conduct a war without the assistance of a civilized nation great britain so the american assault on canada involved attacking indians canadians and british soldiers.
invading canada president james madison approved a t hree pronged plan for the invasion of british canada.
it called for one army to move north through upstate new york along lake champlain to take montreal while another was to advance into upper canada by crossing the niagara river between lakes ontario and erie.
the third attack would come from the west with an american force moving east into upper canada from detroit michigan.
the plan was to have all three attacks begin at the same time to force the british troops in canada to split up.
the complicated plan of invasion however was a disaster.
the underfunded and undermanned americans could barely field one army let alone three and communications among the separated commanders was spotty at best.

he told the canadians that he was there to free them from tyranny and oppression the canadians however did not want to be liberated and the americans were soon pushed back to detroit by british troops canadian militiamen and their indian allies.
hull was tricked by the british commanders threats to unleash thousands of indian warriors.

his capitulation shocked the nation and opened the entire western frontier to raids by british troops and canadian militiamen and their indian allies.
president madison and the republicans felt humiliated.
in kentucky a republican said general hull must be a traitor or nearly an idiot or part of both hull was eventually put on trial and sentenced to death.
although pardoned by madison he was dismissed from the army for his cowardice.
the second prong of the american invasion plan the assault on montreal never got off the ground.
the third prong began at dawn on october 13 1812 when u s troops led by general stephen van rensselaer rowed across the niagara river from lewiston new york to the canadian village of queenston where they suffered a crushing defeat in the battle of queenston heights.
the shameful losses in canada led many americans to lose hope that they could win the war.
in early 1813 a kentuckian warned that any more military disasters would result in disunion and the cause of republicanism will be lost then there was a glimmer of good news.
in april 1813 an american force led by general zebulon pike attacked york later renamed toronto the provincial capital of upper canada.
the british and canadian militiamen surrendered and over the next several days in part because pike had been killed in the battle the u s soldiers rampaged out of control plundering the city and burning government buildings.
the destruction of york outraged the british and canadians and would lead them later to seek revenge on the american capital of washington d c after the burning of york the americans sought to gain naval control of the great lakes and other inland waterways along the canadian border.
if they could break the british naval supply line and secure lake erie they could divide the british from their indian allies.
in 1813 at presque isle pennsylvania near erie t wenty eight year old oliver hazard perry supervised the construction of warships from timber cut in nearby forests.
by the end of the summer commodore perrys new warships set out in search of the british and some warm fighting finally finding them at lake eries put in bay on september 10.
two british warships used their superior weapons to pound the lawrence perrys flagship.
after four hours of intense shelling none of the lawrences guns was working and most of the crew were dead or wounded.
perry refused to quit however.
he switched to another vessel kept fighting and miraculously ended up accepting the surrender of the entire british squadron.
hatless and bloodied perry reported that we have met the enemy and they are ours the war of 1812 333 american naval control of lake erie forced the british to evacuate upper canada.
they gave up detroit and were defeated at the battle of the thames in southern canada on october 5 1813.
during the battle the british fled leaving the great chief tecumseh and 500 warriors to face the wrath of the americans.
when tecumseh was killed the remaining indians retreated.
perrys victory and the defeat of tecumseh enabled the americans to recover control of most of michigan and seize the western district of upper canada.
thereafter the war in the north lapsed into a military stalemate along the canadian border with neither side able to dislodge the other.
the creek war in the south too the war flared up in 1813.
the creek indians in western georgia and alabama had split into two factions the upper creeks called red sticks because of their bright red war clubs who opposed american expansion and sided with the british during the war and the lower creeks who wanted to remain on good terms with the americans.
on august 30 red sticks attacked fort mims on the alabama river thirty miles above the gulf coast town of mobile and massacred 553 men women and children butchering and scalping half of them.
americans were incensed.
thirsting for revenge andrew jackson commanding general of the army of west tennessee recruited about 2 500 volunteer militiamen and headed south.
with him were david crockett a famous sharpshooter and sam houston a nineteen year old virginia frontiersman who would later lead the texas war for independence against mexico.
jackson was a natural warrior and gifted commander who was both feared and respected.

jackson reported to his wife that the carnage was dreadful his men had regained all the scalps taken from fort mims fewer than fifty of jacksons soldiers were killed.
the war of 1812 335 the battle of horseshoe bend was the worst defeat ever inflicted upon native americans and it effectively ended the creeks ability to wage war.
with the treaty of fort jackson signed in august 1814 the red stick creeks gave up two thirds of their land some 23 million acres including southwest georgia and much of alabama.
red eagle chief of the red sticks told jackson i am in your power.
my people are all gone.
i can do no more but weep over the misfortunes of my nation president madison rewarded jackson by naming him a major general in the regular u s army.
soon after the battle of horseshoe bend events in europe took a dramatic turn when the british spanish and portuguese armies repelled french emperor napolons effort to conquer spain and portugal.
now free to focus on the american war the british sent 16 000 veteran soldiers to try yet again to invade america from canada.
the british navy off the american coast also received reinforcement enabling it to extend its blockade to new england ports and to bombard coastal towns from delaware to florida.
the final piece of the british plan was to seize new orleans and thereby sever american access to the mississippi river lifeline of the west.
fighting along the chesapeake bay throughout the war the pitifully small u s navy was unable to protect the nations long coastline.
in february 1813 the british had more warships in the chesapeake bay than were in the entire american navy and they frequently captured and burned american merchant vessels.
the british fleet also launched numerous raids along the virginia and maryland shore in effect mocking the madison administrations ability to defend the nation.
one british officer dismissed the united states as a country of infants in war the presence of british ships on the coast and inland rivers led many slaves to escape or revolt.
as had happened during the revolutionary war british naval commanders promised freedom to slaves who aided or fought with them.
more than 3 000 slaves in maryland and virginia stole boats or canoes that took them to the safety of british ships.
in september 1813 the british organized some 400 former slaves into an all black military unit called the colonial marines.
the recruits were provided uniforms meals and 6 a month in wages.
news of the all black colonial marines panicked whites living along the vast chesapeake bay who feared that the former slaves would have no mercy on them virginias john randolph spoke for many southern planters when he insisted that the question of slavery as it is called is to us a question of life and death fearing our worst enemy the mayor of richmond claimed that the slaves of this city.
have conspired and are conspiring to burn the city 336 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 the burning of washington during the late summer of 1814 u s forces suffered their most humiliating experience of the war when british troops captured and burned washington d c.
in august 4 000 british soldiers landed at benedict maryland routed the american militia at bladensburg and headed for the nations capital only a few miles away.
thousands fled the city.
president madison frantically called out the poorly led and untrained militia then left the white house to help rally the troops.
his efforts failed however as the american defense disintegrated in the face of the british attack.
on august 24 british redcoats marched unopposed into the american capital.
madison and his wife dolley had fled just in time where i shall be tomorrow i cannot tell after first saving a portrait of george washington and a copy of the declaration of independence.
the vengeful british aware that american troops had burned york the canadian capital torched the white house the capitol the library of congress and other government buildings.
a tornado the next day compounded the damage but a violent thunderstorm dampened both the fires and the enthusiasm of the british forces who headed north to assault baltimore.
the destruction of washington d c shocked embarrassed and infuriated americans.

the war of 1812 337 and the military.
david campbell a virginia congressman told his brother that america was ruled by fools and the administration opposed by knaves john armstrong the secretary of war resigned because of the embarrassing sack of the nations capital.
madison replaced him with james monroe who was also serving as secretary of state.
a desperate monroe soon proposed enlisting free blacks into the army.
but many worried that such changes were too few and too late.
a virginia official noted that without a miracle this union is inevitably dissolved president madison was heartbroken by the turn of events.
he called an emergency session of congress and appealed to americans to expel the invaders a baltimore newspaper reported that the spirit of the nation is roused that determination showed itself when fifty british warships sailed into baltimore harbor on september 13 while 4 200 british soldiers including the a ll black colonial marines assaulted the city by land.
about 1 000 americans held fort mchenry on an island in the harbor.
during the night of september 13 the british unleashed a thunderous bombardment of fort mchenry.
the portals of hell appeared to have been thrown open a baltimore resident reported.
yet the americans refused to surrender.
at daybreak on the 14th the soldiers in the battered fort stood defiant guns at the ready.
the frustrated british fleet sailed away.
francis scott key a lawyer and occasional poet watched the bombardment of fort mchenry from a ship having been sent to negotiate the release of a captured american.
the sight of the u s flag still flying over the fort at dawn meant that the city had survived the onslaught.
the dramatic scene inspired key to scribble the verses of what came to be called the s tar spangled banner which began oh say can you see by the dawns early light later revised and set to the tune of a popular english drinking song it eventually became americas national anthem.
the battle of lake champlain the british failure to conquer baltimore nixed their hopes of a quick victory in the war while giving the americans a desperately needed morale boost.
more good news soon arrived from upstate new york where the outnumbered americans at plattsburgh along lake champlain were saved by the superb ability of commodore thomas macdonough commander of the u s naval squadron.
on september 11 1814 just days after the burning of washington d c british soldiers attacked at plattsburgh while their navy engaged macdonoughs warships in a battle that ended with the entire british fleet either destroyed or captured.
the battle of lake champlain also called the battle of plattsburgh forced the british to abandon the northern campaign their main military push in 338 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 the war and retreat back into canada.
when the british officers came to surrender themselves and their swords macdonough said gentlemen return your swords to your scabbards you are worthy of them in florida in november an army led by andrew jackson seized spanish controlled pensacola on the gulf coast thereby preventing another british army from landing and pushing northward into the southern states.
the american victories in new york and florida convinced congress not to abandon washington d c.
instead the members voted to rebuild the capitol and the white house.
the aftermath of the war while the fighting raged u s diplomats including henry clay and john quincy adams son of the former president had begun meetings with british officials in ghent near brussels in present day belgium to discuss ending the war.
the negotiations were at a standstill when news arrived of the american victory at the battle of lake champlain and the failure of the british invasion of baltimore.
the news made the british more flexible but negotiations still dragged on for weeks.
finally on christmas eve 1814 the diplomats reached an agreement to stop the fighting.
the treaty of ghent the weary british decided to end the war in part because of military setbacks but also because london merchants were eager to renew the extensive trade with america.
the british government had also concluded that the war was not worth the cost.
by the treaty of ghent 1814 the two countries agreed to end the war return each sides prisoners and restore the previous boundaries.
this was a godsend for the americans since british forces at the time still controlled eastern maine northern michigan a portion of western new york and several islands off the coast of georgia.
the british also pledged to stop supporting indian attacks along the great lakes.
what had begun as an american effort to protect its honor end british impressment and conquer canada had turned into a second war of independence.
at the end of the treaty negotiations john quincy adams wrote to his wife from ghent that he had had the honor of redeeming our union although the americans lost the war for canada and saw their national capital destroyed they won the southern war to defeat the indians and take their lands.
more important the treaty of ghent saved the splintered republic from possible civil war and financial ruin.
the aftermath of the war 339 the battle of new orleans because it took six weeks for news of the treaty of ghent to reach the united states fighting continued in america at the end of 1814.
on december 1 andrew jackson arrived in new orleans to prepare for a british invasion of the strategic city.
he announced that he would drive the british into the sea or perish in the effort jackson declared martial law taking control of the governance of the city which enabled him to transform new orleans into a large armed camp.
on december 12 a british fleet with some 8 000 seasoned soldiers took up positions on the coast of louisiana.
the british hoped to capture new orleans and thereby gain control of the mississippi river.
british general sir edward pakenhams painfully careful preparation for an assault against the americans gave jackson time to organize hundreds of slaves loaned by planters to dig trenches build ramparts and stack cotton bales and barrels of sugar to protect the defenders from british fire.
the americans built an almost invulnerable position but pakenham cocky and careless rashly ordered a frontal assault at dawn on sunday january 8 1815.
his professional redcoats including all black units from the caribbean islands marched into a murderous hail of artillery shells and rifle fire.
line after line of advancing redcoats crumpled and fell often on top of one another.
when the smoke cleared a kentucky militiaman said that the battlefield looked first like a sea of blood.
it was not blood itself but the red coats in which the british soldiers were dressed before the devastated british withdrew some 2 100 had been wounded or killed including pakenham two other generals and more than 80 officers.
jacksons army defends new orleans andrew jacksons defeat of the british at new orleans january 1815.
340 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 only thirteen americans had lost their lives.
a british naval officer wrote that there never was a more complete failure although the battle of new orleans occurred after the treaty of ghent had been signed it was still a vitally important psychological victory as the treaty had yet to be officially ratified by either the united states or great britain.
had the british won at new orleans they might have tried to revise the treaty in their favor.
jacksons lopsided victory ensured that both governments would act quickly to approve the treaty.
the unexpected american triumph at new orleans also generated a wave of patriotic nationalism.
as a washington d c newspaper crowed almost incredible victory such pride in the battle of new orleans would later help transform the heroic andrew jackson into a dynamic presidential candidate eager to move the nation into an even more democratic era in which the common man would be celebrated and empowered.
the rough hewn jackson wrote a southerner in april 1815 is everywhere hailed as the savior of the country.
he has been feasted caressed i may say idolised the hartford convention a few weeks before the battle of new orleans many new england federalists frustrated by the rising expense of a war they had opposed tried to take matters into their own hands at a meeting in hartford connecticut.
the hartford convention was the climax of new englands disgust with mr.
madisons war on december 15 1814 the hartford convention assembled with delegates from massachusetts rhode island connecticut vermont and new hampshire.
the convention proposed seven constitutional amendments designed to limit republican and southern influence.
the amendments included abolishing the counting of slaves in determining a states representation in congress requiring a t wo thirds supermajority rather than a simple majority vote to declare war or admit new states prohibiting trade embargoes lasting more than sixty days excluding immigrants from holding federal office limiting the president to one term and barring successive presidents from the same state a provision clearly directed at virginia.
delegates at the hartford convention also discussed the possibility that some of the new england states might secede from the united states if their demands were dismissed in washington.
yet the secessionist threat quickly evaporated.
in february 1815 when messengers from the hartford convention reached washington d c they found the battered and burned capital celebrating the good news from new orleans.
their position according to a french diplomat was awkward embarrassing and lent itself to cruel ridicule the aftermath of the war 341 ignored by congress and the president the hartford delegates turned tail for home.
the whole sorry episode proved fatal to the federalist party which never recovered from the shame of disloyalty stamped on it by the hartford convention.
the victory at new orleans and the arrival of the peace treaty from europe transformed the national mood.
almost overnight president madison went from being denounced and possibly impeached to being hailed a national hero.
the wars legacies there was no clear military victor in the war of 1812 nor much clarification about the issues that had ignited a war that cost 7 000 killed and wounded americans.
the treaty of ghent ended the fighting but failed to address the reasons why president madison had declared war in the first place the disputes about u s maritime rights and the british practice of impressment.
for all the clumsiness with which the war was managed however in the end it generated an intense patriotism across much of the nation and reaffirmed american independence.
the young republic was at last secure from british or european threats.
as james monroe said we have acquired a character and a rank among the other nations which we did not enjoy before forgetting their many military disasters americans soon decided that the war was a glorious triumph for republican values.
the people observed treasury secretary albert gallatin are more american they feel and act more as a nation and i hope that the permanency of the union is thereby better secured soon after the official copy of the treaty of ghent arrived in washington d c in mid february 1815 virginian william h cabell wrote his brother that the glorious peace for america.
has come exactly when we least expected but when we most wanted it another virginian colonel john taylor recognized the happy outcome as largely resulting from a succession of lucky accidents that enabled the administration to get the nation out of the war had the conflict dragged on he predicted the republican party and our form of government would have been blown up the war also propelled the united states toward economic independence as the wartime interruption of trade with europe forced america to expand its manufacturing sector and become more s elf sufficient.
the british blockade of the coast created a shortage of cotton cloth in the united states leading to the creation of the nations first cotton manufacturing industry in waltham massachusetts.
by the end of the war there were more than 100 cotton mills in new england and 64 more in pennsylvania.
even thomas jefferson admitted in 342 chapter 7 the early republic 1800 1815 1815 that his beloved agricultural republic had been transformed we must now place the manufacturer by the agriculturalist after nearly forty years of independence the new american republic was emerging as an agricultural commercial and industrial world power.
perhaps the strangest result of the war of 1812 was the reversal of attitudes among republicans and federalists.
the wartime experience taught james madison and the republicans some lessons in nationalism.
first the british invasion of washington d c convinced madison of the necessity of a strong army and navy.
second the lack of a national bank had hurt the federal governments efforts to finance the war state banks were so unstable that it was difficult to raise the funds needed to pay military expenses.
in 1816 madison who had opposed a national bank changed his mind and created the second bank of the united states.
third the rise of new industries during the war prompted manufacturers to call for increased tariffs on imports to protect american companies from unfair foreign competition.
madison went along despite his criticism of tariffs in the 1790s.
while madison reversed himself by embracing nationalism and a broader interpretation of the constitution the federalists similarly pivoted by embracing madisons and jeffersons earlier emphasis on states rights and strict construction of the constitution as they tried to defend the special economic interests of their regional stronghold new england.
it was the first great reversal of partisan political roles in constitutional interpretation.
it would not be the last.
the war of 1812 proved devastating to all of the eastern indian nations most of which had fought with the british.
the war accelerated westward settlement by americans and native american resistance was greatly diminished after the death of tecumseh and his indian confederacy.
the british essentially abandoned their indian allies.
none of their former lands were returned to them and the british vacated the frontier forts that had long served as supply centers for indians.
lakota chief little crow expressed the betrayal felt by native americans after the war when he rejected the consolation gifts from the local british commander after we have fought for you endured many hardships lost some of our people and awakened the vengeance of our powerful neighbors you make peace for yourselves.
you no longer need our service you offer us these goods to pay us for your having deserted us.
but no we will not take them we hold them and yourselves in equal contempt in the years after the war the united states negotiated more than 200 treaties with native peoples that transferred indian lands to the federal government and created isolated reservations for them west of the mississippi river.
the aftermath of the war 343 as the indians were pushed out tens of thousands of americans moved west into the great lakes region and southwest into georgia alabama and mississippi occupying more territory in a single generation than had been settled in the 150 years of colonial history.
the federal government hastened western migration by providing war veterans with 160 acres of land between the illinois and mississippi rivers.
the trans appalachian population soared from 300 000 to 2 million between 1800 and 1820.
by 1840 more than 40 percent of americans lived west of the appalachians in eight new states.
at the same time the growing dispute over slavery and its expansion into new western territories set in motion an explosive national debate that would test again the grand experiment in republican government.
chapter review summary jeffersons administration the jeffersonian republicans did not dismantle much of hamiltons economic program but they did repeal the whiskey tax cut government expenditures and usher in a republican simplicity that championed the virtues of smaller government and plain living.
while republicans idealized the agricultural world that had existed prior to 1800 the first decades of the nineteenth century were a period of transformational economic and population growth in the united states.
commercial agriculture and exports to europe flourished americans moved to the west in huge numbers.
the louisiana purchase which resulted from negotiations with french emperor napolon bonaparte following french setbacks in haiti dramatically expanded the boundaries of the united states.
jeffersons lewis and clark expedition explored the new region and spurred interest in the far west.
in marbury v madison 1803 the federalist chief justice of the supreme court john marshall declared a federal act unconstitutional for the first time.
with that decision the court assumed the right of judicial review over acts of congress and established the constitutional supremacy of the federal government over state governments.
war in europe thomas jefferson sent warships to subdue the barbary pirates and negotiated with the spanish and french to ensure that the mississippi river remained open to american commerce.
renewal of war between britain and france in 1803 complicated matters for american commerce.
neither country wanted its enemy to purchase u s goods so both declared blockades.
in retaliation jefferson convinced congress to pass the embargo act which prohibited all foreign trade.
aftermath of the war of 1812 the treaty of ghent 1814 ended the war by essentially declaring it a draw.
a smashing american victory in january 1815 at the battle of new orleans helped to ensure that the treaty would be ratified and enforced.
the conflict established the economic independence of the united states as many goods previously purchased from britain were now manufactured at home.
during and after the war federalists and republicans seemed to exchange roles delegates from the waning federalist party met at the hartford convention 1815 to defend states rights and threaten secession while republicans now promoted nationalism and a broad interpretation of the constitution.

pa r t thre e an expanding nation during the nineteenth century the united states experienced a wrenching change from being a predominantly agrarian society to having a more diverse economy and urban society with factories and cities emerging alongside farms and towns.
the pace of life quickened with industrialization and the possibilities for better living conditions rose.
between 1790 and 1820 the nations boundaries expanded and its population both white and black soared while the number of native americans continued its long decline.
immigrants from ireland germany scandinavia and china thereafter poured into the united states seeking land jobs and freedom.
by the early 1820s the number of enslaved americans was more than two and a half times greater than in 1790 and the number of free blacks doubled.
the white population of the united states grew just as rapidly.
accompanying the emergence of an industrial e conomy in the northeast during the first half of the nineteenth century was the relentless expansion of the united states westward.
until the nineteenth century most of the american population was clustered near the seacoast and along rivers flowing into the atlantic ocean or the gulf of mexico.
that changed dramatically after 1800.
the great theme of nineteenth century american history was the migration of millions of people across the allegheny and appalachian mountains into the ohio valley and the middle west.
waves of adventurous americans then crossed the mississippi river and spread out across the great plains.
by the 1840s american settlers had reached the pacific ocean.
these developments the emergence of a market based economy the impact of industrial development and dramatic territorial expansion made the second quarter of the nineteenth century a time of restless optimism and rapid change.
as a german visitor noted ten years in america are like a century elsewhere americans in the early republic were nothing if not brash and s elf assured.
in 1845 an editorial in the united states journal claimed that we the american people are the most independent intelligent moral and happy people on the face of the earth the republic governed by highly educated natural aristocrats such as thomas jefferson james madison james monroe and john quincy adams gave way to the frontier democracy promoted by andrew jackson and henry clay.
americans began to demand government of by and for the people.
during the first half of the nineteenth century two very different s ocieties north and s outh grew increasingly competitive with one another.
the north 349 the more dynamic and faster growing region embraced industrial growth large cities foreign immigrants and the ideal of free labor as opposed to the system of slavery in the southern states.
the south remained rural agricultural and increasingly committed to enslaved labor as the backbone of its economy.
two great underlying fears worried southerners the threat of mass slave uprisings and the possibility that a n orthern controlled congress might one day abolish slavery.
the planter elites aggressive efforts to preserve and expand slavery stifled change and reform in the south and ignited a prolonged political controversy with the north that would eventually lead to civil war.

new inventions and industrial development would continue to invade and transform the rural landscape.
a mid the postwar celebrations in 1815 americans set about transforming their victorious young nation.
soon after the wars end prosperity returned as british and european markets again welcomed american ships and commerce.
during the war the loss of trade with britain and europe had forced the united states to develop more factories and mills of its own spurring the development of the more diverse economy that alexander hamilton had envisioned in the 1790s.
between 1815 and 1850 the united states also became a transcontinental power expanding all the way to the pacific coast.
hundreds of thousands of l and hungry people streamed westward toward the mississippi river and beyond.
in just six years following the end of the war in 1815 six states were added to the union alabama illinois indiana mississippi missouri and maine.
nineteenth century americans were a restless ambitious people seeking new ways to get ahead in life by using their ingenuity skill faith and tenacity.
the countrys energy and mobility was dizzying.
a boston newspaper commented that the whole american population is in motion everywhere it seemed people were moving to the next town the next farm the next opportunity.
in many cities half of the entire population moved every ten years.
in 1826 the newspaper editor in rochester new york reported that 120 people left rochester every day while 130 moved into the growing city.
frances trollope an english traveler said that americans were a busy bustling industrious population hacking and hewing their way westward in the pursuit of happiness.

352 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 first half of the nineteenth century.
this great wave of humanity was not always welcomed however.
ethnic prejudices anti catholicism and language barriers made it difficult for many new immigrants mostly from ireland germany and china to be assimilated into american culture.
in the midwest large scale commercial agriculture emerged as big farms grew corn wheat pigs and cattle to be sold in distant markets and across the atlantic.
in the south cotton became so profitable that it increasingly dominated the regions economy luring farmers and planters wealthy farmers with hundreds or even thousands of acres worked by large numbers of slaves into the new states of alabama mississippi louisiana and arkansas.
in both europe and the united states cotton cloth was the first great consumer product of industrial capitalism cotton from the american south provided most of the clothing for people around the world.
as the cotton economy expanded it required growing numbers of enslaved workers many of whom were sold by professional slave traders and relocated from virginia and the carolinas to the old southwest western georgia and the florida panhandle alabama mississippi and louisiana and arkansas.
meanwhile the northeast experienced a momentous surge of industrial development whose labor saving machines and water and s team powered industries reshaped the regions economic and social life.
mills and factories began to dot the landscape and transform the ways people labored dressed ate and lived.
with the rise of the factory system more and more economic activity in the northeastern states occurred outside the home and off the farm.
the transition from m other daughter power in the home to water and steam power in the mills and factories said a farmer was producing a complete revolution in social life and domestic manners an urban middle class began to emerge as americans left farms and moved to towns and cities drawn primarily by jobs in new mills factories stores and banks.
by 1850 the united states had become the worlds fastest growing commercial manufacturing agricultural and mining nation.
the industrial economy also generated changes in other areas from politics to the legal system from the family to social values.
these developments in turn helped expand prosperity and freedom for whites and free blacks.
they also sparked vigorous political debates over economic policies transportation improvements and the extension of slavery into the new territories.
in the process the nation began to divide into three powerful r egions north south and west whose shifting alliances and disputes would shape political life until the civil war.
the market revolution 353 the market revolution during the first half of the nineteenth century a market revolution that had begun before the war of independence accelerated the transformation of the american economy into a global powerhouse.
in the eighteenth century most americans were isolated farmers focused on a subsistence or household economy.
they produced just enough food livestock and clothing for their own familys needs and perhaps a little more to barter exchange with their neighbors.
their lives revolved around a regular farmstead routine in a d ay long cycle that started with the rooster crowing at dawn to the sleep of the chickens at night punctuated by the changing seasons and unpredictable weather.
as the nineteenth century unfolded however more and more farm families began engaging in commercial rather than subsistence agriculture producing surplus crops and livestock to sell for cash in distant regional and even international markets.
in 1851 the president of the new york agricultural society noted that until the nineteenth century production for consumption was the leading purpose of the farm economy.
now however no farmer could find it profitable to do everything for himself.
he now sells for money with the cash they earned farm families were able to buy more land better farm equipment and the latest manufactured household goods.
such farming for sale rather than for consumption often called a market based economy produced b oom and bust cycles and was often built upon the backs of slave laborers immigrant workers and displaced mexicans.
overall however the standard of living rose and americans experienced unprecedented opportunities for economic gain and geographic mobility.
the transition from a traditional household economy to a modern market economy involved massive changes in the way people lived worked traveled and voted.
what the market economy most needed in order to flourish was what were then called internal improvements deepened harbors lighthouses and a national network of canals bridges roads and r ailroads all designed to improve the flow of goods to markets by liberating people from the constraints of distance.
in 1817 for example south carolina congressman john c calhoun expressed his desire to bind the republic together with a perfect system of roads and canals as the worlds largest republic the united states desperately needed a national transportation system.
let us conquer space he told the house of representatives.
calhouns proposal sparked a fierce debate over how to fund the improvements should it be the responsibility of the federal government the individual 354 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 transportation west about 1840 canals miss i s s i p p pi ri ri iowa iowa territory territory ve ve r r chicago lake michigan miss i s s i pi lake michigan wisconsin wisconsin territory territory on hur ke la canalsroads roads navigable navigable rivers rivers michigan michigan detroit chicago detroit toledo la toledo is is o in o columbus ill indiana indiana illinois illinois oad road terre haute ve r frankfort io ri ri ve r frankfort oh missouri missouri r knoxville tennessee tennessee wwn64 wwn64 why were river towns important commercial centers.

states or private corporations.
since the constitution said nothing about the federal governments role in funding transportation improvements many argued that such projects must be initiated by state and local governments.
others argued that the constitution gave the federal government broad powers to promote the general welfare which included enhancing transportation and communication.
the fierce debate over how best to fund internal improvements would continue throughout the nineteenth century.

it took a stagecoach for example four days to go from new york city to boston.
because of long travel times many farm products could only be sold locally before they spoiled.
that soon changed as an array of i nnovations larger horse drawn wagons called conestogas new roads canals steamboats and railroads knit together the expanding national market for goods and services and greatly accelerated the pace of life.
as more settlers moved west people expressed a passion for improving roads in 1795 the wilderness road along the trail first blazed by daniel boone was opened to wagon and stagecoach traffic thereby easing the over the mountains route from north carolina into kentucky and tennessee.
356 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 in 1803 when ohio became a state congress had ordered that 5 percent of the money from land sales in the state would go toward building a national road from the atlantic coast across ohio and westward.
construction finally began in 1811.
originally called the cumberland road it was the first interstate roadway financed by the federal government.
by 1818 the road was open from cumberland maryland westward to wheeling virginia now west virginia where it crossed the ohio river.
by 1838 the national road extended 600 miles farther westward to vandalia illinois.
the national road quickened the settlement of the west and the emergence of a truly national market economy by reducing transportation costs opening up new markets and stimulating the growth of towns.
farmers increasingly took their produce and livestock to sell in distant markets.
but using federal money to finance internal improvements remained controversial.
to the northeast a movement for paved roads gathered momentum after the philadelphia lancaster turnpike was completed in 1794.
the term turnpike derives from a pole or pike at the tollgate which was turned to admit the traffic in exchange for a small fee or toll.
by 1821 some 4 000 miles of turnpikes had been built and stagecoach and freight companies emerged to move more people and cargo at lower rates.
as the quality of the roads improved stagecoaches increased their speed.
in addition stagecoach lines began using continual relays or stages of fresh horses every 40 miles or so.
this made travel faster less expensive and more accessible.
waterways by the early 1820s the turnpike boom was giving way to dramatic advances in water transportation.
steamboats flatboats barges driven by men using long poles and canal barges carried people and goods far more cheaply than did horse drawn wagons.
hundreds of flatboats floated goods farm produce livestock and people from tennessee kentucky indiana ohio western pennsylvania and other states down the ohio and mississippi rivers.
flatboats however went only in one direction downstream.
once unloaded in natchez mississippi or new orleans louisiana they were sold and dismantled to provide lumber for construction.
the difficulties of getting back upriver were solved when robert fulton and robert r livingston sent the clermont the first commercial steamboat up the hudson river from new york city in 1807.
thereafter the use of wood fi red steamboats spread rapidly opening nearly half the continent to water traffic along the major rivers.
by bringing t wo way travel to the mississippi valley which included the areas drained by the ohio and missouri rivers steamboats created a transcontinental market and a commercial agricultural empire that produced the market revolution 357 traveling the western waters steamboats at st paul minnesota in 1859 much of the nations cotton timber wheat corn cattle and hogs.
by 1836 there were 750 steamboats operating on american rivers.
as steamboat use increased the price for shipping goods plunged thus increasing profits and stimulating demand.
the use of steamboats transformed st louis missouri from a sleepy frontier village into a booming river port.
new orleans developed even faster.
by 1840 it was perhaps the wealthiest american city having developed a thriving trade with the caribbean islands and the new latin american republics that had overthrown spanish rule.
a thousand steamboats a year visited new orleans.
the annual amount of trade being shipped through the river city doubled that of new york city by 1843 in large part because of the explosion in cotton production.
the wood burning steamboats were crowded dirty and risky forms of transportation.
accidents explosions and fires were common and sanitation was poor.
passengers crowded on board along with pigs and cattle.
there were no toilets on steamboats until the 1850s and all passengers shared the same two washbasins and towels.
for all of the inconveniences however steamboats were the fastest and most convenient form of transportation in the first half of the nineteenth century.
canals also sped the market revolution.
the erie canal in central new york connected the great lakes and the midwest to the hudson river and new york city.
new york governor dewitt clinton former mayor of new york city and vice president under james madison took the lead in 358 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 romoting the risky engineering project which thomas jefferson dismissed as p little short of madness clinton however boasted that his state of new york had the opportunity to create a new era in history and to erect a work more stupendous more magnificent and more beneficial than has hitherto been achieved by the human race it was not an idle boast.
after the erie canal opened in 1825 having taken eight years to build it drew eastward much of the midwestern trade furs lumber textiles that earlier had been forced to go to canada or to make the long journey down the ohio and mississippi rivers to new orleans and the gulf of mexico.
thanks to the erie canal the backwoods village of chicago developed into a bustling city because of its commercial connection via the great lakes to new york city and eventually across the atlantic to europe.
the erie canal was a triumph of engineering audacity.
forty feet wide and four feet deep it was the longest canal in the world extending 363 miles across new york from albany in the east to buffalo and lake erie in the west and rising some 675 feet in elevation.
additional branches soon put most of the state within its reach.
the canal was built by tens of thousands of manual laborers mostly german and irish immigrants who were paid less than a dollar a day to drain the erie canal junction of the erie and northern canals 1830 32 by john hill.
the market revolution 359 swamps clear forests build stone bridges and aqueducts and blast through solid rock.
it brought a river of gold to new york city in the form of an unending stream of lumber grain flour and other goods from western new york and the midwest and it unlocked the floodgates of western settlement.
the canal also reduced the cost of moving a ton of freight from 100 to 5.
it was so profitable that it paid off its construction costs in just seven years.
the erie canal had enormous economic and political consequences as it tied together the regional economies of the midwest and the east while further isolating the deep south.
the genesee valley in western new york became one of the most productive g rain growing regions in the world and rochester became a boom town processing wheat and corn into flour and meal.
the writer nathaniel hawthorne said the town had sprung up like a mushroom syracuse albany and buffalo experienced similarly dramatic growth because of the erie canal.
the business of moving goods and people along the canal involved some 4 000 boats and over 25 000 workers.
canal boats slender and shallow usually eleven feet wide and seventy feet long were pulled by teams of horses or mules walking along a towpath.
the teams hauling the boats needed to be changed every ten to twelve miles.
painted in bright colors and given colorful names the packet boats carrying passengers traveled seven days a week at between two and four miles an hour.
much time was lost waiting at one of the e ighty eight locks where boats would enter one at a time to be raised or lowered to match the changing water level of the canal.
often the boat captains took their families with them.
most boatmen however were single and rough.
one traveler called them a coarse and untaught set of vagabonds whose chief delight is to carouse and fight the success of the erie and the entire new york canal system inspired other states to build some 3 000 miles of waterways by 1837 not all of which were successful.
by 1834 canals connected pittsburgh to philadelphia a distance of 395 miles.
canals boosted the economy by enabling speedier and less expensive transport of goods and people.
they also boosted real estate prices for the lands bordering the canals and transformed sleepy rural villages like rochester new york into booming cities.
railroads for a brief period canals were essential to the nations economic growth.
the canal era was short lived however.
during the second quarter of the nineteenth century a much less expensive but much more powerful efficient and versatile form of transportation emerged the railroad.
in 1825 the year the erie canal was completed the worlds first s team powered railway began operating in england.
soon thereafter a r ailroad building 360 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 epidemic infected the united states.
in 1830 the nation had only 23 miles of railroad track.
over the next twenty years railroad coverage grew to 30 626 miles.
the railroad was a truly transformational technology.
it surpassed other forms of transportation because of its speed carrying capacity and reliability.
railroads could move more people and freight faster farther and cheaper than wagons or boats.
the early trains averaged ten miles per hour more than twice the speed of stagecoaches and four times that of boats and barges.
that locomotives were able to operate year round gave rail travel a huge advantage over canals that froze in winter and dirt roads that became rivers of mud during rainstorms.
railroads also provided indirect benefits by encouraging new western settlement and the expansion of commercial agriculture.
the power of the railroad could be seen everywhere from rural areas to big cities.
a westerner reported that the opening of a new rail line resulted in three new villages emerging along the line while adding new life to the city the depot or rail station became the central building in every town a public place where people from all walks of life and places converged.
building railroads stimulated the national economy not only by improving transportation but also by creating a huge demand for iron wooden crossties bridges locomotives freight cars and other equipment.
railroads also became the nations largest corporations and employers.
perhaps most important railroads enabled towns and cities not served by canals or turnpikes to compete economically.
in other words the railroads eventually changed what had once been a cluster of mostly local markets near rivers and the coast into an interconnected national marketplace for goods and services.
railroads expanded the geography of american capitalism making possible larger industrial and commercial enterprises and shrinking distances for passengers.
but the railroad mania had negative effects as well.
its quick and shady profits frequently led to political corruption.
railroad titans often bribed legislators.
by facilitating access to the t rans appalachian west the railroads also accelerated the decline of native american culture.
in addition they dramatically quickened the tempo mobility and noise of everyday life.
writer nathaniel hawthorne spoke for many when he said that the locomotive with its startling whistle brought the noisy world into the midst of our slumberous space ocean transportation the year 1845 brought a great innovation in ocean transport with the launch of the first clipper ship the rainbow.
ineteenth century equivalent of built for speed the clipper ships were the n the market revolution 361 building a clipper ship this 1833 oil painting captures the messrs smith co ship yard in manhattan where shipbuilders are busy shaping timbers to construct a clipper ship.
the supersonic jetliner.
they were twice as fast as the older merchant ships.
long and lean with taller masts and larger sails than conventional ships they cut dashing figures during their brief but colorful career which lasted less than two decades.
the american thirst for chinese tea prompted the clipper boom.
asian tea leaves had to reach markets quickly after harvest and the fast clipper ships made this possible.
the discovery of gold in california in 1848 lured thousands of prospectors and entrepreneurs.
when the w ould be miners generated an urgent demand for goods on the west coast the clippers met it.
in 1854 the flying cloud took eighty nine days and eight hours to travel from new york to san francisco around south america less than half as long as the trip would have taken in a conventional ship.
but clippers while fast lacked ample space for cargo or passengers.
after the civil war the clippers would give way to the steamship.
communications innovations in transportation also helped spark improvements in communications which knit the nation even closer together.
at the beginning of the nineteenth century traveling any distance was slow and difficult.
it took d ays often weeks for news to travel along the atlantic seaboard.
for example after george washington died in 1798 in virginia word of his death did not appear in new york city newspapers until a week 362 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 the growth of railroads 1850 superio lake r canada me is si ss ip lake michigan m wi pi rive tario e on lak ny ma mi e eri ke la r ia vt nh ron hu ke la minnesota territory ri ct pa il in nj oh o ri ve r unorganized territory md de atlantic hi va o mo oce an ky nc tn ar sc al ms ga railroads in 1850 tx la fl what role didwwn64 railroads play in national development.

by 1829 however it was possible to deliver andrew jacksons inaugural address from washington d c to new york city by relay horse riders in less than twenty hours.
mail deliveries also improved.
the number of u s post offices soared from 75 in 1790 to 28 498 in 1860.
in addition new steam powered printing presses enabled the mass production of newspapers by reducing their cost from six cents to a penny each enabling virtually everyone to benefit from the news contained in the penny press but the most important advance in communications was the national electromagnetic telegraph system invented by samuel f b morse.
in may 1844 morse sent the first intercity telegraph message from washington d c to baltimore maryland.
it read what hath god wrought by the end of the decade most major cities were connected by telegraph lines that enabled people companies and governments to communicate faster and more reliably.
the electrical telegraph system also helped railroad operators schedule trains more precisely and thus avoid collisions.
a new orleans newspaper claimed that with the invention of the telegraph scarcely anything now will appear to be impossible the role of government steamboats canals and railroads connected the western areas of the country with the east boosted trade helped open the far west for settlement and spurred dramatic growth in cities.
between 1800 and 1860 an undeveloped nation of scattered farms primitive roads and modest local markets was transformed into an engine of capitalist expansion urban energy and global reach.
the transportation improvements were financed by both state governments and private investors.
the federal government helped too despite intense political debates over whether it was constitutional to use federal funds to finance such internal improvements the national government also bought stock in turnpike and canal companies and after the success of the erie canal awarded land grants to several western states to support canal and railroad projects.
in 1850 stephen a douglas a powerful democratic senator from illinois convinced congress to provide a major land grant to support a north south rail line connecting chicago and mobile alabama.
regarded at the time as a special case the 1850 congressional land grant set a precedent for other bounties that totaled about 20 million acres by 1860.
however this would prove to be a small amount when compared to the land grants that congress would award transcontinental railroads during the 1860s and after.
the national government also sent federal cavalry troops to pacify the indians along the route of the railroads.
industrial development 365 industrial development the concentration of huge numbers of people in commercial and factory cities coupled with the transportation and communication revolutions greatly increased the number of potential customers for given products.
such expanding market demand in turn gave rise to a system of mass production whereby companies used new technologies labor saving machines to produce greater quantities of products that could be sold at lower prices to more people thus generating higher profits.
the introduction of steam engines as well as the application of new technologies to make manufacturing more efficient sparked a wave of unrelenting industrialization in europe and america from the mid eighteenth century to the late nineteenth century.
mechanized factories mills and mines emerged to supplement the agricultural economy.
it is an extraordinary era in which we live reported daniel webster in 1847.
it is altogether new.
the world has seen nothing like it before new machines and improvements in agricultural and industrial efficiency led to a remarkable increase in productivity.
by 1860 one farmer miner or mill worker could produce twice as much wheat twice as much iron and more than four times as much cotton cloth as in 1800 american technology such improvements in productivity were enabled by the practical inventiveness of americans.
between 1790 and 1811 the u s patent office approved an annual average of 77 new patents certifying new inventions by the 1850s the patent office was approving more than 28 000 new inventions each year.
many of the industrial inventions generated dramatic changes.
in 1844 for example charles goodyear patented a process for vulcanizing rubber which made the product stronger more elastic waterproof and winter proof.
vulcanized rubber was soon being used for a variety of products from shoes and boots to seals gaskets hoses and eventually tires.
in 1846 elias howe patented his design of the sewing machine.
it was soon improved upon by isaac merritt singer who founded the singer sewing machine company which initially produced only industrial sewing machines for use in textile mills but eventually offered machines for home use.
the availability of sewing machines helped revolutionize womens work by dramatically reducing the time needed to make clothes at home thus freeing up more leisure time for many women.
technological advances improved living conditions houses could be larger better heated and better illuminated.
the first sewer systems helped clean up cities by ridding their streets of human and animal waste.
mechanization of 366 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 factories meant that more goods could be produced faster and with less labor and machines helped industries produce standardized parts that could be assembled by unskilled wage workers.
machine made clothes using standardized forms fit better and were less expensive than those sewn by hand machine made newspapers and magazines were more abundant and affordable as were clocks watches guns and plows.
the impact of the cotton gin in 1792 eli whitney a recent yale graduate from new england visited mulberry grove plantation on the georgia coast where he heard much said of the difficulty of ginning cotton that is separating the fibers from the seeds.
cotton had been used for clothing and bedding from ancient times but until the nineteenth century cotton cloth was rare and expensive because it took so long to separate the lint fibers from tenacious cotton seeds.
one person working all day could separate barely one pound by hand.
at mulberry grove eli whitney learned that the person who could invent a machine to gin cotton would become wealthy overnight.
within a few days he had devised a simple mechanism he called it an absurdly simple contrivance using nails attached to a roller to remove the seeds from cotton bolls.
the cotton gin short for engine proved to be fifty times more productive than a hand whitneys cotton gin eli whitneys laborer.
almost overnight it made drawing which accompanied his 1794 the white fiber americas most profitfederal patent application shows the able cash crop.

politics and international trade.
king cotton during the first half of the nineteenth century s outhern g rown cotton became the dominant force driving both the national economy and the controversial efforts to expand slavery into the western territories.
cotton was called white gold it brought enormous wealth to southern p lanters industrial development 367 and merchants as well as new england textile mill owners and new york shipowners.
by 1812 because of the widespread use of cotton gins the cost of producing cotton yarn had plunged by 90 percent and the spread of textile mills in britain and europe had created a rapidly growing global market for southern cotton.
by the m id nineteenth century people worldwide were wearing m ore comfortable and easier to clean cotton clothing.
when british textile manufacturers chose the less brittle american cotton over the varieties grown in the caribbean brazil and india the demand for southern cotton skyrocketed as did its price.
cotton became americas largest export and the primary driver of the nations extraordinary economic growth during the first half of the nineteenth century.
by 1860 british textile mills were processing a billion pounds of cotton a year 92 percent of which came from the american south.
cotton growing first engulfed the piedmont region of the carolinas and georgia.
after the war of 1812 it migrated into the contested indian lands to the west tennessee alabama florida mississippi louisiana arkansas and texas.
new orleans became a bustling p ort and active slave market because of the cotton grown throughout the region and shipped down the mississippi river.
from the mid 1830s to 1860 cotton accounted for more than half of american exports.
planter capitalists in the south harvested raw cotton and northern buyers and shipowners carried it to new england great britain and france where textile mills spun the fiber into thread and fabric.
bankers in new york city and london financed the growth of global cotton capitalism.
the expansion of slavery because cotton is a labor intensive crop growers were convinced that only slaves could make their farms and plantations profitable.
as a result the price of slaves soared with the price of cotton.
when farmland in maryland and virginia lost its fertility after years of relentless tobacco planting many whites shifted to growing corn and wheat since the climate in maryland and virginia was too cold for cotton.
many virginia and maryland planters sold their surplus slaves to work in the new c otton growing areas in georgia alabama mississippi and louisiana.
between 1790 and 1860 some 835 000 slaves were sold south in 1790 planters in virginia and maryland had owned 56 percent of all the slaves in the united states by 1860 they owned only 15 percent.
cotton created boom times in the new region called the old southwest southwest georgia alabama mississippi and the panhandle of florida.
a cotton farmer in mississippi urged a friend in kentucky to sell his farm and join him if you could reconcile it to yourself to bring your negroes to the mississippi territory they would certainly make you a handsome fortune in 368 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 ten years by the cultivation of cotton slaves became so valuable that stealing slaves became a common problem in the southern states especially alabama and mississippi.
farming the midwest by 1860 more than half the nations population lived west of the appalachian mountains.
the flat fertile farmlands in the m idwest ohio michigan indiana illinois and i owa drew farmers from the rocky hillsides of new england and the exhausted soils of virginia.
by 1860 30 to 40 percent of americans born in new england had moved west first to upstate new york and then to ohio and the midwest.
people traveled on foot on horseback and in jarring wagons all in an effort to make a fresh start on their own land made available by the government.
the process of settling new lands followed the old pattern of clearing underbrush and felling trees burning the debris grubbing out the roots by hand and using horses and oxen to dislodge stumps removing rocks and boulders and then plowing and planting fields.
corn was typically the first crop grown.
women and children often planted the seeds in small mounds about three feet apart.
once the corn sprouted pumpkin squash or bean seeds would be planted around the seedlings.
the strong corn stalk provided a pole for the bean vines to climb the beans and squash or pumpkins added prized nitrogen to the soil and the squash and pumpkin plants grew and spread over the ground smothering weeds around the corn stalks.
once the corn was harvested the kernels could be boiled to make porridge or ground up to make flour and cornmeal that was baked into a bread called johnnycake.
corn stalks were stored to provide winter feed for the cattle and hogs.
over time technological advances led to greater agricultural productivity.
the development of durable iron plows replacing wooden ones eased the backbreaking job of tilling the soil.
in 1819 jethro wood of new york introduced an iron plow with separate parts that were easily replaced when needed.
further improvements would follow including vermonter john deeres steel plow 1837 whose sharp edges could cut through the tough prairie grass in the midwest and the great plains.
by 1845 massachusetts alone had s eventy three plants making more than 60 000 plows per year.
most were sold to farmers in the western states and territories illustrating the emergence of a national marketplace for goods and services made possible by the transportation revolution.
other technological improvements quickened the growth of commercial agriculture.
by the 1840s new mechanical seeders had replaced the process of sowing seed by hand.
even more important in 1831 twenty two year old industrial development 369 mccormicks reaping machine this illustration appeared in the catalog of the great exhibition held at the crystal palace in london in 1851.
the steel plow eased the transformation of the tough grass on the plains and prairies into fertile farmland and the reaping machine greatly accelerated farm production.
irginian cyrus hall mccormick invented a mechanical reaper to harvest v wheat a development as significant to the agricultural economy of the midwest old northwest and great plains as the cotton gin was to the south.
in 1847 the mccormick reapers began selling so fast that he moved to chicago and built a manufacturing plant.
within a few years mccormick had sold thousands of the giant farm machines transforming the scale of commercial agriculture.
using a handheld sickle a farmer could harvest a half acre of wheat a day with a mccormick reaper two people could work twelve acres a day.
early textile manufacturers while technological breakthroughs such as the cotton gin mechanical harvester and railroads quickened agricultural development and created a national and international marketplace other advances altered the economic landscape even more profoundly by giving rise to the factory system.
industrial capitalists who financed and built the first factories were the revolutionaries of the nineteenth century.
mills and factories were initially powered by water wheels then coal fired steam engines.
the shift from water power to coal as a source of energy is what enabled the dramatic growth of the textile industry and industries of all types initiating a w orld wide industrial era destined to end britains domination of the world economy.
in the eighteenth century great britain enjoyed a long head start in industrial production.
the foundations of britains advantage were the invention of the steam engine in 1705 its improvement by james watt in 1765 and a series of additional inventions that mechanized the production of textiles thread 370 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 fabric bedding and clothing.
britain carefully guarded its h ard won industrial secrets forbidding the export of machines or the publication of descriptions of them even restricting the emigration of skilled mechanics.
but the secrets could not be kept forever.
in 1789 samuel slater arrived in america from england with a detailed plan in his head of a water powered spinning machine.
he contracted with an enterprising merchant manufacturer in rhode island to build a mill in pawtucket rhode island and in that little mill completed in 1790 nine children turned out a satisfactory cotton yarn which was then worked up by the putting out system whereby women would weave the yarn into cloth in their homes.
in 1800 the output of americas mills and factories amounted to only one sixth of great britains production and the growth rate was slow and faltering until thomas jeffersons embargo in 1807 stimulated the domestic production of cloth.
by 1815 hundreds of textile mills in new england new york and pennsylvania were producing thread cloth and clothing.
by 1860 the output of americas factories would be a third and by 1880 t wo thirds that of british industry.
after the war of 1812 however british textile companies blunted americas industrial growth by flooding the united states with cheap cotton cloth in an effort to regain their customers who had been shut off by the war.
such postwar dumping nearly killed the infant american textile industry.
a d elegation new england factory village ca.
1844 mills and factories gradually transformed the new england landscape in the early nineteenth century as seen here in the massachusetts villages of salisbury and amesbury.
industrial development 371 of new england mill owners traveled to washington d c to demand a federal tariff tax on imported british cloth to make american textile mills more competitive.
the efforts of the mill owners to gain political assistance created a culture of industrial lobbying for congressional tariff protection against imported products that continues to this day.
what the mill owners neglected to admit was that import tariffs hurt consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices.
over time as scotsman adam smith explained in his classic book on capitalism the wealth of nations 1776 consumers not only pay higher prices for foreign goods as a result of tariffs but they also pay higher prices for domestic goods since businesses invariably seize opportunities to raise the prices charged for their products.
tariffs helped protect american industries from foreign competition but competition is the engine of innovation and efficiency in a capitalist economy.
new england shipping companies opposed higher tariffs because they would reduce the amount of goods being carried in their vessels across the atlantic from britain and europe.
many southern planters opposed tariffs because of fears that britain and france would retaliate by imposing tariffs on american cotton and tobacco shipped to their ports.
in the end the new england mill owners won the tariff war.
congress passed the tariff bill of 1816 which placed a tax of twenty five cents on every yard of imported cloth.
such tariffs were a major factor in promoting industrialization.
by impeding foreign competition they enabled american manufacturers to dominate the national marketplace.
the union manufactories of maryland in patapsco falls baltimore county ca.

the union manufactories would eventually employ more than 600 people.
372 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 the lowell system the factory system centered on wage earning workers sprang f ull blown upon the american scene at waltham massachusetts in 1813 when a group known as the boston associates constructed the first textile mill in which the mechanized processes of spinning yarn and weaving cloth were brought together under one roof.
in 1822 the boston associates led by francis cabot lowell developed another cotton mill at a village along the merrimack river twenty eight miles north of boston which they renamed lowell.
it soon became the model for textile mill towns throughout new england.
the founders of the lowell system sought not just to improve industrial efficiency through the use of l abor saving machinery but to develop model industrial communities designed to increase efficiency and profitability.
they located their four and five story brick built mills along rivers in the countryside.
women were the first factory workers in the nation as the mill owners at waltham and lowell hired mostly young women aged fifteen to thirty from farm families.
the owners preferred women because of their skill in operating textile machines and their willingness to endure the mind numbing boredom of operating spinning machines and looms for wages lower than those paid to men even though their wages 2 50 per week were the highest in the world for women.
moreover by the 1820s new england had a surplus of women because so many men had migrated westward.
in the early 1820s a steady stream of single women began flocking toward lowell.
to reassure worried parents mill owners promised to provide the lowell girls with tolerable work prepared meals comfortable boardinghouses four girls to a room moral discipline and educational and cultural opportunities.
initially the lowell idea worked pretty much according to plan.
visimill girls massachusetts mill workers tors commented on the well designed of the mid nineteenth century red brick mills with their lecture halls photographed holding shuttles used in and libraries.
the lowell girls appeared spinning thread and yarn.
healthy and happy living in cramped industrial development 373 dormitories staffed by housemothers who enforced church attendance and evening curfews.
despite thirteen hour work days and five and a half day workweeks longer hours than those imposed upon prison inmates some of the women found the time and energy to form study groups publish a literary magazine and attend lectures.
by 1840 there were thirty two mills and factories in lowell.
as lowell rapidly grew however the industrial village lost much of its innocence and cohesion as the mill owners accumulated unbelievable profits the once rural village had become a grimy industrial city.
mill owners produced too much cloth which depressed prices.

industrialization cities and the environment the rapid growth of commerce and industry drove the expansion of cities and mill villages.
lowells population in 1820 was 200.
by 1830 it was 6 500 and ten years later it had soared to 21 000.
other factory centers sprouted up across new england displacing forests farms and villages while filling the air with smoke noise and stench.
in addition the profusion of d ams built to harness water to turn the mill wheels flooded pastures and decimated fish populations spawned rapid urban growth that polluted the rivers and aroused intense local resentment.
376 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 broadway and canal street new york city 1836 new yorks economy and industry like those of many other cities grew rapidly in the early nineteenth century.
in 1859 farmers far upstream of the big massachusetts textile factories tried to destroy a massive dam in lake village new hampshire but their axes and crowbars caused little damage.
by then the process of industrialization could not be stopped.
the textile mill system was not only transforming lives and property it was reshaping nature as well.
between 1820 and 1840 the number of americans engaged in manufacturing increased 800 percent and the number of city dwellers more than doubled.
as thomas jefferson and other agrarians feared the united states was rapidly becoming a global industrial power producing its own clothing and shoes iron and engines.
between 1790 and 1860 the proportion of urban to rural populations grew from 3 percent to 16 percent.
because of their strategic locations along rivers flowing into the ocean the atlantic seaports of new york city philadelphia baltimore and boston remained the largest cities.
new orleans became the nations fi fth largest city because of its role in shipping goods that were floated down the mississippi river for shipment to the east coast and to europe.
new york eventually outpaced all its competitors in growth.
by 1860 it was the first city to surpass a population of 1 million largely because of its superior harbor and its unique access to commerce along the erie canal and the atlantic ocean.
popular culture 377 popular culture during the colonial era working class americans had little time for play or amusement.
most adults worked from dawn to dusk six days a week.
in rural areas free time was often spent in communal activities such as barn raisings and c orn husking parties shooting matches and footraces while residents of the seacoast sailed and fished.
in colonial cities people attended dances went on sleigh rides and picnics and played parlor games at home such as billiards cards and chess.
by the early nineteenth century however a more urban society enjoyed more diverse forms of recreation.
as people moved to cities they developed a distinctive urban culture and laborers and shopkeepers sought new forms of leisure and entertainment as pleasant diversions from their long workdays.
urban recreation social drinking was pervasive during the first half of the nineteenth century.
in 1829 the secretary of war estimated that three quarters of the nations laborers drank at least four ounces of hard liquor daily.
taverns and social or sporting clubs in the burgeoning cities served as the center of recreation and leisure.
so called blood sports were also a popular form of amusement especially among the working poor.
for a time cockfighting and dogfighting at saloons attracted excited crowds and frenzied betting but prizefighting boxing eventually displaced the animal contests.
imported from britain bare knuckles blood sports emerged as popular urban entertainment for men of all social classes but especially among the working poor.
378 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 boxing proved popular with all social classes.
the early contestants tended to be irish or english immigrants often sponsored by a neighborhood fire company fraternal association or street gang.
in the antebellum era boxers fought with bare knuckles and the results were brutal.
a match ended only when a contestant could not continue.
a bout in 1842 lasted 119 rounds and ended when a fighter died in his corner.
such deaths prompted several cities to outlaw the practice only to see it reappear as an underground activity.
the performing arts theaters became the most popular form of indoor entertainment.
people from all walks of life flocked to opera houses playhouses and music halls to watch a wide spectrum of performances shakespeares tragedies blood and thunder melodramas comedies minstrel shows operas performances by acrobatic troupes and local pageants.
audiences were predominantly men.
respectable women rarely attended the prevailing cult of domesticity kept women in the home.
raucous audiences cheered the heroes and heroines and hissed at the villains.
if an actor did not meet expectations spectators hurled curses nuts eggs fruit shoes or chairs.
the 1830s witnessed the emergence of the first uniquely american form of mass entertainment blackface minstrel shows featuring white performers made up as blacks.
minstrelsy drew upon african american folklore and reinforced prevailing racial stereotypes.
it featured banjo and fiddle music shuffle dances and lowbrow humor.
between the 1830s and the 1870s minstrel shows were immensely popular especially among northern working class ethnic groups and southern whites.
the most popular minstrel songs were written by a young white composer named stephen foster.
in 1846 he composed oh.
susanna which the crow quadrilles this sheet music cover printed in 1837 shows vignettes caricaturing african americans.
minstrel shows enjoyed nationwide popularity while reinforcing racial stereotypes.
immigration 379 i mmediately became a national favorite.
its popularity catapulted foster into the national limelight and he responded with equally well received tunes such as old folks at home popularly known as way down upon the swanee river massas in de cold cold ground my old kentucky home and old black joe all of which perpetuated the sentimental myth of contented slaves.
immigration more than ever before the united states during the nineteenth century continued to be a nation of immigrants.
warfare in europe at the start of the century restricted travel to america.
after 1815 however when napolon was finally defeated and forced into exile new u s territories and states in the west actively recruited immigrants from europe often offering special incentives such as voting rights after only six months residency.
why did people risk their lives and abandon their homelands to come to the united states.
america offered jobs higher wages lower taxes cheap and fertile land no entrenched aristocracy religious freedom and voting rights.
after 1837 a worldwide financial panic and economic slump accelerated the pace of immigration to the united states.
american employers aggressively recruited foreigners in large part because they were often willing to work for lower wages than native born americans.
the chicago daily tribute observed that the tide of german immigrants was perfect for the cheap and ingenious labor of the country a german laborer was willing to live as cheaply and work infinitely more intelligently than the negro the years from 1845 to 1854 marked the greatest proportional influx of immigrants in u s history 2 4 million or about 14 5 percent of the total population in 1845.
by far the largest number of immigrants between 1840 and 1860 came from ireland and germany.
the irish no nation proportionately sent more of its people to america than ireland.
a prolonged agricultural crisis that brought immense social hardships caused many irish to flee their homeland in the mid nineteenth century.
irish farmers primarily grew potatoes in fact fully a third of them were dependent on the potato harvest for survival.
the average adult male in ireland ate five pounds of potatoes a day.
in 1845 a fungus destroyed the potato crop and triggered what came to be called the irish potato famine.
more than a million people died and almost 2 million more left ireland a country whose total population was only 8 million.
most traveled to canada and the united states.

a free black frustrated by the irish insurgents voiced a criticism of immigrants that is still being made in the twenty first century.
the irish he said were crowding themselves into every place of business and labor and driving the poor colored american citizen out enterprising irish immigrants did forge remarkable careers in america however.

by the start of the civil war the irish in america had energized trade unions become the most important ethnic group supporting the democratic party and made the roman catholic church the nations largest religious denomination.
years of persecution had instilled in irish catholics a fierce loyalty to the church as the supreme authority over all the affairs of the world such passion for catholicism generated unity among irish americans and fear among american protestants.
the irish loved to stick together.
most of them settled in irish neighborhoods in the nations largest cities and formed powerful local democratic political organizations such as tammany hall in new york city that would dominate political life during the second half of the nineteenth century.
the germans german immigrants were almost as numerous as the irish.
unlike the irish newcomers however the german arrivals included a large number of skilled craftsmen and w ell educated professional p eople doctors lawyers teachers engineers some of whom were refugees from the failed german revolution of 1848.
immigration 383 german beer garden new york 1825 german immigrants established their own communities where they maintained the traditions of their homeland.
in addition to an array of political opinions the germans brought with them a variety of religious preferences.
most were protestants usually lutherans a third were roman catholics and a significant number were jews.
among the german immigrants who prospered in the new world were heinrich steinweg a piano maker who in america changed his name to steinway and became famous for the quality of his instruments and levi strauss a jewish tailor who followed the gold rush to california and began making work pants later dubbed levis germans settled more often in rural areas than in cities.
many were independent farmers skilled workers and shopkeepers who were able to establish themselves immediately.
more so than the irish they migrated in families and groups.
this clannish quality helped them better sustain elements of their language and culture in the united states.
more of them also tended to return to their native country.
about 14 percent of the germans eventually went back to their homeland compared with just 9 percent of the irish.
the british scandinavians and chinese immigrants from great britain and canada continued to arrive in large numbers during the first half of the nineteenth century.
they included professionals independent farmers and skilled workers.
two other large groups of immigrants were from scandinavia and china.
norwegians and swedes mostly farmworkers gravitated to illinois wisconsin and the minnesota territory where the cold climate and dense forests reminded them of home.
by the 1850s the rapid development of california was attracting a growing number of chinese 384 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 who like the irish in the east did the heavy work of construction especially on railroad tracks and bridges.
nativism not all americans welcomed the flood of immigrants.
a growing number of nativists people born in the united states who resented the newcomers sought to restrict or stop immigration altogether.
the flood of irish and german catholics especially aroused hostility among protestants.
a boston minister described catholicism as the ally of tyranny the opponent of material prosperity the foe of thrift the enemy of the railroad the caucus and the school nativists eventually launched organized political efforts to stop the tide of immigrants.
the order of the star spangled banner founded in new york city in 1849 grew into a powerful political group known as the american party.
members pledged never to vote for any f oreign born or catholic candidates.
when asked about the secretive organization they were told to say i know nothing a phrase which gave rise to the informal name for the party the know nothings.
for a while the k now nothings appeared to be on the brink of m ajor party status especially during the 1850s when the number of immigrants was five times as large as it had been during the 1840s.

forty percent of the pennsylvania state legislators were k now nothings.
the know nothings demanded that immigrants and roman catholics be excluded from public office and that the waiting period for naturalization earning citizenship be extended from five to twenty one years.
the party however was never strong enough to enact such legislation.
nor did congress restrict immigration during that period.
for a while the k now nothings threatened to control new england new york and maryland but the anti catholic movement subsided when slavery became the focal issue of the 1850s.
organized labor and new professions while most americans continued to work as farmers during the nineteenth century a growing number found employment in new or expanding enterprises textile mills shoe factories banks railroads publishing retail stores teaching preaching medicine law construction and engineering.
technological innovations steam power power tools and new modes of transportation and their social applications mass communication turnpikes the postal service banks and corporations fostered an array of new industries and businesses that transformed the nature of work for many americans both men and women.
early unions in 1800 only 12 percent of americans worked for wages by 1860 wage earners had grown to 40 percent of the nations workforce.
proud apprentices journeymen and master craftsmen who controlled their labor and invested their work with an emphasis on quality rather than quantity resented the spread of mills and factories populated by half trained workers dependent upon an hourly wage and subject to the sharp fluctuations of the larger economy.
the rapid growth of wage workers often came at the expense of skilled s elf employed artisans and craftsmen who owned their own small shops where they made or repaired carriages shoes hats saddles silverware jewelry glass ropes furniture boats and a broad array of other products.
other skilled craftsmen were blacksmiths printers or barrel makers.
throughout the first half of the nineteenth century the number of s elf employed master craftsmen steadily declined as the number of factories and mills increased.
artisans who emphasized quality and craftsmanship in their c ustom made products found it increasingly hard to compete with the low prices for similar products made in much larger numbers in the factories and mass production workshops.
386 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 the production of shoes for example was transformed by the shift to mass production.
until the nineteenth century boots and shoes were made by hand by shoemakers for local customers.
working in their own home or small shop shoemakers might also employ one or two journeymen assistants as well as an apprentice a young man learning the skilled trade.
that changed during the early nineteenth century as the number and size of shoe shops increased in new england largely driven by the demand for inexpensive shoes many of which were shipped south for the rapidly growing slave population.
shoe shops were displaced by shoe factories and the master shoemaker became a manager rather than an artisan.
instead of creating a shoe from start to finish workers were given specific tasks such as cutting the leather or stitching the uppers onto the soles.
the skilled workers forced to make the transition to mass production and a strict division of labor often resented the change.
a massachusetts shoe worker complained that the factory owners were little stuck up s elf conceited individuals who forced workers to follow their orders or be fired.
in 1850 the board of health in lynn massachusetts reported that the life expectancy of a shoe worker was almost twenty years shorter than a farmer.
the shoe factory when philadelphia shoemakers went on strike in 1806 a court found them guilty of a conspiracy to raise wages here shoemakers work at a massachusetts shoe factory.
organized labor and new professions 387 the growing fear among artisans that they were losing status led many of them to become involved in politics and unions.
philadelphia furniture craftsmen for example called for a union to protect their mutual independence at first these workers organized into interest groups representing their individual skills or trades.
during the early nineteenth century a growing fear that they were losing status led artisans in the major cities to become involved in politics and unions.
philadelphia furniture craftsmen for example called for their peers to form a union to protect their mutual independence at first these workers organized themselves into interest groups representing their individual skills or trades.
such trade associations were the first type of labor unions.
they pressured politicians for tariffs to protect their industries from foreign imports provided insurance benefits and drafted regulations to improve working conditions.
in addition they sought to control the number of tradesmen in their profession so as to maintain wage levels.
early labor unions faced major legal obstacles in fact they were prosecuted as unlawful conspiracies.
in 1806 for instance philadelphia shoemakers were found guilty of conspiring to raise their wages the courts decision broke the union.
in 1842 though the massachusetts supreme judicial court issued a landmark ruling in commonwealth v hunt declaring that forming a trade union was not in itself illegal nor was a demand that employers hire only members of the union.
the court also said that union workers could strike if an employer hired laborers who refused to join the union.
until the 1820s labor organizations took the form of local trade unions each confined to one city and one craft or skill.
from 1827 to 1837 however organization on a larger scale began to take hold.
in 1834 the national trades union was formed to organize local trade unions into a stronger national association.
at the same time shoemakers printers carpenters and weavers established national craft unions representing their particular skills.
women also formed trade unions.
sarah monroe who helped organize the new york tailoresses society explained that it was intended to defend our rights if it was unfashionable for men to bear workplace oppression in silence why should it not also become unfashionable with the women in 1831 the women tailors went out on symbols of organized labor strike demanding a just price for labor a pocket watch with an international skilled workers also formed political organi typographical union insignia.
zations to represent their interests.
a new york 388 chapter 8 the emergence of a market economy 1815 1850 newspaper reported that people across the nation were organizing workingmens political parties to protect those principles of liberty and equality unfolded in the declaration of our independence workingmens parties called for laws to regulate banks and abolish the common practice of imprisoning people who could not pay their debts.
the rise of the professions the dramatic social changes opened up an array of new professions.
bustling new towns required new services retail stores printing shops post offices newspapers schools banks law firms medical practices.
by definition professional workers have specialized knowledge and training.
in 1849 henry day delivered a lecture titled the professions at the western reserve school of medicine.
he declared that the most important social functions in modern life were the professional skills and claimed that society had become utterly dependent upon professional services teaching teaching was one of the f astest growing professions in the first half of the nineteenth century.
horace mann of massachusetts was instrumental in promoting the idea of free public education as the best way to transform children into disciplined judicious citizens.
many states especially in the north agreed and the number of schools exploded.
new schools required teachers and mann helped create normal schools around the nation to train future teachers.
public schools initially preferred men as teachers usually hiring them at age seventeen or eighteen.
the pay was so low that few stayed in the profession their entire career but for many educated restless young adults teaching offered independence and social status as well as an alternative to the rural isolation of farming.
church groups and civic leaders started private academies or seminaries for girls.
law medicine and engineering teaching was a common s tepping stone for men who became lawyers.
in the decades after the american revolution young men would teach for a year or two before joining an experienced attorney as an apprentice what today would be called an intern.
they would learn the practice of law in exchange for their labors.
there were no law schools yet.
like attorneys physicians in the early nineteenth century often had little formal academic training.
healers of every stripe assumed the title of doctor and established medical practices.
most were self taught or had learned their profession by assisting a physician for several years occasionally supplementing their internships with a few classes at the handful of medical schools.
by organized labor and new professions 389 1860 there were 60 000 self styled physicians many of whom were quacks or frauds.
as a result the medical profession lost the publics confidence until the emergence of formal medical schools.
the industrial expansion of the united states also spurred the profession of engineering a field that would eventually become the nations largest professional occupation for men.
specialized expertise was required for the building of canals and railroads the development of machine tools and steam engines and the construction of roads bridges and factories.
womens work meanwhile most women still worked primarily in the home or on a farm.
the only professions readily available to them were nursing often midwifery the delivery of babies and teaching.
many middle class women spent their time outside the home doing religious and s ocial service work.
then as now women were the backbone of most churches.
a few women however courageously pursued careers in m ale dominated professions.
elizabeth blackwell of ohio managed to gain admission to geneva medical college now hobart and william smith college in western new york despite the disapproval of the faculty.
when she arrived at her first class a hush fell upon the students as if each member had been struck with paralysis blackwell had the last laugh when she finished first in her class in 1849 but thereafter the medical school refused to admit more women.
the first american woman to earn a medical degree blackwell went on to start the new york infirmary for women and children and later had a long career as a professor of gynecology at the london school of medicine for women.
equal opportunities the dynamic market based economy that emerged during the first half of the nineteenth century helped spread the idea that individuals should have an equal opportunity to better themselves through their abilities and hard work.
equality of opportunity however did not assume equal outcomes.
americans wanted an equal chance to earn unequal amounts of wealth.
in america observed a journalist in 1844 one has as good a chance as another according to his talents prudence and personal exertions the same ideals that prompted so many white immigrants to come to the united states however were equally appealing to african americans and women.
by the 1830s they too began to demand their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness such desires among common people would quickly spill over into the political arena.
the great theme of american political life in the first half of the nineteenth century would be the continuing democratization of opportunities for white men regardless of income or background to vote and hold office.
chapter review summary transportation and communication revolutions canals and other improvements in transportation such as the steamboat allowed goods to reach markets more quickly and cheaply and transformed the more isolated household economy of the eighteenth century into a market based economy in which people bought and sold goods for profit in sometimes distant markets.
clipper ships shortened the amount of time to transport goods across the oceans.
the railroads which expanded rapidly during the 1850s and the telegraph system diminished the isolation of the west and united the country economically and socially.
the erie canal contributed to new york citys emerging status as the nations economic center even as it promoted the growth of chicago and other midwestern cities.
improvements in transportation and communication linked rural communities to a worldwide marketplace.
industrialization inventions in machine tools and technology as well as innovations in business organization spurred a wave of industrialization during the nineteenth century.
the cotton gin dramatically increased cotton production and a rapidly spreading cotton culture boomed in the south with a resultant increase in slavery.
other inventions such as john deeres steel plow and the mechanized mccormick reaper helped americans especially westerners farm more efficiently and more profitably.
in the north mills and factories powered first by water and eventually by coal fired steam engines spread rapidly.
mills initially produced textiles for clothing and bedding from southern cotton as well as iron shoes and other products.
the federal governments tariff policy encouraged the growth of domestic manufacturing especially cotton textiles by reducing imports of british cloth.
between 1820 and 1840 the number of americans engaged in manufacturing increased 800 percent.
many mill workers such as the women employed in the lowell system of new england textile factory communities worked long hours for low wages in unhealthy conditions.
industrialization along with increased commerce helped spur the growth of cities.
by 1860 16 percent of the population lived in an urban area.
immigration the promise of cheap land and good wages drew millions of immigrants to america.
by 1844 about 14 5 percent of the population was foreign born.
the devastating potato famine led to an influx of destitute irish catholic families.
by the 1850s they represented a significant portion of the urban population in the united states constituting a majority in new york and boston german migrants many of them catholics and jews migrated during this same time.
not all n ative born americans welcomed the immigrants.
nativists became a powerful political force in the 1850s with the know nothing party nearly achieving major party status with its message of excluding immigrants and catholics from the nations political community.
workers professionals and women skilled workers artisans formed trade associations to protect their members and to lobby for their interests.
as i ndustrialization spread some workers expanded these organizations nationally forming the national trades union.
the growth of the market economy also expanded opportunities for those with formal education to serve in new or expanding professions.
the number of physicians teachers engineers and lawyers grew rapidly.
by the mid nineteenth century women african americans and immigrants began to agitate for equal social economic and political opportunities.

many townspeople watched from their windows and balconies while the spectators below could also enjoy the foods of various street vendors such as the african american oyster peddler bottom left.
this watercolor by john lewis krimmel captures the vibrant nationalism that emerged in america after the war of 1812.
a fter the war of 1812 the british stopped interfering with american shipping.
the united states could now develop new industries and exploit new markets around the globe.
it was not simply alexander hamiltons financial initiatives and the capitalistic energies of wealthy investors and entrepreneurs that sparked americas dramatic economic growth in the early nineteenth century.
prosperity also resulted from the efforts of ordinary men and women who were willing to take risks uproot families use unstable paper money issued by unregulated local banks and tinker with new machines tools and inventions.
by 1828 the young agrarian republic was poised to become a sprawling commercial nation connected by networks of roads and canals as well as regional economic relationships all enlivened by a restless spirit of enterprise experimentation and expansion.
for all of the energy and optimism exhibited by americans after the war however the fundamental tension between nationalism and sectionalism remained how to balance the national interest with the particular economic and social needs of the nations three growing regions north south and west.
americans who identified themselves as nationalists promoted the interests of the country as a whole.

what was their impact.
what developments enabled andrew jackson to become president.
how did he influence national politics in the 1820s.
394 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 transportation improvements in the west.
of all the issues dividing the young republic the passions aroused by the expansion of slavery proved to be the most difficult to resolve.
a new nationalism after the war of 1812 americans experienced a wave of patriotic excitement.
they had won their independence from britain for a second time and a postwar surge of prosperity fed a widespread sense of optimism.
postwar nationalism in his first message to congress in late 1815 president james madison revealed how much the challenges of the war especially the weaknesses of the armed forces and federal financing had changed his attitudes toward the role of the federal government.
now madison and other leading southern republicans such as south carolinas john c calhoun acted like nationalists rather than states rights sectionalists.
they abandoned many of thomas jeffersons presidential initiatives for example his efforts to reduce the armed forces and his opposition to the national bank in favor of the economic nationalism developed by federalists alexander hamilton and george washington.
madison now supported a larger army and navy a new national bank and tariffs to protect american manufacturers from foreign competition.
the republicans have out federalized federalism one new englander commented after madisons speech.
the bank of the united states after president madison and congressional republicans allowed the charter for the first bank of the united states to expire in 1811 the nations finances fell into a muddle.
states began chartering new local banks with little or no regulation and their banknotes paper money flooded the economy with different currencies of uncertain value.
imagine trying to do business on a national basis when each state chartered bank had its own currency which often was not accepted by other banks or in other states.
in response to the growing financial turmoil madison urged congress to establish the second bank of the united states b u s.
was intended primarily to support a stable national currency that would promote economic growth.
with the help of powerful congressmen henry clay and john c calhoun congress created the new b u s.
in 1816 which like its predecessor was based in philadelphia and was chartered for twenty years.
in return for issuing national currency and opening branches in every state the bank had to handle all of the federal governments funds without charge a new nationalism 395 lend the government up to 5 million upon demand and pay the government 1 5 million.
the bitter debate over the b u s then and later helped set the pattern of regional alignment for most other economic issues.
generally speaking westerners opposed the national bank because it catered to eastern customers.
the controversy over the b u s.
was also noteworthy because of the leading roles played by the eras greatest statesmen john c calhoun of south carolina henry clay of kentucky and daniel webster of new hampshire and later massachusetts.
calhoun introduced the banking bill and pushed it through justifying its constitutionality by citing the congressional power to regulate the currency.
clay who had long opposed a national bank now reversed himself arguing that new economic circumstances had made it indispensable.
webster led the opposition to the bank among the new england federalists who feared the growing financial power of philadelphia.
later webster would return to congress as the champion of a much stronger national government at the same time that unexpected events would steer calhoun away from economic nationalism and toward a defiant embrace of states rights slavery and even secession.
a protective tariff the long controversy with great britain over shipping rights convinced most americans of the need to develop their own manufacturing sector to end their dependence on imported british goods.
efforts to develop iron and textile industries begun in new york and new england during the embargo of 1807 had accelerated during the war of 1812 when america did not have access to european goods.
after the war ended however the m ore established british companies flooded u s markets with their less expensive products which undercut their american competitors.
in response northern manufacturers lobbied congress for federal tariffs to protect their infant industries from what they called unfair british competition.
congress responded by passing the tariff of 1816 which placed a 20 to 25 percent tax on a long list of imported goods.
tariffs benefited some regions the northeast more than others the south thus intensifying sectional tensions and grievances.
debates over federal tariffs would dominate political debate throughout the nineteenth century in part because they provided much of the annual federal revenue and in part because they benefited manufacturers rather than consumers.
the few southerners who voted for the tariff led by john c calhoun did so because they hoped that the south might also become a manufacturing center over time.

sector would roar ahead of the south leading calhoun to do an about face and begin opposing tariffs.
internal improvements the third major element of economic nationalism in the first half of the nineteenth century involved federal financing of internal improvements the construction of roads bridges canals and harbors.
most american rivers flowed from north to south so the nation needed a network of roads running east to west including what became known as the national road connecting the midwest with the east coast.
in 1817 john c calhoun urged the house to fund internal improvements.
he believed that a federally funded network of roads and canals in the west would help his native south by opening up trading relationships between the two regions.
support for federally financed roads and canals came largely from the west which badly needed transportation infrastructure.
opposition was centered in new england which expected to gain the least from projects intended to spur western development.
postwar nationalism and the supreme court the postwar emphasis on economic nationalism also surfaced in the supreme a new nationalism 397 court where chief justice john marshall strengthened the constitutional powers of the federal government at the expense of states rights.
in the pathbreaking case of marbury v madison 1803 the court had for the first time declared a federal law unconstitutional.
in the cases of martin v hunters lessee 1816 and cohens v virginia 1821 the court ruled that the u s constitution as well as the nations laws and treaties could remain the supreme law of the land only if the court could review and at times overturn the decisions of state courts.
protecting contract rights the supreme court made two more major decisions in 1819 that strengthened the john marshall a pillar of judicial power of the federal government at the nationalism marshall was appointed expense of the states one dartmouth chief justice of the u s supreme court college v woodward involved the new at the age of forty six ruling on marbury hampshire legislatures effort to change v madison just two years later.
dartmouth colleges charter to stop the colleges trustees from electing their own successors.
in 1816 the states legislature created a new board of trustees for the college.
the original group of trustees sued to block the move.
they lost in the state courts but won on appeal to the supreme court.
the colleges original charter wrote john marshall in drafting the courts opinion was a valid contract that the state legislature had impaired an act forbidden by the constitution.
this decision implied a new and enlarged definition of contract that seemed to put corporations beyond the reach of the states that had chartered them.
thereafter states commonly wrote into the charters incorporating businesses and other organizations provisions making the charters subject to modification.
such provisions were then part of the contract protecting a national currency the second major supreme court case of 1819 was marshalls most significant interpretation of the constitutional system mcculloch v maryland.
james mcculloch a b u s.
clerk in the baltimore office had refused to pay state taxes on b u s.
currency as required by a maryland law.
the state indicted mcculloch.
acting on behalf of the national bank he appealed to the supreme court which ruled 398 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 steamboat travel on the hudson river 1811 this watercolor of an early steamboat was painted by a russian diplomat pavel petrovich svinin who was fascinated by early technological innovations and the unique culture of america.
unanimously that congress had the authority to charter the b u s.
and that states had no right to tax the national bank.
speaking for the court chief justice marshall ruled that congress had the right that is one of its implied powers to take any action not forbidden by the constitution as long as the purpose of such laws was within the scope of the constitution one great principle that entirely pervades the constitution marshall wrote is that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are supreme.
they control the constitution and laws of the respective states and cannot be controlled by them regulating interstate commerce john marshalls last dramatic decision gibbons v ogden 1824 affirmed the federal governments supremacy in regulating interstate commerce in a ruling on an impor tant new york case.
in 1808 the new york legislature granted robert fulton and robert r livingston the sole right to operate steamboats on the states rivers and lakes.
fulton and livingston then gave aaron ogden the exclusive right to ferry people and goods up the hudson river between new york and new jersey.
thomas debates over the american system 399 gibbons however operated ships under a federal license that competed with ogden.
on behalf of a unanimous court marshall ruled that the monopoly granted by the state to ogden conflicted with the federal license issued to gibbons.
thomas jefferson detested john marshalls judicial nationalism.
the courts ruling in the gibbons case said the eighty two year old former president revealed how the federal branch of our government is advancing towards the usurpation of all the rights reserved to the states and the consolidation in itself of all powers foreign and domestic debates over the american system the major economic initiatives debated by congress after the war of 1812 the national bank federal tariffs and federally financed roads bridges ports and c anals were interrelated pieces of a comprehensive economic plan called the american system.
the term was coined by republican henry clay the powerful congressional leader from kentucky who would serve three terms as speaker of the house before becoming a u s senator.
clay wanted to free americas economy from its dependence on great britain while tying together the diverse regions of the nation politically.
he said i know of no south no north no east no west to which i owe my allegiance.
the union is my country in promoting his american system clay sought to give each section of the country its top economic priority.
he argued that high tariffs on imports were needed to block the sale of british products in the united states and thereby protect new industries in new england and new york from unfair foreign competition.
to convince the western states to support the tariffs clay first called for the federal government to use tariff revenues to build much needed infrastructure roads bridges canals and other internal improvements in the frontier west to enable speedier travel and faster shipment of goods to markets.
second clays american system would raise prices for federal lands sold to the public and distribute the additional revenue from the land sales to the states to help finance more roads bridges and canals.
third clay endorsed a strong national bank to create a single national currency and to regulate the often unstable state and local banks.
clay was the consummate deal maker and economic nationalist.
in many respects he assumed responsibility for sustaining alexander hamiltons vision 400 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 of a strong federal government nurturing a national economy that combined agriculture industry and commerce.
the debates over the merits of the american system would continue throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.
the success of clays program depended on each sections willingness to compromise.
for a while it worked.
critics however argued that higher prices for federal lands would discourage western migration and that tariffs benefited the northern manufacturing sector at the expense of southern and western farmers and the common people who had to pay higher prices for the goods produced by tariff protected industries.
many westerners and southerners also feared that the second bank of the united states would become so powerful and corrupt that it could dictate the nations economic future at the expense of states rights and the needs of particular regions.
missouri senator thomas hart benton predicted that cash strapped western towns would be at the mercy of the national bank in philadelphia.
westerners benton worried are in the jaws of the monster.
a lump of butter in the mouth of a dog.
one gulp one swallow and all is gone an era of good feelings near the end of his presidency james madison turned to james monroe a fellow virginian to be his successor.
in the 1816 election monroe overwhelmed his federalist opponent rufus king of new york by a 183 34 margin in the electoral college.
the virginia dynasty of presidents continued.
monroes presidency started with america at peace and its economy flourishing.
soon after his inauguration in early 1817 monroe embarked on a goodwill tour of new england the stronghold of the federalist party.
in boston a federalist newspaper complimented the republican president for making the effort to harmonize feelings annihilate dissentions and make us one people those words of praise were printed under the heading era of good feelings and the headline became a popular label for monroes administration.
james monroe like george washington thomas jefferson and james madison monroe was a slaveholding planter from virginia.
at the outbreak of the revolutionary war he dropped out of the college of william and mary to join the army.
he served under george washington who called him a brave active and sensible army officer after studying law under thomas jefferson monroe served as a representative in the virginia assembly as governor as a representative in the confederation congress as a u s senator and as u s minister ambassador to paris an era of good feelings 401 london and madrid.
under president madison he served as secretary of state and doubled as secretary of war during the war of 1812.
john c calhoun who would be monroes secretary of war said that the new president was among the wisest and most cautious men i have ever known jefferson noted that monroe was a man whose soul might be turned wrong side outwards without discovering a blemish to the world although monroes presidency began peacefully enough sectional loyalties eventually erupted at the expense of nationalist needs.
two major events signaled the end of the era of good feelings and warned of stormy times ahead the financial panic of 1819 and the political conflict over statehood for missouri.
the panic of 1819 james monroe portrayed as he began his presidency in 1817.
the young republic experienced its first major economic depression when the panic of 1819 led to a prolonged financial slowdown.
like so many other economic collapses it was fundamentally the result of too many people trying to get rich too quickly.
after the war of 1812 european demand for american products especially cotton tobacco and flour soared leading farmers and planters to increase production.
to fuel the roaring postwar economy unsound local and state banks multiplied and made it easy too easy for people and businesses to get loans.
the bank of the united states b u s.
aggravated the problem by issuing risky loans too.
at the same time the federal government aggressively sold vast tracts of public land which spurred reckless real estate speculation by people buying large parcels with the intention of reselling them.
on top of all that good weather in europe led to a spike in crop production there thus reducing the need to buy american commodities.
prices for american farm products plunged.
the panic of 1819 was ignited by the sudden collapse of cotton prices after british textile mills quit buying high priced american cotton the nations leading export in favor of cheaper cotton from other parts of the world.
as the price of cotton fell and the flow of commerce slowed banks began to fail 402 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 and unemployment spiked.
the collapse of cotton prices was especially devastating for southern planters but it also reduced the world demand for other american goods.
owners of new factories and mills most of them in new england new york and pennsylvania struggled to find markets for their goods and to fend off more experienced foreign competitors.
the financial panic and the ensuing depression deepened tensions between northern and southern economic interests.
it also spawned a widespread distrust of banks and bankers.
tennessee congressman david crockett dismissed the whole banking system as nothing more than swindling on a large scale thomas jefferson felt the same way.
he wrote to john adams that the paper money bubble is then burst.
this is what you and i and every reasoning man.
have long foreseen other factors caused the financial panic to become a depression.
business owners farmers and land speculators had recklessly borrowed money to expand their business ventures or to purchase more land.
with the collapse of crop prices and the decline of land values during and after 1819 both land speculators and settlers saw their income plummet.
the equally reckless lending practices of the numerous new state banks compounded the economic confusion.
to generate more loans the banks issued more paper money.
even the second bank of the united states which was supposed to provide financial stability was caught up in the easy credit mania.
in 1819 newspapers revealed a case of extensive fraud and embezzlement in the baltimore branch of the bank of the united states.
the scandal prompted the appointment of langdon cheves a former south carolina congressman as the new president of the b u s.
cheves restored confidence in the national bank by forcing state banks to keep more gold coins in their vaults to back up the loans they were making.
state banks in turn put pressure on their debtors who found it harder to renew old loans or to get new ones.
the economic depression lasted about three years and many people blamed the b u s.
after the panic subsided many americans especially in the south and the west remained critical of the national bank.
the missouri compromise as the financial panic deepened another dark cloud appeared on the horizon the onset of a fierce sectional controversy over expanding slavery into the western territories.
the possibility of western territories becoming slave states created the greatest political debate of the nineteenth century.
thomas jefferson admitted that the issue scared him like a firebell in the night jefferson realized that the united states was increasingly at risk of disintegrating over the future of slavery.
by 1819 the country had an equal number an era of good feelings 403 of slave and free states eleven of each.
the northwest ordinance 1787 had banned slavery north of the ohio river and the southwest ordinance 1790 had authorized slavery south of the ohio.
in the region west of the mississippi river however slavery had existed since france and spain first colonized the area.
st louis became the crossroads through which southerners brought slaves into the missouri territory.
in 1819 residents in the missouri territory asked the house of representatives to let them draft a constitution and apply for statehood its population having passed the minimum of 60 000 white settlers there were also some 10 000 slaves.
it would be the first state west of the mississippi river.
at that point representative james tallmadge jr an obscure new york republican stunned congress by proposing a resolution to ban the transport of any more slaves into missouri.
tallmadges resolution enraged southern slave owners many of whom had developed a profitable business selling slaves the missouri compromise 1820 british possessions oregon country joint occupation by britain and u s maine vt 1820 ip p ss m iss i unorganized michigan territory nh ma ny i oh in o river hi il spanish possessions o missouri va sc ms ga al atlantic ocean florida territory free states md nc tn la slave states states and territories covered by the compromise ri ky arkansas territory pacific ocean ct nj de pa river territory gulf of mexico british 500 miles 500 kilometers sp a ni sh what caused the sectional controversy over slavery in 1819.

any effort to restrict slavery in the western territories they believed could lead to disunion and civil war.
in addition southerners worried that the addition of missouri as a free state would tip the balance of power in the senate against the slave states.
their fears were heightened when congressman timothy fuller an anti slavery republican from massachusetts declared that it was both the right and duty of congress to stop the spread of the intolerable evil and the crying enormity of slavery after fiery debates the house with its northern majority passed the tallmadge amendment on an almost strictly sectional vote.
the senate however rejected it also along sectional lines.
at about the same time maine which had been part of massachusetts applied for statehood.
the senate decided to link maines request for statehood with missouris voting in 1820 to admit maine as a free state and missouri as a slave state thus maintaining the political balance between free and slave states.
illinois senator jesse thomas revised the so called missouri compromise by introducing an amendment to exclude slavery in the rest of the louisiana purchase north of latitude 3630 missouris southern border.
slavery thus would continue in the arkansas territory and in the new state of missouri but would be excluded from the remainder of the area west of the mississippi river.
by a narrow margin the thomas amendment passed on march 2 1820.
then another issue arose.
the p ro slavery faction in missouris consti tutional convention inserted in the proposed state constitution a provision excluding free blacks and mulattoes mixed race people from residing in the state.
this violated the u s constitution.
free blacks were already citizens of many states.
the dispute over the status of blacks henry clay of kentucky clay entered the senate at t wenty eight despite the threatened to unravel the deal to admit requirement that senators be at least missouri as a state until speaker of the thirty years old.

the missouri legislature approved clays suggestion but denied that it had any power to bind the state in the future.
on august 10 1821 missouri became the t wenty fourth state and the twelfth where slavery was allowed.
nationalists praised the missouri compromise for deflecting the volatile issue of slavery.
but the compromise settled little.
in fact it had the effect of hardening positions in both north and south.
sectionalism erupted even within the presidents cabinet.
president monroe insisted that any effort to restrict the spread of slavery violated the constitution.
his secretary of state the future president john quincy adams of massachusetts disliked the missouri compromise for the opposite reason because it sustained the constitutions immoral bargain between freedom and slavery the debate over the missouri compromise revealed a widening divide between north and south the north dominated by shipping commerce manufacturing and small farms the south becoming more and more dependent on cotton and slavery.
nationalist diplomacy the efforts of henry clay to promote economic nationalism and john marshall to affirm judicial nationalism were reinforced by efforts to practice diplomatic nationalism.
john quincy adams secretary of state in the monroe administration and the son of former president john adams aggressively exercised americas growing power to clarify and expand the nations boundaries.
he also wanted europeans to recognize americas dominance in the western hemisphere.
relations with britain the treaty of ghent 1814 had ended the war of 1812 but it left unsettled several disputes between the united states and great britain.
adams oversaw the negotiations of two important treaties the rush bagot treaty of 1817 named after the diplomats who arranged it and the convention of 1818 both of which eased tensions.
in the r ush bagot treaty the two nations agreed to limit the number of warships on the great lakes.
the convention of 1818 was even more impor tant.
it settled the disputed northern boundary of the louisiana purchase by extending it along the 49th parallel westward from what would become minnesota to the rocky mountains.
west of the rockies the oregon country would be jointly occupied by the british and the americans.

figurethe m9 3 first proof how did andrew jacksons aggressive military actions in florida help john 31p0 xquincy 20p6 adams claim territory from spain.
florida still another disputed boundary involved western florida.
spanish control over florida during the early nineteenth century was more a technicality than an actuality.
spain was now a declining power unable to enforce its obligations under pinckneys treaty of 1795 to keep indians in the region from making raids into south georgia.
in 1816 u s soldiers clashed with runaway slaves holed up in a british fort in west florida in the present day florida panhandle.
at the same time seminole warriors fought white settlers in the area.
in 1817 americans burned a seminole village on the border killing five indians.
at that point secretary of war john c calhoun ordered general andrew jackson to lead an army from tennessee into florida igniting what became known as the first seminole war.
jackson was told to pursue marauding indians into spanish florida but not to attack spanish forts.
jackson frustrated by the restrictions wrote president monroe that if the united states wanted spanish florida he could conquer it in sixty days.
nationalist diplomacy 407 massacre of the whites by indians and blacks in florida 1836 published in a southerners account of the seminole war this is one of the earliest known depictions of african americans and native americans fighting as allies.
in early 1818 jacksons force of 2 000 federal soldiers volunteer tennessee militiamen and indian allies crossed into spanish florida from their encampment in south georgia.
in april the americans assaulted a spanish fort at st marks and destroyed several seminole villages along the suwannee river hanging two chiefs.
jacksons soldiers also captured and c ourt martialed two british traders accused of provoking indian attacks.
when told that a military trial of the british citizens was illegal jackson gruffly replied that the laws of war did not apply to conflicts with savages jackson ordered the immediate execution of the british troublemakers an illegal action that outraged the british government and alarmed president monroes cabinet.
but the tennessee general kept moving.
in may he captured pensacola the spanish capital of west florida and established a provisional american government until floridas future was decided.
while jacksons conquests excited expansionists they aroused anger in spain and concern in washington d c spain demanded that its territory be returned and that jackson be punished for violating international law.
monroes cabinet was at first prepared to disavow jacksons illegal acts.
privately secretary of war calhoun criticized jackson for disobeying o rders a stand that would later cause bad blood between them.
jackson however was a hero to most americans.
he also had an impor tant friend in the cabinet secretary of state john quincy adams who realized that jacksons unauthorized conquest of florida had strengthened his own hand in negotiating with the spanish to purchase the territory.
american forces withdrew from florida but negotiations resumed with the knowledge that the u s army could retake florida at any time.
408 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 in 1819 adams convinced the spanish to sign the transcontinental treaty also called the adams ons treaty which gave all of florida to the united states for 5 million.
in 1821 florida became a u s territory in 1845 it would become a state.
the treaty also clarified the western boundary separating the louisiana territory from new spain.
it would run from the gulf of mexico north along the sabine river separating louisiana from texas and then in s tair step fashion up to the red river along the red and up to the arkansas river.
from the source of the arkansas river it would go north to the 42nd parallel and then west to the pacific coast.
the united states finally the controversial spanned the continent.
andrew jackson general was painted by anna claypoole peale in 1819 the year of his military exploits in florida.
she captured jacksons confident demeanor that made him so popular.
the monroe doctrine the most important diplomatic policy crafted by president monroe and secretary of state adams involved a determined effort to prevent any future european colonialism in the western hemisphere.
the spanish british french portuguese dutch and russians still controlled one or more colonies in the americas.
one consequence of the napoleonic wars in europe was the french occupation of spain and portugal.
the turmoil in those two conquered nations helped trigger independence movements among their colonies in the americas.
within little more than a decade after the flag of rebellion was first raised in 1809 in ecuador spain had lost almost its entire empire in the americas la plata later argentina bolivia chile ecuador peru colombia mexico paraguay uruguay and venezuela had all proclaimed their independence as had portuguese brazil.
the only areas still under spanish control were the islands of cuba and puerto rico and the colony of santo domingo on the island of hispaniola.
in 1823 rumors reached america that the monarchs of europe were planning to help spain recover its latin american colonies.
the british foreign minister george canning told the united states that the two countries should the rise of andrew jackson 409 jointly oppose any new incursions by european nations in the western hemisphere.
monroe initially agreed if the london government would agree to recognize the independence of the new nations of latin america.
the british refused.
adams however advised monroe to go it alone in prohibiting further european involvement in the hemisphere.
adams stressed that it would be more candid as well as more dignified for america to ban further european intervention than to tag along with a british statement.
monroe agreed.
in his annual message to congress in december 1823 the president outlined the four major points of what became known as the monroe doctrine 1 that the american continents.
are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers 2 that the united states would consider any attempt by a european nation to intervene in this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety 3 that the united states would not interfere with existing european controlled colonies in the americas and 4 that the united states would keep out of the internal affairs of european nations.
reaction to the monroe doctrine was mixed.
in france marquis de lafayette the courageous freedom loving volunteer in the american revolution hailed the new policy as the best little bit of paper that god had ever permitted any man to give to the world others were not as impressed by the presumptuous american declaration.
no european nation recognized the monroe doctrine.
in fact the russian ruler czar alexander i dismissed it with profound contempt since he knew that the tiny u s navy could not protect its shores.
the russians then controlled alaska and claimed to own the oregon country as well.
to this day the monroe doctrine has no official standing in international law.
symbolically however it has been an important statement of american intentions to prevent european involvement in the western hemisphere and an example of the young nations determination to take its place among the worlds great powers.
since it was announced not a single latin american nation has lost its independence to an outside invader.
the rise of andrew jackson after the war of 1812 the united states had become a o ne party political system.
the refusal of the federalists to support the war had virtually killed the party.
in 1820 president monroe was reelected without opposition the federalists did not even nominate a candidate.
410 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 while the republican party was dominant for the moment however it was about to follow the federalists into oblivion.
if monroes first term was the era of good feelings his second term became an era of bad feelings as sectional controversies erupted into disputes so violent that they gave birth to a new political party the democrats led by andrew jackson.
andrew jackson born in 1767 along the border between the two carolinas jackson grew up in a struggling single parent household.
his father was killed in a farm accident three weeks before andrew was born forcing his widowed mother elizabeth to scratch out a living as a housekeeper while raising three sons.
during the revolution the jackson boys joined in the fighting against the british.
one of them s ixteen year old hugh died of heat exhaustion during a battle another robert died while trudging home from a prisoner of war camp.
in 1781 f ourteen year old andrew was captured.
when a british officer demanded that the boy shine his muddy boots andrew refused explaining that he was a prisoner of war and expected to be treated as such whereupon the angry officer slashed him with his sword leaving ugly scars on jacksons head and hand.
soon after her son was released elizabeth jackson who had helped nurse injured american soldiers died of cholera.
the orphaned andrew jackson thereafter despised the british blaming them for the deaths of his brothers and mother.
after the revolution the s elf taught jackson went to charleston south carolina where he quickly learned to love racehorses gambling and fine clothes.
he returned home and tried saddle making and teaching before moving to salisbury north carolina where he earned a license to practice law.
he was so combative an attorney that he challenged an opposing lawyer to a duel.
he also enjoyed life.
a friend recalled that young jackson was the most roaring rollicking g ame cocking card playing mischievous fellow that ever lived in salisbury in 1788 at age twenty one jackson moved to nashville where he became a frontier attorney in backwoods tennessee.
he also fell in love with rachel donelson robards a beautiful and lively married woman with whom he lived before she was legally divorced from her first husband.
the jacksons were passionately devoted to each other but mean spirited gossip about the origins of their relationship dogged them until rachels death in december 1828.
throughout his life jackson had a quick temper.
he loved a good fight.
when danger rears its head he once told his wife i can never shrink from it in 1806 he challenged charles dickinson to a duel claiming that dickinson had not paid off a racing bet and had insulted his wife rachel.
although the rise of andrew jackson 411 dickinson was said to be the best shot in tennessee jackson let him fire first.
for his gallantry the future president received a bullet in his chest that nearly killed him.
he nevertheless straightened himself patiently took aim and coolly killed his foe.
i should have hit him jackson claimed if he had shot me through the brain the bullet in his chest was never removed.
in 1796 when tennessee became a state voters elected jackson to the u s house and later to the senate where he served only a year before returning to tennessee and becoming a judge.
the ambitious jackson made a lot of money first as an attorney then as a buyer and seller of horses land and slaves.
he eventually owned 100 slaves on his large cotton plantation called the hermitage.
he had no moral reservations about slavery and at times could be a cruel master.
after one of his slaves escaped jackson offered a large reward for his recapture and promised ten dollars extra for every hundred lashes a person will give him to the amount of three hundred when not farming or raising racehorses jackson served as the iron willed commander of the tennessee militia.
many american political leaders cringed at the thought of the r ough hewn s hort tempered jackson who had run roughshod over international law in his war against the british and seminoles in florida presiding over the nation.
his passions are terrible said thomas jefferson.
john quincy adams scorned jackson as a barbarian and savage who could scarcely spell his name jackson dismissed such criticism as an example of the eastern elite trying to maintain control of american politics.
he responded to adamss criticism of his literacy by commenting that he never trusted a man who could think of only one way to spell a word.
presidential politics no sooner had james monroe started his second presidential term in 1821 than leading republicans began positioning themselves to be the next president including three members of the presidents cabinet secretary of war john c calhoun secretary of the treasury william h crawford and secretary of state john quincy adams.
the powerful speaker of the house henry clay also hungered for the presidency.
and there was andrew jackson who was elected to the senate in 1823.
the emergence of so many viable candidates revealed how fractured the republican party had become.
in 1822 the tennessee legislature named jackson its l ong shot choice to succeed monroe.
two years later pennsylvania republicans also endorsed jackson for president and chose calhoun for vice president.
meanwhile the kentucky legislature had nominated its favorite son clay in 1822.
the massachusetts legislature nominated adams in 1824.
that same year a group of republican congressmen nominated crawford a cotton planter from georgia.
412 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 crawfords friends emphasized his devotion to states rights and strict construction of the constitution.
clay continued to promote the economic nationalism of his american system.
adams the only non slaveholder in the race shared clays belief that the national government should finance internal improvements to stimulate economic development but he was less strongly committed to tariffs.
jackson declared himself the champion of the common people and the foe of the entrenched social and political elite.
he claimed to represent the old republicanism of thomas jefferson.
but jefferson believed that jackson lacked the education polish and prudence to be president.
he is jefferson told a friend one of the most unfit men i know a dangerous man in 1824 jefferson supported crawford.
as a self made military hero jackson was an attractive candidate especially to voters of irish background.
the son of poor scots irish colonists he was beloved for having defeated the hated english in the battle of new orleans.
in addition his commitment to those he called the common men resonated with many irish immigrants who associated aristocracy with centuries of english rule over ireland.
the corrupt bargain the initial results of the 1824 presidential election were inconclusive.
jackson won the popular vote and the electoral college where he had 99 votes adams 84 crawford 41 and clay 37.
but the presidential race of 1824 john quincy adams william crawford and andrew jackson stride to the finish line on the left as henry clay lags behind far right.
the rise of andrew jackson 413 jackson did not have the necessary majority of electoral votes.
in such a circumstance as in the 1800 election the constitution specified that the house of representatives would make the final decision from among the top three vote getters.
by the time the house could convene however crawford had suffered a stroke and was ruled out for medical reasons.
so the election came down to adams and jackson.
clays influence as speaker of the house would be decisive.
while adams and jackson courted clays support he scorned them both claiming they provided only a choice of evils but he regarded jackson his fierce western rival as a military chieftain a frontier napolon unfit for the presidency.
jacksons election clay predicted would be the greatest misfortune that could befall the country although clay and adams disliked each other the nationalist adams supported most of the policies that clay wanted particularly high tariffs transportation improvements and a strong national bank.
clay also expected adams to name him secretary of state the office that usually led to the white house.
in the end a deal between clay and adams broke the deadlock.
clay endorsed adams and the house of representatives elected adams with 13 state delegation votes to jacksons 7 and crawfords 4.
the controversial victory proved costly for adams however as it united his foes and crippled his administration before it began.
clays scheme proved to be a colossal blunder.
jackson dismissed clay as a scoundrel the judas of the west who had entered into a self serving corrupt bargain with adams.
their corruptions and intrigues he charged had defeated the will of the people american politics had now entered an era of bad feelings.
almost immediately after the 1824 decision jacksons supporters launched a campaign to undermine the adams administration and elect the military hero president in 1828.
crawfords supporters soon moved into the jackson camp as did the new vice president john c calhoun of south carolina who quickly found himself at odds with the president.
john quincy adams john quincy adams of massachusetts was one of the nations hardest working presidents yet he was also one of the most ineffective.
like his father the stiff formal adams was a great and good man of colossal learning and steely ambition but he lacked the common touch and the politicians gift for compromise.
he worried as had his father that republicanism was rapidly turning into democracy and that government of the people was degenerating into government by the people many of whom in his view were uneducated and incompetent.
adams detested the democratic politicking that andrew jackson represented.
he still wanted politics to be a sacred arena for the best men a 414 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 rofession limited to the most able p and worthy leaders who were motivated by a sense of civic duty rather than a selfish quest for power and stature.
the poet walt whitman wrote that although adams was a virtuous m an a learned man.
he was not a man of the people adams also suffered from bouts of depression and self pity qualities that did not endear him to fellow politicians or the public.
in a fit of candor he described himself as a man of reserved cold austere and forbidding manners yet after admitting the defects in his personality adams confessed that he could not change them.
adamss first message to congress john quincy adams a brilliant man in december 1825 revealed his grand but an ineffective leader he appears blueprint for national development.
here in his study in 1843.
he was the his vision of an energetic federal govfirst u s president to be photographed.
ernment funding an array of improvement projects outdid the plans of alexander hamilton james monroe and henry clay.
the federal government adams stressed should finance internal improvements roads canals harbors and bridges create a great national university in washington d c support scientific explorations build astronomical observatories and establish a department of the interior to manage the vast federal lands.
he challenged congress to approve his proposals and not be paralyzed by the will of our constituents adams believed that he knew what was best for the country and he would not be stopped by the concerns of voters.
the voters thought otherwise.
reaction to adamss speech was overwhelmingly negative.
newspapers charged that adams was behaving like an aristocratic tyrant and congress quickly revealed that it would approve none of his ambitious proposals.
the disastrous start shattered adamss confidence.
he wrote in his diary that he was in a protracted agony of character and reputation adamss effort to expand the powers of the federal government was so controversial and divisive that the republican party split in two creating a new the rise of andrew jackson 415 party system.
those who agreed with the economic nationalism of adams and clay began calling themselves national republicans.
the opposition made up of those who supported andrew jackson and states rights began calling themselves democrats.
they were strongest in the south and west as well as among the working class in large eastern cities.
the democrats were the first party in america to recruit professional state organizers such as martin van buren of new york who developed sophisticated strategies for mobilizing voters and orchestrating grassroots campaigns featuring massive rallies barbecues and parades.
perhaps most important the democrats convinced voters that their primary allegiance should be to their party rather than to any particular candidate.
party loyalty became the prized virtue among democrats it was the most powerful weapon they could muster against the privileged aristocracy running the state and federal governments.
jackson claimed that adams was behaving like a monarch rather than a president a charge later applied to jackson.
if the presidents schemes for expanding government power were not stopped by the voice of the people jackson said it must end in consolidation then in despotism adamss opponents sought to use the always controversial tariff issue against him.
in 1828 a nti adams congressmen introduced a new tariff bill designed to help elect andrew jackson.
it placed duties taxes on various imported raw materials such as wool hemp and iron that were also produced in key states where jackson needed support pennsylvania new york ohio kentucky and missouri.
the measure passed only to be condemned as the tariff of abominations by the cotton states of the lower south.
in south carolina john c calhoun wrote the south carolina exposition and protest 1828 in which he ominously declared that a state could nullify an act of congress that it found unconstitutional such as the new tariff.
jacksons election these maneuverings launched the savage election of 1828 between john quincy adams and andrew jackson the national republicans versus the jacksonian democrats.
both sides engaged in vicious personal attacks.
as a jackson supporter observed the floodgates of falsehood slander and abuse have been hoisted by the adams campaign and the most nauseating filth is being poured on jacksons head.
adamss supporters denounced jackson as a hot tempered ignorant barbarian a gambler and slave trader who thrived on confrontation and violence and whose fame rested upon his reputation as a cold blooded killer.
416 chapter 9 nationalism and sectionalism 1815 1828 the most scurrilous attack on jackson was that he had lived in adultery with his wife rachel.
in fact they had lived together as husband and wife for two years in the mistaken belief that the divorce from her first husband was final.
as soon as the divorce was indeed official andrew and rachel had remarried to end all doubts about their status.
a furious jackson blamed henry clay for the slurs against his wife calling the kentuckian the basest meanest scoundrel that ever disgraced the image of his god the jacksonians for their part condemned adams as an aristocrat and monarchist a professional politician who had never had a real job.
newspa jackson forever proclaiming andrew jackson a man of the people this 1828 poster identifies him with the democratic impulse of the time.
the rise of andrew jackson 417 pers claimed that the president had been corrupted by foreigners in the courts of europe during his diplomatic career.
the most outlandish charge was that adams had allegedly delivered up an american girl to czar alexander i while serving as ambassador to russia.
adams was left to gripe about the many forgeries now swarming in the newspapers against me as a military hero and fabled indian fighter jackson was beloved as the peoples champion by farmers and working men.
as a planter lawyer and slaveholder he had the trust of the southern political elite.
jackson was for a small federal government individual liberty an expanded military and white supremacy.
above all he was a nationalist committed to preserving the union in the face of rising sectional tensions.
candidate jackson benefited from a growing spirit of democracy in which many viewed adams as an elitist.
jackson insisted that the election came down to one question shall the government or the people rule as president jackson promised he would fight against the entrenched power of the wealthy and powerful.
when adamss supporters began referring to jackson as a jackass old hickory embraced the name using the animal as a symbol for his tough campaign.
the jackass eventually became the enduring symbol of the democratic party.
the common man in politics jacksons campaign explicitly appealed to the common voters many of whom were able to vote in a presidential election for the first time as a result of the ongoing democratization of the political system.
new jersey in 1807 and maryland and south carolina in 1810 had abolished property and taxpaying requirements for voting and after 1815 the new states of indiana illinois alabama and mississippi gave voting rights suffrage to all white men regardless of how much property they owned.
other states followed and by 1824 twenty one of the twenty four states had dropped property owning requirements for voting.
only virginia and the carolinas still dominated by the planter elite continued to resist the democratizing trend.
the democratization of politics also affected many free black males in northern states half of which allowed blacks to vote.
rufus king the former presidential candidate declared that in new york a citizen of color was entitled to all the privileges of a citizen.
and entitled to vote the extension of voting rights to common men led to the election of politicians sprung from the people rather than from the social elite.
jackson a frontiersman of humble origin and limited education who had scrambled up the political ladder by sheer tenacity perfectly symbolized this emerging democratic ideal.

how did the broadening of voting rights affect the presidential campaign.
first proof 31p0 x 25p0 labor politics with the widespread removal of property qualifications for voting the working class laborers paid hourly wages became an important political force in the form of the working mens parties.
they were first organized in 1828 in philadelphia the nations largest manufacturing center with other parties following in new york city and boston.
the working mens parties were devoted to promoting the interests of laborers such as shorter working hours and allowing all males to vote regardless of the amount of property owned.
but the overarching concern of the working mens parties was the widening inequality of wealth in american society.
the rise of andrew jackson 419 in 1827 during a citywide carpenters strike the union claimed that when business owners began to oppress the working class wage laborers had no choice but to organize to protect their interests against an unequal and very excessive accumulation of wealth and power into the hands of a few the working mens parties faded quickly however.
the inexperience of labor politicians left them vulnerable to manipulation by political professionals.
in addition major national parties especially the jacksonian democrats co opted many of their issues.
labor parties also proved vulnerable to charges of social radicalism and the courts typically sided with management in dealing with strikes.
yet the working class parties succeeded in drawing attention to their demands.
they promoted free public education for all children and the abolition of imprisonment for debt causes that won widespread popular support.
the labor parties and unions also called for a t en hour workday to prevent employers from abusing workers.
in large part because of andrew jacksons background as a common man union members loved him and the new democratic party proved adept at building a national coalition of working class supporters.
president jackson when the 1828 election returns came in jackson had won the electoral vote by 178 to 83 and his 56 percent of the popular vote would be a margin unsurpassed during the nineteenth century.
equally important was the surge in voter turnout more than twice as many men voted as in the 1824 election.
jackson won every state west and south of pennsylvania.
as he prepared for his inauguration the p resident elect was still boiling with resentment at the way his opponents had besmirched the reputation of his wife who had died in mid december 1828 just a few days after learning of the political attacks on her and her tarnished marriage.
jackson became obsessed with punishing her persecutors especially his archenemy henry clay.
more important jackson wanted to launch a new democratic era that would silence his critics restore government to the people and take power away from the eastern elite he trusted the people because he was one of them.
now he would be the peoples president as he headed for washington d c he was intent on transforming the nations political landscape for good and for ill as it turned out.
chapter review summary nationalism after the war of 1812 the federal government pursued many policies to strengthen the national economy.
the tariff of 1816 protected american manufacturing and the second bank of the united states provided a stronger currency.
led by john marshall the supreme court limited the powers of states and strengthened the power of the federal government in dartmouth college v woodward and mcculloch v maryland.
the marshall court interpreted the constitution as giving congress the right to take any action not forbidden by the constitution as long as the purpose of such laws was within the scope of the constitution in gibbons v ogden the court protected contract rights against state action and established the federal governments supremacy over interstate commerce thereby promoting growth of the national economy.
sectionalism henry clays american system supported economic nationalism by endorsing a national bank a protective tariff and federally funded internal improvements such as roads and canals.
many americans however were more tied to the needs of their particular sections of the country.
people in the different regions north south and west disagreed about which economic policies best served their interests.
as settlers streamed west the extension of slavery into the new territories became the predominant political concern eventually requiring both sides to compromise repeatedly to avoid civil war.
era of good feelings james monroes term in office began with peace and prosperity and was initially labeled the era of good feelings.
two major events however ended the era of good feelings the financial panic of 1819 and the missouri compromise 1820.
the explosive growth of the cotton culture transformed life in the south in part by encouraging the expansion of slavery which moved west with southern planters.
but in 1819 the sudden collapse of world cotton prices devastated the southern economy and soon affected the national economy as well.
the missouri compromise a short term solution to the issue of allowing slavery in the western territories exposed the emotions and turmoil that the problem generated.
national diplomacy the main diplomatic achievements of the period between the end of the war of 1812 and the coming civil war concerned the extension of americas contested boundaries and the resumption of trade with its old enemy great britain.
the countries reached agreement on the northern u s borders and to the south the transcontinental treaty adams ons treaty with spain extended the boundaries of the united states.
the monroe doctrine expressed the idea that the americas were no longer open to colonization and proclaimed american neutrality in european affairs.
the election of 1828 the demise of the federalists left the republicans as the only political party in the nation.
the republicans seeming unity was shattered by the election of 1824 which andrew jackson lost as a result of what he believed was a corrupt bargain between john quincy adams and henry clay.
