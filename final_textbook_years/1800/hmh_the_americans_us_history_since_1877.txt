patrick gass was among those who took part in the famous lewis and clark expedition.
setting out in 1804 this expedition traveled overland from st louis missouri to the pacific.
along the way gass kept a journal in which he took notes on people places and the dramatic events he witnessed.
gass described one of those events in his journal entry for may 14 1805.
a personal voice patrick gass this forenoon we passed a large creek on the north side and a small river on the south.
about 4 in the afternoon we passed another small river on the south side near the mouth of which some of the men discovered a large brown bear and six of them went out to kill it.
they fired at it but having only wounded it it made battle and was near seizing some of them but they all fortunately escaped and at length succeeded in dispatching it.
these bears are very bold and ferocious and very large and powerful.
the natives say they have killed a number of their brave men 99 patrick gass a journal of the voyages and travels of a corps of discovery the journey gass undertook with lewis and clark helped lay the foundations for expansion.
the explorers brought back to the new government reports about the vast regions that lay to the west.
meanwhile other americans continued to shape the government in their growing nation.
jeffersons presidency the election of 1800 pitted thomas jefferson a leader of the democratic republicans sometimes shortened to republicans against president john adams and his federalist party.
it was a hard fought struggle.
each party hurled wild charges at the other.
democratic republicans called adams a tool of the chapter 3 the growth of a young nation rich who wanted to turn the executive branch into a british style monarchy.
federalists protested that jefferson was a dangerous supporter of revolutionary france and an atheist.
the election of 1800 in the balloting in the electoral college jefferson defeated adams by eight electoral votes.
however since jefferson s running mate aaron burr received the same number of votes as jefferson the house of representatives was called upon to break the tie and choose between the two running mates.
for six feverish days the house took one ballot after another 35 ballots in all.
finally alexander hamilton intervened.
although hamilton opposed jefferson s philosophy of government he regarded burr as unqualified for the presidency.
hamilton persuaded enough federalists to cast blank votes that jefferson received a majority of two votes.
burr then became vice president.
the deadlock revealed a flaw in the electoral process established by the constitution.
as a result congress passed the twelfth amendment which called for electors to cast separate ballots for president and vice president.
this system is still in effect today.
in his inaugural address jefferson extended the hand of peace to his opponents.
every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle he said.
we are all republicans we are all federalists.
main idea making inferences how did jeffersons actions reflect his theory of government.
main idea evaluating decisions why was the principle of judicial review important for the future of the supreme court.
simplifying the government jefferson s theory of government often called jeffersonian republicanism held that the people should control the government and that a simple government best suited the needs of the people.
in accord with his belief in decentralized power jefferson tried to shrink the government and cut costs wherever possible.
he reduced the size of the army halted a planned expansion of the navy and lowered expenses for government social functions.
he also rolled back hamilton s economic program by eliminating all internal taxes and reducing the influence of the bank of the united states.
jefferson was the first president to take office in the new federal capital washington d c.
though in appearance the city was a primitive place of dirt roads and few buildings its location between virginia and maryland reflected the growing importance of the south in national politics.
in fact jefferson and the two presidents who followed him james madison and james monroe all were from virginia.
this pattern of southern dominance underscored the declining influence of both new england and the federalists in national political life at that time.
john marshall and the supreme court just before leaving office president adams had tried to influence future judicial decisions by filling federal judge ships with federalists.
but the signed documents authorizing some of the appointments had not been delivered by the time adams left office.
jefferson argued that these appointments were invalid and ordered madison his secretary of state not to deliver them.
this argument led to one of the most important supreme court decisions of all time in marbury v madison 1803.
see page 118.
the federalist chief justice john marshall declared that part of congress s judiciary act of 1789 which would have forced madison to hand over the papers was unconstitutional.
the decision strengthened the supreme court by establishing the principle of judicial review the ability of the supreme court to declare a law in this case an act of congress unconstitutional.

review unit 113 the louisiana purchase in 1800 napoleon bonaparte of france had persuaded spain to return to france the louisiana territory the land spanning from the mississippi river west to the rocky mountains.
france had handed this territory over to spain in 1762 during the french and indian war but napoleon planned to use it as a breadbasket for the colonial empire that he hoped to build in the west indies.
many americans were alarmed when they heard of this transfer as they feared that a strong french presence in north america would force the united states into an alliance with britain.
however by 1803 napoleon had abandoned his ideas of an american empire and offered to sell the louisiana territory to the united states.
jefferson doubted whether the constitution gave him the power to make such a purchase but he decided to proceed.
at a price of 15 million the louisiana purchase more than doubled the size of the united states.
under the direction of president jefferson meriwether lewis and william clark organized and led a group including patrick gass and set off in 1804 to explore the new territory.
the explorers brought back valuable information about the west and showed that transcontinental travel was possible.
madison and the war of 1812 jefferson easily won reelection in 1804 but a crisis clouded his second administration.
renewed fighting between britain and france threatened american shipping.
the crisis continued into the administration of james madison who was elected president in 1808.
some four years later madison led the nation into the war of 1812 against great britain.
the causes of the war although france and britain both threatened u s ships between 1805 and 1814 americans focused their anger on the british.
one reason was the british policy of impressment the practice of seizing americans at sea and impressing or drafting them into the british navy.
americans grew even angrier after learning that officials in british canada were supplying arms to native americans in support of their ongoing battle against american settlers.
a group of young congressmen from the south and the west known as the war hawks demanded war.
the course of the war by the spring of 1812 president madison had decided to commit america to war against britain and congress approved the war declaration in mid june.
republican funding cuts and a lack of popular support had left the american military with few volunteers and ill prepared for war.
britain however was too preoccupied with napoleon in europe to pay much attention to the americans.
nonetheless the british scored a stunning victory in august of 1814 when they brushed aside american troops and sacked washington d c madison and other federal officials fled the city as the british burned the capitol the presidential mansion and other public buildings.
the most impressive american victory occurred at the battle of new orleans.
there on january 8 1815 u s troops led by general andrew jackson of tennessee routed a british force.
ironically british and american diplomats had already signed a peace agreement before the battle of new orleans but news of the pact had not reached jackson in time.
the treaty of ghent signed on christmas eve 1814 declared an armistice or end to the fighting.
the consequences of the war the war had three important consequences.
first it led to the end of the federalist party whose members generally opposed the war.
second it encouraged the growth of american industries to manufacture products no longer available from britain because of the war.
third it confirmed the status of the united states as a free and independent nation background napoleon bonaparte seized control of the french government in 1799 and expanded french territory until his defeat at waterloo in belgium in 1815.

1 review unit 115 nationalism shapes foreign policy as with james madison foreign affairs dominated the first term of president james monroe who was elected in 1816.
his secretary of state john quincy adams established a foreign policy based on nationalism a belief that national interests should be placed ahead of regional concerns such as slavery in the south or tariffs in the northeast.
territory and boundaries high on adams s list of national interests were the security of the nation and the expansion of its territory.
to further these interests adams arranged the convention of 1818 which fixed the u s border at the 49th parallel from michigan west to the rocky mountains.
adams also reached a compromise with britain to jointly occupy the oregon territory the territory west of the rockies for ten years.
he also convinced don luis de onis the spanish minister to the united states to transfer florida to the united states.
the adams oms treaty 1819 also established a western boundary for the united states that extended along the sabine river from the gulf of mexico north to the arkansas river to its source and then north to the 42nd parallel and west to the pacific ocean.
the monroe doctrine when napoleon invaded portugal and spain in 1807 the two countries did not have the money or military force to both defend themselves and keep control of their overseas territories at the same time.
but when napoleon was defeated in 1815 portugal and spain wanted to reclaim their former colonies in latin america.
meanwhile the russians who had been in alaska since 1784 were establishing trading posts in what is now california.
in 1821 czar alexander i of russia main idea summarizing what were the major boundary disputes resolved by john quincy adams.
u s boundary settlements 1803 1819 claimed that alaska s southern boundary was the 51st parallel just north of vancouver island.
he forbade foreign vessels from using the coast north of this line.
with spain and portugal trying to move back into their old colonial areas and with russia pushing in from the northwest the united states knew that it had to do something.
many americans were interested in acquiring northern mexico and the spanish colony of cuba.
moreover the russian action posed a threat to american trade with china which brought huge profits.
i main idea predicting effects do you think that the monroe doctrine would be a source of peace or conflict for the united states.
accordingly in his 1823 message to congress president monroe warned all european powers not to interfere with affairs in the western hemisphere.
they should not attempt to create new colonies he said or try to overthrow the newly independent republics in the hemisphere.
the united states would consider such action dangerous to our peace and safety.
at the same time the united states would not involve itself in european affairs or interfere with existing colonies in the western hemisphere.
a personal voice president james monroe our policy in regard to europe is not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers.
but in regard to those continents of the western hemisphere circumstances are eminently and conspicuously different.
it is impossible that the allied european powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness 9 annual message to congress december 2 1823 james monroe these principles became known as the monroe doctrine.
the doctrine became a foundation for future american policy and represented an important step onto the world stage by the assertive young nation.

review unit 117 ig marbury v madison 1803 origins of the case a few days before thomas jefferson s inauguration outgoing president john adams appointed william marbury to be a justice of the peace.
but the commission was not delivered to marbury.
later jefferson s new secretary of state james madison refused to give marbury the commission.
marbury asked the supreme court to force madison to give him his commission.
the ruling the court declared that the law on which marbury based his claim was unconstitutional and therefore it refused to order madison to give marbury his commission.
legal reasoning writing for the court chief justice john marshall decided that marbury had a right to his commission and he scolded madison at length for refusing to deliver it.
however he then considered marbury s claim that under the judiciary act of 1789 the supreme court should order madison to deliver the commission.
as marshall pointed out the powers of the supreme court are set by the constitution and congress does not have the authority to alter them.
the judiciary act attempted to do just that.
marshall reasoned that since the constitution is the supreme law of the land no law that goes against the constitution can be valid.
the courts are to regard the constitution and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature the constitution and not such ordinary act must govern the case to which they both apply.
if an act of congress violates the constitution then a judge must uphold the constitution and declare the act void.
in choosing to obey the constitution the supreme court did declare the judiciary act unconstitutional and void and so refused to i grant marbury s request.

cohens v virginia 1821 the court overturned a state court decision for the first time.
gibbons v ogden 1824 the court ruled that the federal congress not the states had the power under the constitution to regulate interstate commerce.
chief justice john marshall william marbury why it mattered in 1803 interest in marbury s commission was primarily about partisan politics.
the fight was just one skirmish in the ongoing battle between federalists such as adams and democratic republicans led by jefferson and madison which had intensified in the election of 1800.
when jefferson won the election adams made a final effort to hinder jefferson s promised reforms.
before leaving office he tried to fill the government with federalists including the midnight justices such as marbury.
madison s refusal to deliver marbury s appointment was part of jefferson s subsequent effort to rid his administration of federalists.
marshall s opinion in marbury might seem like a victory for jefferson because it denied marbury his commission.
however by scolding madison and extending the principle of judicial review the power of courts to decide whether or not specific laws are valid the court sent a message to jefferson and to the congress that the judiciary had the power to affect legislation.
the marshall court however never declared another act of congress unconstitutional.
historical impact in striking down part of the judiciary act an act of congress marshall gave new force to the principle of judicial review.
the legacy of john marshall and of marbury is that judicial review has become an essential component of democratic government by ensuring that congress exercises only those powers granted by the constitution the courts protect the sovereignty of the people.
of equal importance the principle of judicial review plays a vital role in our federal system of checks and balances.
with marbury the judicial branch secured its place as one of three coequal branches of the federal government.
the judiciary has no power to make laws or to carry them out.
however judges have an important role in deciding what the law is and how it is carried out.
interpretations of the constitution can differ.
in another decision mcculloch v maryland 1819 chief justice marshall expressed the opinion that article i section 8 of the constitution guaranteed to congress implied powers that are not explicitly stated.
such an interpretation is called a loose construction of the constitution which means it allows for reasonable inferences based on the text.
a strict construction on the other hand allows only for a literal reading of the text.
each supreme court justice has his or her own ideas about how to interpret the constitution.
as these justices decide cases their rulings may change the meaning of the constitution by determining the rights of citizens and the government.
through the 2007 2008 term the court had rendered 162 decisions striking down in whole or part acts of congress.
it had also voided or restricted the enforcement of state laws 1 179 times.
that the entire country has with few exceptions obeyed these decisions no matter how strongly they disagreed proves americans faith in the supreme court as the protector of the rule of law.

quoted in steamboats come true american inventors in action steamboats like the one fulton described did more than comfortably transport passengers.
they also carried freight and played an important role in uniting the nation economically.
although tensions continued to arise between the different sections of the nation a growing national spirit kept the country together.
this spirit was ultimately personified by andrew jackson a self made man from the growing west who was both confident and dynamic.
regional economies create differences in the early decades of the 19th century the economies of the various regions of the united states developed differently.
the northeast began to industrialize while the south and west continued to be more agricultural.
10 chapter 3 the growth of a young nation main idea analyzing causes how did agriculture and industry support a market economy in the north.
early industry in the united states the industrial revolution large scale production resulting in massive change in social and economic organization began in great britain in the 18th century and gradually reached the united states.
industry took off first in new england whose economy depended on shipping and foreign trade.
agriculture there was not highly profitable so new englanders were more ready than other americans to embrace new forms of manufacturing and prime among these were mechanized textile or fabric mills.
soon farmers in the north began to specialize in one or two crops or types of livestock such as corn and cattle sell what they produced to urban markets and then purchase with cash whatever else they needed from stores.
increasingly these were items made in northern factories.
as a result a market economy began to develop in which agriculture and manufacturing each supported the growth of the other.
the south remains agricultural meanwhile the south continued to grow as an agricultural power.
eli whitney s invention of a cotton gin short for engine or machine in 1793 made it possible for southern farmers to produce cotton more profitably.
the emergence of a cotton kingdom in the south and the cotton gin in 1794 eli whitney was granted a patent for a new and useful improvement in the mode of ginning cotton workers who previously could clean only one pound of cotton by hand per day could now clean as much as fifty pounds per day.

7 review unit 121 thus the need for more field labor contributed to the expansion of slavery.
between 1790 and 1820 the enslaved population increased from less than 700 000 to over 1 5 million.
in the north things were different.
by 1804 states north of delaware had either abolished slavery or had enacted laws for gradual emancipation.
slavery declined in the north but some slaves remained there for decades.
vocabulary emancipation the act of freeing from bondage or slavery balancing nationalism and sectionalism these economic differences often created political tensions between the different sections of the nation.
throughout the first half of the 19th century however american leaders managed to keep the nation together.
historical spotlight the supreme court boosts national power as henry clay promoted the american system in an effort to strengthen nationalism the supreme court also boosted national power with two significant decisions.
in mcculloch v maryland 1819 the high court denied maryland the right to tax the bank of the united states thus strengthening the authority of the national government over state governments.
in gibbons v ogden 1824 the court further bolstered federal power by affirming the national governments right to regulate interstate commerce.
clays american system as the north south and west developed different economies president madison developed a plan to move the united states toward economic independence from britain and other european powers.
in 1815 he presented his plan to congress.
it included three major points establishing a protective tariff rechartering the national bank sponsoring the development of transportation systems and other internal improvements in order to make travel throughout the nation easier house speaker henry clay promoted the plan as the american system.
madison and clay supported tariffs on imports to protect u s industry from british competition.
most northeasterners also welcomed protective tariffs.
however people in the south and west whose livelihoods did not depend on manufacturing were not as eager to tax european imports.
nevertheless clay who was from the west kentucky and john c calhoun a southerner south carolina convinced congressmen from their regions to approve the tariff of 1816.
also in 1816 congress voted to charter the second bank of the united states for a 20 year period and to create a unified currency.

main idea analyzing motives what was the intention behind the american system.
the missouri compromise in spite of these efforts to unify the national economy sectional conflicts remained part of american politics.
in 1818 settlers in missouri requested admission to the union.
northerners and southerners disagreed however on whether missouri should be admitted as a free state or a slave state.
behind the leadership of henry clay congress passed a series of agreements in 1820 1821 known as the missouri compromise.
under these agreements maine was admitted as a free state and missouri as a slave state.
the rest of the louisiana territory was split into two parts.
the dividing line was set at 3630 north latitude.
south of the line slavery was legal.
north of the line except in missouri slavery was banned.
the election of andrew jackson despite these sectional tensions the story of america in the early 19th century was one of expansion expanding economies expanding territory and expanding democracy.
the man who embraced the spirit of that expansion and to many personified it was andrew jackson who captured the presidency in 1828 j main idea summarizing what agreements made up the missouri compromise.
2 chapter 3 the growth of a young nation vocabulary corrupt marked by bribery the election of 1824 in 1824 andrew jackson lost his bid for the presidency to john quincy adams.
jacksonians or followers of jackson accused adams and jackson s political enemy henry clay of stealing the presidency.
then because adams appointed clay secretary of state the jacksonians claimed adams had struck a corrupt bargain.
the split between clay and jackson tore apart the democratic republican party.
while clay and his faction were called the national republican party the jacksonians became known as the democratic party.
expanding democracy changes politics during john quincy adams s presidency most states had eased property requirements for voting thereby enlarging the voting population.
in the election of 1824 approximately 350 000 white males voted for the presidency.
in 1828 over three times that number voted.
many of these new voters were common people who viewed the rugged westerner jackson as their champion.
the support of this new voting bloc gave jackson victory in the election of 1828.

jacksonian democracy the spoils system jackson s ideal of political power for all classes is often called jacksonian democracy.
as part of this philosophy jackson sought to give common people a chance to participate in government.
he did this through the spoils system in which new administrations hire their own supporters to replace supporters of the previous administration.
using the spoils system jackson gave away huge numbers of jobs to friends and also to political allies.

however the cherokee nation refused and fought the government in the courts.

nullification and the bank war in 1824 and again in 1828 congress increased the tariff of 1816.
jacksons vice president john c calhoun of south carolina called the 1828 tariff a tariff of abominations because he blamed it for economic problems in the south.
the south s economy depended on cotton exports.
yet the high tariff on manufactured goods reduced british exports to the united states and because of this britain bought less cotton.
with the decline of british goods the south was now forced to buy the more expensive northern manufactured goods.
from the south s point of view the north was getting rich at the expense of the south.
the nullification crisis to try to free south carolinians from the tariff calhoun developed a theory of nullification.
calhoun s theory held that the u s constitution was based on a compact among the sovereign states.
if the constitution had been established by 13 sovereign states he reasoned then the states must still be sovereign and each would have the right to determine whether acts of congress were constitutional.
if a state found an act to be unconstitutional the state could declare the offending law nullified or inoperative within its borders.
the senate debated the tariff question and the underlying states rights issue senator daniel webster of massachusetts opposed nullification and south carolina senator robert hayne aired calhouns views.

review unit 125 in 1832 the issue of states rights was put to a test when congress raised tariffs again.
south carolinians declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 null void and no law.
then they threatened to secede or withdraw from the union if customs officials tried to collect duties.
in response an outraged jackson urged congress to pass the force bill to allow the federal government to use the military if state authorities resisted paying proper duties.
a bloody confrontation seemed likely until henry clay forged a compromise in 1833.
clay proposed a tariff bill that would gradually lower duties over a ten year period.
the compromise also included passage of the force bill.
the tension between states rights and federal authority subsided temporarily.
jacksons bank war although jackson defended federal power in the nullification crisis he tried to decrease federal power when it came to the second bank of the united states.
jackson believed that the national bank was an agent of the wealthy and that its members cared nothing for the common people.
in 1832 jackson won reelection despite the efforts of his critics to make a campaign issue out of jackson s opposition to the bank.
after his reelection he tried to kill the bank by withdrawing all government deposits from the bank s branches and placing them in certain state banks called pet banks because of their loyalty to the democratic party.
as a result the bank of the united states became just another bank.
jackson won the bank war but his tactics and policies angered many people.
many accused him of acting more like a king than a president.
in 1832 his opponents formed a new political party which they later called the whig party.
main idea analyzing motives what were some of jacksons reasons for opposing the second bank of the united states.
analyzing political cartoons andrew the first andrew jackson once justified his tendency to place personal prerogative above constitutional law or national policy by stating that one man with courage makes a majority his critics replied with accusations of tyranny.
the new york american condemned jackson as a maniac who would trample the rights of our people under his feet the whig convention of 1834 declared your president has become your monarch both of those sentiments are reflected in this political cartoon that portrays jackson as a king.
ancient portraits of kings often depicted them grinding their conquered enemies beneath their heel.
beneath jacksons feet are the torn pages of the constitution.
in one hand jackson is holding a scepter a symbol of kingly power while in the other he is holding the veto a symbol of presidential power.

chapter 3 the growth of a young nation main idea analyzing causes how did wildcat banks contribute to the panic of 1837.
successors deal with jacksons legacy when jackson announced that he would not run for a third term in 1836 the democrats chose vice president martin van buren as their candidate.
the newly formed whig party ran three regional candidates against him.
with jackson s support however van buren easily won the election.
the panic of 1837 along with the presidency however van buren inherited the consequences of jackson s bank war.
many of the pet banks that accepted federal deposits were wildcat banks that printed bank notes wildly in excess of the gold and silver they had on deposit.
such wildcat banks were doomed to fail when people tried to redeem their currency for gold or silver.
by may 1837 many banks stopped accepting paper currency.
in the panic of 1837 bank closings and the collapse of the credit system cost many people their savings bankrupted hundreds of businesses and put more than a third of the population out of work.
harrison and tyler in 1840 van buren ran for reelection against whig party candidate william henry harrison who was known as tippecanoe for a battle he won against native americans in 1811.
the whigs blamed van buren for the weak economy and portrayed harrison the old war hero as a man of the people and van buren as an aristocrat.
harrison won the election but died just a month after his inauguration.
john tyler harrison s vice president became president.
a strong minded virginian and former democrat tyler opposed many parts of the whig program.
he halted hopes for significant whig reforms.
the democrat and whig parties went on to dominate national politics until the 1850s.
the new politicians appealed more to passion than to reason.
they courted popularity in a way that john quincy adams and his predecessors never would have.
thus the style of politics in america had changed drastically since the 1790s.
political speeches became a form of mass entertainment involving far more americans in the political process.
also the west was playing an increasing role in national politics.
that trend would continue as more americans moved to places like texas and california.

at its worst the conflict resulted in the civil war.
today state and federal governments continue to square off on jurisdictional issues.
in 1996 the supreme court ruled that congressional districts in texas and north carolina that had been redrawn to increase minority representation were unconstitutional.
in 2000 the supreme court agreed to hear another case in the ongoing since 1979 dispute between the federal government and the state of alaska over who has authority to lease offshore land for oil and gas drilling.
constitutional conflicts between states rights and federal jurisdiction are pictured here.
as you read see how each issue was resolved.
constitutional convention issue the constitution tried to resolve the original debate over states rights versus federal authority.
at the constitutional convention in philadelphia delegates wanted to create a federal government that was stronger than the one created by the articles of confederation.
but delegates disagreed about whether the federal government should have more power than the states.
they also disagreed about whether large states should have more power than small states in the national legislature.
the convention compromised the constitution reserves certain powers for the states delegates other powers to the federal government divides some powers between state and federal governments and tries to balance the differing needs of the states through two houses of congress.
nullification issue the state of south carolina moved to nullify or declare void a tariff set by congress.
in the cartoon above president andrew jackson right is playing a game called bragg.
one of his opponents vice president john c calhoun is hiding two cards nullification and anti tariff behind him.
jackson is doing poorly in this game but he eventually won the real nullification dispute.
when congress passed high tariffs on imports in 1832 politicians from south carolina led by calhoun tried to nullify the tariff law or declare it void.
jackson threatened to enforce the law with federal troops.
congress reduced the tariff to avoid a confrontation and calhoun resigned the vice presidency.
chapter 3 the growth of a young nation 118 1 iw south carolinas secession issue the conflict over a states right to secede or withdraw from the union led to the civil war.
in december 1860 southern secessionists cheered secession enthusiastically in front of the mills house left a hotel in charleston south carolina.
south carolina seceded after the election of abraham lincoln whom the south perceived as anti states rights and antislavery.
lincoln took the position that states did not have the right to secede from the union.
in 1861 he ordered that provisions be sent to the federal troops stationed at fort sumter in charleston harbor.
south carolinians fired on the fort and the civil war was under way.
the unions victory in the war ended the most serious challenge to federal authority states did not have the right to secede from the union.
little rock central high school issue some southern governors refused to obey federal desegregation mandates for schools.
in 1957 president eisenhower mobilized federal troops in little rock arkansas to enforce the supreme courts 1954 ruling in the case of brown v board of education of topeka.
this ruling made segregation in public schools illegal.
the arkansas national guard escorted nine african american students into little rock central high school against the wishes of governor orval faubus who had tried to prevent the students from entering the school.
after this incident faubus closed the high schools in little rock in 1958 and 1959 thereby avoiding desegregation.

in 1821 stephen f austin led the first of several groups of american settlers to a fertile area along the brazos river.
drawn by the promise of inexpensive land and economic opportunity austin established a colony of american settlers in tejas or texas then the northernmost province of the mexican state of coahuila.
however austin s plans didn t work out as well as he had hoped 12 years later he found himself in a mexican prison and his new homeland in an uproar.
after his release austin spoke about the impending crisis between texas and mexico.
a personal voice stephen f austin texas needs peace and a local government its inhabitants are farmers and they need a calm and quiet life.
but my efforts to serve texas involved me in the labyrinth of mexican politics.

can this state of things exist without precipitating the country into a war.
i think it cannot.
quoted in lone star a history of texas and texans stephen f austin austin s prediction was correct.
war did break out in texas twice.
first texans rebelled against the mexican government.
then the united states went to war against mexico over the boundaries of texas.
these conflicts were the climax of decades of competition over the western half of north america a competition that involved the united states mexico native americans and various european nations.
the end result of the competition would be u s control over a huge swath of the continent from the atlantic to the pacific.
settling the frontier as various presidents established policies in the early 19th century that expanded u s territory american settlers pushed first into the northwest territorv and then headed farther west.
y 130chapter 3 the growth of a young nation main idea predicting effects how might manifest destiny later affect u s relations with native americans.
americans pursue manifest destiny for a quarter century after the war of 1812 only a few americans explored the west.
then in the 1840s expansion fever gripped the country.
many americans began to believe that their movement westward was predestined by god.
the phrase manifest destiny expressed the belief that the united states was ordained to expand to the pacific ocean and into mexican and native american territory.
many americans also believed that this destiny was manifest or obvious and inevitable.
most americans had practical reasons for moving west.
for settlers the abundance of land was the greatest attraction.
as the number of western settlers climbed merchants and manufacturers followed seeking new markets for their goods.
many americans also trekked west because of personal economic problems in the east.
the panic of 1837 for example had disastrous background the mormon religion was controversial for its belief in polygamy a practice that allowed a man to have more than one wife.
consequences and convinced many americans that they would be better off attempting a fresh start in the west.
trails west the settlers and traders who made the trek west used a series of old native american trails as well as new routes.
one of the busiest routes was the santa fe trail which stretched 780 miles from independence missouri to santa fe in the mexican province of new mexico.
see map on page 132.
each spring from 1821 through the 1860s american traders loaded their covered wagons with goods and set off toward santa fe.
for about the first 150 miles traders traveled individually.
after that fearing attacks by native americans traders banded into organized groups of up to 100 wagons.
cooperation though came to an abrupt end when santa fe came into view.
traders raced off on their own as each tried to be the first to arrive.
after a few days of trading they loaded their wagons with goods restocked their animals and headed back to missouri.
the oregon trail stretched from independence missouri to oregon city oregon.
it was blazed in 1836 by two methodist missionaries named marcus and narcissa whitman.
by driving their wagon as far as fort boise near present day boise idaho they proved that wagons could travel on the oregon trail.
following the whitmans lead many pioneers migrated west on the oregon trail.
some bought prairie schooners wooden wheeled wagons covered with sailcloth and pulled by oxen.
most walked however pushing handcarts loaded with a few precious possessions food and other supplies.
the trip took months even if all went well.
the mormon migration one group migrated westward along the oregon trail to escape persecution.
these people were the mormons a religious community that would play a major role in the development of the west.
founded by joseph smith in upstate new york in 1827 the mormon community moved to ohio and then illinois to escape persecution.
after an anti mormon mob murdered smith a leader named brigham young urged the mormons to move farther west.
thousands of believers walked to nebraska across wyoming to the rockies and then southwest in 1847 the mormons stopped at the edge of the desert near the great salt lake in what is now utah.

james pierson beckwourth or beckwirth was the toughest kind of pioneer a mountain man.
the son of an african american woman he ventured westward with a fur trading expedition in 1823 and found the place that would become his home for nearly the next quarter century the rocky mountains.
he greatly impressed the crow who gave him the name bloody arm because of his skill as a fighter.
beckwourth served from 1837 until 1848 as an army scout and trading post operator.
in 1848 he discovered a passage in the sierra nevada range that led to californias sacramento valley and decided to settle down near the pass and become a rancher.

main idea developing historical perspective why did many americans initially settle in texas.
declared this is the place.
soon they had coaxed settlements and farms from the bleak landscape by irrigating their fields.
salt lake city blossomed out of the land the mormons called deseret.
setting boundaries in the early 1840s great britain still claimed areas near the canadian border in parts of what are now maine and minnesota.
the webster ashburton treaty of 1842 settled these territorial disputes in the east and the midwest but the two nations merely continued the joint occupation of the oregon territory that they had first established in 1818.
in 1846 the two countries agreed to extend the mainland boundary along the 49th parallel westward from the rocky mountains to puget sound establishing the current boundary between the united states and canada.
unfortunately establishing the boundary in the southwest with mexico would not be so peaceful.
texan independence after 300 years of spanish rule only a few thousand mexican settlers had migrated to what is now texas.
after 1820 that changed as texas became an important region in mexico and then an independent republic.
mexican independence and texan land grants the mission system used by spain declined after mexico had won independence from spain in 1821.
after freeing the missions from spanish control the mexican government offered the surrounding lands to government officials and ranchers.
to make the land more secure and stable the mexican government also encouraged americans to settle in texas.
many americans rushed at the chance to buy inexpensive land in texas.
the population of anglo or english speaking settlers from the united states soon surpassed the population of tejanos or mexican settlers who lived in texas.
among the more prominent leaders of these american settlers was stephen e austin.
austin s father moses austin had received a land grant from spain to establish a colony between the brazos and colorado rivers but died before he was able to carry out his plans.
stephen obtained permission first from spain and then from mexico after it had won its independence to carry out his father s project.
in 1821 he established a colony where no drunkard no gambler no profane swearer and no idler would be allowed.
the main settlement of the colony was named san felipe de austin in stephen s honor.
by 1825 austin had issued 297 land grants to the group that later became known as texas s old three hundred.
each family received either 177 very inexpensive acres of farmland or 4 428 acres for stock grazing as well as a 10 year exemption from paying taxes.
i am convinced austin said that i could take on fifteen hundred families as easily as three hundred if permitted to do so.
by 1830 there were more than 20 000 americans in texas.
the texas revolution despite peaceful cooperation between anglos and tejanos differences over cultural issues intensified between anglos and the mexican government.
the overwhelmingly protestant anglo settlers spoke english instead of spanish.
furthermore many of the settlers were southerners who had brought slaves with them to texas.
mexico which had abolished slavery in 1829 insisted in vain that the texans free their slaves.
meanwhile mexican politics had become increasingly unstable.
austin had traveled to mexico city late in 1833 to present petitions to mexican president antonio lopez de santa anna for greater self government for texas.
while austin was on his way home santa anna had austin imprisoned for inciting revolution after santa anna suspended local powers in texas and other review unit 133 mexican states several rebellions broke out including one that would be known as the texas revolution.
when austin returned to texas in 1835 he was convinced that war was its only resource.
determined to force texas to obey mexican law santa anna marched his army toward san antonio.
at the same time austin and his followers issued a call for texans to arm themselves.
jgj the alamo the commander of the anglo troops lieutenant colonel william travis moved his men into the alamo a mission and fort in the center of san antonio.
travis believed that maintaining control of the alamo would prevent santa anna s movement farther north.
from february 23 1836 santa anna and his troops attacked the rebels holed up in the alamo.
on march 2 1836 as the battle for the alamo raged texans declared their independence from mexico and quickly ratified a constitution based on that of the united states.
the 13 day siege finally ended on march 6 1836 when mexican troops scaled the alamo s walls.
all 187 u s defenders and hundreds of mexicans died.
later in march santa anna s troops executed 300 rebels at goliad.
the alamo and the goliad executions whipped the texan rebels into a fury.

santa anna served as president of mexico 11 times.
santa anna was a complex man with much charm.
he sacrificed his considerable wealth to return again and again to the battlefield and died in poverty almost forgotten.

the texans killed 630 of santa anna s soldiers in 18 minutes and captured santa anna himself.
the texans set santa anna free only after he signed the treaty of velasco which granted independence to texas.
in september 1836 sam houston was elected president of the new republic of texas.
texas moves toward the union most texans hoped that the united states would annex their republic but u s opinion divided along sectional lines.
southerners wanted texas in order to extend slavery which already had been established there.
northerners feared that the annexation of more slave territory would tip the uneasy balance in the senate in favor of slave states and prompt war with mexico.
the 1844 u s presidential campaign focused on westward expansion.
the winner james k polk a slaveholder firmly favored the annexation of texas.
the war with mexico in march 1845 angered by u s texas negotiation on annexation the mexican government recalled its ambassador from washington.
on december 29 1845 texas entered the union.
events moved quickly toward war.
history video independence for texas 71 polk urges war president polk believed that war with mexico would bring not only texas into the union but also new mexico and california.
hence the president supported texan claims in disputes with mexico over the texas mexico border.
while texas insisted that its southern border extended to the rio grande mexico maintained that texas s border stopped at the nueces river 100 150 miles northeast of the rio grande.
despite the fact that mexico had ceased formal diplomatic relations with the u s polk hoped to negotiate secretly the boundary dispute as well as the sale of california and new mexico.
he dispatched john slidell a congressman from louisiana to negotiate both matters.

on february 2 1848 the united states and mexico signed the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo.
mexico agreed to the rio grande as the border between texas and mexico and ceded the new mexico and california territories to the united states.
the united chapter 3 the growth of a young nation states agreed to pay 15 million for the mexican cession which included present day california nevada new mexico utah most of arizona and parts of colorado and wyoming.
five years later in 1853 president franklin pierce authorized james gadsden to pay mexico an additional 10 million for another piece of territory south of the gila river in order to secure a southern railroad route to the pacific ocean.
along with the settlement of the oregon boundary and the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo the gadsden purchase established the current borders of the contiguous 48 states.

quoted in erie water west when the canal was completed it stretched 363 miles from albany new york to lake erie.
the human made waterway ushered in a new era in which technology and improved transportation sent new products to markets across the united states.
i a lock on the erie canal in lockport new york shown here in an 1838 engraving was one of 83 that helped link the great lakes with the northeast.
the market revolution changes like those brought by the erie canal contributed to vast economic changes in the first half of the 19th century in the united states.
in this period known as the market revolution people increasingly bought and sold goods rather than make them for themselves.

in the 1840s alone the national economy grew more than it had in the first 40 years of the century.
the quickening pace of u s economic growth coincided with the growth of free enterprise the freedom of private businesses to operate competitively for profit with little government regulation.
in their pursuit of profit businessmen called entrepreneurs from a french word that means to undertake invested their own money in new industries.
in doing this entrepreneurs risked losing their investment if a venture failed but they also stood to earn huge profits if it succeeded.

while some inventions simply made life more enjoyable others fueled the economic revolution and transformed manufacturing transportation and communication.
new communication links began to put people into instant contact with one another.
in 1837 samuel f b morse a new england artist patented the telegraph which sent messages in code over a wire in a matter of seconds.
businesses used the new communication device to transmit orders and relay up to date information on prices and sales.
the new railroads employed the telegraph to keep trains moving regularly and to warn engineers of safety hazards.
by 1854 23 000 miles of telegraph wire crossed the country.
meanwhile better transportation systems improved the movement of people and goods.
in 1807 pennsylvanian robert fulton had ushered in the steamboat era when his boat the clermont made the 150 mile trip up the hudson river from new york city to albany in 32 hours a remarkable speed for that era.
by 1830 200 steamboats traveled the nation s western rivers that flowed into the mississippi river.
steamboats slashed freight rates as well as voyage times.
water transport was particularly important in moving raw materials such as lead copper and heavy main idea synthesizing how did entrepreneurs contribute to the market revolution.
from telegraph to internet what do the telegraph and the internet have in common.
they are both tools for instant communication.
while the telegraph relied on a network of wires that spanned the country the internet an international network of smaller computer networks allows any computer user to communicate instantly with any other computer user in the world.
morse code in 1837 samuel morse patents the telegraph the first instant electronic communicator.
morse taps on a key to send bursts of electricity down a wire to the receiver where an operator translates the coded bursts into understandable language within seconds.
chapter 3 icltrnui t m xoro alexander graham bell invents the telephone which relies on a steady stream of electricity rather than electrical bursts to transmit sounds.
by 1900 there are over one million telephones in the united states.
marconi radio in 1895 guglielmo marconi an italian inventor sends telegraph code through the air as electromagnetic waves.
by the early 1900s the wireless makes voice transmissions possible.
commercial radio stations are broadcasting music and entertainment programs by the 1920s.
main idea summarizing how did technology influence both the north and the midwest in the 1840s.
where waterways didn t exist americans made them by building canals.
by the 1840s america boasted more than 3 300 miles of canals.
canals however soon gave way to railroads which offered the important advantage of speed as well as winter travel.
developed in england in the early 1800s steam powered locomotives began operating in the united states in the 1830s.
by 1850 over 9 000 miles of track had been laid across the united states.
the market revolution transforms the nation although most americans during the early 1800s still lived in rural areas and only 14 percent of workers had manufacturing jobs these workers produced more and better goods at lower prices than ever before.
many of these goods became affordable for ordinary americans and improvements in transportation allowed people to purchase items manufactured in distant places.
by the 1840s improved transportation and communication also made america s regions more interdependent.
steamboats went up as well as down the mississippi linking north to south.
the erie canal and eventually railroads and telegraph wires soon linked the east and the west.
heavy investment in canals and railroads transformed the northeast into the center of american commerce.
as the northeast began to industrialize many people then moved away to farm the fertile soil of the midwest.
they employed new machines such as the john deere steel plow for cultivating the tough prairie sod and cyrus mccormick s reaper for harvesting grain.
meanwhile most of the south remained agricultural and relied on such crops as cotton tobacco and rice.
changing workplaces the new market economy in the united states did not only affect what people bought and sold it also changed the ways americans worked.
moving production from the home to the factory split families created new communities and transformed relationships between employers and employees.
by the mid 19th century new machines allowed unskilled workers to perform tasks that once had taken the effort of trained artisans.
to do this work though workers needed factories.
television in the late 1800s scientists begin to experiment with transmitting pictures as well as words through the air.
in 1923 vladimir zworykin a russian born american scientist files a patent for the suitable for broadcast kinescope the picture in 1929 zworykin all electronic television.

the internet becomes the modern tool for instant global communication not only of words but images too.
and it is just as amazing now as the telegraph was in its time.
review unit 141 the lowell textile mills in the 1820s a group of entrepreneurs built several large textile mills in lowell massachusetts.
the lowell textile mills soon became booming enterprises.
thousands of people mostly women left family farms to find work in lowell.
mill owners sought female employees because women provided an abundant source of labor and owners could pay lower wages to women than men.
to the girls in the mills though textile work offered better pay than their main alternatives teaching sewing and domestic work.
in letters written in 1846 to her father in new hampshire 16 year old mary paul expressed her satisfaction with her situation at lowell.
a personal voice mary paul i have a very good boarding place have enough to eat.
the girls are all kind and obliging.
i think that the factory is the best place for me and if any girl wants employment i advise them to come to lowell.
quoted in women and the american experience a young mill girl from around 1840.
her swollen hands suggest that she worked as a warper someone who straightened the strands of cotton or wool as they entered the loom.
before long however work conditions deteriorated.
the workday at lowell was more than 12 hours long.
in addition mills often were dark hot and cramped.
factory owners often showed little sympathy for the plight of workers.
in the mid 1840s one mill manager said i regard my workpeople just as i regard my machinery.
so long as they can do my work for what i choose to pay them i keep them getting out of them all i can.
main idea workers seek better conditions as industry grew strikes began to break out when workers protested poor working conditions and low wages.
workers strike in 1834 when the lowell mills announced a 15 percent wage cut 800 mill girls organized a strike a work stoppage to force an employer to respond to demands.
criticized by the lowell press and clergy most of the strikers agreed to return to work at reduced wages.
the mill owners fired the strike leader.
in 1836 lowell mill workers struck again but as in 1834 the company won and most of the strikers returned to their jobs.
although only 1 or 2 percent of workers in the united states were organized the 1830s and 1840s saw dozens of strikes many for higher wages but some for shorter hours.
employers defeated most of these strikes because they could easily replace unskilled workers with people recently arrived from europe who desperately needed jobs.
immigration increases european immigration leaving one country and settling in another rose dramatically in the united states between 1830 and 1860.
between 1845 and 1854 alone nearly 3 million immigrants were added to the population.
more than 1 million were irish immigrants who fled their homeland after a disease on potatoes caused the great potato famine and led to mass starvation.
irish immigrants faced prejudice both because they were roman catholic and because they were poor.
frightened by allegations of a catholic conspiracy to take over the country protestant mobs in big cities constantly harassed them.
other workers resented the irish for their willingness to work as cheap labor a willingness that made them more desirable to employers.
making inferences what was the attitude of many factory owners toward their workers.
main idea summarizing why were most labor strikes of the 1880s and 1840s ineffective.
background during the great potato famine of 1845 1849 about 1 000 000 irish died of starvation and disease.
chapter 3 the growth of a young nation european immigrants arriving in new york city from a colored engraving made in 1858 national trades union amid the growing labor unrest in the 1830s the trade unions in different towns began to join together to expand their power.
journeymen s organizations from several industries united in 1834 to form the national trades union.
the national trade union movement faced fierce opposition from bankers and owners.
in addition workers efforts to organize were at first hampered by court decisions declaring strikes illegal.
in 1842 however the massachusetts supreme court supported the workers right to strike in the case of commonwealth v hunt.
the workplace was not the only area of american life that experienced unrest in the mid 19th century.
indeed a series of religious and social reform movements went hand in hand with these economic changes.

james forten s great grandfather had been brought from africa to the american colonies in chains but james was born free.
by the 1830s forten had become a wealthy sailmaker.
a leader of philadelphia s free black community forten took an active role in a variety of political causes.
when some people argued that free blacks should return to africa forten disagreed and responded with sarcasm.
a personal voice james forten here i have dwelt until i am nearly sixty years of age and have brought up and educated a family.
yet some ingenious gentlemen have recently discovered that i am still an african that a continent three thousand miles and more from the place where i was born is my native country.
and i am advised to go home.
perhaps if i should only be set on the shore of that distant land i should recognize all i might see there and run at once to the old hut where my forefathers lived a hundred years ago 9 quoted in forging freedom the formation of philadelphias black community 1720 1840 forten s unwavering belief that he was an american not only led him to oppose colonization the effort to resettle free blacks in africa but also pushed him fervently to oppose slavery.
forten was joined in his opposition to slavery by a growing number of americans in the 19th century.
abolition the movement to abolish slavery became the most important of a series of reform movements in america.
james forten a spiritual awakening inspires reform many of these movements had their roots in a spiritual awakening that swept the nation after 1790.
people involved in these movements began to emphasize individual responsibility for seeking salvation and insisted that people could improve themselves and society.
these religious attitudes were closely linked to 1 main idea evaluating how did the existence of separate black churches benefit the african american community.
the ideas of jacksonian democracy that stressed the importance and power of the common person.
the second great awakening the second great awakening was a widespread christian movement to awaken religious sentiments that lasted from the 1790s to the 1830s.
the primary forum for the movement was the revival meeting where participants attempted to revive religious faith through impassioned preaching.
revival meetings might last for days as participants studied the bible reflected on their lives and heard emotional sermons.
revivalism had a strong impact on the american public.
according to one estimate in 1800 just 1 in 15 americans belonged to a church but by 1850 1 in 6 was a member.
unitarians and transcendentalists another growing religious group was the unitarians who shared with revivalism a faith in the individual.
but instead of appealing to emotions unitarians emphasized reason as the path to perfection.
as the second great awakening reached its maturity in the 1830s another kind of awakening led by a writer philosopher and former unitarian minister named ralph waldo emerson began in new england.
in 1831 emerson traveled to england where he discovered romanticism an artistic and intellectual movement that emphasized nature human emotions and the imagination.
from these romantic ideals emerson along with other thinkers developed a philosophy called transcendentalism which emphasized that truth could be discovered intuitively by observing nature and relating it to one s own emotional and spiritual experience.
the african american church the urge to reform was growing among african americans too.
slaves in the rural south heard the same sermons and sang the same hymns as did their owners but they often interpreted the stories they heard especially those describing the exodus from egypt as a promise of freedom.
in the north however free african americans were able to form their own churches.
these churches often became political cultural and social centers for african americans by providing schools and other services that whites denied free blacks.
i slavery and abolition by the 1820s abolition the movement to free african americans from slavery had taken hold.
more than 100 antislavery societies were advocating that african americans be resettled in africa.
in 1817 the american colonization society had been founded to encourage black emigration.
other abolitionists however demanded that african americans remain in the united states as free citizens.
william lloyd garrison the most radical white abolitionist was a young editor named william lloyd garrison.
active in religious reform movements in massachusetts garrison became the editor of an antislavery paper in 1828.
three years later he established his own paper the liberator to deliver an uncompromising demand immediate emancipation.

in the 1830s however that position game p port.
whites who opposed abolition hated garrison.
in 1835 a boston mob paraded him through town at the end of a rope.
nevertheless garrison enjoyed widespread black support three out of four early subscribers to the liberator were african americans.
frederick douglass one of those eager readers was frederick douglass who escaped from bondage to become an eloquent and outspoken critic of slavery.
garrison heard him speak and was so impressed that he sponsored douglass to speak for various anti slavery organizations.
hoping that abolition could be achieved without violence douglass broke with garrison who believed that abolition justified whatever means were necessary to achieve it.
in 1847 douglass began his own antislavery newspaper.
he named it the north star after the star that guided runaway slaves to freedom.

the number of slaves owned by individual masters varied widely across the south.
most slaves worked as house servants farm hands or in the fields.
some states allowed masters to free their slaves and even allowed slaves to purchase their freedom over time.
but these manumitted or freed slaves were very few.
the vast majority of african americans in the south were enslaved and endured lives of suffering and constant degradation.
see southern plantations on page 147.
turners rebellion some slaves rebelled against their condition of bondage.
one of the most prominent rebellions was led by virginia slave nat turner.
in august 1831 turner and more than 50 followers attacked four plantations and killed about 60 whites.
whites eventually captured and executed many members of the group including turner.
slave owners oppose abolition the turner rebellion frightened and outraged slaveholders.
in some states people argued that the only way to prevent slave revolts was through emancipation.
others however chose to tighten restrictions on all african americans to prevent them from plotting insurrections.
some proslavery advocates began to argue that slavery was a benevolent institution.
they used the bible to defend slavery and cited passages that counseled servants to obey their masters.

nevertheless opposition to slavery refused to disappear.
much of the strength of the abolition movement came from the efforts of women many of whom contributed to other reform movements including a women s rights movement.
women and reform main idea analyzing issues what were some of the areas of society that women worked to reform.
in the early 19th century women faced limited options.
prevailing customs encouraged women to restrict their activities after marriage to the home and family.
as a result they were denied full participation in the larger community.
women mobilize for reform despite such pressures women actively participated in all the important reform movements of the 19th century.
for many their efforts to improve society had been inspired by the optimistic message of the second great awakening.
from abolition to education women worked for reform despite the cold reception they got from many men.
perhaps the most important reform effort that women participated in was abolition.
women abolitionists raised money distributed literature and collected signatures for antislavery petitions to congress.
women also played key roles in the temperance movement the effort to pro hibit the drinking of alcohol.
some women most notably dorothea dix fought to improve treatment for the mentally disabled.
dix also joined others in the effort to reform the nation s harsh and often inhumane prison system.
q review unit 147 education for women work for abolition and temperance accompanied gains in education for women.
until the 1820s american girls had few educationa opportunities beyond elementary school.
as sarah grimke complained in letters on the equality of the sexes and the condition of woman 1838 a woman who knew chemistry enough to keep the pot boiling and geography enough to know the location of the different rooms in her house was considered learned enough.
grimke believed that increased education for women was a better alternative.
still throughout the 1800s more and more educational institutions for women began to appear.
in 1821 emma willard opened one of the nation s first academically oriented schools for girls in troy new york.
in addition to classes in domestic sciences the troy female seminary offered classes in math history geography languages art music writing and literature.
the troy female seminary became the model for a new type of women s school.
despite tremendous ridicule people mocked that they will be educating cows next willard s background sarah grimks and her sister angelina were leading voices in the abolition and womens rights movements.
school prospered.
elizabeth cady stanton 1815 1902 stanton was an ardent abolitionist and she timed her marriage in 1840 so that she and her new husband could travel together to london for the worlds anti slavery convention.
she also believed that women deserved the same rights as men and even persuaded the minister to omit the word obey from her vow in the marriage ceremony because she felt no need to obey one with whom i supposed i was entering into an equal relation at the antislavery convention stanton and the other women delegates were barred from participation in the convention and were forced to sit and listen from a curtained gallery.
there she met lucretia mott.
stanton and mott vowed to hold a convention as soon as we returned home and form a society to advocate the rights of women eight years later the seneca falls convention fulfilled that vow.
in 1833 the first class of ohio s oberlin college included four women thus becoming the nation s first fully coeducational college.
in 1837 mary lyon surmounted heated resistance to found another important institution of higher learning for women mount holyoke female seminary later mount holyoke college in south hadley massachusetts.
jj education and womens health improvement in women s education began to improve women s lives most notably in health reform.
elizabeth blackwell who in 1849 became the first woman to graduate from medical college later opened the new york infirmary for women and children.
in the 1850s catharine beecher sister of novelist harriet beecher stowe and a respected educator in her own right undertook a national survey of women s health.
to her dismay beecher found three sick women for every healthy one.
it was no wonder women rarely bathed or exercised and the fashionable women s clothing of the day included corsets so restrictive that breathing sometimes was difficult.
unfortunately black women enjoyed even fewer educational opportunities than their white counterparts.
in 1831 prudence crandall a white quaker opened a school for girls in canterbury connecticut.
two years later she admitted an african american girl named sarah harris.
the townspeople protested so vigorously that crandall decided to enroll only african americans.
this aroused even more opposition and in 1834 crandall was forced to close the school and leave town.
only after the civil war would the severely limited educational opportunities for black women slowly begin to expand.
womens rights movement emerges the reform movements of the mid 19th century fed the growth of the women s movement by providing women with increased opportunities to act outside the home.
elizabeth cady stanton and lucretia mott had been ardent abolitionists.
male abolitionists discriminated against them at the world s anti slavery convention in 1840 so the pair resolved to hold a women s rights convention.
in 1848 more than 300 women convened in seneca falls new york.
before the convention started stanton and mott composed an agenda and a detailed statement of grievances.

in spite of all the political activity among middle class white women african american women found it difficult to gain recognition of their problems.
a former slave named sojourner truth did not let that stop her however.
at a women s rights convention in 1851 truth an outspoken abolitionist refuted the arguments that because she was a woman she was weak and because she was black she was not feminine.

i review unit 149 citizenship spotlight alexis de tocqueville and america s success in 1831 alexis de tocqueville visited the united states in order to study the nation s prison system for the french government.
a parisian aristocrat eager to learn more about the united states 25 year old tocqueville spent nine months traveling throughout the country and recording his thoughts about american society and politics.
in 1835 he published his observations in the first volume of democracy in america a second volume followed in 1840.
through his writing tocqueville tried to identify the characteristics and values that made the united states and its inhabitants unique or exceptional.
he wanted to explore why democracy succeeded in america.
he wrote i confess that in america i saw more than america i sought the image of democracy itself with its inclinations its character its prejudices and its passions in order to learn what we have to fear or to hope from its progress.
historians political scientists and other observers have since used tocqueville s writing to elaborate their own ideas about the reasons for america s success as a constitutional republic.
liberty for tocqueville the key to democracy was balancing liberty with equality.
liberty or the freedom of the individual to act and think as he or she chooses had to be balanced against the needs of the nation.
tocqueville praised the founders for their ability to find this balance when they drafted the u s constitution not allowing the concerns of the american revolution to drive them too far toward liberty the chief cause of the superiority of the federal constitution lay in the character of the legislators who composed it.
they had all been nurtured at a time when the spirit of liberty was braced by a continual struggle against a powerful and predominant authority.
they had the courage to say what they believed to be true because they were animated by a warm and sincere love of liberty and they ventured to propose restrictions because they were resolutely opposed to destruction i.
h egalitarianism egalitarianism or equality is the principle that all people possess a fundamental right to fair treatment under the law and equal opportunity in all aspects of life.
tocqueville deeply admired the widespread economic equality that he witnessed during his travels viewing it as american democracys great promise.
he wrote n othing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of conditions.
it has no less empire over civil society than over the government it creates opinions engenders sentiments suggests the ordinary practices of life.
t he equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from which all others seem to be derived.
however he also worried that equality could be a threat to liberty if the people gave too much power to the central government to achieve equality.
for democracy to truly work equality had to be kept in balance with liberty.
chapter 3 individualism the characteristic of rugged individualism is one that many americans point to with pride.
in tocquevilles words as social conditions become more equal the number of persons increases who although they are neither rich enough nor powerful enough to exercise any great influence over their fellow creatures have nevertheless acquired or retained sufficient education and fortune to satisfy their own wants.
they owe nothing to any man they expect nothing from any man they acquire the habit of always considering themselves as standing alone and they are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in their own hands.
tocqueville worried that too much individualism could detract from a vibrant and active civil society.
however he believed that americans willingness to participate in local government and to form political associations could prevent this problem.
populism populism is a political movement that champions the common person over the elite.
tocqueville never uses the word populism in democracy in america because the concept did not exist then as it does now.
however he observed that unlike in europes aristocracies the equality of condition that he found in america made labor a noble pursuit amongst a democratic people where there is no hereditary wealth every man works to earn a living or has worked or is born of parents who have worked.
the notion of labor is therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary natural and honest condition of human existence.
not only is labor not dishonorable amongst such a people but it is held in honor the prejudice is not against it but in its favor.
in addition to this respect for labor tocqueville believed that the relatively equal distribution of property found in america compared to other nations helped to explain why the masses felt contempt for the elites.
laissez faire the literal translation of the french term laissez faire is let to do.
this is understood to mean being left alone without interference.
in explaining the continued success of the u s democratic republic tocqueville cited three main factors the laws the manners and customs of the people and something that he referred to as the peculiar and accidental situation in which providence has placed the americans by this tocqueville was referring to the fact that unlike european nations america had few neighbors to interfere with its affairs which allowed democracy to continue relatively unchallenged.
he declared a thousand circumstances independent of the will of man concur to facilitate the maintenance of a democratic republic in the united states.
the americans have no neighbors and consequently they have no great wars or financial crises or inroads or conquest to dread.
