studying history shows us when events took place.
which events happened first.
how far apart in time did events take place.
a variety of tools measure time.
calendars historians rely on calendars or dating systems to measure time.
a calendar breaks time into units and keeps track of those units.
cultures throughout the world have developed different calendars based on events in their history.
chronology and time lines the order in which events happen is chronology.
there are two types of chronology absolute chronology and relative chronology.
to apply absolute chronology arrange events or individuals in order from the earliest to the latest.
here is an example thomas jefferson writes the declaration of independence 1776 the u s purchases the louisiana territory 1803 andrew jackson is elected president 1828 the civil war begins 1861.
it is not always possible to date an event precisely.
we can only place approximate dates on events that take place over a long period of time.
examples are the ice age and the industrial revolution.
in such cases we can use relative chronology.
li dagli orti corbis throughout history different cultures have developed different calendars.
this calendar was developed by the aztec people who lived in what is now mexico.

the age of exploration was the earliest of these four time periods so it is listed first.
age of exploration reconstruction great depression cold war era an easy way to keep track of chronology is to make a time line.
a time line is a diagram showing the order of events within a period of time.
as you study u s history you will be expected to organize and interpret information from time lines.
for practice look at the time line on the previous page and think about how you would answer these questions which event came first.
which event was last.
during which century did these events take place.
h reading progress check identifying what is the difference between absolute chronology and relative chronology.
primary and secondary sources guiding question what is a primary source and how does it differ from a secondary source.
as you study social studies you will often study and analyze information in primary sources and secondary sources.
a primary source is a document or object that was created during the time being studied.
for example if you see a rocket launch and then write about it you are creating a primary source.
examples of different types of primary sources are listed below.
letters diaries official records photographs and paintings oral histories and interviews artifacts primary sources may be located in libraries archives or private collections.
many maybe viewed online.
for example the national archives has images of the original u s constitution on its web site.
build vocabulary word origins primary source original material from a u primary comes from the latin word primus which means first.
it is period being studied also the source for other english words such as primitive prime and primarily.
exploring social studies personal records and artifacts i w x v.
ef r r 1 uh the letter from abraham lincoln is a primary source.
artifacts such as the sioux deerskin bag the mortar a bowl in which ingredients are ground together and the serpent figure are also primary sources.
a secondary source on the other hand usually comes from someone who was not present at an event.
a book about the history of the space program is a secondary source.
the writer of the book collected information from primary sources and other secondary sources.
some examples of secondary sources are histories encyclopedias magazine articles textbooks biographies secondary sources are widely available online and in libraries.
encyclopedias can be a great resource for students studying the history of the united states or other countries.
checking your sources when you use primary or secondary sources to learn about an event you need to analyze them to find out if they are reliable.
you can evaluate a source by considering the language it uses determining if the information in the source can be corroborated in other sources and researching information about the author.
h secondary source an account of an event written by someone who did not witness it lesson 1 7 this cartoon drawn in the early 1900s shows the standard oil company as a giant octopus.
critical thinking analyzing primary sources what can you infer about the cartoonist s point of view.
written oral and even visual accounts of events are often made from a point of view or particular attitude about someone or something.
the creator uses his or her point of view to decide which information is important which people are key players which details are worth recording and which details are left out.
secondary sources are also often written from a point of view.
most people have feelings and ideas that affect their point of view.
sometimes a point of view is expressed as a bias or an unreasoned emotional judgment about people and events.
here are some hints you can use to help uncover bias in secondary sources as well as in written oral or visual primary sources.
identify the materials creator.
examine his or her views and possible reasons for creating the material.
in written or spoken material look for language that reflects an emotion or opinion words such as all never best worst might or should.
is the creator showing bias.
bias reflects a personal and often unreasoned judgment about the subject.
point of view a particular attitude about someone or something bias an unreasoned emotional judgment about people and events 8 exploring social studies frame of reference when you are reading about a past event or interpreting a historical figures actions you need to also think about frame of reference.
frame off reference refers to the experiences and beliefs that are influencing a person or group at a particular time.
historical context is especially important when judging past events or writings.
a persons point of view must be considered within the frame of reference of his or her times.
for example we know that abigail adams wrote the letter that follows to her husband john adams in the spring of 1776.
as you read the letter think about what was happening at the time.
primary source m i long to hear that you have dedared an independency 1 and by the way in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors 2 do not put such unlimited power into the hands ofthe husbands.
remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation 3 abigail adams abigail adams 1776 1 john was attending the continental congress which would soon declare the united states independent from great britain.
2 ancestors refers to english rulers.
in england women had few rights.
3 abigail points out that if women have no say in the matters ofthe country then they should not be subject to laws passed by men.
evaluating the validity of sources the more times you can answer yes to the following questions about a primary or secondary source the more reliable you may consider the source are facts supported with evidence.
is the language or image objective and not emotional.
can the same information be found in another source.
is the sources creator reputable or does he or she have credentials that would suggest credibility.
does the author or speaker acknowledge other viewpoints.

frame of reference the experiences and beliefs that influence a person or group at a given time lesson 1 using charts graphs models and databases guiding question how do i create and interpret charts graphs models and databases.
some social studies information is presented in various visual forms.
these forms include charts graphs models and databases.
charts and databases when you create a chart you present information in an organized way.
a chart arranges information especially numbers in rows and columns for easy reference.
charts help us categorize information in order to better understand it.
view the chart that shows information about monthly army salaries.
the vertical column on the left shows the soldiers ranks.
the row across the top identifies time periods in four major conflicts.
here are some questions to help you interpret this chart what was the monthly salary for a corporal during the civil war.
did a sergeant during the vietnam war receive more or less pay than a sergeant during world war ii.
what was the difference in salary.
a database is a special kind of chart.
when you create a database you are collecting information that can be rapidly searched and retrieved.
you can create your own database.
by using special software developed for record keeping you can easily add delete change or update information.
lets say that you wanted to build a database with information on events and people.
first determine what facts you want to include.
then follow the instructions to set up fields in the data management system that you are using.
enter each item of data in its assigned field.
determine how you want to organize the facts by data by person or by topic.

what is geography.
guiding question how does geography affect our lives.
the story of the united states begins with geography the study of earth and its people.
geography describes earths land water and plant and animal life.
to understand the link between geography and history keep in mind the following themes location where is it absolute location is one exact spot on earth.
relative location tells where a place is compared with one or more other places.
place what is it like place describes the features that make an area unique or different.
physical features include landform and climate.
cultural or human made features include language and architecture.
movement why do people things and ideas move from place to place for example many early colonists came to america seeking religious freedom.
region what common characteristics does an area share a region is an area that is defined by common features.

humans also change their environment to meet their needs.
as the nation grew during the 1800s the need for better and more transportation systems also grew.
the need for railroads like roads and canals before came from industry and trade.
the growth of railroads in turn created thousands of jobs and stimulated new industries such as those for iron and steel.

globes and maps guiding question what kinds of information do maps provide.
the tools of the geographer include maps and globes.
these help us to learn more about earth.
globes and maps serve different purposes and each has its advantages and disadvantages.
a globe is a round model of earth that shows its shape lands bodies of water and directions as they truly relate to one another.
a map is a flat drawing of all or part of earths surface.
cartographers or mapmakers use mathematical formulas to transfer information from the round globe to a flat map.
still all maps distort the shapes of the places they show.
maps can show small areas such as a school campus.
they can show the streets in a city.
or they can show whole continents or even the entire world.
they can show places as they exist now.
historical maps can show the features of a place at some time in the past.
studying geography helps us to understand earth its people its natural features and the way they interact with each other.
different kinds of maps maps differ because they serve many purposes and show various kinds of information.
a physical map shows the physical features of an area such as its mountains and rivers.
physical maps use color and shading to show relief how flat or rugged the land surface is.
colors also are often used to show elevation the height of an area above sea level.
political maps generally show earths human made divisions.
these include cities and the boundaries of states and countries.
another kind of map is the thematic map.
thematic maps show more specialized information than physical or political maps do.
for instance a thematic map might display the kinds of crops that grow in different areas.
or it might show where i ranching or mining take place.
maps and globes do similar things but each has advantages and disadvantages.
0 comparing do maps or globes give a more accurate representation ofthe shape size and location on places on earth.

the colors used on physical maps include brown or green for land and blue for water.
as you study u s history you will create and analyze thematic maps.
for practice create a personal thematic map that tells something about you.
your map might show your route to school where your friends live or identify the cities in your state you have visited.
parts of a map the map key explains the lines symbols and colors used on a map.
the key shows what population numbers each color represents.
map keys can also show political divisions such as cities.
a measuring line often called a scale bar helps you determine distance on the map.
the map scale tells you what distance on earth is represented by the measurement on the scale bar.
the scale bar on this map shows what measurement on the map equals a certain distance on earth.
an important first step in reading any map is to find the direction marker.
a map has a symbol called a compass rose.
the compass rose tells you the positions of north south east and west.
latitude and longitude lines on globes and maps provide information that helps us easily locate places on earth.
most maps show these lines which are called latitude and longitude.
they cross one another forming a grid pattern.
lines of latitude circle earth parallel to the equator.
the lines measure the distance north and south of the equator in degrees.
the equator is located at 0.
the north pole lies at 90n north.
social studies this map is a special purpose or thematic map.
it provides historical information.
the map also uses colors to show population patterns.
lines of longitude circle earth from the north pole to the south pole.
these lines measure distances east or west of the starting line which is at 0 longitude and is called the prime meridian.
the prime meridian runs through the royal observatory in greenwich england.
the grid formed by the lines of latitude and longitude makes it possible to find the absolute location of a place.
only one place can be found at the point where a specific line of latitude crosses a specific line of longitude.
posing and answering questions about geography in your studies you often answer questions about what you have read or studied.
you will also take part in another kind of activity in which you generate and answer questions about geographic distributions and patterns shown on maps.
you will also sometimes be asked to pose questions shown on other geographic representations such as graphs charts models and databases.

each trading partner depends on the other to help provide his or her wants and needs.
this interdependence occurs between international trading partners and also between partners within countries such as the united states.
the term laissez faire economics from the french to let alone came to describe this idea.
smith s ideas influenced the founders ofthe united states who limited the role of government mainly to national defense and keeping the peace.
a free enterprise economic system also developed in the nation because the people had fought a war for independence to escape english control.
the british government had restricted the peoples right to trade with other nations imposed taxes on the colonists without their consent and held the power to quarter troops in the homes of colonists.
the founders established a nation in which the government played a limited role in the economy.
trade was subject to few restrictions.
taxes were levied but only through representatives elected by the citizens.
property rights were protected owners have the right to use their land homes and any other goods they possess as they see fit.
ethics and free enterprise ethics are the principles of conduct against which actions are determined to be right or wrong good or bad fair or unfair.
the u s free enterprise economy is an ethical system because its characteristics promote economic freedom by letting individuals pursue the occupation of their choice providing goods and services for various groups in society bestowing rewards on producers who make goods preferred by buyers supporting the liberty of individuals and allowing individuals to develop their skills and talents.

in the united states today the two major parties are the republican party and the democratic party.
competing political parties are a necessary part of democratic government.
they are a key link between citizens and their elected officials.
they give voters a choice between candidates and ideas.
a basic difference between the major parties is their view on the role of government.
democrats tend to believe that the federal government should be more directly involved in regulating the economy and in providing housing education and jobs.

1 a citizen is a person who owes loyalty to and is entitled to the protection of a state or nation.
how do you become a u s citizen.
j the u s constitution establishes two ways to become a citizen by birth and for foreign born people who choose to become i citizens by a legal process called naturalization.
j citizenship by birth if you were born in any of the 50 states or the district of columbia you became a u s citizen at birth.

as citizens of our nation we hold many rights.
however we must also fulfill the responsibilities of citizenship.
rights and the declaration of independence almost from the moment that the united states declared itself an independent country americans have valued and celebrated their rights and freedoms.
thomas jeffersons words in the declaration of independence made it clear that the citizens of the new country would never be denied certain basic rights rights that belong to all people.
these principles are brilliantly stated in the second paragraph of the declaration james madison introduced a set of amendments to the u s constitution during the first session of congress.
the states ratified 10 of them in 1791.
these first 10 amendments became known as the bill of rights.
primary source m we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent ofthe governed.
99 declaration of independence 1776 the bridgeman art library getty images jefferson stated that the principles he was identifying were truths not just beliefs held by a few radicals.
he also noted that these principles were self evident or obvious.
in saying that people have unalienable rights or rights that cannot be taken away jefferson was borrowing from earlier thinkers such as william blackstone and from lockes writings on natural rights.
natural or unalienable rights have several characteristics they belong to every human being regardless of gender age or nationality.
they cannot be taken away or interfered with by any government.
there are other kinds of rights besides natural rights.
these rights are man made and codified into law.
yet many of the individual rights that americans enjoy and celebrate such as the right to worship as one pleases the right to assemble and the right to fair treatment under the law are based on the natural and unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness academic vocabulary unalienable right a right that cannot be consent agreement or permission taken away lesson 3 29 during earlier periods in our nation s history some people were not allowed to vote.

today to be eligible to vote you must be a citizen of the united states and at least 18 years of age.
r i rights and the bill of rights in the declaration of independence jefferson laid the foundation for many of the rights that later became part of the u s constitution.
the first 10 amendments or changes to the constitution were added in 1791.
they are known as the u s bill of rights and they list americans basic rights and freedoms.
the first amendment to the constitution protects five basic freedoms freedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of the assembly and freedom to petition the government.
how does the first amendment protect these freedoms.
the amendment safeguards religious freedom in two ways.
first the amendment prohibits congress from establishing an official religion in the united states.
this makes the united states different from countries in which a state church is established.
second the amendment guarantees americans the right to practice their faith as they wish.
the government may not favor one religion over another or treat people differently because of their personal beliefs.
many of the people who braved the journey to the american colonies did so because they were not allowed to practice their religions in their home countries.
the framers of the u s constitution wanted to be sure this would not happen in their new nation.
our responsibilities with citizenship come responsibilities things we are expected or are required to do.
as individuals we have personal responsibilities such as being accountable for how we behave and how we support our families.

they protect the safety property and freedom of citizens.
they also make it possible for people to live together peaceably.
our system of representative government makes it possible for citizens to work with elected leaders to change laws they do not like.
paying taxes gives government money to use for a variety of purposes such as defending the nation providing services to citizens and building roads and bridges.
defending the constitution means more than volunteering to serve in the military to protect the nation against enemies of freedom.
it also means serving on juries when called to do so.
americans have the right to a trial by a jury.
this right would be difficult to exercise if citizens neglected this responsibility.
jury duty is necessary to guarantee everyone a fair and speedy trial.
our rights and responsibilities define who we are as americans.
our national identity has been built through the nations history as a land of immigrants of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds.
it is not based on our belonging to one ethnic group or religion but on our shared values freedom liberty and equality.

reading helpdesk it matters because critical thinking skills help you to analyze information and ideas.
these skills are important to good citizenship because they allow you to exercise your civic rights and responsibilities.
critical thinking skills guidingquestion howcan social studies skills help students organize and analyze information and ideas.
studying history is more than reading sources and viewing pictures or graphs.
historians need many different skills to analyze explain and find patterns in the events of history.
here are some of the social studies skills you will use in your study of u s history.
as you read you will be able to practice these skills.
identifying cause and effect a cause is an action that leads to an event.
an effect is the result of that action.
look for signal words or phrases that alert you to cause and effect such as so because as a result therefore produced and for the following reasons.
think about a personal achievement.
the achievement might be scoring a winning goal writing a funny story or fixing a bicycle.
what causes helped you accomplish this achievement.
how might knowing those causes help you to achieve the same effect again.
making predictions one way to analyze information is to think about what might happen next.
predicting future events is difficult.
sometimes taking hotes summarizing as you read use a table like this one to describe different tools you will use as you study history.
exploring sodal studies social studies skills critical thinking skills problem solving skills writing and communication skills native americans who were forced from their land traveled west in the 1830s.
though you can use knowledge of how certain causes led to certain effects in the past to make such a prediction.
this is one benefit that comes from having a knowledge of history.
for example in the 1830s white americans wanted the land on which the cherokee and four other native american peoples were living.
the government forced all of these peoples to give up their land so that white settlers could have it.
what do you think happened to these native americans in the west once the settlers took their land.
e drawing inferences and conclusions inferences and conclusions are two different types of explanations we form about things.
an inference is something we assume based on what appears to be true.
drawing an inference means choosing the most likely explanation based on that evidence.
for example you arrive at the school bus stop a little later than usual.
no one is there.
you draw the inference that you have missed the bus.
you do not know that for sure however.
you did not see the bus pulling away and there might be other reasons why no one is at the bus stop.
but based on the evidence you have that you were late and that no one is there you assume draw the inference that you missed the bus.
study the model of the division of powers between the national and state governments.
what is a power that is shared.
what inferences might you draw from this.
content vocabulary cause effect inference conclusion generalization plagiarize cause an action that leads to an event effect the result of an action inference something that we assume based on what appears to be true lesson 5 39 the framers ofthe u s constitution divided the powers of government into three types.
the powers granted to the national government are called enumerated powers or expressed powers.
reserved powers are powers set aside for the states.
powers that both the national government and the state governments share are concurrent powers.
a conclusion is a logical explanation that is based on known facts.
when you draw a conclusion you use all available information to form the explanation.
conclusions are often developed from inferences as more information is gathered.
these differences make conclusions more reliable explanations than inferences are.
once you have drawn a conclusion based on facts you can persuasively support your point of view on an issue.
for example by studying a variety of sources about an election such as news reports polling data and debates between the candidates you can effectively draw a conclusion about why a candidate won.
content vocabulary conclusion a logical explanation that is based on known facts academic vocabulary identify to find comparing and contrasting when making comparisons you examine two or more ideas objects or events.
you identify the similarities or what the two things have in common.
when you contrast you are noting differences between ideas objects or events.
at times you are asked to both compare and contrast.
signal words or phrases provide clues to what you need to do.
words such as similar and also tell you to compare.
words and phrases such as however and on the other hand tell you to contrast.
view the chart of the virginia and new jersey plans on page 239.
which parts of the two plans are similar.
which parts are different.
sequencing sequencing involves putting events in the order in which they occurred.
using this skill will help you to see and understand relationships between events.
you can sequence events in two ways 0 exploring social studies absolute chronology when you sequence events in this way you are paying attention to the dates of the events.
relative chronology when you sequence events this way you only need to know which event came first which came second and so on without paying attention to their dates.
sequence the following events using relative chronology.
then identify the relationship between slavery and the civil war.
1860 abraham lincoln is elected president of the united states.
1850 some southern senators oppose compromising with the north over slavery.
1861 southern states leave the union and the civil war begins.
1858 northerner abraham lincoln rises to leadership in a political party that opposes slavery.
finding the main idea when you look for the main idea of a selection you look for the most important idea.
the examples and information that explain the main idea further are called supporting details.
some main ideas are clearly stated often in the first sentence of a paragraph or sometimes in the last sentence of a passage.
other times the writer does not directly state the main idea.
instead he or she provides details that help readers figure out what the main idea is.
to help you find the main idea ask yourself what is each sentence about.
is there one sentence that tells about the whole passage or that is more important than the other sentences.
what main idea do the supporting details point out.
summarizing when you summarize you reduce a large amount of information into short and simple form.
a summary is a short restatement of the informations important content.
summarizing helps you digest and remember the main points in what you have read.
categorizing as a student it is important that you know how to organize large amounts of information in an understandable way.
categorizing helps you arrange facts and information into 1 groups that have the same characteristics.
putting things into categories can make it easier to see similarities and differences 5 among them.

lesson 5 41 anne hutchinson making generalizations generalizations are statements that are generally true based on the facts available.
for example by saying our school has great athletic teams you are making a generalization.
that s because great is probably not true of all your schools teams but just most of them which makes your statement generally true.
in studying history you may need to put bits and pieces of information together in order to see the overall picture.
to make an accurate generalization you must first collect facts about the subject.
then identify similarities among facts and use those similarities to form some general ideas about the subject.
the puritans came to america in 1630 and started a colony called massachusetts.
make a generalization about them from the following pieces of information.
the puritans left england because they wanted religious freedom.
the puritans drove baptists and other non puritans from their colony.
puritan anne hutchinson was expelled from massachusetts for challenging church teachings.
the puritans expelled roger williams because he challenged the churchs authority.
q reading progress check identifying which skill helps identify similarities in two or more things.
problem solving skills guidingquestion how are decision making and problem solving similar.
you will sometimes be called on to investigate a topic in depth.
you might be assigned to complete a project on your own.
your teacher will also assign group projects.
for some topics you will need to solve a problem or make a decision based on the evidence you gather.
a set process a series of steps can help you make the decision or solve the problem.
making decisions people make decisions every day.
some decisions affect other people can have serious results and must be made quickly.
you might be a person who requires a lot of information to make your decision.
or you may feel very comfortable relying on your instinct when making your decision.
whatever the decision and whatever your style decision making should generally follow a process similar to this 42 exploring social studies when your group is working to solve a problem a first step is to understand the problem.
ask the questions what do we know about the problem.
do we have enough information to solve the problem.
if not what information do we need.
determine if others should be involved in the decisionmaking process.
gather information to help you make the decision.
identify options alternatives.
weigh each option and predict the consequences of each.
choose the best option.
put your decision into action.
solving problems a planned and careful approach will assist you in arriving at a solution to a problem.
choosing not to deal with a problem is one option.
however problems very rarely go away by themselves.
here is a process that should help you solve a problem identify the problem.
gather information about the problem.
list and consider solutions to the problem.
consider the advantages and disadvantages of each possible solution.
choose a solution and put it into action.
evaluate the effectiveness of the solution.

if you are working in a group decide which member is doing which part.
after you create six questions the next step is to gather your research materials.
begin with general reference books such as encyclopedias and textbooks or your notes from class.
looking for information on the internet can be quick and rewarding.
however it can be a challenge to find out if the information you locate is true.
it is important to apply the following standards to information on the internet.
jf you answer no to any of the questions below the web site is probably not a reliable source.
is the authorship of the information clear.
can you easily find out who is responsible for the web site.
has the web site been updated recently.
does the writing seem balanced or does it contain a bias toward one point of view.
you must also organize the information you gather.
outlines and reports can be a great resource when doing research.
for example you could use an outline such as the table of contents for this book to organize information about u s history for a presentation.
similarly reports can help you organize data.
if you look at a government report on a topic such as the environment or education the level of detail devoted to certain topics can help you identify the most important subjects to address in an essay.
once you have organized your information you need to interpret or assign meaning to it.
again the organization of material in outlines and reports can provide insight on a topic.
how is the data organized.
in what order is information presented.
the structure of an outline or a report can help you interpret the relative importance of different pieces of data.
h reading progress check making decisions why is it important to decide what you want to find out before beginning your research.
writing and communication skills guiding question how do we communicate information.
we communicate information in three main ways.
one way is in written form as in a report a letter or an e mail.
another way is by voice as in a conversation a speech a song or a presentation at work or in class.
the third way we communicate is visually.
otographs film or video art maps and graphs are all forms of visua communication.
sometimes our communications involve two o t ese means.
for example this textbook uses writing and images to provide information about our nations history.
44 exploring social studies writing skills good writing meets certain standards.
it shows correct use of grammar the rules for how the words and other parts of a language are used.
the words chosen clearly convey the writers information and ideas.
all words are properly used and their spelling is correct.
it is also important that you use the special words of social studies correctly.
as you read the lessons you will see many special words and phrases identified as content vocabulary or academic vocabulary.
examples of special vocabulary include free enterprise and unalienable right.
sentences are complete and properly punctuated.
they also are not so long that they are confusing.
the sentences in good writing are organized into paragraphs.
a paragraph is a group of sentences about one idea or topic.
paragraphs are the building blocks of o deliberate plagiarism unintentional plagiarism passing off as ones own omitting or not properly or rewriting books citing original sources articles or works of others poor paraphrasing or summarizing copying and pasting from web sites or assuming something is o online sources without common knowledge citation when it is not buying borrowing or recycling your own work downloading the work of others from an old paper o most written communication.
keep these tips in mind to avoid the first paragraph of a composition usually introduces the plagiarism.
the next paragraphs present information about the topic in a logical easy to follow sequence.
then the final paragraph states the writers conclusion about the topic.
a very important standard of good writing is that the work be the writers own.
to plagiarize is to present the ideas or words of another person as your own without giving credit to the source.
plagiarism is similar to forgery or copying anything else that is not yours and violates the law.
if you copy an idea or a written text word for word that is plagiarism.
to avoid plagiarism follow these rules put information in your own words.
when you restate an opinion from something you read include a reference to the author for example according to smith and jones always include a footnote when you use a direct quotation from another author.
if you are writing a report you may be required to include a bibliography.
a bibliography is a list of the books articles internet sources and other sources you used to do your research.
these are listed at the end of your report and should include the author of the source the title of the source plagiarize to present someone else s ideas or words as your own lesson 5 45 president george w bush addresses members ofthe u s border patrol about policy issues.
communication skills are important to make sure the audience understands your message.
when you plan an oral presentation ask yourself who is your audience.
what does your audience already know about the topic.
what do you want your audience to know.
what details and vocabulary will help you accomplish this.
the publisher of the source or the web site and internet address url where it can be found the date the source was published or the web site was accessed writing a paragraph writing a good paragraph involves stating information clearly and arranging it in a logical order.
knowing how to write a well organized paragraph helps you express your ideas clearly.
to write a good paragraph follow these steps decide on the main point you want the paragraph to express.
write the idea in a sentence.
this sentence will become the topic sentence or main idea ot the paragraph.
next write detail sentences to support the main idea.
these sentences should add information that explains or expands the main idea stated in the topic sentence.
they may be facts examples or reasons.
they should be arranged in a logical order.
use transition words such as next then also finally because however and as a result to link sentences within the paragraph.
transitions can also be used to link two paragraphs together.
good writing checklist when you finish your writing check to make sure your work is free from errors.
this checklist can help you have i avoided run on sentences and sentence fragments.

are my paragraphs clear and arranged in a logical order.
are the words my own.
finally evaluate the paragraph you have written.
does the topic sentence state the main idea clearly.
do the other sentences support the main idea.
creating presentations many of the standards and skills that make for good written communication apply to voice communication too.
whether you are giving a speech oral report or other presentation your grammar should be correct.
your sentences should be complete short and in an order that makes your meaning clear.
these skills are especially important when you are delivering information orally.
it is often more difficult for people to understand something they listen to than something they read.
to help your audience understand you can ask key questions about the information you are presenting and then answer them in your presentation.
also allow your audience time at the end of your presentation to ask questions.
most social studies presentations are more interesting if they include visuals such as photographs slide shows videos maps graphs or diagrams.

primary source chicago history museum the m generally when the grown people in the neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour the children assembled together in some of the neighbours premises to play and commonly some of us used to get up a tree to look out for any assailant or kidnapper that might come upon us for they sometimes took those opportunities of our parents absence to attack and carry off as many as they could seize one day when all our people were gone out to their works as usual and only i and my dear sister were left to mind the house two men and a woman got over our walls and in a moment seized us both and without giving us time to cry out or make resistance they stopped our mouths and ran off with us into the nearest wood.
here they tied our hands and continued to carry us as far as they could till night came on when we reached a small house where the robbers halted for refreshment and spent the night.
we were then unbound but were unable to take any food and being quite overpowered by fatigue and grief our only relief was some sleep which allayed our misfortune for a short time.
the next morning we left the house and continued travelling all the day.
for a long time we had kept to the woods but at last we came into a road which i believed i knew.
i had now some hopes of being delivered for we had advanced but a little way before i discovered some people at a distance on which i began to cry out for their assistance but my cries had no other effect than to make them tie me faster and stop my mouth and then they put me into a large sack.
they also stopped my sister s mouth and tied her hands and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of sight of these people.
when we went to rest the following night they offered us some victuals but we refused it and the only comfort we had was in being in one another s arms all that night and bathing each other with our tears.

life in the american colonies 1 1 ca i ji a colonial government ial question how do new ideas change the way people live.
it matters because using ideas from england and their own experiences american colonists began developing their beliefs about the proper form and role of government.
english principles of government guidingquestion why are protected rights and representative government important principles.
when english colonists came to north america they brought with them english ideas about government.
these ideas had been developing in england over hundreds of years.
by the 1600s the english people had won political liberties such as trial by jury that were largely unknown elsewhere.
at the heart of the english system were two principles of government protected rights and representative legislatures.
these two principles greatly influenced the development of the united states and are important parts of the u s constitution.
protected rights the colonists believed that government must respect civil liberties or rights.
in fact the protection of peoples rights was a central idea in the english system of government.
it first appeared in the magna carta or great charter which king john signed on june 15 1215.
this document gave english people protection against unjust treatment or punishment.
for the english even kings and queens were bound by the law.
protected rights representative government content vocabulary representative government import mercantilism export representative government the english had a tradition of representative government in which people elect delegates to make laws and conduct government.
the english parliament was a representative assembly.
it had the power to legislate or make laws.
parliament had two chambers or houses the house of lords and the house of commons.
only the eldest sons of englands aristocracy the upper ruling class could sit in the house of lords.
the house of commons included commoners mostly merchants or property owners elected by other property owners.
american legislatures grew in part from this english model.
in the mid 1600s parliament and king james ii began a struggle for power.
in 1688 parliament removed king james ii from power and crowned william and mary to rule.
william and mary promised to govern england according to the statutes laws in parliament agreed upon and the laws and customs of the same the english called this peaceful transfer of power the glorious revolution.
it brought a major change in the idea of government in england.
from that time forward no ruler would have more power than the legislature.
the english bill of rights to set clear limits on a rulers powers parliament drew up the english bill of rights in 1689.
the bill of rights stated that the ruler could not suspend parliaments laws impose taxes or raise an army without parliaments consent.
members of parliament had to be freely elected.
citizens of england had the j i kf right to a fair trial by jury in court cases.
the bill of rights also banned cruel and unusual punishments.
government in america each of the thirteen colonies began as either a charter or a proprietary colony.
charter colonies were based on a charter a grant of rights by the english monarch to a company.
massachusetts was a charter colony.
established in 1619 the virginia house of burgesses was the first legislature in the english colonies.
it became a foundation for the principle of self government in colonial america and later the united states.

built in 1743 pelham s old meeting house is the oldest town hall in continuous use in the nation.
proprietary colonies were the property of an owner or group of owners.
these proprietors ruled more or less as they wished.
for example they named their own governors and many other colonial officials.
pennsylvania was a proprietary colony.
some colonies later became royal colonies under direct english control.
virginia became the first royal colony in 1624.
in a royal colony parliament appointed a governor and council known as the upper house.
the colonists selected an assembly or lower house.
the governor and council usually did as the english king and parliament told them.
this often led to conflicts with the assembly.
for example colonists got angry when officials enforced tax or trade laws.
not all colonists had a voice in government.
in general only white men who owned property could vote.
most women indentured servants landless poor and african americans could not vote.
still compared to europe the share of the colonial population taking part in government was large.
this training proved valuable when the colonies became independent.
local government in the colonies over time townspeople began discussing local issues at town meetings.
these developed into local governments with landowners holding the right to vote and pass laws.
because colonists in many areas took part in local government they developed a strong belief in their right to govern themselves.
town meetings helped set the stage for the american revolution.

english economic policies guidingquestion how did the colonists react to england s economic policies beginning in the 1600s many european nations followed a theory known as mercantilism muhr kuhn tuh lih zuhm.
mercantilism holds that a country builds wealth and power by uilding its supplies of gold and silver.
to achieve this goal a country must export or sell to other countries more than it mercantilism an economic theory whose goal is building a export to sell abroad x a a zb ina nexp sandiaum lifin9 t0 r ng in from foreign markets life in the american colonies imports or buys from other countries.
a country must also seek colonies which could supply raw materials and serve as a market for exports.
the english followed a mercantilist policy.
they looked to the american colonies for raw materials such as tobacco rice indigo wheat lumber fur leather fish and whale products.
they also wanted the colonists to buy english manufactured goods such as tools clothing and furniture.
to control this trade england began passing a series of laws called navigation acts in the 1650s.
these laws forced colonists to sell their raw materials to england even if they could get a better price elsewhere.
goods bought by the colonies from other countries in europe had to go to england first and be taxed.
all trade goods had to be carried on ships built in england or the colonies.
the crews on the ships had to be english as well.
foldables i study organizer include this lesson s information in your foldable v many items in a colonial kitchen were tinware imported from england.
because of its silvery color tinware was often called poor man s silver.
although it was thought to be inferior to china or silver tinware goods were less breakable than china and easier to clean than silverware.
colonial resistance the colonists at first accepted the navigation acts because the laws guaranteed them a place to sell their raw materials.
later the colonists came to resent english restrictions with their population growing colonists wanted to manufacture their own goods rather than import them from england.
they also wanted to sell their products to buyers other than england.
colonial merchants began smuggling or shipping goods without government permission or payment of taxes.
controls on trade would later cause conflict between the american colonies and england.

life in the colonies guidingquestion what was life like for people living in the thirteen colonies.
the number of people living in the thirteen colonies rose from about 250 000 in 1700 to approximately 2 5 million hv the mid 1770s.
the population of persons of african descent increased at an even faster rate from about 28 000 to more than 500 000.
immigration im ih gray shuhn the permanent moving of people into one country from other countries was important to this growth.
between 1607 and 1775 an estimated 690 000 europeans came to the colonies.
also during this time traders brought in 278 000 enslaved africans to the colonies.
there was another reason for the growing population.
colonial women tended to marry early and have large families.
in addition the colonies especially new england turned out to be a very healthy place to live compared to other parts of the world.
still compared to today life was fragile.

colonial education most colonists valued education.
parents often taught their children to read and write at home.
in new england and pennsylvania in particular people set up schools to make sure everyone could read and study the bible.
in 1647 the massachusetts puritans passed a public education law requiring communities with 50 or more families to have a public school.
the result was a high level of literacy in new england.
by 1750 about 85 percent of the men and about half of the women were able to read.

the great awakening inspired greater religious freedom.
it led to the formation of many new types of churches.
the new churches placed an emphasis on having personal faith rather than on church rituals.
more colonists began choosing their own faiths and the strength of established official churches declined.
as a baptist preacher noted the common people now claim as good a right to judge and act in matters of religion as civil rulers or the learned clergy this independence of thought encouraged the belief that colonists had the ability and the right to make their own decisions in government matters as well.
the great awakening also united colonists from north to south in a common experience.
the colonists overcame regional barriers which helped pave the way for the rapid spread of revolutionary ideas and excitement during the struggle for independence.
the enlightenment by the middle of the 1700s many educated colonists were also influenced by the enlightenment.

in april 1776 colonial leader john adams predicted weshall have a long and bloody war to go through few people agreed with him.
each side thought they would win the war quickly.
the british planned to crush the colonists by force.
most patriots americans who supported independence believed the british would give up after losing one or two major battles.
british advantages as the war began the british seemed to have a big advantage.
they had the strongest navy in the world.
the british also had a well trained army.
they were supported by the wealth of their empire.
great britain also had more people.
more than 8 million people lived in britain.
there were only 2 5 million americans.
the patriots did not seem to be a match for the british.
they had no regular army and a weak navy.
american soldiers also lacked experience and weapons for fighting.
much of the patriot military force was in the form of militia groups.
these volunteer soldiers fought only for short periods of time and then returned home.
in addition not all americans supported the struggle for independence.
some americans remained loyal to britain.
others such as the quakers were neutral.
they would not take part in the war because they opposed all armed conflict.
loyalists in the colonies at least one in five americans was thought to be a loyalist or tory the number may have been as high as one in three.
these americans remained loyal to britain and opposed independence.
some americans changed sides during the war.
loyalist support also varied from region to region.
in general support for britain was strongest in the carolinas and georgia and weakest in new england.
loyalists had reasons to support britain.
some depended on the british for their jobs.
some feared the revolution would throw america into chaos.
others simply could not understand why the colonies wanted independence.
for them patriot complaints seemed minor and not worth fighting over.
the british actively sought the support of african americans.
virginias royal governor lord dunmore promised freedom to those african americans who joined the british cause.
many men answered his call.
eventually some of them ended up free in canada.
others settled in the british colony of sierra leone in africa.
loyalty to britain divided friends and family.
for example william franklin son of patriot benjamin franklin was a loyalist who had served as a royal governor of new jersey.
this disagreement caused lasting damage to their relationship.
as one connecticut man observed neighbor was against neighbor father against son and son against father and he that would not thrust his own blade through his brothers heart was called an infamous villain advantages of the patriots the patriots did hold some advantages.
they were fighting on their own ground.
the british on the other hand had to fight from thousands of miles across the atlantic ocean.
it took time and money to ship soldiers and supplies.
thinkinq like a historian drawing inferences and conclusions made in the 1750s the liberty bell hung in the pennsylvania state house now independence hall.
legend has it that on july 8 1776 the bells ringing announced the first public reading of the declaration of independence.
the liberty bell also rang every fourth of july and for many public events until a crack appeared in about 1846.

the british relied on mercenaries muhr suh.

the americans called these mercenaries hessians heh shuhnz after the region in germany from which most of them came.
the patriots fought for the freedom of their own land.
this gave them a greater stake in the wars outcome than soldiers who fought for money.
the americans also lured the hessians away with promises of land.
the patriots greatest advantage was probably their leader george washington.
few could match him for courage and determination.
the war might have taken a different turn without washington.
the continental army after the declaration of independence the continental congress served as the national government.
however the congress lacked the power to raise money through taxes.
delegates led by james madison of virginia called for a stronger national government to bind the colonies together.
they believed that winning independence was possible only under a strong national government.
not every american agreed.
they placed great value on liberty and personal freedom.
after rejecting the rule of the british parliament they were unwilling to transfer power to their own continental congress.
as a result the american revolution was in some ways 13 separate wars with each state fighting for its own interests.
this made it hard for the congress to get soldiers and raise money.
local militia made up a key part of the patriot forces.
these troops were limited.
many were farmers who needed to provide for their families and did not want to leave their fields unattended.
the patriots also needed well trained soldiers who could fight the british throughout the colonies.
to meet this need the congress established the continental army which depended on the states to recruit ree kroot soldiers.
at first soldiers signed up for just one year but general washington asked for longer terms.
if we ever hope for success he said we must have men enlisted for the whole term of the war.
eventually the continental congress invited soldiers to sign up for three years or until the war ended.
most soldiers however still signed up for only one year.

under the terms of the treaty of paris the british gave up control of the land north of the ohio river and west of the appalachian mountains.
many americans were eager to settle in this region.
the new united states government had to establish policies for settlement of these western lands.
another challenge was to come up with an orderly process by which new territories could achieve the status of statehood.
the ordinance of 1785 in 1785 the confederation congress passed an ordinance or law that set up a process to survey and sell the lands north of the ohio river.

congress drafted another law to protect the interests of hardworking settlers.
the northwest ordinance the northwest ordinance passed in 1787 guaranteed the property rights of settlers and provided a democratic model for national expansion.
it created a single northwest territory from lands north ofthe ohio river and east of the mississippi river.

the ordinance of 1785 and the northwest ordinance attempted to make possible the settlement of the northwest territory in a peaceful and orderly way.
in general the laws were successful.
the united states congress would later take a similar step in the south.
in 1798 it created the mississippi territory from land west of georgia.
congress organized the government of the territory in the same basic way as in the northwest territory except that slavery was allowed.
land act of 1800 the ordinance of 1785 and the northwest ordinance aimed to encourage settlement in the northwest territory.
in time it became clear that people needed even more help.
in 1800 congress passed the land act.

although the american revolution led to a union of 13 states it had not yet created a nation.
some leaders were satisfied with independent state governments that were similar to the old colonial governments.
others wanted a strong national government.
they demanded a change in the articles of confederation.
among the leading americans supporting reform were james madison a virginia planter and alexander hamilton a new york lawyer.
the convention begins in september 1786 hamilton called for a convention or meeting in philadelphia to discuss trade issues.
he also suggested that this convention consider what possible changes were needed to make the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies needs of the union george washington at first was not enthusiastic about the meeting.
then news of shayss rebellion made washington change his mind.
he agreed to attend the philadelphia convention and the meeting took on greater importance.

two men from philadelphia also had key roles.
james wilson did important work on the details ofthe constitution and gouverneur morris polished the final draft.
james madison who was a keen supporter of a strong national government kept a record of the conventions work.
madison is often called the father of the constitution because he was the author of the basic plan of government that the convention adopted.
the convention organizes the delegates chose george washington to lead the meetings.
delegates also decided that each state would have one vote on all questions.
decisions would be based on a majority vote ofthe states present.
sessions were not open to the public.
in fact the windows were closed in the sweltering heat to keep anyone from listening in.
this made it possible for the delegates to talk freely.
i f i ii the virginia plan edmund randolph of virginia opened the convention with a surprise.
he proposed the virginia plan which called for a strong national government.
the plan which was largely the work of james madison created a government with three branches a two house legislature a chief executive chosen by the legislature and a court system.
the legislature would have powers to tax regulate trade and veto state laws.
voters would elect members ofthe lower house of the legislature.
the members of the lower house would then choose members of the upper house.
in both houses the number of representatives would be proportional or corresponding in size to the population of each state.
this would give a state such as virginia many more delegates than delaware the state with the fewest number of people.
delegates from the small states objected.
they preferred a system in which all states had equal representation.

paterson argued that the convention should not deprive smaller states of the equality they had under the articles.
the new jersey plan gave congress the power to set taxes regulate trade and elect an executive branch made up of more than one person.

the delegates had to decide whether to revise the articles of confederation or write a new constitution.
on june 19 the states voted to work toward a new constitution based on the virginia plan.
they still had to deal with the difficult issue of representation that divided the large and small states.
the great compromise the convention appointed a committee to settle the disagreement.
roger sherman of connecticut suggested what would later be called the great compromise.
a compromise is the settling of a dispute when each party agrees to give up some of its demands.
shermans compromise proposed different representation in the two house legislature.
in the upper house the senate each state would have two members.
that is the states would be equal in representation.
in the lower house the house of representatives the number of seats for each state would vary based on the states population.
larger states would have more representation.
the three fifths compromise delegates from the south and north disagreed on whether and how to count each states enslaved population.
including enslaved people as part of a states population would increase each southern states size.
this would give southern states more seats in congress.
the southern states liked this but the northern states did not.
at the same time larger populations would increase each southern states taxes because states were to be taxed based on their populations.
the south was not happy about this.
as a solution to this dispute delegates agreed to what was called the three fifths compromise.
as part of this compromise every five enslaved persons would count as three persons in the state s population total.
this population total would be the basis for setting taxes and determining representation in congress.
the question of the slave trade most northern states had already banned the slave trade.
they wanted to prohibit it nationwide.
southern states considered slavery central to their economy.
northerners agreed to keep the new congress from interfering with the slave trade until 1808 compromise a settlement of a dispute by each party giving up some demands a more perfect union 1 debating a bill of rights state constitutions such as those of virginia and massachusetts had a listing of key rights and freedoms.
these are known as a declaration of rights or a bill of rights.
at the convention some delegates worried that without a bill of rights the new national government might abuse its power.
george mason of virginia proposed a bill of rights to be included in the constitution.
the delegates rejected this idea.
most of the delegates believed that the constitution carefully defined government powers and provided enough protection of individual rights.
approving the constitution on september 17 1787 the delegates assembled to sign the constitution they had created.
three delegates refused to sign elbridge gerry of massachusetts and edmund randolph and george mason of virginia.
gerry and mason would not sign because the constitution did not have a bill of rights.
randolph who had put forth the virginia plan felt the final document strayed too far from his own beliefs.
the other delegates did sign the document.
the approved draft of the constitution went out to the states for their approval.
under the articles of confederation all 13 states would have had to agree to any change to the framework of government.
the drafters of the new constitution decided however that the document would go into effect with the approval of just 9 of the 13 states.

he stated that these natural rights include the rights to life liberty and property.
in his two treatises of civil government 1690 he wrote that government is based on an agreement or contract between the people and their government.
americans interpreted natural rights to mean the rights of britons defined in the magna carta and the english bill of rights.
the framers viewed the constitution as a contract between the american people and their government.
the contract protected peoples natural rights by limiting government power.
the french writer montesquieu declared in the spirit of laws 1748 that the powers of government should be separated and balanced against each other.

the united states constitution sets forth seven key principles upon which the american system of government rests.
these principles are 1 popular sovereignty 2 a republican form of government 3 limited government 4 federalism 5 separation of powers 6 checks and balances and 7 individual rights.
the principles of the constitution ensure government restraint as well as power.
at the same time the constitution sets limits so that americans need never fear tyranny.
popular sovereignty the idea that the power of government lies with the people is called popular sovereignty or the right of the people to rule the declaration of independence had identified many grievances against king george iii including imposing taxes on the colonists without their consent and suspending their legislatures.
the principles of the constitution guard against the abuse of power by government.
republicanism a republic is a government in which power is held by the people and exercised by their elected representatives.
the principle of republicanism includes several ideas.

republicanism stresses the values of individual liberty and inalienable rights.
the constitution establishes a republican form of government.
a constitutional republic is a government in which the people rule through elected representatives who govern according to a constitution that limits the governments power.
limited government the framers were wary of a government that might take away peoples rights or favor certain groups.
at the same time they realized that the nation needed a stronger government than the articles of confederation had provided.
their goal was to establish limited government in which the powers of government are strictly defined.
a limited government has only those powers that are given to it by the people.
federalism the original 13 states had fought hard to win independence from great britain.
the articles of confederation protected that independence but it failed to create a national government strong enough to deal with many challenges the young nation faced.
the united states has a federal government in which the many state governments and the single federal government share power.
this system is known as federalism.
the constitution creates the federal system.
it explains how powers are distributed among different levels of government.
the constitution spells out the powers given to congress and establishes the executive and judicial branches.
the constitution lists enumerated powers or those powers that are specifically given to congress.
enumerated powers include the power to coin money regulate interstate and foreign trade maintain the armed forces and create federal courts.
the states cannot exercise these powers.
reserved powers are those powers that belong to the states.
the constitution does not specifically list the reserved powers.
the tenth amendment declares that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are reserved to the states the reserved powers include the power to establish schools pass marriage and divorce laws and regulate trade within a state.
under the constitution the federal government and the state governments share certain powers.
these are the concurrent powers.
examples of concurrent powers are the right to raise taxes borrow money provide for the public welfare republicanism favoring a republic with elected representation as the best form of government the power to coin money is an enumerated power.
congress also has the power to print currency such as the paper bills shown here.
0 popular sovereignty the belief that government is subject to the will of the people constitutional republic a government in which citizens rule through elected representatives according to a plan of government limited government government with limited powers strictly defined by law enumerated power a power specifically given congress in the constitution reserved power a power belonging only to the states concurrent power a power shared by the states and federal government lesson 1 257 the right to carry out criminal justice is a concurrent power and the federal government and the states have their own justice systems.
and administer criminal justice.
each state and the federal government can exercise these powers at the same time.
while states have their own laws and powers the constitution is the supreme law of the land if a state law contradicts the constitution or federal law the constitution or federal law prevails.
this is stated in article vi clause 2 of the constitution the supremacy clause.
separation of powers to make sure no person or group in government has too much power the constitution provides for a separation of powers.
this means the constitution separates the legislative executive and judicial powers of government.
it then places these powers in three different branches of government.
each branch has different and limited powers duties and responsibilities.
checks and balances the framers did more than separate the powers of government.
they set up a system of checks and balances.
under this system each branch of government can check or limit the power of the other branches.
this system helps maintain a balance in the power of the three branches.
here is an example of how the system of checks and balances works congress legislative branch has the power to pass a law.
if the president executive branch disagrees with the law he or she can reject it through the presidential power of the veto.
this veto power checks the power of congress.
at the same time congress can override the veto.
this checks the power of the executive branch.
the united states supreme court judicial branch also has important checks on the other branches.
the supreme court has the power to interpret the constitution and to decide whether or not actions by the legislative and executive branches are allowed.
congress can check decisions made by the courts by beginning the process of changing the constitution itself.
for example the supreme court ruled in the 1857 dred scott v sandford decision that african americans enslaved or free were not citizens.
in 1866 congress proposed the fourteenth amendment.
the amendment was meant to grant full citizenship to formerly enslaved african americans.
when ratified by the states in 1868 the fourteenth amendment had the effect of overruling the dred scott decision.
there are several other ways in which the branches of government check and balance one another.

individual rights the constitution that the framers wrote in 1787 did not have a bill of rights.
these ten amendments became part of the constitution in 1791.
they guarantee basic liberties and individual rights including freedom of religion freedom of speech and of the press freedom to assemble in groups and to protest against the government the right to bear arms the right to a speedy and public trial by jury the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government freedom from cruel and unusual punishments since 1791 other constitutional amendments have expanded on the rights of the american people.
for example amendments have abolished slavery defined citizenship guaranteed equal protection of the law for all people and guaranteed the right to vote for people aged 18 and older.
amendments have also authorized the direct popular election of senators.

lesson 1 259 amending the constitution guiding question how is the constitution able to change over time.
the united states constitution is one of the worlds oldest written constitutions.
it is also a short document compared to many other constitutions.
its clear direct language has helped support stable government for well over two centuries.
at the same time the constitution has enabled government to adapt to changing times and to deal with challenges that the original framers never dreamed of from radio communications to nuclear power to space exploration and more.
the constitution has changed as a result of formal amendment.
the framers allowed for this process when they wrote the constitution.
people have suggested many hundreds of amendments over the years.
yet the nation has amended its constitution only 27 times.
the framers deliberately made the amendment process difficult.
as the diagram the amendment process shows amending the constitution involves two steps.
the first is the formal proposal of an amendment.
congress can do this by a two thirds vote.
also two thirds of the state legislatures can call a the amendment process af of the hundreds of amendments people have proposed or suggested only 27 have become part of the constitution.
q identifying where do amendments to the constitution get their start.
critical thinking drawing conclusions do you think the process for amending the constitution is too easy too difficult or about right.
step 1 proposal a constitutional amendment can be proposed in one of two ways b at a convention called by 2 3 of the states implied power power not enumerated in the constitution but suggested in its language a by 2 3 of the members of both the house senate step 2 ratification after an amendment is proposed it must be ratified.

i i 260 the constitution convention to propose an amendment though this method has never been used.
the second step in the amendment process is ratification.
ratification of an amendment requires approval by three fourths of the states.
states can ratify the amendment at either a state convention or through a vote by the state legislature.
amendments have brought significant changes to the nation.
in addition to protecting our rights amendments have extended the right to vote to a larger share of the population.
the fifteenth amendment sought to ensure that african american men would have the right to vote.
the nineteenth amendment extended voting rights to women.
the twenty fourth amendment outlawed poll taxes giving more people the ability to vote.
the twenty sixth amendment lowered the voting age to 18.
formal amendment is one way the constitution has changed.
the language of the constitution has also been subject to different interpretations.
for example over history congress has claimed for itself certain implied powers ihm plyd.
these are powers that are suggested but not directly stated in the constitution.
the source of the implied powers is article i section 8 of the constitution.
here is found the necessary and proper clause or the elastic clause this clause directs congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying out its duties.
also in article i section 8 is the commerce clause this gives congress power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states congress has used this clause to expand its powers into areas such as the regulation of television that do not appear in the constitution.
h reading progress check summarizing what is the two step process for amending the u s constitution.
over the course of american history some unwritten customs of government have become so strong that they seem to have the effect of law.
for example until the twenty fifth amendment which was ratified in 1967 the constitution did not specify that the vice president would assume the office of president in the event of a presidents death.
yet on eight occasions that is exactly what happened.
each time the custom was applied it acquired more force.

it matters because in a nation where the people rule citizens must understand their government and their rights and responsibilities.
the federal government guiding question what are the three branches of government.
to achieve a separation of powers the constitution divides the federal government into three branches.
they are called the legislative executive and judicial branches.
the nation s legislature congress is the legislative branch of government.
it has two houses the house of representatives and the senate.
currently the house has 435 voting members and 6 nonvoting delegates from the district of columbia puerto rico guam american samoa the virgin islands and the northern mariana islands.
representatives who must be at least 25 years old serve two year terms.
there is no limit to the number of terms a person can serve.
the number of representatives from each state is based on the states population.
states with more people have more representatives in congress though every state has at least one representative.
the federal government resets each states share of the 435 house seats every 10 years.
a states number of representatives may go up or down depending on population changes.

262 the constitution content vocabulary judicial review due process equal protection the senate has 100 senators two from each state.
senators must be at least 30 years old and they serve six year terms.
only one third of the seats come up for election every two years.

article i of the constitution describes the role of congress.
congress makes the nations laws.
these laws are not just rules for behavior.
congress passes laws that impose taxes authorize the spending of money and create government programs.
congress also has the job of declaring war.
both houses of congress must agree on a bill or proposed law.
once both houses do this the bill goes to the president.
if the president signs the bill it becomes law.
the executive branch the executive branch is led by the president and vice president who each serve four year terms.
it also includes the presidents cabinet or top advisers and many other offices departments and agencies.
the executive branchs main job is to administrate or carry out the laws passed by congress.
the president does however propose laws to congress.
the president has many other powers laid out in article ii of the constitution.
these include directing foreign policy naming ambassadors and negotiating treaties with other nations.
the president is also the commander in chief of the armed forces.
the constitution places the military under the control of the president a civilian.
the framers realized that if military force was not controlled it could endanger the nation.
the judicial branch article iii of the constitution establishes a supreme court and allows for congress to create lower courts.
congress has established district courts which are the main trial courts for the federal government and appeals courts which hear cases on appeal from lower courts.
there are several other types of federal courts as well.
for example there are special federal courts for hearing bankruptcy cases.
bankruptcy is a legal process for people or businesses that cannot pay off their debts.
the supreme court is at the top of the united states legal system.
it rules on only the most difficult legal questions and its rulings are never appealed.
the supreme court also has the power of judicial review.
the court can review the actions of the executive and legislative branches to determine whether they violate the constitution.

reading helpdesk what it means to be a citizen guidingquestion what are the rights and elements of participation of american atm.
citizens of the united states enjoy certain rights and liberties.
being a citizen also involves some responsibilities.
our rights our rights fall into three main categories 1he right to be protected from unfair government actions the right to be treated equally with others and the right to enjoy basic freedoms.
our government must treat people fairly and accordingto clear rules.
this is spelled out in the fifth amendment which says no one shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law due process means the government must follow established procedures in taking action against a citizen.
the fourteenth amendment guarantees all people equal protection of the laws.
this principle means all people regardless of race religion or political beliefs must receive the same treatment under the law.
the first amendment outlines many of our basic freedoms these include freedom of religion freedom of speech and of the press freedom of assembly and freedom to petition the government.
the framers knew that in a free society in which the people rule people must be able to share ideas.
our rights and freedoms have limits.
for example government can limit our freedom of speech or our right to hold a protest i due process the legal rules and procedures the government must observe before depriving a person of life liberty or property equal protection the equal application of the law regardless of a person s race religion political beliefs or other qualities naturalization the process of becoming a citizen of another country academic vocabulary diminish reduce make smaller 264 the constitution if it threatens public safety.

for the most part anyone born on u s soil is automatically a u s citizen.
u s soil includes american territories and military bases around the world.
citizenship is also granted to anyone born outside of the united states if one parent is a u s citizen.
a person who was born in another country can become a citizen through the process called naturalization nachuh ruh lih zay shuhn.
a number of responsibilities things we are expected or required to do come with citizenship.

all males 18 and older must register with the government in case they are needed to defend the country.

the french viewed the 1794 jays treaty as an american attempt to help the british in their war with france.
to punish the united states the french seized american ships that carried cargo to britain.
president adams sent a team of diplomats to paris to try to resolve the dispute in the fall of 1797.
french officials chose not to meet with the americans.

it matters because in the election of 1800 the nation experienced a peaceful transferal power from one party to the other.
the election of 1800 guidingquestion iv jflf did the election of 1800 show about the nature of politics.
in the election of 1800 the federalist party supported president adams for a second term and charles pinckney for vice president.
the republicans nominated thomas jefferson for president and aaron burr as his running mate.
the election campaign of 1800 was very different from the political campaigns we see today.
neither adams nor jefferson traveled around the country to gather support.
many thought direct campaigning improper for a person who would be president.
instead hundreds of letters were sent to leading citizens and newspapers to make candidates views public.
the campaign was bitterly fought.
each political party made personal attacks against the other.
for example the federalists accused jefferson who believed in freedom of religion of being godless.
the republicans warned that the federalist party favored the wealthy and would bring back monarchy.
the vote is tied under the constitution voters in a presidential election are really electing groups of people called electors.
these electors form what is known as the electoral college.
they cast the ballots that content vocabulary customs duty jurisdiction boundary disputed by britain and the u s popular vote total 67 282 eight electors in pennsylvania voted for jefferson and seven for adams.
eight electors in north carolina voted for jefferson and four for adams.
five electors in maryland voted for jefferson and five for adams.
actually elect the president and vice president.
each state has as many electors and electoral votes as it has members of congress.
at that time the constitution said that electors were to cast two ballots without indicating which was for president and which was for vice president.
the candidate with the majority of votes became president and the candidate with the next largest number of votes became vice president.
in 1800 73 electors cast their ballots for jefferson and burr.
each candidate therefore got the same number of votes.
because of the tie vote the house of representatives had to decide the election.
in the house federalists tried to keep jefferson from becoming president by supporting burr.
for 35 ballots the election remained tied.
finally one federalist decided not to vote for burr.
because no one wanted to see another tie between a presidential and vice presidential candidate in 1803 congress passed the twelfth amendment to the constitution which was ratified the following year.
from then on electors cast one of their votes for president and the other for vice president.

jefferson believed that a large federal government threatened liberty and that individual states could better protect freedom.
he wanted to limit the power size and authority of the central government.
h reading progress check identifying what criticism did each political party make of the other inthe election of 1800.
jefferson as president guiding question what did jefferson want to accomplish during his presidency.
thomas jefferson had strong ideas about government and he surrounded himself with people who shared similar views.
jefferson and albert gallatin secretary of the treasury reduced the national debt and cut down on military expenses.
jefferson also limited the number of federal government workers to a few hundred people.
at the same time his government got rid of most federal taxes.
they only collected customs duties or taxes on imported goods.
under jefferson the governments income would come from customs duties and from the sale of western lands.
he believed that these changes would help to create a stable economic system.
judiciary act of 1801 after the election and before jefferson took office the federalists passed an act to expand the nations court system.
john adams used this act the judiciary act of 1801 to make hundreds of appointments during his last days as president.
adams also asked john marshall to serve as chief justice.
congress was then still under federalist control and supported adamss choices.
in this way adams blocked jefferson from making appointments and made sure the federalists controlled the courts.
adams s appointments could not take effect until these last minute appointees known as midnight judges received certain official papers called commissions.
when jefferson became president some of these appointees had not yet received their commissions.
jefferson told secretary of state james madison not to deliver them.
academic vocabulary similar sharing qualities but not the same as like principle a fundamental or basic law or idea the growing power of the supreme court one of the appointees who did not get his commission was william marbury.
he asked the supreme court to force its delivery.
the court said it did not have the jurisdiction jur iss dik shuhn the legal authority to force delivery of marburys commission.
marbury had argued that an act of congress gave the court such authority but the court ruled that that act violated the constitution.
the ruling in marbury v madison affected much more than william marburys career.
in this landmark case chief justice john marshall established the three principles of judicial review 1 the constitution is the supreme law of the land 2 the constitution must be followed when there is a conflict with any other law and 3 the judicial branch can declare laws unconstitutional.
in short marshall claimed for the courts the power to find acts of other branches unconstitutional.
judicial review is a key check on the legislative and executive branches.
in his 34 year term as chief justice marshall helped broaden the power of the court.
he also expanded federal power at the expense of the states.
in mcculloch v maryland 1819 the court held that congress does have implied powers and that states cannot tax the federal government.
in gibbons v ogden 1824 the court held that federal law overrules state law in matters affecting more than one state.
in worcester v georgia 1832 the court decided that states could not regulate native americans.

guiding question how did spain and france play a role in americans moving west.
in 1800 the territory of the united states extended as far west as the mississippi river.
the area west of the river known as the louisiana territory belonged to spain.
the louisiana territory was an enormous area of land stretching south to the city of new orleans and west to the rocky mountains.
its northern boundaries remained undefined.
during the early 1800s americans moved west in search of land and adventure.
these pioneers many of them farmers expanded settlement in kentucky and tennessee.
many also set out for even less populated areas in the northwest territory.
they made a long and exhausting journey over the appalachian mountains.
pioneers heading to the western lands had to travel along rough muddy roads or cut their way through thick forests.
these westward bound pioneers loaded their household goods into conestoga kah neh stoh guh wagons sturdy vehicles topped with white canvas.
the settlers traveled with their two most valued possessions rifles and axes.
they needed rifles for protection and to hunt animals for food.
they used axes to cut paths for their wagons through the dense forests.
many of the settlers set up farms along rivers that fed into the upper mississippi river.
farmers needed access to the mississippi to transport their crops to markets.
their goods traveled down the mississippi to new orleans where workers loaded them onto other ships bound for markets on the east coast.
the spanish controlled the region but they allowed the americans to sail on the lower mississippi and trade in new orleans.
for the western farmers this agreement was vital to their economic survival.
the french threat for some years the spanish allowed american goods to move freely in their territory.
in 1802 the spanish suddenly changed their policy no longer allowing american goods to move into and beyond new orleans.
president jefferson learned that spain and france had secretly agreed to transfer the louisiana territory to france.
jefferson believed that france had also gained florida in its secret agreement with spain.
this news alarmed jefferson.
the agreement between spain and france posed a serious threat to the united states.
frances leader napoleon bonaparte had plans to create empires in europe and the americas.

a french official told u s representatives robert livingston and james monroe that the entire louisiana territory was for sale.
the offer took livingston and monroe by surprise.
they did not have the authority to accept such an offer.
the deal however was too good to pass up.
the new territory would provide plenty of cheap land for farmers for future generations.
it would also give the united states control of the mississippi river which would protect domestic shipping interests.
these benefits convinced livingston and monroe to close the deal even though they did not have authorization to buy the whole territory.
after a few days of negotiation the parties agreed on a price of 15 million.
jefferson worried that such a large purchase might not be legal.
the constitution said nothing about acquiring new territory.

industrial growth guidingquestion how did new technology affect the way things were made.
in colonial times most americans lived in the same place that they worked which was usually a farm.
when they wanted or needed something they made it.
using their hands and simple tools people made much of their own furniture farm equipment household items and clothing.
in the mid 1700s people began producing goods through new methods.
in great britain inventors built machines that did some of the work involved in cloth making such as spinning thread.
these new machines ran on the power of flowing water.
british cloth makers built factories called mills along rivers.
in the mills they installed large numbers of machines.
to tend the machines mill owners paid people wages regular payment of money in return for work.
people began to leave their homes and farms to work in the mills and collect wages.
this historic change is so important that it is known as the industrial revolution.
the industrial revolution in the united states the industrial revolution reached the united states around 1800.
mills and factories first appeared in new england because of its geography.
first new englands poor soil made farming difficult people willingly gave up farm work to earn wages in mills and growth and expansion taking notes finding the main idea use a diagram like this one to identify the major elements of the free enterprise system.

second new englands many rivers and streams offered thinkinr i ike n the waterpower needed to run factory machinery.
third the plj t ctan t kt area had many ports.
these ports allowed the shipping in of raw i himokjlajn materials such as cotton and the shipping out of finished goods such as cloth.
new inventions at the heart of the industrial revolution was technology.
first new machines changed the way people made cloth.
inventions such as the water frame and spinning jenny spun thread and the power loom wove the thread into cloth.
compared to making thread or cloth by hand the machines saved time and money.
other inventions followed.
in 1793 eli whitney invented the cotton gin.
the word gin is short for engine it quickly removed the seeds from picked cotton and allowed a huge increase in cotton production.
in 1798 eli whitney received a contract from the u s government to make 10 000 rifles in 28 months.
to produce this large quantity in a short time whitney devised a manufacturing method that would produce interchangeable parts.
the idea was to make large quantities of uniform pieces that could replace any other identical pieces.
interchangeable parts opened the way for producing many different kinds of goods on a mass scale and for reducing the price of the goods.
the rise of factories in 1790 congress passed a patent law to protect the rights of inventors.
a patent gives an inventor the sole legal right to make money from an invention for a certain period of time.
thus patents then and now encourage technological innovation.
the british also tried to protect their inventions.
one law prohibited textile workers from sharing technology or leaving the country.
still a british worker named samuel slater brought these secrets to the united states.
he memorized the design of the machines used in the british factory in which he worked.
in the 1790s slater built copies in the united states of british machines that made cotton thread.
slaters mill marked an important step in the industrial revolution in the united states francis cabot lowell improved on slater s mill in 1814.
lowell s massachusetts textile or cloth factory not only made thread it also wove the thread into cloth.

while many new englanders went to work in factories in the early 1800s most americans still lived and worked on farms.
in the northeast farms were small so a family could do all the necessary work.
farmers in the northeast usually sold their products locally.
agriculture moved west along with american settlers.
western farmers in the region north of the ohio river found land that could support a thriving agriculture.
many of these farmers concentrated on raising pork and cash crops such as corn and wheat.
in the south cotton production rose sharply after the invention of the cotton gin.
in addition the cotton gin encouraged planters to grow cotton over a much wider area.
southern farmers seeking new land moved west to plant and farm cotton.
large plantations across the deep south were devoted to the cultivation of the valuable crop.
between 1790 and 1820 cotton production soared from 3 000 to 300 000 bales per year in the south.
the success and spread of cotton production created a huge demand for enslaved workers.
trade in enslaved africans expanded.
between 1790 and 1810 the number of enslaved africans in the united states rose from about 700 000 to 1 2 million.
as farmers moved west the crops they planted varied according to the climate.
while cotton was the common choice in the warmer south grain crops such as wheat shown here and corn dominated the cooler areas to the north.

small investors such as shopkeepers merchants and farmers provided the money necessary to build most new businesses.
these people invested money in hopes of earning profits if the businesses were successful.
low taxes minimum government regulations private property and competition encouraged the growth of the free enterprise system in the young nation.
growth of corporations in the 1830s changes in the law paved the way for the growth of corporations.
a corporation is a type of business that can have many owners.
because of their legal status corporations can grow to a large size.
they sell stock shares of ownership in a company to raise the money to build factories and expand their business.
large corporations began to appear in this era and their great size helped drive industrialization.
the word corporation comes from the latin word corpus which means body.
it is a group of people that acts together.
a corporation continues to exist even after the people who first formed it have one.

barnyard animals often roamed freely.
there were no sewers to carry away waste so diseases such as cholera and yellow fever were a threat.
fire was another danger.
sparks from a fireplace could easily ignite wooden buildings.
fires could be disastrous since few cities had organized fire companies.

in 1790 the first census the official count of a population revealed that there were nearly 4 million americans.
at that time most of these people still lived in the narrow strip of land between the appalachian mountains and the atlantic ocean.
that pattern however was changing.
for years a few rugged american settlers had been crossing the appalachian mountains and settling in western lands.
now a steady stream of settlers began moving west.
daniel boone and the wilderness road explorer and pioneer daniel boone was among the early western pioneers.
in 1769 he explored a native american trail through the appalachian mountains.
called warriors path it led boone through a break in the mountains the cumberland gap.
beyond the gap lay the gentle hills of a land now called kentucky.

building roadways the nation needed good inland roads for travel and to ship goods.
private companies built many turnpikes or toll roads.
tolls or fees paid by travelers helped pay the cost of building the roads.
many roads had a base of crushed stone.
in some areas workers built corduroy roads these roads had a surface made up of logs laid side by side like the ridges of corduroy cloth.
ohio became a state in 1803.
the new state asked the i connections to today the national road drivers today can follow a modern road that closely follows the route of the national road.

the 140 foot 43 m clermont was large fast and comfortable.
i reading helpdesk the route closely followed that of a military road george washington had built in 1754.
it eventually reached ohio and then vandalia illinois.
congress viewed the road as vital to military readiness but did not take on any other road building projects.
traveling on rivers river travel was far more comfortable than travel by road which was often rough and bumpy.
also boats or river barges could carry far larger loads of farm products or other goods.
river travel had two big drawbacks however.
first most major rivers in the eastern region flowed in a north south direction while most people and goods were headed east or west.
second while traveling downstream was easy moving upstream against the current was slow.
in the 1780s and 1790s boat captains were already using steam engines to power boats in quiet waters.
these early engines however did not have enough power to overcome the strong currents and winds found in large rivers lakes or oceans.
the clermont s first voyage in 1802 robert livingston a political and business leader hired robert fulton to build a steamboat with a powerful engine.
livingston wanted the steamboat to carry cargo and passengers up the hudson river from new york city to albany.
in 1807 fulton launched his steamboat the clermont.
the boat made the 150 mile 241 km trip from new york city to albany in 32 hours.
using only sails the trip would have taken four days.
the clermont offered many comforts.
passengers could sit or stroll on deck or relax in sleeping compartments below deck.
the engine was noisy but its power provided a smooth ride.
canal an artificial waterway academic vocabulary region an area defined by a feature or characteristic i lock a separate compartment in which water levels rise and fall in order to raise or lower boats on a canal 354 growth and expansion i 1 steamboats ushered in a new age of river travel.
shipping goods and moving people became cheaper and faster.
regular steamboat service began along the mississippi river between new orleans and natchez mississippi in 1812.
steamboats also contributed to the growth of river cities such as cincinnati and st louis.
by 1850 some 700 steamboats were carrying cargo and passengers within the united states.
new waterways steamboats improved transportation but were limited to major rivers.
no such river linked the east and the west.
business and government officials led by dewitt clinton in new york developed a plan to connect new york city with the great lakes region.
they would build a canal an artificial waterway across the state of new york.
the canal would connect the hudson river with buffalo on lake erie.
from these points existing rivers and lakes could connect a much wider area.
the erie canal thousands of workers many of them irish immigrants helped build the 363 mile 584 km erie canal.
along the way they built a series of locks separate compartments in which workers could raise or lower the water level.
the locks worked like an escalator to raise and lower boats up and down hills.
canal building was a hazardous task.
many workers died as a result of cave ins or blasting accidents.
another threat was disease which bred in the swamps where the workers toiled.
after more than eight years of hard work the erie canal opened on october 26 1825.
clinton who was now governor of new york boarded a barge in buffalo and traveled on the canal to albany.
from there he sailed down the hudson river to new york city.

critical thinking analyzing why do you think the canal helped populations grow.
canal travel expands at first the erie canal did not allow steamboats because their powerful engines could cause damage to the canals earthen banks.
instead teams of mules or horses hauled the boats and barges.
a two horse team pulled a 100 ton 91 t barge about 24 miles 39 km in one day.
this was fast compared with travel by wagon.
in the 1840s workers strengthened the canal banks so that steam tugboats could pull the barges.
the erie canals success did not go unnoticed.
by 1850 the country had more than 3 600 miles 5 794 km of canals.
canals lowered shipping costs and brought prosperity to towns along their routes.

in 1800 only 387 000 white settlers lived west of the appalachian mountains.
by 1820 that number had grown to more than 2 4 million people.
ohio for example had only 45 000 settlers in 1800.
by 1820 it had 581 000 residents.
early pioneer families often settled in communities along the great rivers such as the ohio and the mississippi.
these waterways provided a highway for shipping crops and other goods to markets.
the growth of canals also helped expand the area open to settlement.
canals allowed people to settle on lands farther from the large rivers.
people often preferred to settle with others from their original homes.
it was mainly people from tennessee and kentucky who settled indiana for example.
michigans pioneers came mostly from new england.
western families often gathered together for social events.
men took part in sports such as wrestling.

in 1816 the republican majority in congress approved the creation of a new national bank.
president madison signed the bill creating the second bank of the united states.
after the first bank closed many state banks had acted unwisely.
they made too many loans and allowed too much money into circulation.
these actions led to inflation a rise in the prices of goods.
as prices rose american families could buy less and less with each dollar.
the absence of a national bank also meant the federal government had no safe place to keep its funds.
the second bank of the united states restored stability to the money supply helping american businesses to grow.
competition from britain another challenge facing the economy was a flood of british goods following the war of 1812.
british factories often had more advanced technology and methods than american factories.
the british turned out goods of higher quality and at a lower price than goods made in the united states.
naturally buyers preferred these goods.
by flooding the united states with their goods the british hoped to keep american businesses from competing.
congress created the second bank of the united states to restore order to the united states money supply.

h reading helpdesk sectionalism rivalry based on the special interests of different areas i new tariffs american manufacturers called for high tariffs to protect their growing industries.
to address this problem congress passed the tariff of 1816.
unlike earlier revenue tariffs which were meant to provide income for the federal government this tariff was designed to protect american manufacturers from foreign competition by placing high taxes on imports.
merchants who paid the tariff on imported goods simply added the cost of the tariff to their prices.
this made imported items more expensive for consumers and encouraged them to buy cheaper american made goods.
when congress passed protective tariffs in 1818 and 1824 that were even higher than the tariff of 1816 some americans protested.
southerners were especially angry.
they felt that the tariff protected northern manufacturers at their expense.
the south had few factories so people there saw little benefit from high tariffs.
what the southern states did see were higher prices for the goods they had to buy.
growing sectionalism the tariff dispute illustrated a growing sectionalism sehk shuh nuhlih zuhm differences in the goals and interests of different parts of the country.
such differences had existed since colonial times.
now it seemed they were growing sharper.
in fact they soon brought an end to the era of good feelings.
in the early 1800s three distinct sections developed in the united states the north the south and the west.
the north included new england and the mid atlantic states.
the south covered what is now the southeast.
the west included the area between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river.
geography economics and history all contributed to sectional differences and differing ways of life in the united states.
as the differences grew deeper however people began to wonder whether sectionalism might divide the nation.
each section of the country had a strong voice in congress in the early 1800s.
henry clay of kentucky represented the interests of western states.
john c calhoun of south carolina spoke for southern interests.
daniel webster of massachusetts protected the interests of new england.
each leader although a nationalist at this time remained concerned with protecting the interests of his own section of the country.
360 growth and expansion nationalism and the supreme court under the strong leadership of chief justice john marshall the u s supreme court backed the powers ofthe national government over the states in three landmark decisions in the early 1800s.
in the case of fletcher v peck in 1810 the court ruled that courts could declare acts of a state government void if they violated provisions of the constitution.
then in 1819 the court decided the case of mcculloch v maryland.
it said that the state of maryland could not tax the local office of the bank ofthe united states because it was the property of the national government.
allowing such a tax the court said would give states too much power over the national government.
in this ruling the court also declared that the national bank was constitutional even though the constitution did not specifically give congress the power to create a bank.
marshall observed that the constitution specifically gave congress power to issue money borrow money and collect taxes.
congress could also he reasoned do whatever was necessary and proper to carry out those powers.
in 1824 the court again ruled in favor of federal government power in gibbons v ogden.
the state of new york had granted a monopoly muhnah puhlee sole control of an industry to a steamship operator running ships between new york and new jersey.
under new yorks law no other operator could run steamboats on the same route.
the supreme court said that only congress had the power to make laws governing interstate commerce or trade between states.
missouri statehood in 1819 the missouri territory asked congress for admission as a state.
most missouri settlers had come from kentucky and tennessee which allowed slavery.
they believed slavery ought to be legal in missouri.
representative james tallmadge proposed that missouri gradually abolish slavery in order to be admitted to the union.
the house passed this plan but the senate blocked it.
at the time the population in the north was slightly larger than that in the slave states of the south.
consequently the north had 105 members in the house of representatives compared to the souths 81 members.
representation in the senate was balanced with 11 slave states and 11 free states.
the addition of missouri as a free state would put the south in the minority in both houses of congress.
biography henry clay 1777 1852 henry clay had a long career in congress that began when he was elected to fill a senate vacancy when he was just 29 a year shy ofthe constitution s age requirement.
clay s ability to resolve arguments earned him the nickname the great compromiser.

clay proposed that maine in the northeast enter the union as a free state.
missouri could then enter as a slave state.
this would keep an even balance of power in the senate 12 free states and 12 slave states.
the missouri compromise also addressed the question of slavery in the rest of the louisiana purchase territory.
the compromise drew a line west from the southern boundary of missouri at 3630 n latitude.
the compromise blocked slavery north of the line but permitted it south of the line.
the missouri compromise promised a temporary solution to sectional conflict.
it did nothing to solve the basic problem however.
americans who moved west took their different ways of life with them.
white southerners wanted to take an economy based on slavery to their new homes.

366 growth and expansion by mark twain samuel langhorne clemens 1835 1910 known as mark twain was born in missouri.
he spent his early years along the mississippi river in the town of hannibal.
later as a young man clemens trained as a river pilots apprentice.
he used his experiences as a basis for many of the stories in his memoir life on the mississippi.
this book is a collection of humorous anecdotes and folktales that provides a glimpse into twains life before he became a famous author.
mark twain used memories of his youth in writing life on the mississippi.
i remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to glide by hannibal when i was a boy an acre or so of white sweet smelling boards in each raft a crew of two dozen men or more.
99 from life on the mississippi primary source 6i between la salle s opening of the river and the time when it may be said to have become the vehicle of anything like a regular and active commerce seven sovereigns had occupied the throne of england america had become an independent nation.
the river s earliest commerce was in great barges keelboats broadhorns.
they floated and sailed from the upper rivers to new orleans changed cargoes there and were tediously warped and poled back by hand.
a voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine months.
in time this commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of rough and hardy men rude uneducated brave suffering terrific hardships with sailor like stoicism heavy fighters reckless fellows every one elephantinely jolly foul witted profane prodigal of their money bankrupt at the end ofthe trip fond of barbaric finery prodigious braggarts yet in the main honest trustworthy faithful to promises and duty and often picturesquely magnanimous.
vocabulary sovereign one who holds power tedious boring stoicism the quality of not reacting to pleasure or pain elephantine having great size profane not religious prodigal wasteful prodigious large in size or quantity magnanimous noble generous heyday the peak of one s strength by and by the steamboat intruded.
then for fifteen or twenty years these men continued to run their keelboats down stream and the steamers did all ofthe upstream business the keelboatmen selling their boats in new orleans and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers.
but after a while the steamboats so increased in number and in speed that they were able to absorb the entire commerce and then keelboating died a permanent death.
the keelboatman became a deck hand or a mate or a pilot on the steamer and when steamer berths were not open to him he took a berth on a pittsburgh coal flat or on a pine raft constructed in the forests up toward the sources of the mississippi.
literary element imagery is the use of descriptive and figurative language.
it appeals to at least one ofthe five senses hearing seeing tasting smelling and touching.
as you read identify images that create a sensory experience.
for example how does twain s description ofthe rafts appeal to your sense of smell.
in the heyday ofthe steamboating prosperity the river from end to end was flaked with coal fleets and timber rafts all managed by hand and employing hosts ofthe rough characters whom i have been trying to describe.
i remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to glide by hannibal when i was a boy an acre or so of white sweetsmelling boards in each raft a crew of two dozen men or more three or four wigwams scattered about the raft s vast level space for storm quarters and i remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk of their big crews for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get on these rafts and have a ride.

new parties emerge guiding question what new ways of campaigning appeared during the elections of 1824 and 1828.
from 1816 to 1824 the united states had only one major political party.
this was the democratic republican party.
the party was far from united.
in 1824 four democratic republican candidates competed for the presidency.
party leaders chose william h crawford a former senator from georgia to be their candidate.
three other candidates were favorite sons that is they received backing from their home states rather than the national party.
their views reflected the interests of their regions.
two favorite sons andrew jackson and henry clay were from the west.
clay of kentucky was speaker of the house of representatives.
jackson of tennessee was a hero of the war of 1812.
raised in poverty he claimed to speak for americans who had been left out of politics.

the election of 1824 produced great controversy.
constitution requires that the house of representatives select the president when no candidate has won a majority of the electoral vote.
as the house prepared to vote clay met with adams.
clay agreed to use his influence as speaker to defeat jackson.
with clays help the house chose adams for president.
adams quickly named clay to be secretary of state.
in the past this office had been the stepping stone to the presidency.
jacksons followers accused the two men of making a corrupt bargain and stealing the election.
adams as president adams and clay denied any wrongdoing.
no one ever uncovered any evidence of a bargain.
still the charge cast a shadow over adamss presidency.
in his first message to congress adams announced his plans.
in addition to improving roads and waterways he wanted to build a national university and support scientific research.
adamss proposals upset his opponents.
they wanted a more limited role for the federal government.
it would be wrong they believed for government to spend money on such projects.

the election of 1828 by 1828 the democratic republican party had split.
jacksons supporters called themselves democrats.
the national republicans supported adams.
most democrats favored states rights and distrusted strong central government.
the national republicans wanted a strong central government.
they supported measures such as building roads and a national bank to facilitate economic growth.
during the campaign both sides resorted to mudslinging or attempts to ruin their opponents reputation with insults.
the candidates also used slogans buttons and rallies.
such practices became a regular part of american political life.
in the election jackson received most of the votes cast in the frontier states.
he also received many votes in the south where his support for states rights was popular.
john c calhoun of south carolina who had been adamss vice president switched parties to run with jackson.
calhoun also supported states rights.

andrew jackson had qualities most americans admired.
he was a patriot a self made man and a war hero.
thousands of ordinary people came to washington for his inauguration.
expanded voting rights president andrew jackson promised equal protection and equal benefits for all americans at least all white american men.
jacksons promise reflected the spirit of the times.
in the nations early years only men who owned property or paid taxes could vote.
by the 1820s many states had loosened these requirements.
white male sharecroppers factory workers and others could now participate in the political process.
by 1828 nearly all states let voters rather than state legislatures choose presidential electors.
women still could not vote.
african americans and native americans had few rights of any kind.
making government more democratic jackson disliked interest groups organized groups of people who try to influence government in a way that helps their own interests.
he also disliked people whose power came from privilege.
instead jackson and other democrats wanted to further open government to the people.

the fired employees protested.
but one jackson supporter said to the victors belong the spoils in other words because jackson had won the election his supporters had the right to the spoils or benefits of victory.
this practice of replacing current government employees with supporters of the winner is called the spoils system.
jacksons supporters also abandoned the unpopular caucus system in which top party leaders chose the partys candidates for office.
instead parties began using nominating conventions nahmih nayting kuhn ven shuhnz where delegates from the states chose the partys presidential candidate.

according to the states rights position the constitution was an agreement among the states to establish a national government.
if an act of the national government went beyond the powers granted by the constitution a state had the right to refuse to obey.
president jackson disagreed.
if a state could nullify any federal law it considered unconstitutional the power of the federal government would cease.
he feared nullification could destroy the union.
nominating convention a meeting in which representative members of a political party choose candidates to run for important elected offices i 378 the jackson era in 1830 at a washington dinner marking thomas jeffersons birthday jackson had a chance to make his feelings on nullification known.

looking directly at calhoun the president declared our union.
it must be preserved answering jacksons challenge the vice president rose with a toast of his own the union next to our liberty most dear to make sure his meaning was clear calhoun added it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the states in 1832 congress passed a lower tariff.
it was not enough to cool the protest.
south carolina passed the nullification act declaring it would not pay the illegal tariffs of 1828 and 1832.
the state threatened to secede or break away from the union if the federal government interfered.
to ease the crisis jackson backed a bill that would gradually lower the tariff.
jackson also vowed to uphold the law and asked congress for the power to use the power of the federal government if it was needed.
early in 1833 congress passed the lower tariff bill and also the force bill allowing jackson to use the military to enforce federal law.

the cherokee creek seminole chickasaw and choctaw peoples lived in the mountains plateaus and swamps of georgia alabama mississippi and florida.
these groups had created successful farming communities that were much like many other american communities.
as a result americans considered them civilized and called them the five civilized tribes though americans recognized the success of the five civilized tribes they did not necessarily respect their rights.
in fact some white people wanted the native americans lands for themselves.
to make this possible they wanted the federal government to force eastern native americans to relocate to lands west of the mississippi river.
andrew jackson supported the white settlers demand for native american land.
he had once fought the creek and seminole in georgia and florida to give the settlers more land.
when he became president in 1829 he stated that he wanted to move all native americans to the great plains.
many people taking notes describing as you read use a graphic organizer like this one to describe how each group of native americans resisted removal and the result.
380 the jackson era like most people of the americas in the early 1800s the seminole in this village lived off the land they farmed.
believed this region to be a wasteland where american settlers would never want to live.
many people thought that if all native americans moved there conflict with them would be ended.
the cherokee versus georgia in 1830 president jackson pushed the indian removal act through congress.
this law allowed the federal government to pay native americans to move west.
jackson then sent officials to make treaties with the native americans in the southeast.
in 1834 congress established the indian territory.
most of the region was located in what is now the state of oklahoma.
this area was to be the new home for the native americans of the southeast.
most eastern native american peoples felt forced to sell their land and move west.
the cherokee refused to do so.
in treaties of the 1790s the federal government had recognized the cherokee as a separate nation.
however the state of georgia in which many cherokee lived refused to accept the cherokees status.
in 1830 georgia made cherokee land part of the state.
it also began to enforce state laws in the cherokee nation.
as pressure for relocation mounted the cherokee appealed to the american people primary source ft we are aware that some persons suppose it will be for our advantage to remove beyond the mississippi our people universally think otherwise we wish to remain on the land of our fathers.

reading helpdesk still georgia pressured the cherokee.
in response the cherokee turned to the u s supreme court.
in worcester v georgia 1832 chief justice john marshall ruled that georgia had no right to interfere with the cherokee.
president jackson who supported georgias efforts to remove the cherokee defiantly opposed the supreme court s ruling.
john marshall has made his decision jackson is said to have declared now let him enforce it no one was willing or able to challenge the failure of the president and congress to enforce the courts ruling.
the trail of tears by 1835 the cherokee were divided about what to do.
that year the federal government convinced a small number of cherokee about 500 of them to sign the treaty of new echota.
in this treaty the group agreed to give up all cherokee land by 1838.
cherokee chief john ross sent a protest to the u s senate.
ross explained that the few cherokee who signed the treaty did not speak for all the 17 000 cherokee in the region.
many white americans including senators daniel webster and henry clay also opposed the treaty as unfair.
however their pleas did not change the minds of president jackson or the white settlers.
in 1836 the senate approved the treaty by a single vote.

jacksons successor president martin van buren ordered the army to move the rest of them.
in may 1838 general winfield scott arrived in the cherokee nation with 7 000 troops to remove the remaining cherokee by force.
he told them that resistance and escape were hopeless.
the cherokee knew that fighting would lead to their destruction.
filled with sadness and anger cherokee leaders gave in.
between june and december 1838 soldiers rounded up cherokee in north carolina georgia alabama and tennessee.
under guard the cherokee began their march to indian territory in the west.
the forced relocation of some 15 000 cherokee was a terrible ordeal.
most people were not prepared for the journey.
trouble started even before they set out.
as the cherokee crowded into camps and awaited the command to begin their march illness broke out.
as many as 2 000 cherokee died.
once on the trail the cherokee suffered from hunger and from exposure to the weather.
these conditions led to the deaths of another 2 000 people.
when the relocation was over about one quarter of the cherokee population was dead.
the cherokee came to call their forced journey west the trail where they cried.

reading helpdesk andrew jackson disliked the second bank of the united states long before he became president.
congress had set up the bank in 1816 to hold the federal governments money and to control the nations money supply.
private bankers rather than elected officials ran the bank.
its president nicholas biddle represented everything jackson disliked.
jackson prided himself on being a self made western pioneer who had started with nothing.
biddle came from a wealthy philadelphia family and had a good education and experience in financial matters.
in addition the banks assigned duties made it a powerful institution.
many western settlers depended on being able to borrow money to run their farms.
the banks strict policies made such loans difficult to obtain.
like many other westerners jackson viewed the bank as a monopoly that favored wealthy easterners and limited western growth.

they thought this would force jackson to take action against the bank.
clay and webster believed the bank had the support of the american people.
they thought that if jackson tried to veto or reject the renewal of the banks charter he would lose support.
henry clay wanted to run for president.
he and webster believed that jacksons veto would help clay defeat the president in the 1832 election.
jackson told secretary of state martin van buren the bank is trying to kill me.
but i will kill it jackson vetoed the bill.
he argued that the bank was unconstitutional despite the supreme courts decision to the contrary in mcculloch v maryland 1819.
this case had concerned whether the state of maryland had the right to tax the national bank of the united states.
webster and clay were right about one thing.
the bank did play a large part in the election of 1832.
instead of gaining support for clay as president however their plan backfired.
most people supported jacksons veto and jackson was reelected.
jackson then decided to kill the bank even before its current charter ended.

the democrats chose van buren jacksons vice president during his second term.
the whigs a new party that included former national republicans and other anti jackson forces were the opposition.
the whigs nominated three candidates.
each had support in a different part of the nation.
the whigs hoped this tactic would keep van buren from getting a majority of the electoral votes.
then the election would be decided by the house of representatives which the whigs controlled.
the whigs plan failed.
jacksons popularity and support helped van buren win both the popular and the electoral vote.
van buren had barely taken office when a financial panic hit the nation.

van buren is standing second from the right.
some of these banks began issuing huge amounts of banknotes.
concerned that these notes had little value the government stopped accepting them as payment for purchasing public land people began to question the value of their banknotes leading to economic panic.
the panic of 1837 led to a depression a severe economic downturn.
land values dropped and banks failed.
thousands of businesses closed.
many workers lost their jobs and farmers lost their land.
in cities across the nation many people could not afford food or rent.
president van buren did little to ease the crisis.
he believed in the principle of laissez faire that government should interfere as little as possible in the nations economy.
however van buren did persuade congress to create an independent federal treasury in 1840.
this meant that the government no longer had to deposit its money in private banks as it had been doing.
it would keep its money in the federal treasury instead.
this new system prevented state and private banks from using government money to back their banknotes.
it helped prevent further bank crises.
calling it a second declaration of independence van buren and his supporters hailed the passing of the federal treasury law.
still members of van burens own democratic party joined the whigs in criticizing the act.

lesson 3 389 during the campaign of 1840 the log cabin image appeared in paintings banners and political cartoons.
the log cabin campaign to run against van buren the whigs united behind one of their 1836 candidates william henry harrison.
like andrew jackson harrison was a hero of the war of 1812.
john tyler a planter from virginia was harrisons running mate.
harrison had first gained fame with his victory over tecumsehs followers in the battle of tippecanoe in 1811.
the whigs made reference to this event in the campaign slogan tippecanoe and tyler too.
harrison needed the support of the workers and farmers who had voted for jackson in order to win the election.
the whigs portrayed harrison who in reality was a wealthy ohioan as a simple frontiersman like jackson.
the democrats attacked this image.
they said that all harrison was good for was sitting in front of a log cabin and collecting his military pension.
these attacks played right into the hands of the whigs who adopted the log cabin as the symbol of their campaign.
while presenting harrison as a man of the people the whigs portrayed van buren as a wealthy snob with perfume scented whiskers.
they blamed him for the depression and accused him of spending the peoples money on expensive furniture for the white house.
the whigs tactics and the effects of the depression seemed to work.
a record number of voters turned out to elect harrison by a wide margin making him the first whig president.
inauguration day 1841 was bitterly cold.
harrison insisted on delivering his long speech without a hat or coat.
he died of pneumonia 32 days later.
he served the shortest term of any president and john tyler became the first vice president to gain the presidency because of the death of a president.
at age 50 tyler was also the nations youngest president up to that time.

390 the jackson era john tyler s presidency john tyler won the vice presidential election as a whig.
however he had once been a democrat and had opposed many whig policies.
whig party leaders had put him on the election ballot with harrison mainly to attract southern voters.
whig party leaders daniel webster and henry clay had believed they could control harrison and run the country behind the scenes.
harrisons death ruined that plan.
president tyler vetoed several bills sponsored by whigs in congress.
his lack of party loyalty outraged many whigs.
when he twice vetoed a bill to renew the charter of the bank of the united states all but one of his cabinet members resigned.
only daniel webster remained as secretary of state.
whig leaders actually expelled tyler from the whig party.
the biggest success of the tyler presidency came in the area of foreign relations.
in 1842 the united states and great britain signed the webster ashburton treaty.
this agreement settled a long dispute over the border between maine and canada and set a firm u s canadian boundary from maine to minnesota.
except for opposing tyler the whigs could not agree on their partys goals.
increasingly they voted by region north south and west not party.
this division may explain why the whig candidate henry clay lost the election of 1844 to democratic candidate james polk.
after only four years the whigs were out of power.
the whigs elected just one more president zachary taylor in 1848.
taylor also died in office.
by then the whig party had become badly divided over the issue of slavery.
by the early 1850s the party had nearly disappeared.

the debate over ending slavery lincoln hated slavery yet he was reluctant to make the civil war a battle to end it.
early in the war lincoln hesitated to move against slavery for fear of losing the border states.
even many white northerners who disapproved of slavery were not eager to risk their lives to end it.
meanwhile abolitionists including frederick douglass and newspaper editor horace greeley urged lincoln to make the war a fight to end slavery.
the abolitionists described slavery as a moral wrong that needed to be abolished.
they also pointed out that slavery was the root of the divisions between north and.

lesson 2 513 lincoln s emancipation proclamation sent a clear message to enslaved people and the confederacy about the future of slavery.
primary source a call for emancipation the constitution did not give lincoln the power to end slavery but it did give him the power to take property from an enemy in wartime.

this decree freed all enslaved people in areas that were in rebellion against the united states on january 1 1863.
the emancipation proclamation did not change the lives of all enslaved people overnight.
for example enslaved people living in the loyal border states remained in bondage.
others remained under the direct control of their holders in the south and would have to wait for a union victory before gaining their freedom.
yet the emancipation proclamation had a strong impact.
with it the government declared slavery to be wrong.

reading helpdesk technology and industry guiding question how did technology and industry change during the 1800s.
the early years of the 1800s saw much innovation in industry and technology.
the ways in which americans worked traveled and communicated underwent great change.
the new ways of living affected the whole nation but their effects were most dramatic in the north.
three phases of industrialization before industrialization workers made most goods one item at a time from start to finish.
to make clothes a woman might spin the thread weave the cloth then cut and sew the fabric.
industrialization changed that way of working.
the norths industrialization took place in three phases.
during the first phase employers divided jobs into smaller steps.
for example one worker would spin thread and nothing else.
another worker wove cloth.
each worker specialized in one step and became an expert in it.
two specialized workers could produce more cloth than if each worker did both tasks.
during the second phase of industrialization entrepreneurs built factories to bring specialized workers together.
this allowed the product to move quickly from one worker to the next.
taking notes identifying cause and effect as you read use a diagram like the one shown to describe the three phases of the development of industrialization in the north.
426 north and south development of industrialization phase 5 i content vocabulary clipper ship telegraph morse code in the third phase workers used machines to complete tasks.
for example machines called looms wove cloth using the power of flowing water.
the machines worked much faster than any human could.
the workers job changed from weaving to tending the machine.
mass production of cloth began in new england in the mid 1800s.
then elias howe invented the sewing machine in 1846.
workers could now make clothing in mass quantities by using machine made fabrics and sewing machines.
similar changes were transforming other industries and affecting the norths economy.
by 1860 the northeasts factories made at least two thirds of the countrys manufactured goods.
changing transportation improvements in transportation contributed to the success of the new american industries.
between 1800 and 1850 crews built thousands of miles of roads and canals.
by connecting lakes and rivers canals opened new shipping routes.
in 1807 inventor robert fulton launched his first steamboat the clermont on the hudson river.
steamboats made fast upstream travel possible.
they carried goods and passengers more cheaply and quickly along inland waterways than flatboats or sail powered vessels did.
in the 1840s builders began to widen and deepen canals to make space for steamboats.
by 1860 about 3 000 steamboats traveled the countrys major rivers and canals as well as the great lakes.
this encouraged the growth of cities such as cincinnati buffalo and chicago.
sailing technology also improved in the 1840s.
the new clipper ships featured tall sails and sleek hulls.
they could sail 300 miles 483 km per day as fast as most steamships at that time.
clipper ships got their name because they clipped time from long journeys.
they swiftly and cheaply moved goods from the eastern united states to asia and returl with cargoes of silk and i and tea that were still fre in 1851 the flying cloud a famed clipper ship sailed from new york city to san francisco in 89 days.

a year later peter cooper designed and built the first american steam powered locomotive.
the tom thumb as it was called got off to a slow start.
it actually lost a race staged against a horse drawn train when its engine failed.
before long however engineers had improved the technology.
by 1840 steam locomotives were pulling trains in the united states.
in 1840 the united states had almost 3 000 miles 4 828 km of railroad track.
by 1860 the nations tracks totaled about 31 000 miles 49 890 km mostly in the north and midwest.
the new rail lines connected many cities.
one line linked the cities of new york and buffalo.
another connected philadelphia and pittsburgh.
railway builders connected these eastern lines to lines being built farther west in ohio indiana and illinois.
by 1860 the nations railroads formed a network that united the midwest and the east.
moving goods and people the impact of improved transportation was felt deeply in the western areas of the country.
before canals and railroads farmers sent their crops down the mississippi river to new orleans.
from j there goods sailed to the east coast or to other countries.
this took a considerable amount of time and often caused goods to be more expensive.
i railways and canals transformed trade in these regions.
the opening of the erie canal in 1825 and later the railroad networks allowed grain livestock and dairy products to move directly from the midwest to the east.
improvements in transportation provided benefits to both businesses and consumers.
farmers and j manufacturers could now move goods faster and more cheaply j as a result consumers could purchase those goods at lower prices than in the past.
the railroads also played an important role in the settlement of the midwest and the growth of its industry.
fast affordable train travel brought people into ohio indiana and illinois.
the populations of these states grew as did urban railroad centers such as chicago and omaha.
new towns and industries developed as more people moved into the area.

lesson 1 429 biography john deere 1804 1886 john deere was born in vermont.
he trained as a blacksmith but found it difficult to make a living in his home state.
he traveled to the state of illinois in the 1830s there he learned that farmers were having a difficult time plowing the region s rich but sticky soil with the rough iron plows ofthe day.
deere began making a polished steel plow that performed much better.
within 10 years deere was selling 1 000 plows per year.
he was quoted as saying i will never put my name on a product that does not have in it the best that is in me.
critical thinking drawing condusions what can you conclude about how deere s invention benefited his farmer customers.
samuel morse an american inventor developed a system for sending coded messages instantly along electrical wires.
after morse showed his system could send messages over a short distance congress gave him money to test the device over a wider area.
morse strung wires between washington d c and baltimore maryland.
on may 24 1844 he was ready to tryout his system.
a crowd of people watched as morse tapped out the words what hath god wrought on his telegraph system.
a few moments later the operator in baltimore sent the same message back in reply.
morses telegraph had worked.
telegraph operators sent messages quickly by using morse code.
this code uses different arrangements of short and long signals dots and dashes to represent letters of the alphabet.
telegraph companies formed and workers put up telegraph lines across the country.
by 1852 there were about 23 000 miles 37 015 km of telegraph lines in the united states.
the telegraph allowed information to be communicated in minutes rather than days.
people could quickly learn about news and events from other areas of the united states.
the telegraph also allowed businesses to become more efficient with production and shipping.

farming innovations guidingquestion m ftflf changes made agriculture more profitable in the 1830s.
in the early 1800s few farmers were willing to settle in the treeless great plains west of missouri iowa and minnesota.
even areas of mixed forest and prairie west of ohio and kentucky seemed too difficult for farming.
settlers worried that their old plows could not break the prairies matted sod.
they also worried that the soil would not be fertile enough to support fields of crops.
advancements in agriculture three inventions ofthe 1830s helped farmers overcome difficulties in farming the land.
as a result settlement expanded throughout wider areas of the midwest.
reading helpdesk morse code a system of dots and dashes that represent the alphabet 430 north and south one of these inventions was the steel tipped plow developed by john deere in 1837.
this allowed farmers to cut through the hard packed prairie sod.
knowing that they would be able to farm the land on the prairies helped people make the decision to move west.
equally important to the transformation of farming were the mechanical reaper which sped up the harvesting of wheat and the thresher which quickly separated the grain from the stalk.
each of these innovations reduced the labor required for farming.
mccormick s reaper cyrus mccormick was the genius behind the invention ofthe mechanical reaper.
before this invention farmers had harvested grain with handheld cutting tools.
mccormicks reaper greatly increased the amount of crop a farmer could harvest.
because farmers could harvest more wheat they could plant more of it.
growing wheat became profitable.
raising wheat became and would remain the main economic activity on the midwestern prairies.
new machines and the ease of access to railroads allowed farmers to plant more acres with cash crops.
midwestern farmers grew wheat and shipped it east by train and canal barge.
northeast and middle atlantic farmers increased their production of fruits and vegetables.
in spite of improvements in agriculture the north was steadily becoming more industrial and urban.

reading helpdesk the factories of the north guidingquestion why did many americans push for reform in the workplace during this era.
the factory system played an important role in the nations economic growth.
the factory system combined several steps of an items production under one roof.
in the mid 1800s machines took over more and more manufacturing tasks.
these innovations changed the way goods were manufactured.
the range of goods manufactured this way also increased.
american factories began to turn out everything from fabric and clothing to shoes watches guns sewing machines and agricultural machinery.
more goods were available at cheaper prices to a growing number of consumers leading to economic growth.
conditions for factory workers working conditions worsened as the factory system developed.
employees worked long hours.
by 1840 the average workday was 11 4 hours.
longer days caused fatigue and on the job accidents.
many factory machines had rapidly moving belts and other parts.
these belts had no shields for protection and many workers especially children suffered injuries from these belts.
belts were just one of the many hazards of factory work.
employees often worked under harsh conditions.
in the summer factories were hot and stifling.
the machines gave off heat and there was no such thing as air conditioning at that time.
likewise in the winter workers were often cold because most factories had no heating.
no laws existed to control working conditions or protect workers.
factory owners were often more concerned about profits than about employees comfort and safety.
child labor was also a serious problem.
children in factories often worked six days a week and 12 hours or more a day.
the work was dangerous and hard.
young workers tended machines in mills and worked underground in coal mines.
reformers called for laws to regulate child labor shorten work hours and improve conditions.
many years passed before child labor regulations became law.
workers7 attempts to organize workers tried various ways to gain better conditions in the workplace.
by the 1830s they began organizing into unions.
skilled workers formed trade unions.
these were groups of workers with the same trade or skill.
the idea was that by working together union members would have more power than they would as individuals.
in new york city skilled workers wanted to receive higher wages and limit their workday to 10 hours.
groups of skilled workers formed the general trades union of the city of new york.
the workers staged a series of strikes in the mid 1830s.
a strike is a refusal to work in order to put pressure on employers.
going on strike was illegal in the early 1800s.
in addition to the threat of losing their jobs workers who went on strike faced punishment for breaking the law.
in 1842 a massachusetts court ruled that workers did have the right to strike.
workers would not receive other legal rights for many more years.

social discrimination also existed.
most communities in the north did not allow african americans to attend public schools.
many communities also kept them from using other public services.
african americans often had to attend poor quality schools and go to hospitals that were reserved only for them.
discrimination had economic effects as well.
in the business world only a few african americans found success.
in new york city samuel cornish and john b russwurm founded freedoms journal the first african american newspaper in 1827.
in 1845 macon b allen became the first african american licensed or given official authority to practice law in the united states.
most african americans however lived in poverty in the mid 1800s.
women workers women also faced discrimination in the workplace.
employers often paid women half as much as they paid male workers.
men kept women from joining unions and wanted them kept out of the workplace.
in the 1830s and 1840s some female workers tried to organize.
sarah g bagley a weaver from massachusetts founded the lowell female labor reform organization.
in 1845 her group petitioned for a 10 hour workday.
because most of the workers were women the legislature did not consider the petition.
however movements like this one paved the way for later movements to help working women.

in the early years of the united states the south had an economy based almost entirely on farming despite the fact that settlers had developed only a small part of the region.
most southerners lived in the upper south an area along the atlantic coast in maryland virginia and north carolina.
a few people had also settled in georgia and south carolina.
by 1850 the south had changed.
its population had spread inland to the deep south.

the economy of the south was thriving.
that economy depended however on slavery.
in fact slavery grew stronger than ever in the south while it all but disappeared in the north.
cotton is king southern planters grew mainly rice indigo and tobacco in colonial times.

whitneys gin quickly and easily removed seeds from cotton fibers.
with a cotton gin productivity proh duhk tih vuhtee the amount a worker can produce in a given time shot up.
the cotton gin helped workers process 50 times more cotton each day than they could by hand.
the use of the cotton gin had important consequences.
it encouraged farmers to grow more cotton in more places.
because southern planters relied on enslaved workers to plant and pick their cotton the demand for slave labor increased.
slavery spread across a larger area of the south.
by 1860 the deep south and upper south remained agricultural but each region concentrated on different crops.
the upper south grew more tobacco hemp wheat and vegetables.
the deep south produced more cotton as well as rice and sugarcane.
because more workers were needed to produce cotton and sugar the sale of enslaved africans became a big business.
enslaved people in the upper south were increasingly bought by slave traders who then sold them in the deep south.

industry developed more slowly in the south than in the north.
why was this so.
one reason was the boom in cotton.
agriculture especially cotton farming produced great profits.
building new industry is costly.
planters would have had to sell enslaved people or land to raise the money to build factories.
they chose instead to invest in profitable agriculture including enslaved africans.
in addition the market for manufactured goods in the south was smaller than that in the north.
enslaved people who made up a large share of the population had no money to buy goods.
this limited local market discouraged industries from developing.
for these reasons some white southerners simply did not want industry.
one texas politician louis wigfall summed up that southern point of view primary source w we want no manufactures we desire no trading no mechanical or manufacturing classes.
as long as we have our rice our sugar our tobacco and our cotton we can command wealth to purchase all we want.

some southern leaders thought the souths dependence was too great.
they wanted to develop more industry in the region.
these leaders also argued that factories would improve the economy of the upper south.
william gregg of south carolina shared this view.
he opened his own textile factory.
georgias augustin clayton also went into textiles opening a cotton mill.
in virginia joseph reid anderson made tredegar iron works one of the nations leading iron producers.
the alabama iron works also included a sawmill for producing lumber.
these industries however were not typical of the south.
southern transportation in general farmers and the few manufacturers of the south relied on natural waterways to transport their goods.
most towns were located on coasts or along rivers because canals were scarce and roads were poor.
southern rail lines were short local and not linked together.
the south had fewer railroads than the north.
this caused southern cities to grow more slowly than northern cities where railways were major routes of commerce and settlement.
the rail networks in the north also gave northern manufacturers an advantage over their southern competitors.
lower shipping costs allowed northerners to charge less for their goods.
by i860 only about one third of the nations rail lines lay within the south.

southern agriculture guidingquestion how were southern farms different from southern plantations.
slavery was at the heart of the southern economy but that did not mean that every white person owned large numbers of enslaved people.
white society in the south was complex and had many levels.
most white southerners fit into one of four categories yeomen tenant farmer rural poor or plantation owner.
small farmers and the rural poor most white people in the south were yeomen yohmuhn farmers who generally owned small farms of 50 to 200 acres 20 81 ha.
these yeomen lived mostly in the upper south and in the hilly areas of the deep south.
they did not practice plantation style agriculture.
they grew crops to use themselves and to trade with local merchants.
yeomen generally owned few or no enslaved african americans.
another group of southern whites worked as tenant farmers.
they rented land from property owners.
these classes of white southerners made up the majority of the white population of the south.

though they were looked down upon by many they were proud of their ability to provide for their families.
a few free african americans also held enslaved workers.
some free african americans bought members of their own families to free them although others worked their enslaved workers in the same manner as white southern planters.
plantation owners the larger plantations covered several thousand acres.
in addition to the land they owned plantation owners measured their wealth by the number of enslaved people they had.
in 1860 only about 4 percent of slaveholders held 20 or more enslaved workers.
earning profit was the main goal for owners of large plantations.
to make a profit they needed to bring in more money than they spent to run their plantations.
large plantations had fixed costs.
these are operating costs that remain much the same year after year.
for example the cost of housing and feeding workers is a fixed cost.
there is no easy way to reduce a fixed cost.
on the other hand the price of cotton changed from season to season.
a change in price often meant the difference between a successful year for a plantation and a bad one.

in the face of this threat enslaved people set up a network of relatives and friends.
if an owner sold a father or mother an aunt an uncle or a close friend stepped in to raise the children left behind.
these networks were a source of strength in the lives of enslaved people.
large close knit extended families became an important part of african american culture.
african american culture in 1808 congress banned the importation of enslaved persons.
slavery remained legal but traders could no longer purchase enslaved people from other countries.
some illegal slave trading continued but by 1860 almost all the enslaved people in the south had been born there.
though most enslaved people were born in the united states they tried to preserve african customs.

i have no accurate knowledge of my age never having seen any authentic record containing it.
by far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant.
i do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday.
they seldom come nearer to it than planting time harvest time cherry time spring time or fall time.
a want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood.
the white children could tell their ages.
i could not tell why i ought to be deprived of the same privilege.
i was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it.
the nearest estimate i can give makes me now between twenty seven and twenty eight years of age.
i come to this from hearing my master say some time during 1835 1 was about seventeen years old my mother and i were separated when i was but an infant before i knew her as my mother.
it is a common custom in the part of maryland from which i ran away to part children from their mothers at a very early age.
frequently before the child has reached its twelfth month its mother is taken from it and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off and the child is placed under the care of an old woman too old for field labor.
for what this separation is done i do not know unless it be to hinder the development of the child s affection toward its mother and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child.
this is the inevitable result.

primary source yes jefferson davis our present position illustrates the american idea that government rests upon the consent of the governed and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish a government whenever it becomes destructive of the ends for which it was established.
the declared purpose of the compact of union from which we have withdrawn was to establish justice insure domestic tranquility to provide for the common defence to promote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity and when in the judgment of the sovereign states now comprising this confederacy it no longer meets the purposes for which it was ordained and ceased to answer the ends for which it was established a peaceful appeal to the ballot box declared that so far as they are concerned the government created by that compact should cease to exist.
in this they merely asserted a right which the declaration of independence of july 4 1776 defined to be inalienable.

in 1865 former confederate states began creating new governments based on president johnsons plan.
these states elected leaders to again represent them in the congress.
when the new senators and representatives arrived in washington d c congress would not seat them.
the radical republicans were not willing to readmit the southern states on johnsons easy terms.
radicals were determined to make the former confederacys return to the union difficult for the white south.
reading helpdesk black codes and civil rights events in the south strengthened the radicals determination.
by early 1866 legislatures in the southern states had passed laws called black codes.
these laws were designed to limit the freedoms of the newly freed african americans.
some black codes made it illegal for african americans to own or rent farms.
the laws also made it easy for white employers to take advantage of african american workers.
some black codes allowed officials to fine or even arrest african americans who did not have jobs.

548 the reconstruction era fourteenth lk amendment 3 fifteenth lx amendment i z content vocabulary black codes override impeach men and women and their supporters life under the black codes was little better than slavery.
at the same time congress tried to protect the rights of the souths african americans.
in 1866 it passed a bill that gave the freedmens bureau new powers.
the bureau could now set up special courts to try persons charged with violating african americans rights.
african americans could sit on the juries in these courts and judge accused white southerners.
to combat the black codes radical republicans pushed the civil rights act of 1866 through congress.
this law gave the federal government power to get involved in state affairs to protect african americans rights.
it also granted citizenship to african americans.
this act was meant to counter the supreme court decision in the 1857 case dred scotty.
the supreme court had ruled that african americans were not citizens.
president johnson vetoed both bills.
he claimed that the federal government was exceeding its authority.
johnson also argued that both bills were unconstitutional.
he reasoned that they had been passed by a congress that did not include representatives from all the states.
by raising this issue he was warning that he would veto any law passed by a congress in which the south was not represented.
republicans in congress were able to override or defeat both vetoes and the bills became law.
radical republicans began to see that congress and johnson would not be able to work together on reconstruction.
they gave up hope of compromising with the president and began to create their own plan for dealing with the south.
the fourteenth amendment congress did worry that the courts might overturn the civil rights act.
it proposed another amendment to the constitution which the states ratified in 1868.
the thirteenth amendment had ended slavery.
the fourteenth amendment took the next step by stating that mumaky source all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside.
j the fourteenth amendment black codes laws passed in the south just after the civil war aimed at ontrolling freed men and women and allowing plantation owners to ta e idvantage of african american workers override to reject or defeat something that has already been decided radical republicans such as charles sumner of massachusetts were determined not only to rebuild the south but also to remake southern society.
lesson 2 549 connections to today the fourteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment aimed to preserve the rights of formerly enslaved people.
today it protects the rights of all americans from abuse by state governments.
before the fourteenth amendment the bill of rights applied only to actions of the federal government.
for example the first amendment prevented the federal government but not state governments from denying freedom of religion.
over time the supreme court has used the fourteenth amendment to apply the bill of rights to actions of state governments too.
this language protected the citizenship extended to african americans by the civil rights act of 1866.
it guaranteed that citizenship could not later be taken away by passing another law.
the amendment made it clear that if a state barred any adult male citizen from voting that state could lose some representation in congress.
another part of the fourteenth amendment said that no state could take a persons life liberty or property without due process of law it stated that every person was entitled to equal protection of the laws it also excluded former confederate leaders from holding any national or state office unless congress had pardoned them.
some people considered amending the constitution to protect african americans to be an extreme measure.
increasing violence toward african americans across the south convinced moderate republicans that an amendment was necessary.
congress required that the southern states ratify the fourteenth amendment as another condition of rejoining the union.
because most refused to do so at first the amendments ratification was delayed until 1868.

radical republicans in charge guidingquestion what elements were included in the radical republicans idea of reconstruction.
president johnson campaigned against the radical republicans in the congressional elections of 1866.
he attacked the fourteenth amendment and made it a major issue in the campaign.
many northerners disliked johnsons tone.
some feared the clashes between whites and african americans that were taking place in the south.
voters rejected johnsons views and the republicans won an overwhelming majority in congress.
this meant that johnson could no longer prevent them from overriding his vetoes.
a period known as radical reconstruction began.
the reconstruction acts by 1867 10 of the former confederate states had not ratified the fourteenth amendment.
in response congress passed the first reconstruction act.
this law required that those states form new governments.
only tennessee which had ratified the amendment kept its government and rejoined the union.
the act divided the 10 defiant states into 5 military districts.
each district would be governed by an army general until new state governments were formed.
former confederate leaders were banned from serving in these new governments.
each state also had to submit a new state constitution to congress for approval.
finally the act guaranteed african american men the right to vote in state elections.
the second reconstruction act empowered the army to register voters in each district and to help organize state constitutional conventions.

because johnson strongly opposed the reconstruction acts congress passed a series of laws to limit his power.
one of these laws was the tenure of office act.
this law stated that the president could not remove government officials including members of his own cabinet without the senates approval.
congress wanted to protect secretary of war edwin stanton.
stanton was the cabinet official in charge of the military and a supporter of radical reconstruction.
tensions between johnson and the radical republicans continued to grow.
in august 1867 while congress was not in session johnson suspended stanton temporarily stopped him from working.
when the senate met again it refused to approve the suspension.

his reputation as a war hero carried him into the white house in the election of 1868 and to reelection in 1872.
unfortunately grant had little experience in politics.
scandal and corruption plagued grants presidency.
in addition a severe economic depression began during his second term.
a crisis arose when the powerful banking firm of jay cooke and company declared bankruptcy.
this triggered a wave of fear known as the panic of 1873.
it set off a depression that lasted much of the decade.
the depression and the scandals in the grant administration hurt the republican party.
in the 1874 congressional elections the democrats won back control of the house of representatives.

critical thinking analyzing what does the voting pattern suggest about support for reconstruction in the north.
the election of 1876 republicans attempted to keep control of the white house by choosing ohio governor rutherford b hayes as their candidate for president in 1876.
hayes held moderate views on reconstruction.
republicans hoped he would appeal to voters in both the north and the south.
hayes ran against democrat samuel tilden the governor of new york in a very close election.
neither got a majority of the electoral votes mainly because of confusing election returns from three southern states.
these states florida south carolina and louisiana were still under republican rule.
republicans insisted that many voters in these states favored hayes but their votes had not been counted.
congress named a commission to decide which candidate should receive the disputed electoral votes.
the commission recommended giving them all to hayes.
doing this would make hayes president by one electoral vote.
connections to today the election of 2000 a voting dispute in florida also affected the 2000 presidential election.
an extremely close vote count led to a bitter dispute between republican george w bush and democrat a1 gore over whether and how to recount the ballots.

one of these was a pledge to withdraw the troops who had been stationed in the south since the end of the civil war.

rise of the new south by the 1880s forward looking southerners were convinced that their region must develop an industrial economy.
they argued that the south had lost the civil war because its industry did not match the norths.
atlanta newspaper editor henry grady headed a group that urged southerners to out yankee the yankees and build a new south this new south would have industries based on the regions coal iron tobacco cotton and lumber resources.
southerners would create this new economy by embracing a spirit of hard work and regional pride.
southern industry made great gains in the 1880s.
textile mills sprang up across the region.
the american tobacco company developed largely by james duke of north carolina came to control nearly all the tobacco manufacturing in the country.

560 the reconstruction era and steel.
much of the industry was in alabama near deposits of iron ore.
in florida port cities jacksonville and pensacola prospered because of strong demand for lumber and other products.
the south possessed a cheap and reliable supply of labor.
a railroad building boom also helped development.
by 1870 the railroad system destroyed by the war was nearly rebuilt.
between 1880 and 1890 track mileage more than doubled.
the new south s rural economy in spite of these gains the south did not develop an industrial economy as strong as the norths.
agriculture remained the souths main economic activity.
supporters of the new south hoped to promote small profitable farms that grew a variety of crops instead of relying on cotton.
a different economy emerged however.
many landowners held on to their large estates.
when estates were divided much of the land went to sharecropping and tenant farming.
neither of these activities was profitable.
debt also caused problems.
poor farmers used credit to buy supplies.
merchants who provided credit also charged high prices and farmers debts rose.
to repay debts farmers turned to cash crops.
as in the past the main cash crop was cotton.
higher cotton production.
drove cotton prices down.
lower prices led farmers to plant even more cotton.
the growth of sharecropping and the heavy reliance on a single cash crop helped prevent improvements in the conditions of southern farmers.

laws passed by the redeemer governments denied southern african americans many of their newly won rig ts.
voting restrictions the fifteenth amendment barred a state from denying someone.
the right to vote because of race.
white southern leaders found 1 ways to get around the amendment.
one way was by requiring a poll tax a fee required for voting.
many african americans e could not afford to pay the tax so they could not vote.
lesson 4 561 cm j wlife lmmkanuirw y ou m fflfe s mnt m onit w w another means of denying voting rights was the literacy test lih tuh ruh see tehst.
this approach required potential voters to read and explain difficult parts of state constitutions or the federal constitution.
because most southern african americans had little education literacy tests prevented many from voting.
both poll taxes and literacy tests also kept some whites from voting.
to prevent this some states passed grandfather clauses grand fahthuhr klahz ihz.
these laws allowed people to vote if their fathers or grandfathers had voted before reconstruction.
because african americans could not vote at that time they were excluded.
such laws and the constant threat of violence caused african american voting to decline sharply.
after reconstruction southern leaders used a variety of means to prevent african americans from exercising their right to vote.
jim crow laws by the late 1800s segregation had also become common across the south.
segregation sehgrih gay shuhn is the separation of the races.
southern states passed so called jim crow laws that required african americans and whites to be separated in almost every public place.
in 1896 the supreme court upheld segregation laws in plessy v ferguson.
the case involved a louisiana law that required separate sections on trains for african americans and whites.
the court ruled that segregation was legal as long as african americans had access to public places equal to those of whites.
in practice the separate facilities for african americans were far from equal.
southern states spent much more money on schools and other facilities for whites than on those for african americans.
still this separate but equal doctrine gave legal support to segregation for more than 50 years.
violence against african americans also rose.
one form of violence was lynching lihn cheeng in which angry mobs killed people by hanging them.
some african americans were lynched because they were suspected of crimes.
others were lynched because they did not act as whites thought they should.

they called themselves exodusters this name came from the biblical book of exodus which describes the israelites escape from slavery in egypt.
during the exodus of the 1870s more than 20 000 african americans migrated to kansas.
they hoped their journey would take them far from the poverty that they experienced in the south.
other african americans escaped the south by becoming soldiers.
they served in segregated army units and fought in the western indian wars from 1867 until 1896.
according to legend the men were called buffalo soldiers by the apache and cheyenne.
the soldiers adopted the name as a sign of honor and respect.
units of buffalo soldiers answered the nations call to arms not only in the west but also in cuba the philippines hawaii and mexico.
reconstruction s impact reconstruction was a success in some ways and a failure in others.

8 the american revolution guidingquestion why did the colonists fight a war for independence against great britain.
the american colonies experienced rapid population growth.
in time colonists revolted against what they saw as oppressive british rule.
they established a new independent government for themselves.
new ideas influence the colonists during the 1600s and 1700s philosophers of the age of enlightenment stressed the use of reason and logic to understand natural laws.
enlightenment writer john locke attempted to use reason to discover natural laws that applied to politics and society.
he argued that governments existed because the people who were governed allowed them to exist for no government can have a right to obedience from a people who have not freely consented to it which they can never be supposed to do till they are put in a full state of liberty to choose their government lockes ideas influenced thomas jefferson and other colonists.
also in the 1700s some americans renewed their christian faith in what became known as the great awakening.
the new ideas of baptists presbyterians and methodists won many converts.
along with the enlightenment this movement emphasized an individualism that inclined american colonists toward political independence.
the growing rift with britain in the 1750s great britain and france began fighting for control of north america.
both countries relied on native americans as allies and the war became known as the french and indian war.
the british victory in the war left britain with steep debts and new territories to govern and defend.
many british leaders thought that the colonies should share in these costs.
the american colonists however did not like the policies britain adopted to solve its financial problems.
the proclamation of 1763 tried to halt colonial expansion into native american lands west of the appalachians.
king george iii wanted to avoid another costly war with the native americans but the colonists who wanted access to the ohio river valley were enraged.
no taxation without representation colonists had been smuggling goods without paying customs duties so britain tightened customs and introduced unpopular taxes such as the sugar act and the stamp act the first direct tax britain had levied on the colonists.
in october 1765 representatives from nine colonies issued the declaration of rights and grievances arguing that only representatives elected by the colonists not parliament had the right to tax them.
no taxation without representation became a popular catchphrase.
colonists boycotted british goods and britain repealed the stamp act in 1766.
in 1767 the townshend acts put new customs duties on key british imports and enforced rules against smuggling.
colonial anger turned to violence in 1770 resulting in the boston massacre on march 5.
eventually britain repealed the townshend acts.
the resumption of smuggling soon led to strife.
colonists created committees of correspondence to communicate with one another about british activities.
in 1773 colonists dumped hundreds of cases of tea off british ships in a protest called the boston tea party.
outraged parliament passed the coercive acts to punish the colonists for their defiance and the quebec act which extended the boundaries of what was then the province of quebec to include much of what is now ohio michigan indiana wisconsin and illinois.
together these laws came to be known as the intolerable acts.

fifty five colonial delegates met at the first continental congress in philadelphia on september 5 1774.
soon after gathering they learned that britain had suspended the massachusetts assembly.
the congress responded by approving a plan to boycott british goods.
in the meantime the suspended massachusetts assembly gathered secretly to create a new massachusetts provincial congress and a committee of public safety.
they selected john hancock to be president of the committee and gave him the power to call up the militia in effect making hancock a rival governor to general gage whom the british had put in control of massachusetts.
in april 1775 gage decided to seize control of the militias weapons and supplies that were stored in concord.
as the british troops marched past the town of lexington on their way to concord fighting broke out between the minutemen militia and the british troops.
the first shots of the revolutionary war had been fired.
three weeks later as fighting continued in massachusetts the second continental congress gathered in philadelphia.
the appointed george washington to command a new continental army made up of the colonial militias.
battles took place in boston near norfolk virginia in north carolina and outside charleston south carolina.
by july 1776 the congress had decided the time had come to declare independence and appointed a committee to draft a declaration.
the first draft of the declaration of independence was written by thomas jefferson then edited and revised by others on the committee including john adams benjamin franklin roger sherman and robert livingston.
on july 4 1776 the continental congress issued the declaration of independence.
john hancock was the first person to sign followed by 55 other representatives from the colonies.
among the signers were thomas jefferson 10 roger sherman john adams and benjamin franklin.
others included benjamin rush who had helped organize the sons of liberty in pennsylvania and assisted tom paine in writing common sense john witherspoon from new jersey who went on to help draft the articles of confederation and charles carroll the sole catholic signer of the declaration and one of the leaders of opposition to britain in maryland.
with the signing of the declaration the thirteen colonies had now become the united states of america and the american revolution had begun.
the war for independence the continental army could not match the british army in size funding or experience.
it was fighting on home ground however and used unconventional tactics.
the british enjoyed early victories but the american win at saratoga in 1777 was a turning point in the war.

boston was a center of protest against british policies.
when on the night of march 5 1770 british soldiers fired into a crowd killing or injuring 11 people colonists were quick to declare the event a massacre even though exactly what occurred is debatable.
political essay 1767 from what has been said i think this uncontrovertible conclusion may be deduced that when a ruling state obliges a dependent state to take certain commodities from her alone it is implied in the nature of that obligation is essentially requisite to give it the least degree of justice and is inseparably united with it in order to preserve any share of freedom to the dependent state that those commodities should never be loaded with duties for the sole purpose of levying money on the dependent state.
upon the whole the single question is whether the parliament can legally impose duties to be paid by the people of these colonies only for the sole purpose of raising a revenue on commodities which she obliges us to take from her alone or in other words whether the parliament can legally take money out of our pockets without our consent.

s r f i j i teks 1a 1c 29a 29b l izhen the declaring independence declaration of independence was written in 1776 with very few exceptions the people of the world were governed by monarchs emperors and absolute rulers.
there had been very little development in political ideas since roman times that discussed the relationship between the individual and the government.
a reexamination of government began in the renaissance and by the time ofthe enlightenment in the 18th century many new ideas had emerged.
those ideas culminated in the american declaration of independence.
the declaration of independence 1776 the text of the declaration of independence has four parts.
the first part is the preamble which explains why it is being issued.
the second part explains the idea of natural rights and uses that idea to explain the legal justification for declaring independence.
the third part the list of grievances charges the british with violating the rights ofthe colonies and gives examples.
the fourth part is the resolution where the colonies officially declare their independence.
the declaration was written by thomas jefferson with the help of benjamin franklin and john adams.
it was then revised by congress before being issued.
the document draws on the new political theories ofthe enlightenment.
it summarizes these ideas when it states that people are endowed with unalienable rights.
this was a revolutionary idea.
it means that rights do not come from the government.
people have rights no matter what their government says no matter what laws it passes and the government cannot take them away.
second the declaration argues that the only reason people create government is to protect their rights.
the only legitimate or just powers a government has are the powers it gets from vocabulary endowed provided or born with unalienable cannot be taken away or given away divests gives up or takes off arbitrary based on a persons opinion or preference not following the rules levying imposing taxes or duties the consent ofthe governed in other words government exists to serve the people and when it fails to protect peoples rights the people have a right to overthrow it.
the declaration of independence is very important.
it marks the birth ofthe united states the first modern democratic republic.
its ideas and values have influenced people in other nations and have helped to transform governments and societies around the world.
the second treatise of government 1689 the political ideas behind the declaration came from many sources including enlightenment writers and classical thinkers such as aristotle and cicero.
but the greatest influence on american thinking was probably the 17th century english philosopher john locke who wrote two treatises of government shortly after the english parliament removed king james ii from power and asked william and mary to become the new monarchs of england men being as has been said by nature all free equal and independent no one can be put out of this estate and subjected to the political power of another without his own consent.
the only way whereby any one divests himself of his natural liberty and puts on the bounds of civil society is by agreeing with other men to joyn and unite into a community for their comfortable safe and 14 peaceable living one amongst another in a secure enjoyment of their properties.
governments are dissolved from within when such a single person or prince sets up his own arbitrary will in place ofthe laws which are the will ofthe society declared by the legislative secondly when the prince hinders the legislative from acting freely pursuant to those ends for which it was constituted thirdly when by the arbitrary power ofthe prince the electors or ways of election are altered without the consent and contrary to the common interest ofthe people.
in these and the like cases when the government is dissolved the people are at liberty to provide for themselves by erecting a new legislative differing from the other by the change of persons or form or both as they shall find it most for their safety and good.
the english bill of rights 1789 the declaration of independence contains 18 charges against the king.
this list of grievances were patterned after several documents but the most influential was the english bill of rights issued by the english parliament in 1689 by assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws and the execution of laws without consent of parliament by levying money for and to the use ofthe crown by pretence of prerogative for other time and in other manner than the same was granted by parliament.

the preamble explains why the continental congress drew up the declaration.
impel force natural rights the second part the declaration of natural rights states that people have certain basic rights and that government should protect those rights.
john locke s ideas strongly influenced this part.
in 1690 locke wrote that government was based on the consent of the people and that people had the right to rebel if the government did not uphold their right to life liberty and property.
endowed provided of america preamble when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
declaration of natural rights we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while 16 evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.

the leaders who created the united states of america knew that they were creating something new.
they made a deliberate choice to replace royal rule with a republic.
in a republic power is held by citizens who are entitled to vote.
elected officials are responsible to the citizens and must govern according to laws or a constitution.
political ideas of the new nation in an ideal republic all citizens are equal under the law regardless of their wealth or social class.
these ideas contradicted traditional practices that restricted the rights of many people on the basis of their race class or gender.
despite these contradictions republican ideas began to change american society.
by the end of the revolution each state had drawn up its own written constitution.
many based on the models of massachusetts and virginia called for separate branches of government two house legislatures and a list of rights guaranteed to citizens.
the articles of confederation initially adopted in 1777 during the revolution the articles of confederation were ratified in 1781 formally establishing the framework for a central national government.
the articles loosely unified the states under a single governing body the congress.
there were no separate branches of government and congress had only limited powers.
after fighting to free themselves from british rule the states did not want a new government that might become tyrannical.
si creating a notion framework basic structure under the articles each state had one vote in congress.
congresss power however was limited.
it could negotiate with other nations raise armies and declare war but had no authority to regulate trade or impose taxes.
congress could not raise enough money to pay its debts or expenses.

constitution.
the young united states faced several political and economic problems after the end of the american revolution.
many american leaders believed that the new nation would not survive without a strong national government and that the articles of confederation had to be revised.
in may 1787 55 of the most distinguished leaders in the united states met in philadelphia to discuss weaknesses in the articles of confederation.
they soon decided that a new form of government was needed.
all the delegates supported a national government with the power to levy taxes and make laws that would be binding upon the states.
the delegates also accepted the idea of dividing the government into executive legislative and judicial branches.
debate and compromise debate arose about how each state should be represented in the legislative branch.
the larger states insisted that representation be based on population smaller states wanted each state to have an equal vote.
the convention appointed a special committee to find a compromise.
benjamin franklin warned the delegates that if they failed to agree they would become a reproach and a by word down to future ages.
and what is worse mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance war and conquest roger sherman of connecticut suggested the basis of the committee s solution.
the legislature would be divided into two houses.
in the house of representatives the number of a states representatives would depend on its population.
in the senate each state would have equal representation.
voters in each state would elect the members of the house of representatives but the state legislatures would choose the senators.
this proposal came to be known as the connecticut compromise or the great compromise.
photo library of congress prints photographs division lc uszc4 4097 the connecticut compromise sparked a fresh controversy whether to count enslaved people when determining how many representatives each state would have in the house of representatives.
southern delegates wanted to count enslaved people.
northern delegates objected pointing out that enslaved people could not vote.
the matter was settled by the three fifths compromise.
every five enslaved persons would count as three free persons for determining both representation and taxation.
in another compromise the delegates dealt with the power of congress to regulate trade agreeing that the new congress could not tax exports.
they also agreed that it could not ban the slave trade until 1808.
framework of government next the delegates focused on the details of the new government.
the government was based on the principle of popular sovereignty or rule by the people.
it created a representative system of government in which elected officials speak for the people.
to strengthen the central government but still preserve the rights of the states the constitution describes a system known as federalism.
under federalism power is divided between the national and state governments.
the constitution also provides for a separation of powers by dividing power between three branches of government the legislative branch which makes laws the executive branch which implements and enforces the laws among other duties and the judicial branch which interprets federal laws and renders judgment in cases involving those laws.
a system of checks and balances prevents any one of the three branches from becoming too powerful.
each branch has some ability to limit the power of the other two.
the success of the constitutional convention in creating a government that reflected the countrys many viewpoints was in washingtons words little short of a miracle the convention john adams declared was the greatest single effort of national deliberation that the world has ever seen ratification and the bill of rights on september 28 1787 congress voted to submit the constitution to the states.
each state would hold a convention to ratify or approve it.
nine states had to vote to approve the constitution for it to go into effect.
as soon as americans learned about the new constitution they began to argue over whether it should be ratified.
the debate took place in state legislatures in mass meetings in the columns of newspapers and in everyday conversations.
supporters of the constitution called themselves federalists.
they emphasized that the constitution would create a federal system with power divided between a central government and state governments.
they hoped the name would remind americans who feared a central government that the states would retain many of their powers.
opponents to the constitution were called anti federalists a somewhat misleading name as they were not truly against federalism.
they accepted the need for a national government.
the real issue as far as they were concerned was whether the national government or the state governments would be supreme.
the federalists arguments for ratification were summarized in the federalist a collection of 85 essays written by james madison alexander hamilton and john jay.
the three men published most of the essays in new york newspapers in late 1787 and early 1788.
to this day the federalist remains a valuable resource for understanding how the constitution was supposed to work and what the framers wanted to achieve.
james madison 1751 1836 although many individuals contributed to the framing ofthe u s constitution james madison proposed the virginia plan which defined a separation of powers between the legislative executive and judicial branches.
he was a leader in the first united states congress and was responsible for the first 10 amendments ofthe i constitution known as the bill of rights.
in 1808 he was elected the fourth president ofthe united states.

separation of powers government principle in which power is divided among different branches creating a nation 23 the federalists knew however that the most important votes still lay ahead.
the large states of massachusetts virginia and new york might vote either way.
in massachusetts opponents of the constitution included massachusetts governor john hancock and samuel adams.
adams refused to support the new constitution unless federalists gave him a guarantee that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states.
from keeping their own arms or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons papers or possessions the federalists moved quickly to meet these objections.
they promised to attach a bill of rights to the constitution once it was ratified.
they also agreed to support an amendment that would reserve for the states all powers not given to the federal government.
in the end the promise to add a bill of rights won the vote for ratification in both massachusetts and virginia.
in new york alexander hamilton and john jay worked hard to build support.
when it became clear the constitution would go into effect new york voted by a narrow margin to ratify it as well.
elections for congress and the new office of president were held in 1788 and in march 1789 the new united states senate and house of representatives met for the very first time.
george washington was elected the first president under the new constitution.
with the new government in effect one of the very first tasks of the new congress was to pass the bill of rights as promised.
james madison one of the leaders in congress made the bill of rights a top priority.
he hoped it would demonstrate the good faith of federal leaders and build support for the new government.
in drafting the bill of rights madison relied heavily on the virginia declaration of rights issued in 1776 and the virginia statute for religious freedom that thomas jefferson had written in 1786.
in late september 1789 congress agreed on 12 constitutional amendments.
they were then sent to the states for ratification but only 10 were approved.
these 10 went into effect and are generally referred to as the bill of rights.
the first eight protect the rights of individuals against actions of the federal government.
the last two set limits on the powers of the new national government.
the ninth amendment states that the people have other rights not listed.
the tenth amendment states that any powers not specifically given to the federal government are reserved for the states.

the rise of political parties guiding question why did political parties emerge in the new republic and what were the consequences.
george washington served as the first president under the new constitution.
congress created three executive departments and organized the judicial branch.
washington appointed the heads of the executive departments including thomas jefferson as secretary of state and alexander hamilton as secretary of the treasury.
jefferson and hamilton one of the new governments most pressing concerns involved the national debt.
hamilton proposed a plan to pay off the debt and to create a national bank to manage the countrys finances.
jefferson james madison and others 4 opposed the plan arguing that congress could not establish a bank because it was not among the federal government s enumerated powers specifically listed in the constitution.
hamilton disagreed stating that the bank was among the implied powers not explicitly listed in the constitution but necessary for the government to do its job.
hamilton eventually won approval for his program and the bank of the united states was established in 1791.
that same year congress enacted a tax on whiskey to bring in much needed revenue.
the tax infuriated many.
some western pennsylvania farmers resisted tax collectors and destroyed the whiskey stills of those who paid the tax.
in august 1794 washington sent nearly 13 000 troops to put down what was called the whiskey rebellion.
the debate over hamiltons financial program divided congress into rival political parties.
the federalists supported hamiltons plans and a strong national government.
the democratic republicans led by jefferson and madison favored a limited federal government and more power for the states.
the election of 1800 washingtons successor was fellow federalist john adams.
a series of unpopular taxes and laws passed during his first term gave adams a disadvantage in seeking reelection in 1800.
the democratic republican nominees were jefferson for president and aaron burr for vice president.
under the constitution each state chooses electors the same number as it has representatives and senators.
this group the electoral college then votes for the president.
in 1800 each elector was to vote for two people of their choice for president even if one were nominated for vice president.
when the votes were counted the federalist candidates had lost and jefferson and burr were tied at 73 votes each.
since neither had a majority the house of representatives had to choose a geography connection president and chose jefferson.

in the 1803 case marbury v madison the supreme court decided that part of the judiciary act was unconstitutional and thus invalid.
the constitution specifies which cases can go directly to the supreme court and court orders are not mentioned.
in the courts opinion marshall wrote so if a law be in opposition to the constitution if both the law and the constitution the nineteenth century begins guiding question howdid the united states assert itself as an independent nation.
president jefferson attempted to limit federal powers and helped expand the size of the country.
later the united states faced war with britain.
jefferson in office thomas jefferson took office committed to limiting government.
he began paying off federal debt cut government spending eliminated the hated whiskey tax and planned to rely on local militia instead of a standing army.
weakening the federalists control ofthe judiciary was another aim of the new administration.
on his last day in office president adams had appointed dozens of new federalist judges and court officers.
jefferson asked the incoming democratic republican congress to abolish some of the new positions and to withhold the paperwork confirming other appointments.
one of those who did not receive his documents william marbury took the matter to the supreme court.
the court sympathized with marbury but ruled in 1803 that it could not issue an enforcement order.
according to chief justice john marshall and his colleagues the law that authorized the court to write such orders actually was unconstitutional and invalid.
the decision established the courts power of judicial review the power to declare laws unconstitutional and invalid.
apply to a particular case the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case.
this is of the very essence of judicial duty thinking drawing conclusions what principle did the ruling in marbury v madison establish.
with the help of their native american guide and interpreter sacagawea meriwether lewis and william clark explored the territory acquired by the louisiana purchase.
critical thinking predicting consequences why was the louisiana purchase a significant event for the young united states.
westward expansion under jefferson the size of the country increased considerably.
the treaty of paris of 1783 had already established the mississippi river as the nations western border.
after the defeat of native americans in the northwest territory and the treaty of greenville in 1795 more settlers poured into the region.
during washingtons term kentucky and tennessee had become states and ohio followed in 1803.
in 1800 spain had given louisiana back to france.
to finance his plans for european conquest the french leader napoleon bonaparte now offered to sell all of the louisiana territory as well as new orleans to the united states.
congress overwhelmingly approved the louisiana purchase on april 30 1803.
the united states paid 11 25 million and also agreed to take on french debts of about 3 75 million owed to u s citizens.
with the purchase the nation had more than doubled its size.
even before louisiana became part of the united states jefferson had asked congress to fund a secret expedition into the louisiana territory.
after receiving approval from congress jefferson chose meriwether lewis and william clark to lead the expedition.
during their explorations they found a path through the rocky mountains and eventually reached the pacific ocean.
the war of 1812 in 1809 james madison succeeded jefferson as president and a foreign relations crisis loomed.
the british regularly seized american ships at sea and often practiced impressment a legalized form of kidnapping that forced people into military service.
britain claimed the right to stop american ships and search for british deserters.
on several 26 occasions they impressed american citizens into service as well.
americans in the west also blamed britain for encouraging attacks by native americans along the frontier.
president jefferson had tried economic sanctions against britain with the embargo act of 1807 but the actions mostly hurt the american economy.
like jefferson president madison first responded with economic measures.
after several attempts the measures finally began to have the desired effect.
unfortunately word of british cooperation came too late congress had already declared war against britain.
at the beginning of the war of 1812 conquering canada was the primary objective of the united states.
u s forces were victorious on lake erie and lake champlain.
the british however easily entered washington d c.
they dispersed the poorly trained militia defending the capital and set fire to the white house and the capitol.
in baltimore however the city militia inflicted heavy casualties on the british.
british forces bombarded fort mchenry throughout the night of september 13 1814 and then abandoned their attack.
the sight of the u s flag still flying over the fort at dawn inspired francis scott key to write the star spangled banner which became the national anthem.
as battles raged peace talks began in the belgian city of ghent.
the treaty of ghent signed on december 24 1814 ended the war and restored prewar boundaries but did not mention impressment.
at about the same time british and u s forces faced each other in new orleans.
unaware that a treaty had been signed u s general andrew jackson led his troops to a decisive victory over the british in the battle of new orleans in january 1815.
jackson became a national hero.
the war of 1812 increased the prestige of the united states overseas and generated a new spirit of patriotism and national unity.

the new federal government had greater powers but it also had specific limitations.
a system of interlocking responsibilities kept any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.
voters are sovereign that is they have ultimate authority in a republican system.
they elect representatives and give them the responsibility to make laws and run the government.
for most americans today the terms republic and representative democracy mean the same thing a system of limited government in which the people are the final source of authority.
28 photo comstock punchstock limited government although the framers agreed that the nation needed a stronger central authority they feared misuse of power.
they wanted to prevent the government from using its power to give one group special advantages or to deprive another group of its rights.
by creating a limited government they restricted the governments authority to specific powers granted by the people.
the delegates to the constitutional convention were very specific about the powers granted to the new government.
their decision to provide a written outline of the governments structure also served to show what they intended.
articles i ii and iii of the constitution describe the powers of the federal government and the limits on those powers.
other limits are set forth in the bill of rights which guarantees certain rights to the people.
federalism in establishing a strong central government the framers did not deprive states of all authority.
the states gave up some powers to the national government but retained others.
this principle of shared power is called federalism.
the federal system allows the people of each state to deal with their needs in their own way but at the same time it lets the states act together to deal with matters that affect all americans.
the constitution defines three types of government powers.
certain powers belong only to the federal government.
these enumerated powers include the power to coin money regulate interstate and foreign trade maintain the armed forces and create federal courts article i section 8.
the second kind of powers are those retained by the states known as reserved powers including the power to establish schools set marriage and divorce laws and regulate trade within the state.
although reserved powers are not specifically listed in the constitution the tenth amendment says that all powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states the third set of powers defined by the constitution is concurrent powers powers the state and federal governments share.

critical thinking 1 analyzing information how can the president help control the judiciary.
2 drawing conclusions why is it important that the legislative branch can override a presidential veto.
separation of powers to prevent any single group or institution in government from gaining too much authority the framers divided the federal government into three branches legislative executive and judicial.
each branch has its own functions and powers.
the legislative branch congress makes the laws.
the executive branch headed by the president carries out the laws.
the judicial branch consisting of the supreme court and other federal courts interprets and applies the laws.
in addition to giving separate responsibility to separate branches the membership of each branch is chosen in different ways.
the president nominates federal judges and the senate confirms the appointments.
people vote for members of congress.
voters cast ballots for president but the method of election is indirect.
on election day the votes in each state are counted.
the candidate who receives the majority receives that states electoral votes which total the number of senators and representatives the state has in congress.
electors from all states meet to formally elect a president.
a candidate must win a majority of votes in the electoral college to win.
checks and balances the framers who wrote the constitution deliberately created a system of checks and balances in which each branch of government can check or limit the power of the other branches.
this system helps balance the power of the three branches and prevents any one branch from becoming too powerful.
for example imagine that congress passes a law.
the president can reject the law by vetoing it.
congress however can override or reverse the presidents veto if two thirds of the members of both the senate and the house of representatives vote again to approve the law.

congress approved these 10 amendments and referred to them as the bill of rights.

the legislative branch includes the two houses of congress the senate and the house of representatives.
congress has two primary roles to make the nations laws and to decide how to spend federal funds.
the government cannot spend any money unless congress appropriates or sets aside funds.
all tax and spending bills must originate in the house of representatives and be approved in both the house and the senate before moving to the president to be signed.
congress also monitors the executive branch and investigates possible abuses of power.
the house of representatives can impeach or bring formal charges against any federal official it suspects of wrongdoing or misconduct.
if an official is impeached the senate acts as a court and tries the accused official.
officials who are found guilty may be removed from office.
the senate has certain additional powers.
two thirds of the senate must ratify treaties made by the president.
the senate must also confirm presidential appointments of federal officials such as department heads ambassadors and federal judges.
all members of congress have the responsibility to represent their constituents the people of their home states and districts.
as a constituent you can expect your senators and representative to promote national and state interests.
congress members introduce thousands of bills proposed laws every year.
because individual members of congress cannot possibly study all these bills carefully both houses form committees of selected members to evaluate proposed legislation.
standing committees are permanent committees in both the house and the senate that specialize in a particular topic such as agriculture commerce or veterans affairs.
these committees are usually divided into subcommittees that focus on a particular aspect of an issue.
the house and the senate also form temporary select committees to deal with issues requiring special attention.
these committees meet only until they complete their task.

throughout american history various presidents have been both praised and criticized for their leadership.
being an effective leader in a federal constitutional republic requires a number of important qualities.
as chief of state and chief diplomat the president represents the nation to the american people and to the world.
to be effective a president must demonstrate principles and conviction yet be optimistic and friendly open to others and able to communicate clearly and effectively.
great leaders can inspire their people to greatness with their words their confidence and their determination.
as a legislative leader the president must be able to compromise to understand different points of view and to work with many different personalities in congress while at the same time understanding clearly what principles and goals should be upheld.
a president that bows to political pressures too often will be seen as weak or vacillating but a president who the constitution handbook refuses to negotiate and compromise with congress will be seen as stubborn aloof or ineffective.
as commander in chief the president has to be decisive and willing to make difficult decisions.
at the same time presidents must be willing to listen to advice and the expertise of those serving under them.
the president is the final decision maker when the nation is at war and his or her decisions can impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people.
a president who refuses to act when necessary will be seen as timid and indecisive which can embolden the nations enemies.

as the head of an enormous and complex bureaucracy the president must resist the temptation to go into too much detail on every little issue.
there is not enough time to do so.
instead an effective chief executive must have the ability to choose good people that can be trusted to implement the president s goals within the executive departments.
the president must support the team he or she has chosen and be loyal to them.
an effective president will set high expectations clear goals and will lead by example.
at the same time presidents have to hold their people and themselves accountable for any failures and be willing to learn from mistakes.
as the chief executive responsible for carrying out the nations laws and upholding the constitution the president above all needs integrity.
presidents have to implement laws they disagree with they cannot allow personal feelings to interfere with their decisions or distort their judgment.
they cannot give in to corruption and use their office for personal gain.
nor should they make decisions purely on the basis of what will get them reelected.
the president as the leader of a democratic republic should listen 34 to the people.

district and appellate courts united states district courts are the lowest level of the federal court system.
these courts consider criminal and civil cases that come under federal authority such as kidnapping federal tax evasion claims against the federal government and cases involving constitutional rights such as free speech.
there are 94 district courts with at least one in every state.
the appellate courts or courts of appeal consider district court decisions in which the losing side has asked for a review of the verdict.
if an appeals court disagrees with the lower courts decision it can overturn the verdict or order a retrial.
there are 14 appeals courts one for each of 12 federal districts one military appeals court and an appellate court for the federal circuit.
the supreme court the supreme court is the final authority in the federal court system.
it consists of a chief justice and eight associate justices.
most of the courts cases come from appeals of lower court decisions.
only cases involving foreign diplomats or disputes between states can begin in the supreme court.
supreme court independence the president appoints the courts justices for life and the senate confirms the appointments.
the public has no input.
the framers hoped that by appointing judges they would be free to evaluate the law with no concern for pleasing voters.
judicial review the role of the judicial branch is not described in detail in the constitution but the role of the courts has grown as powers implied in the constitution have been put into practice.
in 1803 chief justice john marshall expanded the power of the supreme court by striking down an act of congress in the case of marbury v madison.

all citizens of the united states have certain basic rights but they also have specific responsibilities.
living in a system of self government means ultimately that every citizen is partly responsible for how society is governed and for the actions the government takes on his or her behalf.
the rights of americans the rights of americans fall into three broad categories to be protected from unfair actions of the government to receive equal treatment under the law and to retain certain basic freedoms.
protection from unfair actions parts of the constitution and the bill of rights protect all americans from unfair treatment by the government or the law.
among these rights are the right to a lawyer when accused of a crime and the right to a trial by jury when charged with a crime.
in addition the fourth amendment protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures.
this provision requires police to have a court order before searching a persons home for criminal evidence.
to obtain this the police must have a very strong reason to suspect someone of a crime.
equal treatment all americans regardless of race religion or political beliefs have the right to be treated the same under the law.
the fifth amendment states that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law due process means that the government must follow procedures established by law and guaranteed by the constitution treating all people equally.
the fourteenth amendment requires every state to grant its citizens equal protection of the laws basic freedoms the first amendment describes our basic freedoms freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly and the right to petition.
in a democracy power rests in the hands of the people.
therefore citizens in a democratic society must be able to exchange ideas freely.
the first amendment allows citizens to criticize the government in speech or in the press without fear of punishment.
in addition the ninth amendment states that the rights of americans are not limited to those in the constitution.
over the years this has allowed americans to assert other basic rights that have been upheld in court or assured by amending the constitution.
limits on rights the rights of americans are not absolute.
they are limited based on the principle of respecting everyone s rights equally.
for example many cities and towns require groups to obtain a permit to march on city streets.
such laws do limit free speech but they also protect the community by ensuring that the march will not endanger other people.
in this and other cases the government balances an individuals rights the rights of others and the community s health and safety.
most americans are willing to accept some limitations on their rights to gain these protections as long as the restrictions are reasonable and apply equally to all.
a law banning all marches would violate the first amendment rights of free speech and assembly and be unacceptable.
similarly a law preventing only certain groups from marching would be unfair because it would not apply equally to everyone.

i 1 2 1 citizens responsibilities citizens in a democratic society have both duties and responsibilities.
duties are actions required by law.
responsibilities are voluntary actions.
fulfilling duties and responsibilities ensures good government and protects rights.
duties one basic duty of all americans is to obey the law.
laws serve three important functions.
they help maintain order they protect the health safety and property of all citizens and they make it possible for people to live together peacefully.
if you believe a law is wrong you can work through your representatives to change it.
americans also have a duty to pay taxes.
the government uses tax money to defend the nation to build roads and bridges and to assist people in need.
americans often benefit from services provided by the government.
another duty of citizens is to defend the nation.
all males aged 18 and older must register with the government in case the nation needs to call on them for military service.
military service is not automatic but a war could make it necessary.
the constitution guarantees all americans the right to a trial by a jury of their equals.
for this reason you may be called to jury duty when you reach the age of 18.
having a large group of jurors on hand is necessary to guarantee the right to a fair and speedy trial.
you also have a duty to serve as a trial witness if called to do so.
most states require you to attend school until a certain age.
school is where you gain the knowledge and skills needed to be a good citizen.
in the constitution h nc i iok responsive take action school you learn to think more clearly to express your opinions more accurately and to analyze the ideas of others.
these skills will help you make informed choices when you vote.
responsibilities the responsibilities of citizens are not as clear cut as their duties but they are as important because they help maintain the quality of government and society.
one important responsibility is to be well informed.
knowing what your government is doing and expressing your open and quick to thoughts about its actions helps to keep it responsive to the wishes of the people.
you also need to be informed about your rights and to assert them when necessary.
knowing your rights helps preserve them.
other responsibilities include accepting responsibility for your actions and supporting your family.
to enjoy your rights to the fullest you must be prepared to respect the rights of others.
respecting the rights of others also means respecting the rights of people with whom you disagree.
respecting and accepting others regardless of race religion beliefs or other differences is essential in a democracy.
vote vote vote.
perhaps the most important civic responsibility of american citizens is to vote when they reach the age of 18.
voting allows you to participate in the democratic process and to guide its direction.
when you vote for people to represent you in government you will be exercising your right of self government.
if you disapprove of the job your representatives are doing it will be your responsibility to help elect other people in the next election.
in addition to voting there are other ways you can participate in the democratic process.
you can let your representatives know what you think about issues through email letters telephone calls petitions and by taking part in public meetings or political rallies.
you can join a political party and help campaign for a candidate that you support.
political parties are always looking for volunteers to help.
in addition membership in a party will let you play a role in choosing who runs as candidates for election.
and the time may come when you too may want to participate by running for office.
participating in the democratic process reflects our patriotism.
we live in a constitutional democratic republic.
the national ethos the beliefs and ideas americans all share as a community includes the belief that the best and most effective government is government of for and by the people.
the only way to live up to those beliefs is to embrace them by participating in the democratic process.
the constitutions preamble states that the goal of the people of the united states is to form a more perfect union because the united states is a government of the people and a democratic republic it becomes more perfect and moves closer to its goals when all of its people in all of their variation and diversity participate.
if someone does not participate the union does not have their input and is less likely to reflect a balance of all of the needs concerns and goals of the people.
this make it harder to achieve justice peace security liberty or to promote the general welfare.
if we truly love the country then we want it to succeed and if there are aspects to it that you do not like the best way to change them is by getting involved in politics and working to bring about the changes you think are needed.
patriotism is not standing by while others act patriots act so as to help make their country better.
the united states is made up of people who have come from all over the world sometimes to escape violence or poverty or oppression and sometimes seeking employment education and more opportunity.
38 whatever their reasons each immigrant who becomes a citizen promises in their oath of allegiance that i support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states of america against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
as citizens of a self governing democratic republic all american citizens share a common bond in that they stand for certain self evident truths that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness b reading progress check describing what are the rights and responsibilities of an american citizen.
understanding symbols and mottos guiding question howdo thesymbols and mottos of the united states help to define american society.
all nations make use of symbols.
a symbol is something that stands for something else.
it is a short hand way of remembering all the qualities and ideas embodied in something.
nations use symbols to remind people what the nation represents.
they are also a statement of sovereignty.
when a nations flag is flown over something it is saying that it belongs to the nation.
similarly when a national seal is put on a document it is saying that the document is an official statement of the nation.
symbols remind people of their nations history values and goals.
they evoke patriotism and pride.
perhaps most important they remind people that despite their differences they are all united in one national community.
the american flag the best known and most visible symbol of the united states is the flag sometimes nicknamed the stars and stripes the star spangled banner the red white and blue or old glory.
the continental congress approved the design of the flag in june 1777.
the 13 alternating stripes on the flag represent the original 13 colonies that founded the united states.
each star in the blue field represents one state.
the stars were a metaphor for the new nation.
stars in the night sky are grouped into constellations or patterns.
the stars on the flag represent that the united states is a new constellation a new arrangement in the world.
the colors used on the flag have been said to have at least two meanings.
they are the same colors as used on the british flag and so remind the united states of its origins as british colonies.
they are also the same colors used on the great seal of the united states which was designed before the flag and have specific meanings.
red for strength and courage white for purity and innocence and blue for perseverance vigilance and justice.
e pluribus unum on july 4 1776 nearly a year before the continental congress decided on the design for a flag it began work on the great seal of the united states.
a seal is a type of signature.
most nations have an official symbol that they use to seal or sign official documents and treaties with other nations.
seals date to the days when letters and documents would be signed and sealed by melting wax onto them and then pressing a symbol into the wax sealing the envelope closed.
they are also commonly put on coins and currency to show that the money has been officially issued by a particular country.
the great seal has two sides.
on the one side is an eagle holding a banner with the latin motto e pluribus unum which means out of the constitution handbook 3 many one this vmotto refers to the creation of a nation from 13 separate colonies.
today it also is used to describe the united states as a country of many peoples from many different cultures races and backgrounds united into one nation.
the motto was never made the official motto of the united states but it has been used on american coins since the late 1700s.
on the same side of the seal the eagle also clutches an olive branch with 13 leaves in one claw and 13 arrows in the other claw symbolizing the nations power in war and peace.
the eagle also carries a shield with red and white stripes and a blue field.
thirteen stars symbolizing the original 13 colonies fly above the eagle.
on the opposite side of the seal are symbols that often puzzle people.
there is an unfinished pyramid with 13 levels and the date 1776 in roman numerals at it base.
it represents the 13 colonies and the idea that the united states is a work in progress and not yet finished.
a pyramid was chosen because it represents strength and duration like the pyramids of egypt that have lasted for thousands of years.
hovering over the pyramid is an eye in a triangle.
the triangle looks like the capstone or top of the pyramid and the eye is intended to represent god watching over the nation.
above the eye are the latin words annuit coeptis which means he approves the undertaking indicating god approves of the new nation.
below the pyramid are the latin words novus ordo seclorum meaning new order of the ages referring to the idea that the united states as a democratic republic was a new way of organizing society in the world.
star spangled banner the star spangled banner is the national anthem of the united states.
its lyrics were first written down as a poem in 1814 by francis scott key after he watched the british attack fort mchenry during the war of 1812.
the poem describes key watching anxiously in the early morning dawn to see if the american flag is one of the most easily recognizable symbols of the united states.
critkalthinking drawing conclusions how would the flag need to change if more states were added to the union.
40 the flag is again raised over the the land of the free and home of the brave the song became popular in the 1800s and was played regularly on july 4th.
in 1889 secretary of the navy benjamin tracy ordered that it be played whenever the navy raised the american flag but the song was not made the official national anthem of the united states until 1931.
in god wetrust the official motto of the united states is in god we trust the origins of the phrase probably dates to the national anthem.
in the fourth verse of the star spangled banner is the phrase and this be our motto in god is our trust but the motto was not approved by congress at the time and for much of its history the united states did not have an official motto.
the phrase was used as a battle cry by some units in the union army and in the late 1800s after the civil war congress approved the phrase in god we trust for use on american coins.
since 1938 all united states coins have had this phrase inscribed on them.
in 1956 with the united states in the midst of the cold war with the soviet union congress declared the national motto to be in god we trust the motto was meant to assert the general american belief in god and to contrast it with the communist belief in atheism.
in 1957 the phrase began to be used on american paper currency as well.
in recent years the motto has become controversial with some people arguing that it violates the first amendments ban on government establishing a religion.
lower courts as well as the supreme court have repeatedly ruled that the motto and its use on coins and currency is not a violation of the first amendment because it serves a ceremonial not a religious purpose and does not constitute the creation of a state church.

the motto of the united states can be found on its currency.

powe ed to congress elastic clause the final enumerated power is often called the elastic clause this clause gives congress the right to make all laws necessary and proper to carry out the powers expressed in the other clauses of article i.
it is called the elastic clause because it lets congress stretch its powers to meet situations the founders could never have anticipated.
almost from the beginning this phrase was a subject of dispute.
the issue was whether a strict or a broad interpretation of the constitution should be applied.
the dispute was first addressed in 1819 in the case of mcculloch v maryland when the supreme court ruled in favor of a broac interpretation.
the court stated that the elastic clause allowed congress to use its powers in any way that was not specifically prohibited by the constitution.
what does the phrase necessary and proper in the elastic clause mean.
original rights a writ of habeas corpus issued by a judge requires a law official to bring a prisoner to j court and show cause for holding the i prisoner.

in antebellum america the period before the civil war americans faced a new question could they work together to create a strong and prosperous nation.
the nation matures guidingquestion how did the united states develop politically and economically in the early 1800s.
i after the war of 1812 the united states entered an era of good feelings a sense of nationalism swept the country.
riding this wave of nationalism was democratic republican james monroe the nations fifth president.
the missouri compromise the era of good feelings could not ward off the nations growing sectional disputes.
missouris application for statehood as a slave state stirred up the divisive issue of whether slavery should expand westward.
in 1819 the union consisted of 11 free and 11 slave states.
admitting any new state would upset the balance in the senate and touch off a bitter struggle over political power.
many northerners opposed extending slavery into the west believing it to be morally wrong.
the south feared that if slavery could not expand then new free states would give the north enough votes in the senate to outlaw slaveholding.
a solution emerged when maine which for decades had been part of massachusetts requested admission to the union as a separate state.
th senate voted to admit maine as a free state and missouri as a slave state.
this solution to the controversy kept the balance in the senati senator jesse thomas of illinois then proposed an amendment that would prohibit slavery in the louisiana purchase territory north of missouri s southern border.
slavery could expand into arkansas territo south of missouri but not in the rest of the louisiana purchase.
62 by a very close vote carefully managed by henry clay of kentucky the house of representatives voted to accept the missouri compromise.
however this merely postponed a debate over the future of slavery.
american nationalism following the war of 1812 the federalist party rapidly lost political influence.
partisan infighting had largely ended because only one major political party the democratic republicans remained.
as monroes presidency began focus shifted from world affairs to national growth.
in 1823 while many of spains colonies were fighting for independence president monroe proclaimed what became known as the monroe doctrine.
it declared the united statess opposition to european interference in the americas.
the charter of the first bank of the united states had expired in 1811.
in 1816 representative john c calhoun of south carolina introduced a bill proposing the second bank of the united states.
the bill passed giving the bank power to issue national currency and to control state banks.
inexpensive british goods threatened to put american manufacturers out of business.
congress responded with the tariff of 1816.
unlike earlier revenue tariffs which provided income for the federal government this tariff was a protective tariff that worked to raise the prices of imports.
under chief justice john marshall the supreme court issued decisions that helped strengthen the national government.
between 1816 and 1824 marshall interpreted the constitution broadly to support federal power.
in the 1819 case mcculloch v maryland the court decided that congress had the authority to establish the second bank of the united states.
it ruled that the federal government could use any method that was necessary and proper for carrying out its powers as long as the method was not expressly forbidden by the constitution.
the ruling meant that a state could not interfere with a federal agency working within that states borders.
industrialization and the transportation revolution the industrial revolution which had begun in europe spread to the united states during this time.
businesses began large scale manufacturing using complex machines and organized workforces in factories.
as transportation expanded manufacturers sold their wares nationwide or abroad instead of just locally.
in 1806 congress funded a major east west highway called the national road.
private businesses and state and local governments also built roads and canals.
the invention of the steamboat transformed river transportation.
by 1835 more than 700 steamboats called riverboats traveled on the nations waterways.
railroads also appeared in the early 1800s.

while thousands became farmers in the rural west many others settled in cities providing a steady source of cheap labor.
more than 44 000 irish arrived in 1845 after a widespread famine in their homeland.

but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states.

in the 1800s many americans were anti catholic and the arrival of predominantly catholic irish and german immigrants led to the rise of nativist groups and push for laws banning immigrants from holding public office.
in 1854 delegates from some of these groups formed the american party which came to be called the know nothings.
owners ofthe early factory mills expressed a paternalistic concern for their workers.
the relationship between management and labor however became more strained whenever prices slumped and wages dropped.
by 1860 factory workers numbered roughly 1 3 million.
men women and children alike typically toiled for 12 or more hours a day.
hoping to gain higher wages or shorter workdays some workers began to organize in labor unions.
during the late 1820s and early 1830s about 300 000 men and women belonged to some form of union.
most employers refused to bargain with them and the courts often saw them as unlawful conspiracies that limited free enterprise.
despite the trend toward urban and industrial growth agriculture remained the countrys leading economic activity.
until the late 1800s farming employed more people and produced more wealth than any other kind of work.
northern farmers produced enough to sell their surplus in the growing eastern cities and towns.
as one ohio newspaper reporter wrote in 1851 as far as the eye can stretch in the distance nothing but corn and wheat fields are to be seen and on some points in the scioto valley as high as a thousand acres of corn may be seen in adjoining fields belonging to some eight or ten different proprietors reading progress check explaining how did the millions of new immigrants make a living in the united states.

farming was even more important in the south which lagged behind the north in industrialization.
the south had few big cities and less industry.
compared with the many textile mills and factories in the north the south had only scattered iron works textile mills and coal iron salt and copper mines.
together these accounted for only 16 percent of the nations total manufacturing.
the south thrived on the production of several major cash crops including cotton tobacco rice and sugarcane.
no crop would play a greater role in the souths fortunes during this period than cotton.

the age of jackson guiding question how wouldyou evaluate the age of jackson.
andrew jackson was elected president in the election of 1828 supported by rural and small town voters.
as president jackson actively tried to make the government more inclusive.
he wanted ordinary citizens to play a role in government and he supported the spoils system the practice of giving people government jobs on the basis of party loyalty.
jackson had not been in office long before he had to focus on a national crisis that highlighted the growing rift between the north and the south.
south carolina bought many needed goods from england and as a result had to pay the high tariffs levied on those goods.
when another tariff law was passed in 1832 south carolina adopted an ordinance of nullification declaring spoils system the practice of handing out government jobs to supporters of the winning candidate creating a nation 65 in andrew jackson s inaugural address he declared his intention to move all native americans to the great plains.

jackson regarded nullification as treason and sent a warship to charleston.
when congress passed a bill that lowered tariffs gradually south carolina repealed its nullification of the tariff law.
along with the nullification crisis jackson dismantled the second bank of the united states.
like most westerners and many working people in the east he regarded the bank as a monopoly that benefited the wealthy elite.
he vetoed a bill that would have extended its charter and then withdrew all the governments deposits severely weakening the bank.
in his inaugural address jackson had declared his intention to move all native americans to the great plains.
in 1830 jackson signed the indian removal act.
the cherokee in georgia appealed to the supreme court hoping to gain legal recognition of their territorial rights.
chief justice marshall supported this right in two decisions both of which jackson refused to carry out.
in 1838 martin van buren jacksons successor sent in the army to forcibly move the cherokee.

a reforming society guiding question m to common characteristics did reform movements of this era share.
temperance moderation in or abstinence from consuming alcohol during the mid 1800s a number of reformers argued that no social vice caused more crime poverty or family hardship than the excessive consumption of alcohol.
they advocated temperance or moderation in the consumption of alcohol.
temperance groups formed across the country preaching the evils of alcohol and urging people to give up liquor.
in 1833 a number of groups formed a national organization the american temperance union.
in 1851 maine passed the first state prohibition law an example 12 other states followed by 1855.
other states passed local option laws which allowed towns and villages to ban liquor sales.
66 prisons asylums and school reform some reformers focused on providing better facilities for prisoners and the insane.
many states replaced their overcrowded prisons with penitentiaries so prisoners would be rehabilitated and by the beginning of the civil war most states had established public mental institutions to keep the mentally ill out of the prison system.
many reformers sought to establish a system of public education.
they focused on establishing elementary schools to teach all children the basics of reading writing and arithmetic and to instill a work ethic.
women s rights by the mid 1800s the development of factories separated the home from the workplace.
men often left home to go to work while women tended the home.
as the reform movements of the 1830s grew some women set out to create more educational opportunities and began promoting new ideas about their role in society.
in 1848 activists lucretia mott and elizabeth cady stanton organized the seneca falls convention in new york.
the convention issued the declaration of sentiments and resolutions better known as the seneca falls declaration.
it began with words expanding on the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal.
stanton proposed that they focus on suffrage or the right to vote and the convention narrowly passed her proposal.
abolitionism of all the reform movements that began in the early 1800s the most divisive was the one calling for abolition or the immediate end to slavery.
it polarized the nation and helped bring about the civil war.
many of the nations founders knew that the united states would have difficulty remaining true to its ideals of liberty and equality if it did not emancipate or free all enslaved people.
some religious groups argued that slavery was a sin.
free african americans took a prominent role in the movement.
one of the most famous was frederick douglass who had escaped from slavery in maryland.

creating a nation 67 teks 22a 22b 29a tocquevilles democracy in america in 1831 alexis de tocqueville o french lawyer was commissioned by the french government to study american prisons.
while in america tocqueville traveled to the michigan frontier and as far south as new orleans but spent most of his time in new england.
he became convinced that there was something exceptional about american society.
between 1835 and 1839 he published a two volume book democracy in america.
the book is regarded as one of the great works of political thought because of its discussions of liberty egalitarianism individualism populism and laissez faire economics.
tocqueville argued that these five attributes made america exceptional in the world.
americas social and economic equality enabled the united states to have a remarkable amount of political liberty.
tocqueville believed the political liberty found on the american frontier helped keep people equal and led to individualism and free economic exchange both of which benefited america because they were constrained by democratic institutions.
democracy and equality among the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the united states nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of condition among the people.
i readily discovered the prodigious influence that this primary fact exercises on the whole course of society it gives a peculiar direction to public opinion and a peculiar tenor to the laws it imparts new maxims to the governing authorities and peculiar habits to the governed.
i soon perceived that the influence of this fact extends far beyond the political character and the laws of the country and that it has no less effect on civil society than on the government it creates opinions gives birth to vocabulary egalitarianism idea that people should be treated as equals populism belief in the rights and values of regular people as opposed to the elite prodigious remarkable impressive in size eminently highly greatly exceptionally asunder divided apart new sentiments founds novel customs and modifies whatever it does not produce.
the emigrants who colonized the shores of america in the beginning of the seventeenth century somehow separated the democratic principle from all the principles that it had to contend with in the old communities of europe and transplanted it alone to the new world.
it has there been able to spread in perfect freedom and peaceably.
equality and the frontier tocqueville believed social equality in the united states prevented the growth of an aristocracy and ensured popular democracy.
in the excerpt below he outlines how this equality combined with the open american frontier made the united states unique among nations and led to the development of capitalism.
the social condition of the americans is eminently democratic this was its character at the foundation of the colonies and is still more strongly marked at the present day.
i have stated that great equality existed among the emigrants who settled on the shores of new england.
the germ of aristocracy was never planted in that part of the union.
i do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals in the united states i know of no country indeed where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of 68 men and where the profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property.
but wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.
this picture still gives a very imperfect idea of what is taking place in the new states of the west and south west.
at the end of the last century a few bold adventurers began to penetrate into the valleys of the mississippi and the mass of the population very soon began to move in that direction communities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from the wilds and in the western settlements we may behold democracy arrived at its utmost extreme public good from individualism individualism was a new concept in the 1800s and tocqueville worried that it would cause people to pursue their self interest at the expense of others.
tocqueville believed americans had found ways to combine individual economic activity with democratic institutions so as to benefit rich and poor.
individualism is a novel expression to which a novel idea has given birth.
our fathers were only acquainted with egotism.
egotism is a passionate and exaggerated love of self individualism is a mature and calm feeling which disposes each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his fellow creatures and to draw apart with his family and his friends so that after he has thus formed a little circle of his own he willingly leaves society at large to itself.
the great advantage of the americans is that they have arrived at a state of democracy without having to endure a democratic revolution and that they are born equal instead of becoming so.
the americans have combated by free institutions the tendency of equality to keep men asunder and they have subdued it.
in the united states the more opulent citizens take great care not to stand aloof from the people on the contrary they constantly keep on easy terms with the lower classes they listen to them they speak to them every day.
they know that the rich in democracies always stand in need of the poor.
it would seem as if every imagination in the united states were upon the stretch to invent means of increasing the wealth and satisfying the wants of the public.
the best informed inhabitants of each district constantly use their information to discover new truths which may augment the general prosperity and if they have made any such discoveries they eagerly surrender them to the mass of the people.

slaveholders offered a bounty of 40 000 for her capture.
when california applied for statehood attempts by congress to find a compromise on slavery further heightened opposing viewpoints.
senator lewis cass of michigan suggested that the citizens of each new territory should be allowed to decide for themselves if they wanted to permit slavery this idea came to be called popular sovereignty.

then taylor died unexpectedly in july.
vice president millard fillmore succeeded him and quickly threw his support behind the measure which had been divided into several smaller bills.
by september congress had passed all parts of the compromise of 1850.
henry clay had conceived the fugitive slave act as a measure to benefi slaveholders.

democratic senator stephen a douglas of illinois wanted the eastern starting point to be in chicago.
knowing a northern route would run through the unsettled lands west of missouri and iowa he prepared a bill to organize the region into a new territory to be called nebraska.
key southern committee leaders prevented this bill from coming to a vote in the senate.
they made it clear that before nebraska could be organized congress had to repeal part of the missouri compromise and allow slavery in the new territory.
douglas finally agreed to repeal the antislavery provision of the missouri compromise and to divide the region into two territories.
nebraska would be to the north adjacent to the free state of iowa kansas would be to the south west of the slave state of missouri.
this looked like nebraska was intended to be free territory while kansas was intended for slavery.
warned that the south might secede without such concessions president franklin pierce finally gave his support to the bill.

the party was determined to prevent southern planters from gaining control ofthe federal government.
republicans did not agree on abolishing slavery but they did agree that it had to be kept out of the territories.
at the same time the american party also known as the know nothing was making gains.
this anti catholic nativist party opposed immigration.

the outcome of the 1860 election triggered the first shots ofthe long bloody civil woi the opposing sides guiding question what were the advantages and disadvantages for the north and the soi at the start of the war.
although the south had many experienced officers to lead its troo in battle the north had several economic advantages.
in 1860 the population of the north was about 22 million while the south had about 9 million people more than one third of whom were enslaved in 1860 almost 90 percent of the nations factories were located in the northern states which could provide troops with ammunition and other supplies more easily.
the south had only half as many miles of railroad track as the north.
northern troops could more easily disrupt the southern rail system and prevent the movement of supplies and troops.
the union also controlled the national treasury and could expe continued revenue from tariffs.
many northern banks held large reserves of cash which they lent the government by purchasing bon in contrast to the union the confederacys financial situation was poor and it became worse over time.
most southern planters were ii debt and unable to buy bonds.
southern banks were small and had f cash reserves so they could not buy many bonds either.
the best hope for the south to raise money was by taxing trade.
but the unio navy quickly blockaded southern ports reducing trade.
the confederacy enacted direct taxation of its people but many southerners refused to pay.
the confederacy was forced to print paper money causing rapid inflation in the south.

b reading progress check identifying what advantages did factories and railroads give the north in the civil war.
the early stages guiding question when did the war change from a battle over preserving the union to a war to end slavery.
what caused this change.
the civil war began in april 1861 when confederate forces fired upon federal troops in fort sumter in charleston harbor.
confederate president jefferson davis claimed that the seceding states were fighting for the same sacred right of self government that had inspired the american revolution and that the confederacy would seek no conquest all we ask is to be let alone first battle of bull run soon after the war began lincoln approved an assault on confederate troops gathered near manassas junction virginia.
the first battle of bull run started well for the union but the tide turned when reinforcements helped the confederates defeat the union forces.
the outcome made it clear that the north would need a large well trained army to prevail against the south.
the war in the west the union blockaded southern ports along the atlantic but the south used small fast ships to smuggle goods past the blockades.
in april 1862 union forces seized new orleans the souths largest city and gained control of the lower mississippi river.
in early 1862 union general ulysses s grant began a campaign on the cumberland and tennessee rivers.
control of these rivers would split tennessee and provide the union with a route into confederate territory.
all of kentucky and most of western tennessee eventually fell.
the war in the east while grant fought in the west union general george b mcclellans forces set out to capture richmond virginia the confederate capital.
in late june 1862 confederate general robert e lee began a series of attacks on mcclellans continued from p 78 teks texas essential knowledge and skills 9a trace the historical development ofthe civil rights movement in the 19th 20th and 21st centuries including the 13th 14th 15th and 19th amendments 26f discuss the importance of congressional medal of honor recipients including individuals of all races and genders such as vernon j baker alvin york and roy benavidez outcome something that follows as a result or consequence creating a nation 79 forces.
together the two sides suffered more than 30 000 casualties.
on september 17 1862 lees forces met mcclellans at antietam an tee tuhm creek.
the fight was the bloodiest one day battle in american history ending with nearly 6 000 soldiers killed and another 17 000 wounded.
mcclellan did not break lees lines but he inflicted so many casualties that lee decided to retreat to virginia.
the battle of antietam was a crucial victory for the union.
the british government had been ready to intervene in the war as a mediator if lees invasion had succeeded.
now the british decided to wait and see how the war progressed.
the souths defeat at antietam had an even more important political impact in the united states.
it convinced president lincoln that th time had come to end slavery in the south.
the emancipation proclamation most democrats opposed ending slavery while republicans were divided.
with union casualties rising however many northerners began to agree that slavery had to end both to punish the south and to make the soldiers sacrifices worthwhile.
on september 22 1862 lincoln publicly announce.
that he would issue the emancipation proclamation a decree freeing all enslaved persons in states still in rebellion after january 1 1863.
because the proclamation freed enslaved african americans only in states at war with the union it did not address slavery in the border states.
by its very existence however the proclamation transformed the conflict over preserving the union into a war of liberation.

as 1863 began there was no end to the war in sight.
more than two years of battle lay ahead for americans and the casualties would continue to rise steeply.
the new military technology produced a hug number of casualties and doctors struggled to tend to the wounded having little understanding of infection and germs.

mary edwards walker was one of the few women before the civil war to earn a medical degree.
when the civil war erupted she volunteered to help the union army and worked as a surgeon near the front lines.
she frequently crossed enemy lines to treat civilians and on one such mission in 1864 she was arrested as a spy and imprisoned for four months.
for her contributions to the war effort she was awarded the medal of honor in 1865.
vicksburg gaining control of the mississippi river was a vital element of the union strategy for winning the civil war.
if the union could capture vicksburg mississippi the last major confederate stronghold on the river then the north could cut the south in two.
in may 1863 grant launched two assaults on vicksburg but the citys defenders repulsed both attacks and inflicted high casualties.
grant decided to put the city under siege by cutting off its food and supplies and bombarding it until its defenders gave up.
on july 4 1863 with his troops starving the confederate commander at vicksburg surrendered.
gettysburg meanwhile in virginia lee had been able to defeat union forces at fredericksburg and chancellorsville.
emboldened by these victories lee decided in june 1863 to launch another invasion of the north.
at the end of june as lees army foraged in the pennsylvania countryside some of his troops headed into gettysburg hoping to seize a supply of shoes.
when they arrived near the town they discovered two brigades of union cavalry.
on july 1 1863 as confederates pushed the union troops out of the town the main forces of both armies hurried to the scene ofthe fighting.
on july 2 lee attacked but the union troops held their ground.
the following day lee ordered nearly 15 000 men under the command of general george e pickett and general a p hill to make a massive assault.
the attack known as picketts charge caused 7 000 casualties in less than half an hour but failed to break the union lines.
a 11 this has been my fault said lee.
it is i that have lost this fight.
lees troops retreated to virginia.
at gettysburg the union suffered 23 000 casualties the south an estimated 28 000 more than one third of lees entire force.
the disaster at gettysburg proved to be the turning point ofthe war in the east.
the unions victory strengthened the republicans politically and ensured once again that the british would not recognize the confederacy.
for the remainder of the war lees forces remained on the defensive slowly giving ground to the advancing union army.
m four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.

general grant succeeded in securing control ofthe mississippi river.
lincoln rewarded him appointing him general in chief of the union forces.
grant then began a relentless series of attacks against lees forces slowly pushing deeper into virginia.
in june 1864 grant forces reachec the fortifications outside the city of petersburg.
instead of attacking he put the city under siege.
as the siege dragged on support for the war declined and lincoln expected to lose the 1.
presidential election.
in september 1864 however general william tecumseh sherman captured atlanta and then began a march to sea pillaging and destroying railroads warehouses ra and factories.
shermans success revitalized northern support for the war and lincoln won in a landslide.
the president interpreted his reelection as a mandate from the voters end slavery permanently by amending the constitution.
the senate had passed an amendment the previous spring but lincoln and congressiona republicans had to build a coalition of anti slavery democrats to get the amendment passed in the house of representatives.
on january 31 1865 the thirteenth amendment to the constitution banning slavery in the united states narrowly passed the house of representatives and went to the states for ratification.
it took the remainder of the year but by december 1865 enough states had ratified the amendme for it to go into effect.
the thirteenth amendment marked a culmination o the abolition movement that had begun in the years after the american revolution.
it also finally applied the founding principles ofthe declaration independence the self evident truths as the declaration put it that all mei are created equal and had an unalienable right to liberty.
the war ends by the spring of 1865 lee knew that time was running out.
on april 1 1865 union troops cut the last rail line into petersburg virginia.
lees troops attempted to escape grants forces in the area but union cavalry blocked the road.
with his battered troops surrounded and outnumbered lee surrendered to grant at appomattox court house on apr 9 1865.
grants generous terms of surrender guaranteed that the union woi not prosecute confederate soldiers for treason.
when grant agreed to let confederates take their horses home to put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the next winter lee thanked him saying the kindness would do much toward conciliating our people with the war over lincoln delivered a speech describing his plan to restore the southern states to the union.
in the speech he mentioned including african americans in southern state governments.
one listener actor johnwilkes booth sneered to a friend that is the last speech he w ever make.
although his advisers had repeatedly warned him not to appe unescorted in public lincoln went to fords theatre with his wife to see a play on the evening of april 14 1865.

b reading progress check drawing conclusions what were the differences the south experienced before and after the battle of gettysburg.
reconstruction guiding question iv wf important decisions had to be made concerning the fate ofthe seceded states and the rights of those freed from slavery.
at the end of the civil war the south was a defeated region with a devastated economy.
while some southerners were bitter over the loss for many rebuilding their land and their lives was more important.
the president and congress grappled with the difficult task of reconstruction.
opposing plans for reconstruction in december 1863 president lincoln offered a general amnesty or pardon to southerners who took an oath of loyalty to the united states and accepted the unions requirements concerning slavery.
however certain confederate officials and military officers were not included in the offer.
in his second inaugural address in march 1865 lincoln spoke of ending the war with malice toward none with charity for all resistance to lincolns plan surfaced among a group of republicans in congress known as radical republicans.
they wanted to prevent the leaders of the confederacy from returning to power.
they also wanted the federal government to guarantee african americans their right to vote.
vice president andrew johnson a democrat from tennessee assumed the presidency after lincolns death.
his 1865 plan for reconstruction closely resembled lincolns and offered amnesty to all former citizens of the confederacy except for former confederate officials and wealthy planters.
many congressional republicans were outraged when southerners elected many former confederate officials to congress.
they were further angered when southern state legislatures passed a series of laws known as black codes that limited african americans rights.
the fourteenth amendment in june 1866 in order to permanently block states from imposing black i codes or other restrictions on african american rights congress passed the i fourteenth amendment to the constitution.
this amendment granted.

it was also about helping freed african americans transition from enslavement to freedom.
increased education was key in this effort.
florida a m university traces its origins back to 1887.
originally named the state normal college for colored students the schools first president was thomas desaille tucker an attorney.
tucker was only the second teacher at the school and presided over its first fourteen years.
the school became floridas land grant college for african americans and received financial aid from the morrill land grant act.
today florida a m continues the tradition of educating african americans as one of the premier historically black institutions of higher education in the united states.
extremist organizations during reconstruction secret sodetic such as the white league and the pale faces formed to prevent africai americans from exercising their rights.
the largest of these groups the ku klux kian used violence to drive out carpetbaggers and intimidate african americans.
other white extremist organizations included the red shirts and the knights of the white camellia.
the red shirts originated in mississippi and the knights of the white camellia first formed in new orleans.
defending do you think the cartoon texl is correct in its assertion that these groups were worse than slavery.
in march 1867 congressional republicans passed the military reconstruction act dividing the former confederacy except for tennesse which had ratified the fourteenth amendment in 1866 into five military districts.
in order for the former confederate states to regain control oft.
state government and be allowed to elect members to congress they had give the right to vote to all adult male citizens regardless of race and rati the fourteenth amendment.
the fourteenth amendment was a turning point in american politic and legal history.
since its ratification in 1868 it has been used to expand federal power over the states and to extend civil rights through its equal protection clause.
it also led to the doctrine of incorporation the idea tha the bill of rights applies to state governments not just the federal government.
although it did not prevent southern states from imposing restrictions on african americans in the late 19th century the fourteenth amendment would empower the african american civil rights movement and help ensure its success in the 1950s and 1960s.
the fifteenth amendment in the meantime tensions between radical republicans and johnson increased and eventually the house of representatives voted to impeach t president.
the impeachment trial in the senate ended one vote short of convicting johnson.
although johnson remained in office he did not run for re election in 1868.
that year the republicans nominated general gr for president.
grant won easily and republicans kept control of congress republicans moved rapidly to expand their reconstruction program.
recognizing the importance of african american suffrage congress pass the fifteenth amendment to the constitution.
this amendment declared that the right to vote shall not be denied on account of race color or previous condition of servitude by march 1870 enough states had ratifi the amendment to make it part of the constitution.
radical reconstructs had a dramatic impact on the south particularly in the short term.
it changed southern politics by bringing hundreds of thousands of african 84 americans into the political process for the first time.
it also began to change southern society.
as it did so it angered many white southerners who began to fight back against the federal governments policies.
the south during reconstruction by the autumn of 1870 all former confederate states had rejoined the union.
the freedmens bureau worked to feed and clothe war refugees and help formerly enslaved people.
a large number of northerners traveled to the south where many were elected or appointed to positions in the new state governments.
southerners called these newcomers carpetbaggers because some arrived with their belongings in suitcases made of carpet fabric.
local residents saw them as intruders seeking to exploit the south.

political speech 1861 the confederate states of americas constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution african slavery as it exists among us the proper status ofthe negro in our form of civilization.
the prevailing ideas entertained by most ofthe leading statesmen at the time ofthe formation ofthe old constitution were that the enslavement of the african was in violation ofthe laws of nature that it was wrong in principle socially morally and politically our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea its foundations are laid its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.

they know that all the unutterable agonies of our many battlefields all the terrible sorrows which rend so many vocabulary subordination in a state yielding to or being controlled by authority canker a sore that spreads deference respect for someone elses wishes or desires paramount superior to all others hostilities acts of warfare thousands of loving hearts all the ravages t desolation of this stupendous conflict are t be charged to slavery.

determined intelligent champion ofthe union cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the rebellion and at the same time uphold its inciting cause are preposterous and futile that the rebellion if crushed out tomorrow would be renewed within a year if slavery were left in full vigor that army officers who remain to this day devoted to slavery can at best be but halfway loyal to the union and that every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the union.

87 understanding historical eras why learn this skill.
have you ever heard someone refer to music from the 60s or art from the renaissance.
has your history teacher ever referred to the middle ages or to the gilded age or to the cold war era.
in each case they are referring to an historical era.
an era is a period of time in history that has distinct characteristics.
historians divide history into eras as a form of shorthand.
instead of having to refer to the time when many people were out of work the great plains were suffering dust storms and the government was creating programs to help people historians can simply refer to the great depression.
understanding historical eras makes learning history easier.
by breaking history into chunks it is easier to remember what was happening and why.
some era like the industrial era become known for the rapid growth of urban areas.
learning the skill to be an historical era a period of time has to have a common set of major characteristics.
these characteristics are based on a combinatic of the unique politics economics technology social issues culture and major events that we shaping people s lives at the time.
it is not alwa clear when an era begins or ends.
some of the things common in one era may continue into tl next era but usually several major things change leading historians to identify it as a new era.
historians often use a major event to mark the break or turning point that leads to a new era.
historians also break up history different.
depending on what they are studying.
an historian looking at international events regarc the 1920s and 1930s as the interwar era between world war i and world war ii.
but ar historian looking at economics sees the boomii 1920s as very different from the depression of the 1930s.
because the history of the united states is short the historical eras people use tend to be only a few decades long at most.
modern american history is usually said to begin in if the reason 1877 is chosen as the start is because it marks the last year when political debates still involved the issues of the civil w and reconstruction.
after 1877 historians generally agree that the united states began tc change and deal with issues unrelated to the civil war era.
these are the major eras of american histc since 1877 that most historians reference the industrial era or gilded age 1877 1900 the progressive era world war i 1900 1920 the roaring 20s or the new era 1920 1929 the great depression or new deal 1929 1939 world war ii 1939 1945 post war america 1945 to the present 88 photo francis miller time life pictures getty images text martin luther king jr i have a dream august 28 1963.
reprinted by the decades since the end of world war ii have been a time of great change and historians disagree over how best to divide it into historical eras.
many historians see 1945 to 1991 as an historical era because 1945 marks the start of the cold war and 1991 marks the end of the soviet union.
others focus on events within the united states.
some like to divide the post war era into decades the 50s the 60s the 70s etc because they see dramatic cultural changes in each decade.
others prefer to divide the post war years into eras based on major political economic or technological changes including the following post war america 1945 1953 civil rights era 1954 1968 vietnam era 1965 1975 the conservative resurgence 1976 1992 end of the century 1980 2000 the technology revolution 1981 present the post 9 11 era 2001 present the great recession 2007 present whatever era is used the best way to understand it is to focus on the major characteristics that make it different from other times in history.
learning those characteristics will help you remember american history and you will be able to make connections and generalizations about history more easily.
practicing this skill open up your textbook or the online student edition website.
look through the different chapters and lessons paying attention to the headings and topics to get a sense of the major characteristics of each era.

when others found a rich source nearby comstock claimed he owned the land and quickly struck a deal to share the fortune.
he later sold his claim for thousands of dollars not realizing that the sticky blue gray clay that made mining in the area difficult was nearly pure silver ore worth millions.
news of the comstock lode as the strike came to be called brought a flood of prospectors to virginia city.
so many people arrived that in 1864 nevada was admitted as the thirty sixth state in the union.
this occurred many times in the american west.
news of a mineral strike would start a stampede of prospectors.
almost overnight tiny frontier towns were transformed into small cities.
virginia city for example grew from a town of a few hundred people to nearly 30 000 in just a few months.
it had an opera house shops with furniture and fashions from europe several newspapers and a six story hotel.
these quickly growing towns were called boomtowns.
the term boom refers to a time of rapid economic growth.
boomtowns were 96 owdy places.
prospectors fought over claims and thieves haunted the treets and trails.
often law and order was enforced by vigilance ommittees self appointed volunteers who would track down and punish vrongdoers.
in some cases they responded with their own form of justice ut most people respected the law and tried to deal firmly but fairly with he accused.
eventually the mines that supported the boomtown economy would be used up.
a few boomtowns were able to survive when the mines closed but many of them did not.
instead these boomtowns went bust a term borrowed from card games in which players lost all of their money.
in virginia city for example the silver mines were exhausted by the 1880s and most residents moved on only about 500 people remained by 1930.
other towns were completely abandoned and became ghost towns.
mining leads to statehood after gold was discovered in 1858 in colorado near pikes peak miners rushed to the area declaring pikes peak or bust many panned for gold without success and headed home complaining of a pikes peak hoax in truth the colorado mountains contained plenty of gold and silver although much of it was hidden beneath the surface and hard to extract.
deep deposits of lead mixed with silver were found at leadville in the 1870s.
news of the strike attracted as many as 1 000 newcomers a week making leadville one of the wests most famous boomtowns.
this bonanza spurred the building of railroads through the rocky mountains and transformed denver the supply point for the mining areas into the second largest city in the west after san francisco.

in 1889 congress admitted three new states north dakota south dakota and montana.
in the southwest the arizona territory followed a similar pattern.
miners had already begun moving to arizona in the 1860s and 1870s to work one ofthe nations largest copper deposits.
when silver was found at the town of tombstone in 1877 it set off a boom that attracted a huge wave of prospectors to the territory.
the boom lasted about 30 years and during that time tombstone became famous for its lawlessness.
marshal wyatt earp and his brothers gained their reputations during the famous gunfight at the o k.
corral there in 1881.
although arizona did not grow as quickly as colorado nevada or montana by 1912 it had enough people to apply for statehood as did the neighboring territory of new mexico.
hydraulic mining method of mining by which water is sprayed at a very high pressure against a hill or mountain washing away large quantities of dirt gravel and rock and exposing the minerals beneath the surface miners used high pressure water to wash loose earth into ditches.
the ditches carried the water and earth into riffle boxes that agitated the water causing the silver or gold to settle out.
the leftover debris called tailings or slickens was then washed into a nearby stream.
critical thinking determining cause and effect how might this mining practice have helped miners in their search for minerals.
mining technology extracting minerals from the rugged mountains of the american west required ingenuity and patience.
early prospectors extracted shallow deposits of ore in a process called placer mining using simple tools like picks shovels and pans.
other prospectors used sluice mining to search riverbeds more quickly than the panning method.
a sluice diverted the current of a river into trenches.
the water was directed to a box with metal riffle bars that caused heavier minerals to settle to the bottom of the box.
a screen at the end kept the minerals from escaping with the water and sediment.
when deposits near the surface ran out miners began hydraulic mining to remove large quantities of earth and process it for minerals.
miners sprayed water at very high pressure against the hill or mountain they were mining.
the water pressure washed away the dirt gravel and rock and exposed the minerals beneath the surface.
changes to the land hydraulic mining began in the sierra nevada mountains in california.
it effectively removed large quantities of minerals and generated millions of dollars in gold.
unfortunately it also had a devastating effect on the local environment.
millions of tons of silt sand and gravel were washed into local rivers.
this sediment raised the riverbed.
as a result the rivers began overflowing their banks causing major floods that wrecked fences destroyed orchards and deposited rocks and gravel on what had been good farm soil destroying thousands of acres of rich farmland.
in the 1880s farmers fought back by suing the mining companies.
in 1884 federal judge lorenzo sawyer ruled in favor of the farmers.
he declared hydraulic mining a public and private nuisance and issued an injunction stopping the practice.
congress eventually passed a law in 1893 allowing hydraulic mining if the mining company created a place to store the sediment.
by then most mining companies had moved to quartz mining the kind of mining familiar to people today in which deep mine shafts are dug and miners go underground to extract the minerals.
p reading progress check explaining what role did mining play in the development ofthe american west.
cowboys drove millions of cattle north from texas to the railroads in kansas and points beyond.
ranching and cattle drives guiding question why was cattle ranching an important business for the great plains.
the lure of the great plains brought other americans west to herd cattle.
the texas longhorn a cattle breed descended from spanish cattle introduced two centuries earlier was well adapted to this region and flourished on scarce water and tough prairie grasses.
by 1865 some 5 million roamed the texas grasslands.
another boon to cattle ranching was the open range a vast area of grassland that the federal government owned.
here ranchers could graze their herds free of charge and unrestricted by private property.
the long drive begins prior to the civil war ranchers had little incentive to round up the longhorns and move them to market.
beef prices were low and moving cattle to eastern markets was not practical.
but during the war eastern cattle had been slaughtered in huge numbers to feed the armies of the union and the confederacy.
after the war beef prices soared.
also by this time railroads had reached the great plains heading to towns in kansas and missouri.
ranchers and livestock dealers realized that if they could move their cattle to the railroad the longhorns could be sold for a huge profit and shipped east to market.
in 1866 ranchers rounded up about 260 000 longhorns and drove them to sedalia missouri the first long drive other cattle trails soon opened including the route to abilene kansas as the railroads expanded in the west.
cowboys from major ranches went north with the herds which could number anywhere from 2 000 to 5 000 cattle.

eventually hundreds of square miles of fields were fenced cheaply and easily with a new invention barbed wire.
the fences blocked the cattle trails.
the cattle industry faced other struggles.
prices plunged in the mid 1880s and many ranchers went bankrupt.
the harsh winter of 1886 1887 buried the plains in deep snow.
many cattle froze or starved to death.
although it survived these terrible blows the cattle industry was changed forever.
the era of the open range ended and cowboys became ranch hands.
from then on herds were raised on fenced in ranches.

settling the hispanic southwest guidingquestion what was the relationship like between hispanics in the southwest and new settlers.
for centuries much of what is today the american southwest belonged to spains empire.
after mexico won its independence the region became the northern territories of the republic of mexico.
when the united states defeated mexico in 1848 it acquired this vast region.
according to the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo which ended the war the regions residents retained their property rights and could become american citizens.
settling the west 99 hacienda a huge ranch changing demographics in the southwest in california the spanish mission system had collapsed by the early 1800s.
in its place a society dominated by a landholding elite had emerged.
these landowners owned vast haciendas ranches that covered thousands of acres.
the heavy influx of forty niners during the california gold rusho 1849 however changed this society dramatically.
californias population grew from about from 14 000 to around 100 000 in less than two years and its demographic pattern changed dramatically.
suddenly hispanic californians were vastly outnumbered.
some hispanic californians welcomed the newcomers and the economic growth that resulted.
others distrusted the english speaking prospectors who tried to exclude them from the mines.
when california achieved statehood in 1850 hispanics served in many state and local offices.
increasingly however the original hispanic population found its status diminished and hispanics were often relegated to lower paving and less desirable jobs.
as they had done with native americans settlers from the east clashed with mexican americans over land.
across the region many hispanics lost their land to the new settlers.
mexican american claims to the land often dated back to spanish land grants.
these grants were hundreds of years old and defined the boundaries of property in vague terms.
when more than one person claimed ownership of a property american courts frequently held that the old land grants were insufficient proof of ownership.
this allowed others to stake claim to the property.
in some instances outright fraud was used to take land illegally from mexican americans.
the cattle boom of the 1870s and 1880s had a tremendous impact on hispanics in the southwest where many had long worked as vaqueros the spanish word for cowboys.
spanish vaqueros had a long history of sharing their techniques for managing cattle.
they shared methods of branding with florida cattlemen as far back in history as when florida was a spanish colony.
this interaction with american cowboys enriched the english language with such spanish words as hirint.
lasso and stampede.
in the mid 19th century most hispanics in the southwest lived on large haciendas where they worked in the fields or helped tend cattle.
critical th3nk8w6 identifying central ideas how might the change from being the majority to becoming the minority have affected hispanics in the southwest.
v clashes and compromises in the southwest with the increasing demand for beef in the eastern united states english speaking ranchers wanted to expand their herds and claimed large tracts of land of mexican origin.
in some cases the hispanic population fought back.
in new mexico residents of the town of las vegas were outraged when english speaking ranchers tried to fence in land that had long been used by the community to graze livestock.
in 1889 a group of hispanic new mexicans calling themselves las gorras blancas the white caps raided ranches owned by english speakers tore down their fences and burned their barns and houses.
attempts were made to call in federal troops to stop the raids but the president refused to send them.
the raids finally ended in 1891.
despite the influx of english speaking settlers hispanics in new mexico remained more influential in public affairs than did their counterparts in california and texas.
hispanics remained the majority both in population and in the territorial legislature.
in addition a hispanic frequently served as new mexicos territorial delegate to congress.
as more railroads were built in the 1880s and 1890s the population of the southwest continued to swell.
the region attracted not only americans and european immigrants from the east but also immigrants from mexico.
mexican immigrants worked mainly in agriculture and on the railroads.
in the growing cities of the southwest such as el paso albuquerque and los angeles hispanics settled in neighborhoods called barrios.
these neighborhoods had spanish speaking businesses and spanish language newspapers and they helped keep hispanic cultural and religious traditions alive.

you will often encounter thematic maps when studying history.
knowing how to read and create a thematic map will help you understand the information this type of map presents.
learning the skill a thematic map takes data about a region and puts it on a map using colors and symbols that show how the data connects to geographical features.
thematic maps usually portray information about the politics economy society culture climate or history of a geographic area.
a land use map is an example of a thematic map.
it uses colors and symbols to show things such as where crops are grown where mines are located or the population density.
another example is an historical map that uses symbols arrows and colors to show the routes followed by explorers or how borders change over time.
geographic features have to be included.
this decision is usually based on the patterns you want to show.
decide what symbols and colors best present the data.
should the symbols change size or color for different sets of data.
does the map need to show things changing over time.
prepare your map key carefully.
when reading a thematic map follow these steps read the title this will help you understand the map s theme location time period and type of data being shown.
read the map key thematic maps use symbols and colors to convey information.
sometimes the symbols change size to indicate if more or less of something exists at that point on the map.
study the map and draw conclusions look for patterns on the map.
they reveal how the data presented by the thematic symbols and colors relates to the geographic features.
when creating a thematic map follow these steps identify the data you want to present.

although life was difficult settlers discovered that they could grow wheat using new technologies.
by 1890 the land had been settled and cultivated and there was no longer a true frontier in the united states.
the beginnings of settlement guiding question what encouraged settlers to move wesf to the great plains.
the great plains is a vast region of prairie roughly west of the mississippi river and east of the rocky mountains in the united states and canada.
although the population of the great plains grew steadily after the civil war the settlers faced many challenges.
summer temperatures could top 100f.
prairie fires were a frequent danger.
sometimes swarms of grasshoppers destroyed crops.
winter brought terrible blizzards and extreme cold.
a settler who experienced the fierce winters wrote in her diary on march 12 1884 primary source c6 nobody can describe a blizzard.
there is one kind in which the snow sticks all over everything and another that is colder in which the snow drives with terrible force the sun shining above it.
this is the dakota boomer s exhilarating weather.
w from the checked years a bonanza farm diary 1884 1888 in this dry grassland trees grew naturally only along rivers and streams.
without trees to use as timber many settlers cut chunks of sod densely packed soil held together by grass roots to build their homes.
to obtain water they had to drill wells more than 100 feet deep and operate the pump by hand.

railroad companies sold land along the rail lines at low prices and provided credit to prospective settlers.
pamphlets and posters spread the news across europe and america that cheap land could be claimed by anyone willing to move.
in 1862 the government encouraged settlement on the great plains by passing the homestead act.
for a small registration fee an individual could file for a homestead a tract of public land available for settlement.
a homesteader could claim up to 160 acres of land and receive title to it after living there for five years.
the homestead act provided a legal metho for settlers to acquire clear title to property on the frontier.
with their property rights assured and the railroads providing lumber and supplies settlers began moving to the plains in large numbers.
g reading progress check analyzing what developments of the late 1800s attracted settlers to endure the hardships ofthe great plains.
technology and the wheat belt guiding question what new metho ds and technologies revolutionized agriculture and made it practical to cultivate the plains.
the harsh dry climate and densely packed soil ofthe great plains required new farming methods and technological innovations in order for settlement to begin.
one new farming method called dry farming was to plant seeds deep in the ground where there was enough moisture for them to grow.
by the 1860s plains farmers were using steel plows threshing machines seed drills and reapers.
these new machines made dry farming possible.
still soil on the plains could blow away during a dry season.
as the population grew the impact of the sodbusters as those who plowed the plains were called helped change the environment.
many farmers eventually lost their homesteads through the combined effects of drought wind erosion of the soil they had loosened and overuse ofthe land.
large landholders could buy mechanical reapers and steam tractors that made it easier to harvest a large crop.
threshing machines knocked kernels loose from the stalks.
mechanical binders tied the stalks into bundles for collection.
these innovations were well suited for harvesting wheat a crop that could endure the dry conditions of the plains.
during the 1880s many farmers from the states of the old northwest territory moved to the great plains to take advantage of the inexpensive land and new technology.
the wheat belt began at the eastern edge of the great plains and covered much of the dakotas and parts of nebraska and kansas.
the new machines allowed a family to bring in a substantial harvest on a wheat farm of several hundred acres.
some wheat farms covered up to 65 000 acres.
these were called bonanza farms because they yielded big profits.
like mine owners bonanza farmers formed companies invested in property and equipment and hired laborers as needed.
104 farmers fall on hard times the bountiful harvests in the wheat belt helped the united states become the worlds leading exporter of wheat by the 1880s.
then things began to go wrong.
a severe drought struck the plains in the late 1880s destroying crops and ruining the soil.
in addition competition from other wheat producing nations increased.
by the 1890s a glut of wheat on the world market caused prices to drop.
some farmers tried to make it through these difficult times by mortgaging their land that is they borrowed money from a bank based on the value of their land.
if they failed to meet their mortgage payments they forfeited the land to the bank.
some who lost their land continued to work it as tenant farmers renting the land from its new owners.
by 1900 tenants cultivated about one third of the farms on the plains.
technology helped make it possible to farm the vast open grasslands of america.
here horse drawn farm equipment is used to gather hay in the 1880s.
closing the frontier on april 22 1889 the government opened one of the last large territories for settlement.
within hours thousands of people raced to stake claims in an event known as the oklahoma land rush.
the next year the census bureau reported that there was no longer a true frontier left in america.
in reality there was still a lot of unoccupied land and the homestead act continued to encourage new settlement into the 1900s but the closing of the frontier marked the end of an era.
it worried many people including historian frederick jackson turner.
turner believed that the frontier had provided a safety valve of social discontent it was a place where americans could always make a fresh start.
most settlers did indeed make a fresh start adapting to the difficult environment of the plains.
water from their deep wells enabled them to plant trees and gardens.
railroads brought lumber and brick to replace sod as a building material coal for fuel and manufactured goods from the east such as clothes and household goods.
small scale farmers rarely became wealthy but they could be self sufficient.
typical homesteaders raised cattle chickens and a few crops.

statistics are collections of data.
they are often presented in charts and graphs and play an important role in inductive reasoning.
inductive reasoning is when we use evidence to make broad generalizations.
inductive reasoning does not prove something is true.
instead when you reach a conclusion through inductive reasoning you decide how probable or likely it is to be true.
inductive arguments can be strong or weak not right or wrong.
they help us make predictions and form hypotheses that we can test to see if they are true.
learning to interpret statistics improves inductive reasoning and helps us make better predictions.
learning the skill use the following steps to help you interpret statistical information scan the chart or graph reading the titles and labels to get an idea of what is being shown.
examine the statistics shown looking for increases and decreases similarities and differences.
look for a correlation.
when two pieces of data appear to be related we say there is a correlation between them.
in a positive correlation as one number rises the other number rises.
in a negative correlation as one number rises the other number falls.
for example the percentage of overweight people has increased since 1970.
at the same time the percentage of people living in the suburbs has also increased since 1970.
there is a positive correlation between these two numbers.
determine the conclusions you can draw.
a correlation does not imply causation.
just because two numbers appear to have a relationship does not mean the one set of data causes the other.
using the example above you might think being overweight makes you live in the suburbs.
but you have to ask whether that is probable.
in this case it seems more likely there are independent reasons causing both numbers to rise.
on the other hand using inductive reasoning teks 30c 31b we can create a hypothesis to explain the relationship.
for example living in the suburbs might mean people exercise less because they don t walk to work.
asa result they gain weight.
having used the statistics to create a hypothesis wecannoi use other means to check if it is true.

for centuries the great plains were home to many groups of native americans.
some lived in farming and hunting communities but many were nomads who roamed the land following their main source of food the buffalo.
the plains indian nations were divided into bands ranging from a few dozen to several hundred people who lived in extended family groups and respected nature.
the settlers who migrated to the plains deprived these native americans of their hunting grounds broke treaties that guaranteed them land and often forced them to relocate.
native americans resisted by attacking settlers property and occasionally going to war with them.
the dakota sioux uprising in 1862 the dakota people part of the sioux had a conflict with the settlers in minnesota.
the sioux had agreed to live on a reservation in exchange for annuities that frequently never reached them.
at the time many dakota lived in poverty and faced starvation.
when local traders refused to provide food on credit the dakota protested by launching a rebellion that killed hundreds of settlers.
a military tribunal sentenced more than 300 dakota to death after the uprising.
after reviewing the evidence however president lincoln reduced the number condemned to death to 38.
others fled the reservation when federal troops arrived and became exiles in a region that bore their name the dakota territory.

as the number of settlers increased bands of native americans began raiding wagon trains and ranches.
by the summer of 1864 dozens of homes had been burned and an estimated 200 settlers killed.
the governor persuaded the native americans to surrender at fort lyon where he promise food and protection.
those who failed to report would be subject to attack although a number of native americans surrendered many others did not.
in november 1864 chief black kettle brought several hundred cheyenne to the fort to negotiate a peace deal.
fort lyons commander major scott anthony allowed the chief to make camp at nearby sandcre while he awaited orders.
shortly afterward colonel john chivington oftl colorado volunteers attacked black kettles camp even though the cheyenne were there to negotiate.
what actually happened at sand creek is unclear.
some witnesses stated that black kettle had been flying both an american flag and a white flag of truce which chivington ignored.
others reported that the american troops fired on the unsuspecting native americans and then brutally murdered hundreds of women and children.
still others described a savage battle in which both sides fought ferociously for two days.

thetn of what happened at sand creek is still debated.
ensure to guarantee or make certain a doomed plan for peace as conflicts escalated with native americans congress took action.
in 1 congress formed an indian peace commission which proposed creating two large reservations on the plains one for the sioux and another for native americans of the southern plains.
federal agents would run the reservations and the army would deal with any groups that refused to report or remain there.
the indian peace commissions plan was doomed to failure.
althouj negotiators pressured native american leaders into signing treaties they could not ensure that those leaders or their followers would abide by th nor could anyone prevent settlers from violating their terms.

by the 1870s many native americans had left the reservations in disgust.
they preferred hunting buffalo on the open plains.
the buffalo were rapidly disappearing however as professional buffalo hunters sought hides for markets in the east and other hunters killed for sport.
when buffalo blocked rail traffic the railroads killed them and fed the meat to workers.
the army determined to force native americans onto reservations encouraged buffalo killing.
by 1889 very few buffalo remained.
battle of the little bighorn in 1876 prospectors overran the lakota sioux reservation in the dakota territory to mine gold in the black hills.
the lakota saw no reason to abide by a treaty that settlers were violating so many left the reservation to hunt near the bighorn mountains in montana.
the government responded by sending an expedition accompanied by lieutenant colonel george a custer and the seventh cavalry.
custer underestimated the fighting capabilities of the lakota and the cheyenne.
on june 25 1876 he launched an attack on one of the largest groups of native american warriors ever assembled on the great plains.
the native american forces rapidly defeated custer and his more than 200 soldiers killing them all.

he and his followers were then exiled to oklahoma.
tragedy at wounded knee native american resistance came to a final tragic end on the lakota sioux reservation in 1890.
defying government orders the lakota continued to perform the ghost dance a ritual that celebrated a hoped for day of reckoning when settlers would disappear the buffalo would return and native americans would be reunited with their dead ancestors.
federal authorities had banned the ceremony fearing it would lead to violence.
they blamed the latest defiance on sitting bull who had returnee from canada and sent police to arrest the chief.
sitting bulls supporters tried to stop the arrest.
in the exchange of gunfire that followed sitting bu was killed and a group of ghost dancers fled the reservation.

americanization and the dawes act some americans had long opposed the mistreatment of native americans.
in her 1881 book a century of dishonor helen hunt jackson detailed the years of broken promises and injustices.
her descriptions of events such as the sand creek massacre sparked new debate on the issue.
some americans believed the solution was americanization.
they thought that native americans should be encouraged to abandon their traditional tribal culture and assimilate into american society by learning english adopting anieric culture and values and eventually becoming american citizens.

1 analyzing according to the cartoon why was the bureau of indian affairs unable to help native americans.
2 making inferences why do you think schurz did not want the war department to regain control of indian affairs.
due to a cumbersome system of handling the administration of indian laws the agents of the bureau of indian affairs bia had many opportunities for personal enrichment and an invitation for large scale corruption.
secretary ofthe interior carl schurz attempted to cleanse the bia of corruption and prevent the war department from regaining management of indian affairs.
110 boarding schools separate from reservations.
by 1902 some 25 schools had been set up.
officials then pressured parents to send children to these schools.
there they were required to speak english choose an english name dress in american style clothes cut their hair to match american styles attend church and learn vocational skills.
over time the schools became controversial.
they were often underfunded and poorly maintained and discipline was strict.
some students found the schools repressive and many cases of abuse were reported.
a second americanization strategy was to encourage native americans to abandon the reservation system and become independent landowners.
in 1887 congress passed the dawes act which altered the reservation system by dividing reservation land into allotments for farming or ranching.
under the act 160 acres were allotted to each head of household 80 acres to each single adult and 40 acres to each child.
any land remaining after allotments would be sold to american settlers with the proceeds going into a trust for native americans.
citizenship would be granted to native americans who stayed on their allotments for 25 years.
while some native americans succeeded as farmers or ranchers many had little training or enthusiasm for either pursuit.
they often found their allotments too small to be profitable so they leased them.
in addition some native american groups had grown attached to their reservations and hated to see them divided into homesteads.
few stayed long enough to qualify for citizenship.
in the end the assimilation policy proved a dismal failure.
native american culture on the plains was doomed because it depended on buffalo for food clothing fuel and shelter.
when the herds were wiped out there was no way to sustain the traditional way of life.
although the dawes act failed in its goals american reformers continued to advocate for assimilation.
in the early 1900s reform groups such as the friends of the indians and the indian rights association began to push for citizenship for all native americans believing it would encourage greater assimilation.
finally in 1924 congress passed the citizenship act granting all native americans citizenship.
in 1934 the indian reorganization act reversed the dawes acts policy of assimilation.
it restored some reservation lands gave native americans control over those lands and permitted them to elect their own governments.

causes united states becomes an industrial nation c g u i di ng qli estion why was the united states successful at industrialization.
although the industrial revolution reached the united states in the early 1800s most americans still lived on arms when the cavil war began in 1861.
after the war industry rapidly expanded and millions of americans left their farms to work in mines and factories.
by the early 1900s the united states was the world s leading industrial nation.
its gross national product gnp the total value of all goods and services that a country produces during a year was roughly three times greater than it had been in the late 1860s.
natural resources an abundance of raw materials was one reason for the nation s industrial success.
the united states had vast natural resources including timber coal iron and copper.
this meant that american companies could obtain resources cheaply and did not have to impor them from other countries.
many of these resources were located in the american west.
the settlement of the west helped accelerate industrialization as did the transcontinental railroad.
railroads took settlers and miners to the west and carried resources back to the eas at the same time people began using a new resource petroleum.
even before the automotive age petroleum was in high demand becam it could be turned into kerosene.
the american oil industry was built on the demand for kerosene a fuel used in lanterns and stoves.
the industry began in western pennsylvania where residents had long noticed oil bubbling to the surface of area springs and streams.
in 1859 edwin drake drilled the first oil well near titusville pennsylvania and by 1900 oil fields had been drilled from pennsylvania to texas.
as oil production rose it fueled economic expansion.
118 a large workforce the human resources available to american industry were as important as natural resources in enabling the nation to industrialize rapidly.
between 1860 and 1910 the population ofthe united states nearly tripled.
this population growth provided industry with a large workforce and created greater demand for consumer goods.
population growth stemmed from two sources large families and a flood of immigrants.
because of better living conditions more children survived and grew to adulthood.
at the same time social and economic conditions in parts of europe and china convinced many people to immigrate to the united states in search of a better life.
between 1870 and 1910 more than 17 million immigrants arrived in the united states.

to invent new products and to improve products invented by others.
he first achieved international fame in 1877 with the invention of the phonograph.
two years later he perfected the electric generator and the light bulb.
his laboratory then went on to invent or improve several other devices including the battery and the motion picture.
in 1882 owen latimer who worked for edison invented a process for making cheap long lasting carbon filaments for light bulbs.
with this invention electric lighting became increasingly affordable.
in 1889 several edison companies merged to form the edison general electric company today known as ge.
the revolution in electricity took another step forward when engineer george westinghouse developed an alternating current ac system to distribute electricity over long distances using transformers and generators.
with this innovation electricity began to improve living standards rapidly.
city streets became safer as streetlights were installed.
electric trolley cars improved commute times to work and new electric devices in the home made domestic chores easier and less time consuming.
ac current and transformers are still used today to distribute electricity.
innovation using electricity also launched a revolution in communication in 1874 alexander graham bell began experimenting with ways to transmit sound via an electric current of varying intensity.
in 1876 he succeeded.
his device which became known as the telephone transformed communication and helped improve the nations standard of living f amily members could quickly get in touch with each other businesses could place orders much more quickly and news of events that might shape personal and business choices could be obtained in time for better decisions to be made.

a few years later in the early 1870s gustavus swift hired an engineer to develop a refrigerated railroad car.
swift shipped the first refrigerated load of fresh meat in 1877.
the widespread use of refrigerated shipping containers enabled fresh food especially meat to be shipped long distances.
as a result the price of food began to drop and the quality of food people could obtain year round rose dramatically.
the pace of innovation continued rapidly throughout the late 1800s.

power driven sewing machines and cloth cutters rapidly moved the clothing business from small tailor shops to large factories.
similar changes took place in shoemaking.
large factories began using new processes and inventions to mass produce shoes efficiently and inexpensively and could pass those savings on to their customers in the form of lower prices.
by the early 1900s tailors and cobblers had nearly disappeared.
prices of many other products also dropped as the united states industrialized.
h reading progress check evaluating which invention do you think has had the most lasting influence.
free enterprise guidingquestion howdid laissez faire economics promote industrialization.
another important reason the united states industrialized rapidly was the nations free enterprise system.
in the late 1800s the profit motive attracted many people of high ability and ambition into business.
entrepreneurs people who risk their capital in organizing and running a business believed they could make money in manufacturing and transportation.
many of the new inventions that transformed society would not have been possible without entrepreneurs willing to risk their money to help develop and implement their inventions.
many entrepreneurs from new england who had accumulated money by investing in trade fishing and textile mills invested their money in factories and railroads.
an equally important source of private capital was europe especially great britain.
foreign investors saw great opportunities for profit in the united states.
the benefits of laissez faire part of what attracted entrepreneurs to invest in american businesses was societys and governments support in principle for the idea of laissez faire leh say far a french phrase meaning let people do as they choose supporters of laissez faire believe that the government should not interfere in the economy other than to protect private property rights and maintain peace.
they argue that if the government regulates the economy it increases costs and eventually hurts society more than it helps.
laissez faire relies on supply and demand rather than the government to regulate wages and prices.
supporters believe a free market with competing companies leads to greater efficiency and creates more wealth for everyone.
laissez faire advocates also support low taxes and limited government debt to ensure that private individuals not the government will make most of the decisions about how the nations wealth is spent.
entrepreneur one who organizes manages and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise laissez faire a policy that government should interfere as little as possible in the nation s economy industrialization 121 practice to do something repeatedlyso it becomes the standard skills practice use a concept map to help you understand new vocabulary in this lesson.
write the word laissez faire in the center circle and write details and ideas about the word in the surrounding circles.
do the same with the term entrepreneur the government s relationship to business in many ways the united states practiced laissez faire economics in the 1 1800s.
state and federal governments kept taxes and spending low.
theyd not impose costly regulations on industry or try to control wages andprfc in the late 1800s the united states was also one of the largest free trade areas in the world.
unlike europe which was divided into dozens of countries each with tariffs the entire united states was open to trade.
th constitution bans states from imposing tariffs and there were few regulations on commerce or immigration.
supporters of laissez faire say these factors played a major role in the countrys rapid economic growth.
in other ways however the government went beyond laissez faire an introduced policies intended to promote business.
since the early 1800s leaders in the north and the south had different ideas about the proper ri of the government in the economy.
northern leaders wanted high tariffs i protect manufacturers from foreign competition and supported federal subsidies for companies building roads canals and railroads.
southern leaders opposed subsidies and favored low tariffs to promote trade and tc keep the cost of imported goods low.
the civil war ended the debate.
after the southern states seceded th republican controlled congress passed the morrill tariff greatly increasi tariff rates.
by 1865 tariffs had nearly tripled.
congress also gave vast tra of western land and nearly 65 million in loans to western railroads and public lands with mineral resources for much less than their market valu historians still debate whether these policies helped the economy grow.
high tariffs however contradicted laissez faire ideas.
when the nati raised tariffs on foreign goods other countries raised their tariffs on american goods.
this hurt american companies trying to sell goods abr particularly farmers who sold their products overseas.
despite these problems many business leaders and members ot congress believed tari were necessary.
few believed that new american industries could comp with established european factories without tariffs to protect them.

in 1865 the united states had about 35 000 miles of railroad track almost all of it east of the mississippi river.
after the civil war railroad construction expanded dramatically.
by 1900 the united states had more than 200 000 miles of track.
the transcontinental railroad the railroad boom began in 1862 with the pacific railway act.
this act gave two corporations the union pacific and the central pacific permission to build a transcontinental railroad.
it also offered each company land along its right of way.

by linking the nation rail increased the markets for many products spurring industrial growth.
railroad companies also stimulated the economy by spending huge amounts of money on steel coal timber and other materials.
large rail companies consolidated hundreds of small unconnected railroads to create large integrated railroad systems.
meanwhile new locomotive technology and the invention of air brakes enabled railroat put longer and heavier trains on their lines.

robber barons guiding question howdid government grants to build railroads result in large scale corruption.
the great wealth many railroad entrepreneurs acquired in the late 1800s led to accusations that they had built their fortunes by swindling investors and taxpayers bribing officials and cheating on their contracts and debts.
jay gould was perhaps the most notoriously corrupt railroad owner who practiced insider trading and manipulated stock prices.
bribery occurred frequently partly because government was so deeply entangled in funding the railroads.
railroad investors discovered they could make more money by selling free government land grants than by operating a railroad and some bribed political representatives to vote for more grants.

jay gould robber baron railroad owners became condemned as robber barons as the american public increasingly began to suspect them of bribery cheating and swindling.
the credit mobilier scandal corruption in the railroad industry became public in 1872 with the credit mobilier scandal.
credit mobilier was a construction company set up by several stockholders of the union pacific railroad including oakes ames a member of congress.

hill built the great northern railroad from wisconsin and minnesota to washington state without any federal land grants or subsidies.
he planned the railroads route to pass by existing towns in the region and offered low fares to settlers who homesteaded along his route.
he also identified products that were in demand in china including cotton textiles and flou and hauled those goods to washington to ship to asia.
this way his railroa efficiently hauled goods both east and west instead of simply sending good east and coming back empty like other railroads.

retailers began using new techniques to attract consumers.
the rise of big business guiding question what advantages do large corporations have over small businesses.
by 1900 big business dominated the economy operating vast complexes of factories and distribution facilities.
the corporation an organization owned by many people but treated by law as though it were a person made big business possible.
stockholders own corporations through shares of ownership called stock.
selling stock allows a corporation to raise money while spreading out the financial risk.
before the 1830s few corporations existed because entrepreneurs had to convince state legislatures to issue them charters.
in the 1830s however states began allowing companies to become corporations and issue stock without a charter from the legislature.
the freedom to form a corporation was one of the great benefits of the laissez faire approach to economics in the later half of the 1800s.
with the money raised from selling stock corporations could invest in new technologies hire large workforces and purchase machines.
this greatly increased their efficiency.
they achieved economies of scale in which the cost of manufacturing is decreased by producing goods quickly in large quantities.
all businesses have fixed costs and operating costs.
fixed costs are costs a company pays even if it is not operating loans mortgages and taxes.
operating costs are incurred when running a company wages shipping costs buying raw materials.
small manufacturers usually had low fixed costs but high operating costs.
if sales dropped it was cheaper to shut down temporarily.
big manufacturers however had the high fixed costs of building and maintaining a factory while operating costs were low.

in these circumstances big corporations had several advantages.
they could produce more goods at a lower cost and could stay open in bad economic times by cutting prices to increase sales.
rebates from the railroads further lowered their operating costs.
of course this also led eventually to one ofthe major costs of laissez faire economics small businesses many family owned that could not compete with large corporations were forced out of business.

cutting prices to beat the competition also cut into profits.
this situation demonstrated one ofthe potential costs of laissez faire.
with no regulations governing their competition companies were also free to make deals with each other to fix prices by organizing pools or agreements to keep prices at a certain level.
another term for a pool that is used today is cartel.
american courts and legislatures however were suspicious of pools because they interfered with competition and property rights.
as a result even though the laissez faire economy meant that companies could try to fi prices companies that formed pools found that it also meant they had no legal protection and could not enforce their pool agreements in court.
asa result pools generally broke apart whenever one member cut prices to steal types of business organizations.

andrew carnegie and steel the remarkable life of andrew carnegie illustrates the rise of big business in the united states.
a scottish immigrant carnegie went to work at age 12 in a textile factory.
he worked his way up to become secretary to thomas scott a superintendent of the pennsylvania railroad.
when scott was promoted carnegie became the new superintendent.
carnegie bought shares in iron mills and factories that made sleeping cars and railroad locomotives as well as a company that built railroad bridges.
by his early 30s he quit his job to concentrate on his investments.
as part of his business activities carnegie often traveled to europe.
on one trip he met sir henry bessemer who had invented a new process for making high quality steel efficiently and cheaply.
after meeting bessemer carnegie opened a steel mill in pittsburgh in 1875 and began using the bessemer process.

t primarysource two pounds of ironstone one pound and a half of coal mined manufactured into coke one half pound of lime and a small amount of manganese ore these four pounds of materials manufactured into one pound of steel for which the consumer pays one cent.
from triumphant democracy 1893 to make his company more efficient carnegie began the vertical integration of the steel industry.
a vertically integrated company owns all of the different businesses on which it depends for its operation.
instead of paying companies for coal lime and iron carnegies steel company bought coal mines limestone quarries and iron ore fields.
vertical integration saved money and enabled many companies to expand.
rockefeller and standard oil successful business leaders also pushed for horizontal integration or combining many firms engaged in the same type of business into one large industrialization 129 monopoly total control of a type of industry by one person or one company corporation.
horizontal integration took place frequently as companies competed.
when a company began to lose market share it would often sell out to competitors to create a larger organization.
perhaps the most famous example of an industrialist who achieved almo complete horizontal integration of his industry is john d rockefeller.
through a series of buyouts rockefellers standard oil began to horizontally integrate the oil industry.
by 1880 the company controlled about 90 percent ofthe oil refining industry in the united states.
when a single company.
vi i morkot it becomes a monopoly.
trust a combination of firms or corporations formed by a legal agreement especially to reduce competition holding company a company whose primary business is owning a controlling share of stock in other companies new business organizations many americans feared monopolies because they believed that a monopol could charge whatever it wanted for its products.
they argued that one of the costs of laissez faire economics was that it created large powerful corporations that could control prices and manipulate politicians and laws to ensure that they did not face any new competition.
supporters of laissez faire disagreed.
they asserted that monopolies ha to keep prices low because raising prices would allow competitors to reappear and offer products at a lower price.
in some industries even though a company had a near monopoly in the united states it was not really a monopoly because it was competing on a global scale.
standard oi for example came very close to having a monopoly in the united states bi it was competing against european oil companies and the competition forced the company to keep its prices low in the late 1800s and early 1900s trusts in the late 1800s in an effort to stop horizontal integration and the ris of monopolies many states made it illegal for one company to own stock in another company.
it did not take long however for companies to find ways around the laws.
in 1882 standard oil formed the first trust a new way of merging businesses that did not violate the law.
a trust is a legal arrangement that allows one person to manage another persons property.
the person who manages that property is called a trustee.
instead of buying a company outright standard oi 1 had stockholders give their stocks to a group of standard oil trustees.
in exchange the stockholders received shares in the trust which entitled them to a portion the trusts profits.
since the trustees did not own the stock but were merely managing it they were not violating any laws.
the trustees could control a group of companies as if they were one large merged company.
holding companies in 1889 the state of new jersey further accelerated the rise of big business with a new incorporation law.
this law allowed corporatioi set up in new jersey to own stock in other businesses.
many companies immediately used the law to create holding companies.
a holding company does not produce anything.
instead it owns the stock of companies that do produce goods.
the holding company manages the companies it owns effectively merging them into one large enterprise.
investment banking another increase in the size of corporations began in the 1890s when investment bankers began helping to create holding compank investment bankers specialized in helping companies issue stock.
companies would sell large blocks of stock to investment bankers at a discount.
the bankers would then find the investors and sell the stock for a profit.
perhaps th most successful investment banker was j p morgan.
in the mid 1890s investment bankers began merging many of america arge corporations into holding companies and then selling their stock.
in 1901 j p morgan bought out andrew carnegie.
he then merged carnegie steel with other large steel companies into an enormous holding company called the united states steel company.
u s steel was worth 1 4 billion the first billion dollar company in american history.
seiling the product the creation of giant manufacturing companies in the united states pushed retailers to expand in size as well.
the vast array of products that american industries produced led retailers to look for new ways to attract consumers.
n w ayer and son the first advertising company began creating large illustrated ads instead of relying on the old small print line ads previously used in newspapers.
by 1900 retailers were spending over 90 million a year on advertising in newspapers and magazines.
advertising attracted readers to the newest retail business the department store.
in 1877 advertisements billed john wanamaker s new philadelphia department store the grand depot as the largest space in the world devoted to retail selling on a single floor when it opened only a handful of department stores existed in the united states.

1877 working in the united states why did workers try to form unions in the late 1800s.
there were many benefits of laissez faire economics in the late 1800s including rapid industrialization dramatic innovation and improving standard of living but the laissez faire idea that governments should avoid regulating the economy had costs as we working conditions in factories and mines were difficult and ofter dangerous.
many workers performed dull repetitive tasks in dangerous unhealthy working conditions.
workers breathed in lir dust and toxic fumes.
heavy machines lacking safety devices led t injuries.
with no regulations governing workplace safety or trainii requirements workers had no recourse when they were poorly treated other than to quit and look for a new job.
despite these conditions industrialism led to a dramatic rise i the standard of living.
the average workers wages rose by 50 perc between 1860 and 1890.
nevertheless the uneven division of incc between the wealthy and the working class caused resentment am workers.
in 1900 the average industrial worker made 22c per hou and worked 59 hours per week.
deflation or a rise in the value of money added to tensions.
between 1865 and 1897 deflation caused prices to fall which increa the buying power of workers wages.
although companies cut wages regularly in the late 1800s prices fell even faster so that wages were actually still going up in buying power.
workers however resented getting less money.
eventually many concluded that they needed a union to bargain for higher wages and better working conditions.
i early unions there were two basic types of industrial workers in the united states in the 1800s craft workers and common laborers.
craft workers such as machinists iron molders stonecutters shoemakers and printers had special skills and training.
they received higher wages and had more control over their time.
common laborers had few skills and received lower wages.
in the 1830s as industrialization began to spread craft workers began to form trade unions.
by 1873 there were 30 national trade unions in the united states.
among the largest and most successful were the iron molders international union the international typographical union and the knights of st crispin the shoemakers union.

employers however generally viewed unions as conspiracies that interfered with property rights.
business leaders particularly opposed industrial unions which united all the workers in a particular industry.
companies used several techniques to stop workers from forming unions.
they required workers to take oaths or sign contracts promising not to join a union.
they hired detectives to identify union organizers.
workers who tried to organize a union or strike were fired and placed on a blacklist a list of troublemakers so that no company would hire them.
companies used lockouts to break up existing unions.
they locked workers out of the property and refused to pay them.
if the union called a strike employers would hire replacements or strikebreakers.
efforts to break unions often succeeded because there were no laws giving deflation a decline in the volume of available money or credit that results in lower prices and therefore increases the buying power of money industrial union an organization of common laborers and craft workers in a particular industry lockout a company tool to fight union demands by refusing to allow employees to enter its facilities to work workers the right to form unions or requiring owners to negotiate with them.
government policies toward unions did not really reflect a commitment to laissez faire economics.
instead of staying out of economic disputes and allowing workers to confront owners and work out their disagreements on their own the governments relationship toward business shifted toward policies that supported business owners and impeded the development of unions.
courts frequently ruled that strikes were conspiracies in restraint of trade for which and labor leaders were often fined or jailed.
eventually even state militias and federal troops would be used to break up strikes.
restraint the act of limiting restricting or keeping under control annual nonfarm earnings real wages mi not adjusted for inflation source historical statistics ofthe united states colonial times to 1970 in the late 1800s industrial workers toiled in dangerous unhealthy conditions.
bad working conditions eventually led workers to seek to organize unions hoping to improve their situations.
hi comparing and contrasting how did changes in real wages and wages that were not adjusted for deflation differ.
fjs drawing conclusions why do you think workers wanted to organize.
6 o industrialization 133 part ofthe reason for the governments objection to unions and collective action by workers was the perception that unions were un american.
in the 1800s the ideas of karl nlarx called bdarxism became very influential in europe.
marx argued that the basic force shaping capitalist society was the class struggle between workers and owners.
he believed that workers would eventually revolt seize control of the factorie and overthrow the government.
eventually marx thought the state would disappear leaving a communist society where classes did not exist.
while many labor supporters agreed with marx a few supported anarchism.
anarchists believe that society does not need any government.
in the late 1800s anarchists assassinated government officials and setoff bombs across europe hoping to begin a revolution.
during the same period tens of thousands of european immigrants headed to america.
anti immigrant feelings were already strong in the united states and as people began to associate immigrant workers with radical ideas they became suspicious of unions.
these fears and concerns for law and order often led officials to use the courts the police and even the army to crush strikes and break up unions.

places and regions what region ofthe country seems to have had the fewest strikes.

struggling to organize guidingquestion what made it difficult for union workers to create large industrial unions.
although workers attempted on many occasions to create large industrial unions they rarely succeeded.
in many cases the confrontations with owners and the government led to violence and bloodshed.
the great railroad strike the panic of 1873 was a severe recession that struck the american economy and forced many companies to cut wages.
the economy had still not recovered when in july 1877 the baltimore and ohio railroad announced it was cutting wages for the third time.
in martinsburg west virginia workers walked off the job and blocked the tracks.
as word spread railroad workers across the country walked off the job.
the strike eventually involved some 80 000 railroad workers and affected two thirds of the nations railways.
angry strikers smashed equipment tore up tracks and blocked rail service in new york city baltimore pittsburgh st louis and chicago.
the governors of several states called out their militias.
in many places gun battles erupted between the militia and the strikers.
declaring a state of insurrection president rutherford b hayes sent federal troops to martinsburg baltimore pittsburgh and elsewhere.
it took 12 bloody days for police state militias and federal troops to restore order.
by the time the strike collapsed more than 100 people lay dead and over 10 million in railroad property had been destroyed.
the violence of this strike alarmed many americans and only further contributed to the idea that allowing workers to organize was dangerous to society.
the knights of labor the knights of labor founded in 1869 took a different approach to labor issues.
its leader terence powderly opposed strikes in favor of boycotts and arbitration in which a third party helps workers and employers reach an agreement.
unlike other unions the knights welcomed women and african americans.
they called for an eight hour workday equal pay for women no child labor and worker owned factories.
the haymarket riot in 1886 supporters of the eight hour workday called for a nationwide strike on may 1.
on may 3 chicago police intervening in a fight on a picket line opened fire on the strikers killing four.
the next day about 3 000 people gathered to protest the shootings in chicagos haymarket square.
someone threw a bomb police opened fire and workers shot back injuring about 170 people and killing 10 policemen.
eight men were arrested for the bombing.
though evidence against them was weak public anger resulted in eight convictions.
four were executed.
union critics used the haymarket riot to claim that dangerous radicals dominated the unions.
one of the men arrested was a member of the knights of labor.
the blow to the knights reputation along with lost strikes led to a decline in their membership and influence.
the homestead and pullman strikes in the summer of 1892 another labor dispute led to bloodshed.
a steel mill owned by andrew carnegie in homestead pennsylvania was managed by henry clay frick an anti union business partner.
frick proposed cutting wages by 20 percent.
he then locked out employees who were members of the amalgamated association of iron steel and tin workers and had the 1 pinkerton detective agency bring in replacements.
when the pinkertons i and strikebreakers approached the plant the strikers resisted.

the governor of pennsylvania sent in the militia to protect the strikebreakers and four months later the strike collapsed.
in 1894 the pullman palace car company slashed workers wages without lowering rents and prices in the company town.
american railway union aru workers refused to handle pullman cars and railroads around to a near halt.
railroad managers arranged to have u s mail cars attached to the pullman cars and president cleveland sent in federal troops to keep the mail running.
a federal court then issued an injunction or formal order to halt the boycott.
both the strike and the aru collapsed.
the supreme court later upheld the right to issue such an injunction.
this gave business a powerful tool for dealing with labor unrest.
a identifying central ideas how did major strikes prevent large industrial unions from maintaining power and influence.
new unions emerge how were the new industrial unions different from the older trade unions.
although workers often shared the same complaints about wages and working hours unions took different approaches to how they tried to improve workers lives.
trade unions remained the most common type of labor organization but unskilled workers were not represented by trade unions.
new types of unions emerged to support these workers.
samuel gompers concentrated his efforts on improving working conditions and believed that a just society was built on a fair labor policy.
drawing conclusions how do you think gompers would view a society that did not allow labor unions.
the rise of the afl the american federation of labor afl was the dominant labor organization of the late 1800s.
in 1886 leaders of several national trade un created the afl.
it focused on promoting the interests of skilled workers.
samuel gompers was the first president of the afl a position heh almost continuously until 1924.
while other unions became involved ir politics gompers tried to concentrate on pure and simple unionism focusing on wages working hours and working conditions.
he was willing to use strikes to create change but preferred to negotiate.
the afl had three main goals.
first it tried to convince companies recognize unions and agree to collective bargaining.
second it pushed closed shops meaning that companies could hire only union member third it promoted an eight hour workday.
by 1900 the afl was the b union in the country with more than 500 000 members.
still at that ti the afl represented less than 15 percent of all nonfarm workers.

women and organized labor after the civil war the number of female wage earners began to increase.
by 1900 women made up more than 18 percent ofthe labor force.
the types of jobs women did outside the home reflected societys ideas about what constituted womens work about one third of women wage earners worked as domestic servants.
another third worked as teachers nurses sales clerks and office clerical workers.
the remaining third were industrial workers often in the garment industry or food processing plants.
women were paid less than men even when they performed the same jobs.
it was assumed that a woman had a man helping support her and that a man needed higher wages in order to support a family.
most unions excluded women.
one of the most famous labor leaders of the era was mary harris jones also known as mother jones jones worked as a labor organizer for the knights of labor before helping organize mine workers.
her public speaking abilities made her a very successful organizer leading john d rockefeller to dub her the most dangerous woman in america in 1900 jewish and italian immigrants who worked in the clothing business in new york city founded the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu which represented female and male workers in the womens clothing industry.
membership expanded rapidly and in 1909 a strike of some 30 000 garment workers won the ilgwu recognition in the industry better wages and benefits for employees.
in 1903 mary kenney osullivan and leonora oreilly decided to establish a separate union for women.

man came because they were poor and american industries had plenty jobs available or because they had special skills.
europes industria cities however also offered plenty of jobs so economic factors do not entirely explain why people migrated.
many immigrants came to the united states not just to find work but to escape the restrictions of social class in europe that kept them trapped at the bottom of society.

this period of immigration is known as new immigration.
the old immigration which occurred before 1890 had been primarily of people from northern and western europe.
this wave of immigrants changed the culture of americas cities and the demographics of its workforce.
although every immigrant group had some of its members working in every type of job and profession available certain patterns emerged.

many germans also moved to texas to become farmers.
large numbers o irish settled in the northeast and upper midwest and they were the large ethnic group in boston.
the wave of immigration in the late 1800s also brought about a cultui shift in american religion.
in 1850 catholics were only five percent ofthe population.
by the early 1900s they made up 17 percent of the total and had become the single largest religious denomination in the country.
whi there had been catholics in america from the earliest days when lord baltimore founded maryland colony as a refuge for english catholics american culture had been overwhelmingly protestant in its outlook and religious perspective.

by the late 1800s it was focused mainly on asians jews and eastern europeans.
nativists opposed immigration for many reasons.
some feared that the influx of catholics from countries such as ireland italy and poland would swamp the mostly protestant united states.
many labor unions argued that immigrants undermined american workers because they would work for low wages and accept jobs as strikebreakers.
nativists organize increased feelings of nativism led to the founding of two major antiimmigrant organizations.
the american protective association founded by henry bowers in iowa in 1887 was an anti catholic organization.
its members vowed not to hire or vote for catholics and the organization lobbied for restrictions of catholic immigration to the united states.
the apa built a large following in the midwest and northeast of the united states.
on the west coast where sentiment against the chinese was very strong widespread racial violence erupted.
denis kearney an irish immigrant formed the workingmans party of california to fight chinese immigration.
the party won seats in the california legislature and made opposition to chinese immigration a national issue.
congress passes new immigration laws opposition to immigration led congress to pass several laws designed to limit the massive number of immigrants arriving in the united states.
most of these were vetoed by the presidents of the era.

urban america 147 the immigration act of 1882 imposed a head tax of 50 cents on each immigrant who arrived by ship at a united states port.
the law also gave immigration officials the authority to reject immigrants who had a crimir record were mentally disabled or who were unable to take care of themselves without becoming a public charge for most of american history the borders had been open and virtual anyone who could get to the united states could settle there.
state andlo governments controlled the ports and border crossings.
the immigration act of 1882 began federal oversight of immigration and gave responsibilit to the treasury department to issue regulations hire immigration agents and build inspection stations.
one of the purposes of the head tax was to pay for the cost of the agents and offices needed to inspect immigrants.
t law triggered a debate in american politics over the correct policies and regulations to adopt toward immigrants.
the debate has continued to the present day.
immigrant optimism despite the difficulties of the journey the challenges of finding work anc the anger of nativists many immigrants to the united states remained optimistic in part because of what they were fleeing from and in part because of what they discovered upon arriving.
although many americai were poor and faced very difficult lives there was no widespread famine war or rebellion unlike parts of china and europe.
there was no rigid d system.
immigrants understood that even though they were poor theycc attempt to improve their position in life and were not permanently trappi because of the class into which they were born.
in addition wages wereh as compared to much of the world jobs were plentiful even if difficult ar sometimes demeaning and there remained a lot of cheap land on the gre plains for those wishing to strike out on their own.
in short there was an opportunity to be free that many immigrants had never experienced befo and it created both optimism and a sense of possibility.

how is urban li it matters because native born americans and immigrants were drawn to cities by the jobs available in america s growing industries.
the new modern cities developed skyscrapers public transportation systems and neighborhoods divided by social class.
in many cities political machines controlled city government.
americans migrate to the cities guidingquestion howdoyou think life in big cities was different from life on farms and in small towns.
most of the immigrants who arrived in the united states in the late 1800s lacked both the money to buy farms and the education to obtain higher paying jobs.
thus they settled in the nations growing cities and took jobs in the rapidly expanding factories of the united states.
at the same time rural americans also began moving to the cities.
farmers moved to cities because urban areas offered betterpaying jobs than did rural areas.
many young men and women growing up on farms in the east where cheap land was no longer available preferred to build a life in the cities instead of becoming settlers on the distant plains.
cities had much to offer too electric lights running water modern plumbing plus attractions such as museums libraries and theaters.
as a result after the civil war the united states steadily change from a rural nation to an urban one.
new york city which had mor than 800 000 inhabitants in 1860 grew to almost 3 5 million by 190 during the same period chicago swelled from some 109 000 residents to more than 1 6 million.
the united states had only 131 cities with populations of 2 500 or more residents in 1840 by 1900 there were more than 1 700 such urban areas.
by 1920 more americans lived in urban areas than rural areas.
as city populations grew the rising value of land provided an incentive to try new strategies of urban development.
some businessmen built upward rather than outward.
tall steel frame 152 buildings called skyscrapers began to appear.
to move people around cities quickly various kinds of mass transit developed.
at first almost all cities relied on the horsecar a railroad car pulled by horses.
in 1890 horsecars moved about 70 percent of urban traffic in the united states.
more than 20 cities beginning with san francisco in 1873 installed cable cars which were pulled along tracks by underground cables.
then in 1887 engineer frank j sprague developed the electric trolley car.
the countrys first electric trolley line opened the following year in richmond virginia.
in the largest cities congestion became a severe problem.
chicago responded by building an elevated railroad while boston followed by new york built the first subway systems.
g reading progress check summarizing what attracted people to cities in the 1800s.
separation by class guiding question how did the living conditions of the urban working class differ from those of other social classes.
in the growing cities the upper middle and working classes lived in separate and distinct parts of town.
the boundaries between neighborhoods can still be seen in many american cities today.
during the last half of the 1800s the wealthiest families established fashionable districts in the heart of a city.
as their homes grew larger wealthy women increasingly relied on more servants such as cooks maids butlers nannies and chauffeurs and spent a great deal of money on social activities.
in an age in which many new yorkers lived on 500 a year socialite cornelia sherman martin spent 360 000 on a dance.
american industrialization expanded the middle class which included doctors lawyers engineers managers social workers architects and teachers.
many middle class people moved away from the central city to escape the crime and pollution and to be able to afford larger homes.
some used new commuter rail lines to move to streetcar suburbs in the late 1800s wealthier families had at least one live in servant.
this gave the woman of the house more time to pursue activities outside the home including womens clubs at first these clubs focused on social and educational activities but over time club women became active in charitable and reform activities.
in chicago for example the womens club helped establish juvenile courts and exposed the terrible conditions at the cook county insane asylum.
few families in the urban working class could hope to own a home.
most spent their lives in crowded tenements or multifamily apartment buildings.
the first tenement in the united states was built in 1839.
in new before the mid 1800s few buildings exceeded four or five stories.
to make wooden and stone buildings taller required thick lower walls.

historians later adopted the term and applied it to the era in american history that began about 1870 and ended around 1900.
the era was in many ways a time ot marvels.
amazing new inventions led to rapid industrial growth.
cities grew in size and people thronged the crowded streets.
wealthy entrepreneurs built spectacular mansions.
skyscrapers reached to the sky and electric lights banished the darkness.
by calling this era the gilded age twain and warner were sounding an alarm.
something is gilded if it is covered with gold on the outside but made of cheaper material inside.
a gilded age might appear to sparkle but critics pointed to corruption poverty crime and great disparities in wealth between the rich and the poor.
whether the era was golden or merely gilded it was certainly a time of great cultural activity.
industrialism and urbanization altered the way americans looked at themselves and their society and these changes gave rise to new values new art and new entertainment.
the idea of individualism one ofthe strongest beliefs of the era and one that remains stron today was the idea of individualism.
many americans firmly believed that no matter how humble their origins americans coub rise in society and go as far as their talents and commitment woul ta e them.
no one expressed the idea of individualism better than 156 horatio alger who wrote more than 100 rags to riches novels.
in his books a poor person goes to the big city and through a combination of hard work and luck becomes successful.
even though such dramatic jumps upward in social standing were not commonplace algers popular books convinced many young people that no matter how many obstacles they faced success was possible.
social darwinism another powerful idea of the era was social darwinism.
this philosophy loosely derived from charles darwins theories strongly reinforced the idea of individualism.
herbert spencer british philosopher herbert spencer applied darwins theory of evolution and natural selection to human society.
in his 1859 book on the origin of species by means of natural selection darwin argued that plant and animal life had evolved over millions of years by a process he called natural selection.
in this process those species that cannot adapt to the environment in which they live gradually die out while those that do adapt thrive and live on.
spencer used this theory to argue that human society also evolved through competition and natural selection.
he said that society became better because only the fittest people survived.
spencer and others such as american scholar william graham sumner became known as social darwinists and their ideas as social darwinism.
survival of the fittest became the catchphrase of their philosophy.
some industrial leaders used social darwinism to justify their support of laissez faire capitalism.
this economic doctrine opposed any government programs that interfered with business.
darwinism and the church many devout christians found darwins conclusions offensive.
they rejected the theory of evolution because they believed it contradicted the bibles account of creation.
some clergy however concluded that evolution might have been gods way of creating the world.
one of the most famous ministers of the era henry ward beecher called himself a christian evolutionist carnegie s gospel of wealth andrew carnegie advocated a gentler version of social darwinism that he called the gospel of wealth.
this philosophy held that wealthy americans should engage in philanthropy using their fortunes to create the conditions that would help people help themselves.
building schools and hospitals for example was better than giving handouts to the poor.
carnegie funded the creation of public libraries in cities across the nation because libraries provide the information people needed to get ahead in life.
herbert spencer.
1820 1903 herbert spencer was a philosopher 1 who wrote about survival of the fittest several years before darwin s origin of species was i published.
in his major series synthetic philosophy spencer tried j to apply his beliefs about evolution to a variety of social sciences.
he believed that both philosophy and science created an ordered system j that supported human progress.
critical thinking drawing conclusions why might spencer s ideas have seemed controversial at the time they were written.

those worthy of assistance except in rare cases seldom require assistance.
the really valuable men of the race never do except in cases of accident or sudden change.

the tremendous changes that industrialism and urbanization brought triggered a debate over how best to address society s problems.
some americans embraced the ideas of individualism and social darwinism.
others disagreed arguing that societys problems could be fixed only if americans and their government began to take a more active role in regulating the economy and helping those in need.
challenging social darwinism in 1880 journalist henry george published progress and poverty a discussion of the american economy that quickly became a national best seller.
george observed the present century has been marked by a prodigious increase in wealth producing power this should he asserted have made poverty a thing of the past instead he claimed the gull between the employed and the employer is growing wider social contras are becoming sharper in other words laissez faire economics was niakii society worse not better.
most economists now argue that georges analysis was hawed.
industrialism did make some americans very wealthy but it also improvi the standard of living for most others as well.
at the time however americans in the midst of poverty did not see improvement.
georges ide spurred reformers to challenge social darwinism.
a young newsboy sells papers on a street corner in 1910.
lester frank ward in 1883 lester frank ward published dynamic sociology in which he argued that humans were different from animals because they had the ability to make plans to produce the future outcomes they desired.
wards ideas came to be known as reform darwinism.
people he insisted had succeeded in the world because of their ability to cooperate.
government he argued could regulate the economy cure poverty and promote education more efficiently than competition in the marketplace could.
looking backward writer edward bellamy promoted another altern to social darwinism and laissez faire economics.
in 1888 he published looking backward a novel about a man who falls asleep in 1887 and awakens in the year 2000 to find that the nation has become a perfect society with no crime poverty or politics.
in this fictional society the government owns all industry and shares the wealth equally with all mencans.
bellamys ideas were essentially a form of socialism.
naturalism in literature criticism of industrial society also appean chai.
ure style of writing known as naturalism.
naturalists failed i ff cia darwinism by suggesting that some peoj could no ceo ly use hey were.
in circumstances the among the most prominent naturalist writers were stephen crane jack london and theodore dreiser.
stephen cranes novel maggie a girl of the streets 1893 told the story of a girls descent into prostitution and death.
jack londons tales of the alaskan wilderness demonstrated the power of nature over civilization.
theodore dreisers novels such as sister carrie 1900 painted a world where people sinned without punishment and where the pursuit of wealth and power often destroyed their character.
naturalist literature drew peoples attention to the issues and problems facing american society as a result of rapid industrialization and urbanization issues such as poverty violence safety disease and isolation.
the literature had a positive impact in that it encouraged readers to look at social problems.
it encouraged some people to become reformers and to try to help the less fortunate.
but the literature also had a negative impact.
by downplaying heroism and the ability of people to make a difference in their life it discouraged people from taking action and encouraged envy and resentment toward people of different social classes.
naturalism also implicitly asked readers to consider whether individualism and laissez faire was leading to the best possible society.
so it was not surprising that readers of naturalist literature might conclude that the way to make things better was by government intervention.
whether that was a positive or negative impact of the literature depended on whether a person thought an increased government role in society and the economy was a good idea.
helping the urban poor the plight of the urban poor prompted some reformers to find new ways to help.
the social gospel movement worked to better conditions in cities according to the biblical ideals of charity and justice.
washington gladden a minister was an early advocate who popularized the movement in writings such as applied christianity 1887.
walter rauschenbusch a baptist minister from new york became the leading voice in the social gospel movement.
the church he argued must demand protection for the moral safety of the people the social gospel movement inspired many churches to build gyms provide social programs and child care and help the poor.
the salvation army and the young mens christian association ymca also combined faith and an interest in reform.
the salvation army offered practical aid and religious counseling to the urban poor.
the ymca tried to help industrial workers and the urban poor by organizing bible studies citizenship training and group activities.
the ymca also provided low cost boarding houses for young men.
the head of the chicago ymca dwight l moody was a gifted preacher whose revival meetings drew thousands of people.
moody rejected both the social gospel movement and social darwinism.
he believed the way to help the poor was not by providing them with services but by redeeming their souls and reforming their character.
the settlement house movement began as an offshoot of the social gospel movement.
in the late 1800s idealistic reformers including many college educated women established settlement houses in poor often heavily immigrant neighborhoods.
the reformers lived in these settlement houses which were community centers offering everything from medical care and english classes to kindergartens and recreational programs.
jane addams opened hull house in chicago in 1889.
jewish reformer lillian wald founded the henry street settlement in new york city.

the number ol children attending school rose from 7 562 000 in 1870 to 15 503 000 in 1900.
pub schools were often crucial to the success of immigrant children.
at schoi they were taught english and learned about american history and cultu a process known as americanization.
schools also tried to instill discipline.
grammar schools divided students into grades and drilled them in punctuality neatness and efficiency necessary habits for the workplace.

realism in art literature a new movement in art and literature called realism began in the 1800s arwm tried to explain the natural world scientifically artists and wi ned to portray the world realistically.
realist artists did not generally 160 choose heroic or historical topics.
nor did they try to idealize people as romantic artists had done.
instead they painted ordinary people doing ordinary things.
among the best known of the realist painters are john singer sargent and thomas eakins.
much of the work they did was portraiture formal paintings in realistic detail of people posing for the artist.
eakins however was also known for paintings that depicted people in action.
he painted men rowing athletes playing baseball a family out for a carriage ride doctors performing surgery and scientists in action in their laboratories.
the realist style captured many of the characteristics of the era such as clothing styles social relationships the differences between the social classes and the way people looked doing ordinary things in life.
writers also attempted to capture the world as they saw it.
in several novels william dean howells presented realistic descriptions of american life.
for example his novel the rise of silas lapham 1885 described the attempts of a self made man to enter boston society.
also an influential literary critic howells was the first to declare mark twain an incomparable american genius.
twain whose real name was samuel clemens published his masterpiece adventures of huckleberry finn in 1884.
in this novel the title character and his friend jim who has escaped from slavery float down the mississippi river on a raft.
twain wrote in local dialect with a lively sense of humor.
through the innocent eyes of his characters who question right and wrong in american society as they encounter it twain gave readers a humorous yet critical account of racism violence and poverty in the nation.
popular culture popular culture changed considerably in the late 1800s.
industrialization improved the standard of living for many people enabling them to spend money on entertainment and recreation.
increasingly urban americans divided their lives into separate units that of work and that of home.
people began going out to public entertainment.
in cities saloons often outnumbered groceries.
as a place for social gathering saloons played a major role in the lives of male workers.
saloons with his book adventures of huckleberry finn mark twain had written a true american novel.

they even offered the first free lunch salty food that made patrons thirsty and eager to drink more.
saloons also served as political centers and saloonkeepers were often key figures in political machines.
working class families and single adults could find entertainment at new amusement parks such as new york citys coney island.
amusements such as water slides and railroad rides cost only a nickel or dime.

tin pan alley people also enjoyed comic theater and music.

like urban america 161 vaudeville ragtime music echoed the hectic pace of city life.
its syncopate rhythms grew out of the music of riverside honky tonks saloon pianists and banjo players using the patterns of african american music.
scott joplin one ofthe most important african american ragtime composers became known as the king of ragtime.
he wrote his most famous piece the maple leaf rag in 1899.
from the early 1880s to the late 1930s the music industry in america was centered in new york city.
the part of the city where many music publishers and songwriters were located became known as tin pan alley.
the name is thought to have come from a sarcastic description of the sou of many pianos playing different ragtime songs all at once that it soundi like tin pans banging together.
tin pan alley musicians and publishers m most of their money by selling sheet music.
very few people owned phonographs in the 1880s and 1890s but many homes had pianos banjos and other instruments and people would play popular songs for themseh and their families.
musicians known as pluggers put on performances tc advertise songs and get people to buy the sheet music.
the negative impact of tin pan alley especially in its early years wa that it also continued to promote racial stereotypes.
much of tin pan au style and sound derived from african american songs and music but wit themes and content that appealed to white americans.
a portion of the music published especially in the 1880s and 1890s included racial jokes ideas that probably played a role in sustaining the racism of the era and t social separation of whites and african americans.

up until the 1880s most jobs in the federal government were subject to the spoils system.
after candidates won election and took office they fired all of the people who worked for the government and gave the jobs to people who had supported their election.
this practice of rewarding political supporters with government jobs is known as patronage.
supporters of patronage claimed it was necessary to ensure that government workers stayed loyal to the elected representatives of the people.
but after the civil war many americans came to believe patronage made the government inefficient and corrupt.
civil service reforms when rutherford b hayes became president in 1877 he tried to end patronage by firing officials who had been given jobs because of their support of the party and replacing them with reformers.
his actions split the republican party between stalwarts who supported patronage halfbreeds who backed some reform and reformers.
no reforms were passed.
in 1880 the republicans nominated james garfield a halfbreed for president and chester a arthur a stalwart for vice president.
despite the feud over patronage the republicans managed to win the election.
a few months later president garfield was assassinated by a man angry that he had not been given a government job.

cleveland was a reformer with a reputation for honest the republicans nominated james g blaine a former speaker of the house rumored to have accepted bribes.
some republicans were so unhappy with blaine that they supported cleveland.
cleveland narrowly won the election and then he faced supporters who expected him to reward them with jobs.

debating economic policy by the 1880s the american people had become increasingly concerned ab the power of large corporations fearful they were controlling prices and wages and corrupting the government.
small businesses and farmers had become particularly angry at the railroads.
while large corporations could negotiate rebates and lower rates because of the volume of goods they shipped others were forced to pay much highe rates.
eventually many states passed laws regulating railro rates.
in 1886 the supreme court ruled in the case of wab st louis and pacific railway v illinois that only the federj government could regulate interstate commerce.
public pressure forced congress to act and in 1887 cleveland sif the interstate commerce act.
this was the first federal la regulate interstate commerce.
the law limited railroad rates to what was reasonab and just outlawed rebates and made it illegal to charge higher rates for shorter hauls where the short haul wasp of a longer haul.
the law also created the interstate commerce commission icc the nations first independent regulatory agency.
the icc was not very effective in regulating the industry because it had to tab railroads to court prove they were violating the law thei the court to enforce the icc s rulings.
despite its weaknesses the creation of the icc had benefits.
by banning rebates and higher rates for short h it reduced some of the pressure on farmers and small businesses who were struggling to compete with large companies.

many democrats thought that congress should cut tariffs because they raised the price of imported go 164 high tariffs also forced other nations to respond in kind making it difficult for farmers to export surpluses.
in december 1887 president cleveland proposed lowering tariffs.
the democratic house passed moderate tariff reductions but the republican senate rejected the bill.
in 1888 the republicans and their presidential candidate benjamin harrison received large campaign contributions from industrialists who benefited from high tariffs.
cleveland and the democrats campaigned against high tariff rates.
in one of the closest presidential elections in american history harrison lost the popular vote but won the electoral vote giving republicans control of the white house.
in 1890 representative william mckinley pushed through a bill that cut some taxes and tariff rates but increased rates on other goods.
the mckinley tariff intended to protect american industry from foreign competition instead helped trigger a steep rise in the price of all goods.

why were these steps necessary.
unrest in rural america populism apolitical movement founded in the 1890s representing mainly farmers that favored free coinage of silver and government control of railroads and other large industries guiding question what kinds of problems did farmers face.
populism was a movement to increase farmers political power and work for legislation in their interest.
an economic crisis following the civil war led farmers to join the populist movement.
new technology enabled farmers to produce more crops but increased supply caused prices to fall.
high tariffs also made it hard for farmers to sell their goods overseas.
in addition mortgages with large banks and rail shipping costs that continued to increase made the farmers difficulties worse.
the money supply greenback a unit of paper currency first issued by the federal government during the civil war currency papermoneyusedasa medium of exchange inflation an ongoing increase in prices and decrease in the value of money some farmers thought adjusting the money supply would solve their problems.
during the civil war the government had expanded the money supply by issuing millions of dollars in greenbacks paper currency that could not be exchanged for gold or silver coins.
when currency is issued that cannot be exchanged for a commodity like gold or silver it is called fiat currency.
it holds value only because the government says it does.
the increased money supply without an increase in goods for sale caused inflation or a decline in the value of money.
as the paper money lost value the prices of goods soared.
after the civil war ended the united states had three types of currency in circulation greenbacks gold and silver coins and national banknotes backed by government bonds.
to get inflation under control the federal government stopped printing greenbacks and began paying off its bonds.
in 1873 congress also decided to stop making silver into coins.
these decisions meant that the money supply was insufficient for the countrys growing economy.
as the economy expanded deflation an increase in the value of money and a decrease in prices began.
deflation hit farmers especially hard.
falling prices meant that they sold their crops for less and then had to borrow money for seed and other bond a note issued by the government that promises to pay off a loan with interest this civil war era banknote from 1862 was part ofthe expanded money supply that caused a rise in inflation.
criticalthinking making inferences why would an increase in the amount of paper currency cause it to lose value.
urban america 165 deflation an ongoing decrease in prices and an increase in the value of money supplies to plant their next crops.
with money in short supply interest ra began to rise increasing the amount farmers owed.
rising interest rates a made mortgages more expensive and despite their lower income farmer to make the same mortgage payments to the banks.
farmers knew their problems were partly due to a shortage of currency.
some wanted the government to print more greenbacks.
others especially those in the we where new silver mines had been found wanted silver coins to be issued again.
increasingly farmers realized that if they wanted the government t meet their demands they had to organize.

realizing that farmers were iso kelley founded the first national farm organization the patrons of husbandry in 1867.
it became known as the grange.
in 1873 the nation plunged into a severe recession and farm income fell sharply.
grangers responded by pressuring states to regulate railroad and warehouse rates.
to reduce harmful competition among farmers the grangers also tried creating organizations called cooperatives in whic member farmers worked together to increase prices and lower costs.
not the strategies improved farmers economic conditions.
the farmers7 alliance strategy a plan or method for achieving a goal as the grange began to fall apart a new organization known as the farmers alliance began to form.
by 1890 the alliance had between 1.

when charles w macune became the leader of th alliance he announced a plan to organize very large cooperatives wh he called exchanges.
the exchanges failed because they overextended themselves or because wholesalers railroad owners and bankers mac difficult for them to stay in business.

in july 1892 more than 1 000 delegates met in omaha nebraska to form the people s party.
the party held its first national convention and nominated james b weaver to run for president.
the omaha conventions platform called for a return to unlimited coinage of silver.
it also called for federal ownership of railroads and a graduated income tax.
populists also adopted proposals that were designed to appeal to organized labor.
ideas such as an eight hour workday and immigration restrictions were put forth as appealing options.
in the end however populism held little appeal to urban voters who continued their traditional party allegiances.
many workers continued to vote for the democrats whose candidate grover cleveland won the election.

the election of 1896 guiding question why did the populists support the democratic candidate william jennings bryan in 1896.
as the election of 1896 approached leaders of the peoples party decided to make the free coinage of silver the focus of their campaign and to hold their convention after the republican and democratic conventions.
they believed correctly that the republicans would endorse a gold standard.
they also expected the democrats to nominate grover cleveland even though cleveland favored a gold standard.
the peoples party hoped that when it endorsed silver pro silver democrats would choose the populists.
unfortunately their strategy failed.
william jennings bryan made an impassioned pro silver speech at the convention and won the democratic nomination.
primarysource having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world supported by the commercial interests the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere we will answer their demand fora gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold 99 from bryan s speech at the democratic national convention 1896 the populists faced a difficult choice endorse bryan and risk undermining their identity as a party or nominate their own candidate and risk splitting the silver vote.
they chose to support bryan.
the republicans appealed to workers with the promise that mckinley would provide a full dinner pail also most business leaders supported the republicans convinced that unlimited silver coinage would ruin the country.
many employers warned workers that if bryan won businesses would fail and unemployment would rise further.
mckinleys reputation as a moderate on labor issues and as tolerant toward ethnic groups helped improve the republican partys image with urban workers and immigrants.
when the votes were counted mckinley had won with a decisive victory.
evaluating populism s impact discouraged by defeat the peoples party declined after 1896.
the populist goal of using the federal government to ease the economic hardships of farmers and regulate big business failed primarily because of graduated income tax a tax based on the net income of an individual or business and which taxes different income levels at different rates skills practice work with a partner.

urban america 167 the partys inability to appeal successfully to urban workers in the north populist ideas however were not forgotten and continued to influence t political debate.
in the years ahead many items on the populist program would be realized including the eight hour workday restrictions on immigration and a graduated income tax.
ironically the key populist gc of increasing the money supply came about almost immediately followii the election as gold from the klondike and new gold mines in south af flooded into the worlds economy.
the klondike gold rush in august 1896 an american prospector discovered gold near the klonc river in the yukon territory of northern canada.
when the news reache san francisco and seattle the following year the last great gold rush in american history began.
within months an estimated 100 000 peoples.
out for the klondike determined to strike it rich.
physical geographic factors made getting to the klondike very diffici the region was extremely remote.
the most direct route was to book passage to the ports of dyea or skagway then hike approximately 30 mil over the mountains before sailing the final 500 miles down the yukon ri to dawson city the nearest settlement to the gold fields.
prospectors we required to bring a years worth of supplies so as to ensure no one starve death in the remote region.
to do that each person had to bring in nearl ton of material.
boomtowns full of hotels storehouses saloons and gent stores popped up.
prices soared as merchants sought to supply tools foo shelter transportation and entertainment to the prospectors pouring inti the region.
hundreds died some from the cold some from starvation others from avalanches accidents while climbing mountains or crossing frozen lakes or from outbreaks of dysentery and typhoid fever.
by 1899 the gold rush was over although companies using heavy equipment continued to expand gold production into the early 1900s.

how is urban it matters because after reconstruction ended southern states began passing laws that weakened the rights of african americans by introducing segregation and denying voting rights.
african american leaders struggled to protect civil rights and improve their quality of life.
resistance and repression guiding question howdid african americans resist radsm and try to improve their way of life following reconstruction.
after reconstruction many african americans in the rural south lived in poverty.
most were sharecroppers landless farmers who gave their landlords a large portion of their crops as rent.
sharecropping usually left farmers in chronic debt.
many eventually left farming and sought jobs in southern towns or headed west to claim homesteads.
in the mid 1870s benjamin pap singleton became convinced that african americans would never be given a chance to get ahead in the south.
he began urging african americans to move west specifically to kansas and form their own independent communities.
his ideas soon set in motion a mass migration.
in less than two months approximately 6 000 african americans left their homes in the rural south and headed to kansas.
the newspapers called it an exodus like the ancient jews escape from egyptian bondage referred to in the bible.
the migrants themselves came to be known as exodusters the first exodusters many possessing little more than hope and the clothes on their backs arrived in kansas in the spring of 1879.
while some african americans fled the south others joined poor white farmers who had created the farmers alliance.
alliance leaders urged african americans to form a similar organization.
in 1886 african american farmers established the colored farmers national alliance which numbered about 1 2 million members by 1890.

after reconstruction ended in 1877 the rights of african americans wei gradually undermined.
attempts to unify whites and african americans failed.
instead a movement to diminish the civil rights of african americans gained momentum as the century ended.
taking away the vote the fifteenth amendment prohibits states from denying citizens the rigl to vote on the basis of race color or previous condition of servitude.
however it does not bar states from denying the right to vote on other grounds.
in the late 1800s southern states began imposing restrictions.
though they did not mention race they were meant to make it hard or impossible for african americans to vote.
in 1890 mississippi began requiring all citizens registering to votetc pay a poll tax of 2 a sum beyond the means of most poor african americans or poor whites.
mississippi also instituted a literacy test requiring voters to read and understand the state constitution.
few african americans born after the civil war had been able to attend sch and those who had grown up under slavery were largely illiterate.
even those who knew how to read often failed the test because officials deliberately picked passages that few people could understand.
other southern states adopted similar restrictions.
the number of african americans registered to vote in southern states fell drastically between 1890 and 1900.
election officials were far less strict in applying the poll tax and literacy requirements to whites but the number of white voters also fell significantly.
to let more whites vote louisiana introduced the grandfather clause.
this allowed any man to vote if he had an ancestor who could vote in 1867.
this provision adopted in several southern states exempted most whites from voting restrictions.
legalizing segregation african americans in the north were often discriminated against but segregation or the separation of the races was different in the south.
southern states passed laws that rigidly enforced discrimination.
these laws became known as jim crow laws.
in 1883 the supreme court set the stage for legalized segregation when it overturned the civil rights act of 1875.
that law had prohibited keeping people out of public places on the basis of race and barred racial discrimination in selecting jurors.
the supreme court however ruled that the fourteenth amendment provided only that no state could deny citizens equal protection under the law.
private organizations such as hotels theaters and railroads were free to practice segregation.
encouraged by the supreme courts ruling and by the decline of congressional support for civil rights southern states passed a series of laws establishing racial segregation in virtually all public places.
southern whites and african americans could no longer ride together in the same railroad cars or even drink from the same water fountains.
in 1892 an african american named homer plessy challenged a louisiana law that forced him to ride in a separate railroad car from whites.

the incident was planned in advance to test the statute to emphasize the folly ofthe law.
a conductor orders an african american off a whites only train car in philadelphia pennsylvania.
how the court ruled the court upheld the right of states to make laws that sustained segregation.
the majority of justices wanted to distinguish between political rights guaranteed by the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and social rights.

after a mob dri wells out of town she settled in chicago and continued her campaign.
in 1895 she published a book denouncing mob violence and demanding a fair trial by law for those accused of crime and punishment by law af honest conviction although congress rejected an antilynching bill the number of lynchings decreased significantly in the 1900s due in part to efforts of activists such as wells.
