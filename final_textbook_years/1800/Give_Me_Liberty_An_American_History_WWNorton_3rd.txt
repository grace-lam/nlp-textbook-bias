the court ruled against him and dorr served two years in prison.
the triumph of democracy unable to vote.
leaders of the states labor movement complained repeatedly about the absence of free suffrage in october 1841 proponents of democratic reform organized a peoples convention which drafted a new state constitution.
it enfranchised all adult white men while eliminating entirely blacks who previously could vote if they owned the required amount of property another illustration of how the expansion of white freedom sometimes went hand in hand with restrictions on the freedom of non whites.
when the reformers ratified their constitution in an extralegal referendum and proceeded to inaugurate thomas dorr a prominent rhode island lawyer as governor president john tyler dispatched federal troops to the state.
the movement collapsed and dorr subsequently served nearly two years in prison for treason.
the dorr war demonstrated the passions aroused by the continuing exclusion of any group of white men from voting.
and the legislature soon eliminated the property qualification for native born men black as well as white although it retained it for immigrants until 1888.
tocqueville on democracy by 1840 more than 90 percent of adult white men were eligible to vote.
a flourishing democratic system had been consolidated.
american politics was boisterous highly partisan and sometimes violent and it engaged the energies of massive numbers of citizens.
in a country that lacked more traditional bases of nationality a powerful and menacing neighbor historic ethnic religious and cultural unity democratic political institutions came to define the nations sense of its own identity.
alexis de tocqueville the french writer who visited the united states in the early 1830s returned home to produce democracy in america a classic account of a society in the midst of a political transformation.
tocqueville had come to the united states to study prisons.
but he soon realized that to understand america one must understand democracy which as a person of aristocratic background he rather disliked.
his key insight was that democracy by this time meant far more than either the right to vote or a particular set of political institutions.
it was what scholars call a habit of the heart a culture that encouraged individual initiative belief in equality and an active public sphere populated by numerous voluntary organizations that sought to improve society.
democracy tocqueville saw had become an essential attribute of american freedom.
as tocqueville recognized the rise of democracy represented a profound political transformation.
the idea that sovereignty belongs to the mass of ordinary citizens was a new departure in western thought.
as long ago as aristotle political philosophers had warned that democracy inevitably degenerated into anarchy and tyranny.
for centuries doctrines of divine right and hierarchical authority had dominated political thought.
the founders of the republic who believed that government must rest on the what were the social bases for the flourishing democracy of the early mid nineteenth century.
consent of the governed also sought to shield political authority from excessive influence by ordinary people hence the electoral college supreme court and other undemocratic features of the constitution.
nonetheless thanks to persistent pressure from those originally excluded from political participation democracy for white males had triumphed by the age of jackson.
democracy reinforced a sense of equality among those who belonged to the political nation and it deepened the divide separating them from those who did not.
participation in elections and the pageantry surrounding them parades bonfires mass meetings party conventions helped to define the people of the united states.
the right to vote increasingly became the emblem of american citizenship.
in law voting was still strictly speaking a privilege rather than a right subject to regulation by the individual states.
but noah websters american dictionary noted that according to common usage and understanding in america but not in europe the term citizen had become synonymous with the right to vote.
the suffrage said one advocate of democratic reform was the first mark of liberty the only true badge of the freeman the information revolution the market revolution and political democracy produced a large expansion of the public sphere and an explosion in printing sometimes called the information revolution the application of steam power to newspaper printing led to a great increase in output and the rise of the mass circulation penny press priced at one cent per issue instead of the traditional six.
newspapers like the new york sun and new york herald introduced a new style of journalism appealing to a mass audience by emphasizing sensationalism crime stories and exposs of official misconduct.
by 1840 according to one estimate the total weekly circulation of newspapers in the united states whose population was 17 million exceeded that of europe with 233 million people.
thanks to low postal rates many newspapers circulated far beyond their places of publication.
indeed by the 1830s newspapers accounted for most postal traffic outstripping private letters.
the emergence of organized political parties also spurred newspaper publication.
each major party needed to have newspapers supporting its views in every part of the country and government printing contracts were essential to most newspapers survival.
the publication of all sorts of magazines travel guides advice manuals religious titles and other reading materials rose dramatically.
the reduction in the cost of printing also made possible the appearance of alternative newspapers in the late 1820s and early 1830s including freedoms journal the first black newspaper philadelphia mechanics advocate and other labor publications the abolitionist weekly the liberator and cherokee phoenix the first native american newspaper.
the growth of the reading public yet another facet of the democratization of american life opened the door for the rise of a new generation of women writers.
lydia maria child catharine maria sedgwick catharine beecher and others published stories poetry essays and guides to domestic life.
by the 1830s moreover through participation in religious and reform movements thousands of women would establish a public presence the american womans home a guide to domestic life by the sisters catharine beecher and harriet beecher stowe.
even though works like this were meant to instruct middle class women on how to meet their domestic responsibilities their popularity allowed talented women to take on a new public role as writers.
10 democracy in america 1815 1840 the triumph of democracy as will be described in chapter 12.
nonetheless once new jersey added the word male to its voting requirements in 1807 women everywhere whether married or single propertied or dependent were denied the right to vote.
the limits of democracy by the 1830s the time of andrew jacksons presidency the axiom that the people ruled had become a universally accepted part of american politics.
those who opposed this principle wrote tocqueville hide their heads but the very centrality of democracy to the definition of both freedom and nationality made it all the more necessary to define the boundaries of the political nation.
as older economic exclusions fell away others survived and new ones were added.
the vigorous public life of antebellum america was simultaneously expansive and exclusive and its limits were as essential to its nature as its broad scope.
democracy in america could absorb native born poor white men as well as waves of immigrants yet it erected impenetrable barriers to the participation of women and non white men groups also excluded as noted in the previous chapter from full participation in the market revolution.
the principle of universal suffrage declared the united states magazine and democratic review in 1851 meant that white males of age constituted the political nation how could the word universal be reconciled with barring blacks and women from political participation.
as democracy triumphed the intellectual grounds for exclusion shifted from economic dependency to natural incapacity.
gender and racial differences were widely understood as part of a single natural hierarchy of innate endowments.
a boundary drawn by nature itself was not really exclusion at all.
how did woman first become subject to man as she now is all over the world asked the new york herald in 1852.
by her nature her sex just as the negro is and always will be to the end of time inferior to the white race and therefore doomed to subjection paradoxically therefore while freedom for white men involved an open ended process of personal transformation developing to the fullest the potential inherent within each human being the limits of american democracy rested on the belief that the character and abilities of non whites and women were forever fixed by nature.
the debate over which people are and are not qualified to take part in american democracy lasted well into the twentieth century.
not until 1920 was the constitution amended to require states to allow women to vote.
the voting rights act of 1965 swept away restrictions on black voting imposed by many southern states.
even today controversy persists over the voting rights of immigrants persons who have served prison terms and the poor.
the political world of the nineteenth century so crucial an arena for the exercise of american freedom was in part defined in contrast to the feminine sphere of the home.
freedom in the public realm in no way implied freedom in private life.
the most rabid radical ralph waldo emerson remarked in his journal in 1841 was likely to be conservative in relation to the theory of marriage beyond the right to decent treatment by her husband and to whatever property the law allowed her to control declared what were the social bases for the flourishing democracy of the early mid nineteenth century.
the new york herald a woman had no rights.
with which the public have any concern a racial democracy if the exclusion of women from political freedom continued a long standing practice the increasing identification of democracy and whiteness marked something of a departure.
tocqueville noted that by the 1830s equality had become an american obsession.
in contrast to the highly stratified societies of europe white americans of all social classes dressed the same traveled in the same stagecoaches and railroad cars and stayed in the same hotels.
yet at the same time blacks were increasingly considered a group apart.
racist imagery became the stock in trade of popular theatrical presentations like minstrel shows in which white actors in blackface entertained the audience by portraying african americans as stupid dishonest and altogether ridiculous.
with the exception of herman melville who portrayed complex sometimes heroic black characters in works like moby dick and benito cereno the latter a fictionalized account of a shipboard slave rebellion american authors either ignored blacks entirely or presented them as stereotypes happy slaves prone to superstition or long suffering but devout christians.
meanwhile the somewhat tentative thinking of the revolutionary era about the status of non whites flowered into an elaborate ideology of racial superiority and inferiority complete with scientific underpinnings.
these developments affected the boundaries of the political nation.
in the revolutionary era only virginia south carolina and georgia explicitly confined the vote to whites although elsewhere custom often made it difficult for free blacks to exercise the franchise.
as late as 1800 no northern state barred blacks from voting.
but every state that entered the union after that year with the single exception of maine limited the right to vote to white males.
and beginning with kentucky in 1799 and maryland two years later states that had allowed blacks to vote rescinded the privilege.
race and class in 1821 the same new york constitutional convention that removed property qualifications for white voters raised the requirement for blacks to 250 a sum beyond the reach of nearly all of the states black residents.
north carolina disenfranchised free blacks in 1835 and pennsylvania home of an articulate economically successful black community in philadelphia did the same three years later.
one delegate to the pennsylvania constitutional convention refused to sign the completed document because of its provision limiting suffrage to whites.
this was thaddeus stevens who would later become a leader in the drive for equal rights for african americans after the civil war.
by 1860 blacks could vote on the same basis as whites in only five new england states which contained only 4 percent of the nations free black population.
a delegate to the pennsylvania convention of 1837 described the united states as a political community of white persons dandy jim a piece of sheet music from 1843.
minstrel shows were a form of nineteenth century entertainment in which white actors impersonated blacks.
here the actor makes fun of a black man attempting to adopt the style of middleclass white americans.
10 democracy in america 1815 1840 nationalism and its discontents despite racial inequalities many whites of the revolutionary generation had thought of african americans as citizens of color potential members of the body politic.
but in the nineteenth century the definition of the political nation became more and more associated with race.
the federal government barred free blacks from service in state militias and the army although the navy did enroll some black sailors.
no state accorded free blacks what today would be considered full equality before the law.
in illinois for example blacks could not vote testify or sue in court serve in the militia or attend public schools.
blacks were aliens not americans intruders among us declared a political leader in minnesota.
in effect race had replaced class as the boundary between those american men who were entitled to enjoy political freedom and those who were not.
even as this focus on race limited americas political community as a whole it helped to solidify a sense of national identity among the diverse groups of european origin.
in a country where the right to vote had become central to the meaning of freedom it is difficult to overstate the importance of the fact that white male immigrants could vote in some states almost from the moment they landed in america while nearly all free blacks and of course slaves whose ancestors had lived in the country for centuries could not vote at all.
n at i o n a l i s m a n d i t s d i s c o n t e n t s an image from a broadside from the campaign of 1824 promoting the american system of governmentsponsored economic development.
the illustrations represent industry commerce and agriculture.
the ship at the center is named the john quincy adams.
its flag no colonial subjection suggests that without a balanced economy the united states will remain economically dependent on great britain.
the american system the war of 1812 which the united states and great britain the worlds foremost military power fought to a draw inspired an outburst of nationalist pride.
but the war also revealed how far the united states still was from being a truly integrated nation.
with the bank of the united states having gone out of existence when its charter expired in 1811 the country lacked a uniform currency and found it almost impossible to raise funds for the war effort.
given the primitive state of transportation it proved very difficult to move men and goods around the country.
one shipment of supplies from new england had taken seventy five days to reach new orleans.
with the coming of peace the manufacturing enterprises that sprang up while trade with britain had been suspended faced intense competition from low cost imported goods.
a younger generation of republicans led by henry clay and john c calhoun believed these infant industries deserved national protection.
while retaining their jeffersonian belief in an agrarian republic they insisted that agriculture must be complemented by a manufacturing sector if the country were to become economically independent of britain.
in 1806 congress as noted in the previous chapter had approved using what efforts were made in this period to strengthen the economic integration of the nation and what major crises hindered these efforts.
public funds to build a paved national road from cumberland maryland to the ohio valley.
two years later albert gallatin jeffersons secretary of the treasury outlined a plan for the federal government to tie the vast nation together by constructing roads and canals up and down the eastern seaboard and by connecting the atlantic coast with the great lakes and ohio and mississippi rivers.
gallatins proposal fell victim to regional rivalries and fears of excessive national power.
but the idea revived after the war of 1812.
in his annual message now known as the state of the union address to congress in december 1815 president james madison put forward a blueprint for government promoted economic development that came to be known as the american system a label coined by henry clay.
it should not be confused with the american system of manufactures mentioned in the previous chapter which referred to a way of mass producing goods with interchangeable parts not a political program for economic growth.
the plan rested on three pillars a new national bank a tariff on imported manufactured goods to protect american industry and federal financing of improved roads and canals.
the last was particularly important to those worried about the dangers of disunity.
let us bind the nation together with a perfect system of roads and canals john c calhoun implored congress in 1815.
let us conquer space when believers in strict construction of the constitution objected calhoun replied if we are restricted in the use of money to the enumerated powers on what principle can the purchase of louisiana be justified government sponsored internal improvements as the construction of roads and canals was called proved to be the most controversial part of the plan.
congress enacted an internal improvements program drafted by calhoun only to be astonished when the president on the eve of his retirement from office in march 1817 vetoed the bill.
since calling for its enactment madison had become convinced that allowing the national government to exercise powers not mentioned in the constitution would prove dangerous to individual liberty and southern interests.
a constitutional amendment would be necessary he declared before the federal government could build roads and canals.
the other two parts of his plan however became law.
the tariff of 1816 offered protection to goods that could be produced in the united states especially cheap cotton textiles while admitting tax free those that could not be manufactured at home.
many southerners supported the tariff believing that it would enable their region to develop a manufacturing base to rival new englands.
and in 1816 a new bank of the united states was created with a twenty year charter from congress.
banks and money the second bank of the united states soon became the focus of public resentment.
like its predecessor it was a private profit making corporation that served as the governments financial agent issuing paper money collecting taxes and paying the governments debts.
it was also charged with ensuring that paper money issued by local banks had real value.
the number of local banks had risen to more than 200 a sign of the accelerating market revolution.
they promoted economic growth by helping to finance john c calhoun in an 1822 portrait by the artist charles bird king.
calhoun would evolve from a nationalist into the most prominent spokesman for state sovereignty and the right of nullification.
10 democracy in america 1815 1840 nationalism and its discontents manufacturing and commerce and extending loans to farmers for the purchase of land tools consumer goods and in the south slaves.
they also printed paper money.
today only the federal government issues paper money and the amount is determined by the federal reserve bank not the amount of gold held at the repository at fort knox.
but in the nineteenth century paper money consisted of notes promising to pay the bearer on demand a specified amount of specie gold or silver.
the value of the currency issued by individual banks depended on their reputation for stability.
since banks often printed far more money than the specie in their vaults the value of paper currency fluctuated wildly.
the bank of the united states was supposed to prevent the overissuance of money.
because it held all the funds of the federal government it accumulated a large amount of paper money issued by local banks which had been used to purchase public land.
the bank of the united states could demand payment in gold and silver from a local bank in exchange for that banks paper money.
this prospect was supposed to prevent local banks from acting improperly for if it could not provide the specie when asked it would have to suspend operations.
the panic of but instead of effectively regulating the currency and loans issued by local banks the bank of the united states participated in a speculative fever that swept the country after the end of the war of 1812.
the resumption of trade with europe created a huge overseas market for american cotton and grain.
coupled with the rapid expansion of settlement into the west this stimulated demand for loans to purchase land which local banks and branches of the bank of the united states were only too happy to meet by printing more money.
the land boom was especially acute in the south where the cotton kingdom was expanding.
early in 1819 as european demand for american farm products returned to normal levels the economic bubble burst.
the demand for land plummeted and speculators lost millions as the price of western land fell.
at this time loans tended to be of short duration and banks could demand repayment at any time.
the bank of the united states followed by state banks began asking for payments from those to whom it had loaned money.
farmers and businessmen who could not repay declared bankruptcy and unemployment rose in eastern cities.
the politics of the panic the panic of 1819 lasted little more than a year but it severely disrupted the political harmony of the previous years.
those suffering from the economic downturn pressed the state and national governments for assistance.
to the consternation of creditors many states especially in the west responded by suspending the collection of debts.
kentucky went even further establishing a state bank that flooded the state with paper money that creditors were required to accept in repayment of loans.
this eased the burden on indebted farmers but injured those who had loaned them the money.
overall the panic deepened many americans traditional distrust of banks.
it undermined the reputation of the second bank of the united states what efforts were made in this period to strengthen the economic integration of the nation and what major crises hindered these efforts.
which was widely blamed for causing the panic.
several states retaliated against the national bank by taxing its local branches.
these tax laws produced another of john marshalls landmark supreme court decisions in the case of mcculloch v maryland 1819.
reasserting his broad interpretation of governmental powers marshall declared the bank a legitimate exercise of congressional authority under the constitutions clause that allowed congress to pass necessary and proper laws.
marshalls interpretation of the constitution directly contradicted the strict construction view that limited congress to powers specifically granted in the constitution.
marshall acknowledged that the constitution nowhere mentions the right of lawmakers to issue corporate charters.
but he wrote where the aim of legislation in this case to promote the general welfare was legitimate all means which are.
not prohibited.
are constitutional maryland the chief justice continued could not tax the bank.
the power to tax marshall remarked involves the power to destroy and the states lacked the authority to destroy an agency created by the national government.
the missouri controversy in 1816 james monroe handily defeated federalist candidate rufus king becoming the last of the virginia presidents.
by 1820 the federalists fielded electoral tickets in only two states and monroe carried the entire country.
one elector william plumer of new hampshire however cast his vote for john quincy adams whom he deemed more qualified than monroe to be president.
the legend later arose that plumer voted as he did because he wished george washington to remain the only president elected unanimously.
monroes two terms in office were years of one party government sometimes called the era of good feelings.
plenty of bad feelings however surfaced during his presidency.
in the absence of two party competition politics was organized along lines of competing sectional interests.
even as political party divisions faded and john marshall aligned the supreme court with the aggressive nationalism of clay calhoun and others the troublesome issue of slavery again threatened to disrupt the nations unity.
in 1819 congress considered a request from missouri an area carved out of the louisiana purchase to form a constitution in preparation for admission to the union as a state.
missouris slave population already exceeded 10 000.
james tallmadge a republican congressman from new york moved that the introduction of further slaves be prohibited and that children of those already in missouri be freed at age twenty five.
tallmadges proposal sparked two years of controversy during which republican unity shattered along sectional lines.
his restriction passed the house where most northern congressmen supported it over the objections of southern representatives.
it died in the senate however.
when congress reconvened in 1820 senator jesse thomas of illinois proposed a compromise with three parts.
missouri would be authorized to draft a constitution without tallmadges restriction.
maine which prohibited slavery would be admitted to the union to maintain the sectional balance between free and slave states.
and slavery would be prohibited in all remaining territory within the louisiana purchase north of latitude 36309 missouris southern boundary.
congress adopted thomass plan as the missouri compromise.

since some northern states still considered blacks citizens this seemed to violate the federal constitutions comity clause which requires each state to recognize the rights of citizens of other states.
henry clay engineered a second missouri compromise according to which congress accepted the states constitution as written but instructed missouri that it could not deprive the citizens of any states of their rights under the u s constitution.
missouri however largely ignored this provision.
the slavery question thomas jefferson who had drafted the clause of the northwest ordinance of 1787 prohibiting slavery north of the ohio river strenuously opposed efforts to keep the institution out of missouri.
he saw the entire controversy as an attempt by federalists to revive their party by setting northern and southern republicans against each other.
jefferson was correct that political power not moral scruples motivated most northern congressmen.
but republicans not the few remaining federalists provided the bulk of the votes against slavery in missouri.
by 1820 new york had surpassed virginia in population and what efforts were made in this period to strengthen the economic integration of the nation and what major crises hindered these efforts.
new york republicans were among the leading advocates of emancipation in missouri.
twenty eight years of virginia presidents interrupted only by the single term of john adams of massachusetts had persuaded many northerners that the south exercised undue influence in washington.
more slave states meant more southern congressmen and electoral votes.
the missouri controversy raised for the first time what would prove to be a fatal issue the westward expansion of slavery.
the sectional division it revealed aroused widespread feelings of dismay.
this momentous question wrote jefferson like a fire bell in the night awakened and filled me with terror.

here was a new party really formed.
terrible to the whole union but portentously terrible to the south threatening in its progress the emancipation of all their slaves threatening in its immediate effect that southern domination which has swayed the union for the last twenty years.
the dissolution of the union over the issue of slavery adams mused disastrous as that might be would result in civil war and the extirpation of slavery from this whole continent it would take more than forty years for adamss prediction to be fulfilled.
for the moment the slavery issue faded once again from national debate.
n at i o n s e c t i o n a n d pa r t y the united wars of states and the latin american independence between 1810 and 1822 spains latin american colonies rose in rebellion and established a series of independent nations including mexico venezuela ecuador and peru.
by 1825 spains once vast american empire had been reduced to the islands of cuba and puerto rico.
the uprisings inspired a wave of sympathy in the united states.
in 1822 the monroe administration became the first government to extend diplomatic recognition to the new latin american republics.
parallels existed between the spanish american revolutions and the one that had given birth to the united states.
in both cases the crisis of empire was precipitated by programs launched by the imperial country aimed in large measure at making the colonies contribute more to its finances.
the government in spain had been trying to strengthen its hold on the empire since the late eighteenth century.
a french army under napoleon occupied spain in 1808 and overthrew the monarchy inspiring assertions of local control throughout spanish america.
a new constitution adopted by spain in 1812 granted greater local rights in spain and the colonies.
when the king was restored in 1814 he repudiated the constitution and moved to reassert control over the colonies.
but the colonists had become used to autonomy.
as had happened in british north america local elites demanded status and treatment equal to residents of the imperial power.
the voices of freedom from president james monroe annual message to congress 1823 in the wake of the latin american struggle for independence president james monroe included in his annual message a passage that became known as the monroe doctrine.
it outlined liberty and happiness of their fellow men on that side of the atlantic.
in the wars of the european powers in countrys relations with the rest of the world for matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part nor does it comport with our policy to do so.
it is only when our rights are invaded or seriously nearly a century that the western hemisphere menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation principles that would help to govern the was no longer open to european colonization and that the united states would remain uninvolved in the wars of europe.
this occasion has been judged proper for asserting as a principle.
that the american continents by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers.
it was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great effort was then making in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people of those countries and that it appeared to be conducted with extraordinary moderation.
it need scarcely be remarked that the results have been so far very different from what was then anticipated.
of events in that quarter of the globe with which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive our origin we have always been anxious and interested spectators.
the citizens of the united states cherish sentiments the most friendly in favor of the for our defense.
with the movements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers.
the political system of the allied powers of europe is essentially different in this respect from that of america.
we owe it therefore to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the united states and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.
with the existing colonies or dependencies of any european power we have not interfered and shall not interfere.
but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintain it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states.
from john c calhoun a d i s q u i s i t i o n o n g o v e r n m e n t c a.
1 8 4 5 the most prominent political philosopher in the pre civil war south john c calhoun sought to devise ways that the south could retain the power to protect its interests within the union especially the institution of slavery as it fell behind the north in population and political power.
between them has been so entirely overlooked that when the term majority is used in political discussions it is applied exclusively to designate the numerical as if there were no other.
the first and leading error which naturally arises from overlooking the distinction referred to is to confound the numerical majority with the people and this is so completely as to regard them as identical.
this is a consequence that necessarily results from considering the numerical as the only there are two different modes in which the sense of the community may be taken one simply by the right of suffrage unaided the other by the right through a proper organism.
each collects the sense of the majority.
but one regards numbers only and considers the whole community as a unit having but one common interest throughout and collects the sense of the greater number of the whole as that of the community.
the other on the contrary regards interests as well as numbers considering the community as made up of different and conflicting interests as far as the action of the government is concerned and takes the sense of each through its majority or appropriate organ and the united sense of all as the sense of the entire community.
the former of these i shall call the numerical or absolute majority and the latter the concurrent or constitutional majority.
i call it the constitutional majority because it is an essential element in every constitutional government be whatever form it takes.
so great is the difference politically speaking between the two majorities that they cannot be confounded without leading to great and fatal errors and yet the distinction majority.
all admit that a popular government or democracy is the government of the people.
those who regard the numerical as the only majority.
are forced to regard the numerical majority as in effect the entire people.
the necessary consequence of taking the sense of the community by the concurrent majority is.
to give to each interest or portion of the community a negative on the others.
it is this mutual negative among its various conflicting interests which invests each with the power of protecting itself.
without this there can be no constitution.
questions 1.
why does monroe think that the systems of europe and the western hemisphere are fundamentally different.
which americans would be most likely to object to calhouns political system.
how do the two documents differ in their conception of how powerful the national government ought to be.
10 democracy in america 1815 1840 nation section and party spanish american declarations of independence borrowed directly from that of the united states.
the first issued in 1811 even before the restoration of the monarchy in spain declared that the united provinces of venezuela now enjoyed among the sovereign nations of the earth the rank which the supreme being and nature has assigned us language strikingly similar to jeffersons.
unlike the british empire spains dissolved into seventeen different nations.
the spanish empire was too vast and disconnected for a common sense of nationhood to emerge.
the spanish government had imposed severe restrictions on printing thereby making communication between the various parts of the empire more difficult than in the british colonies.
the first printing press in bogot a major city in south america was not established until the 1770s.
nonetheless imported books had circulated widely spreading the eras revolutionary ideas.
in some ways the new latin american constitutions were more democratic than that of the united states.
most sought to implement the transatlantic ideals of rights and freedom by creating a single national people out of the diverse populations that made up the spanish empire.
to do so they extended the right to vote to indians and free blacks.
the latin american wars of independence in which black soldiers participated on both sides also set in motion the gradual abolition of slavery.
but the latin american wars of independence lasted longer sometimes more than a decade and were more destructive than the one in the united states had been.
in some countries independence was followed by civil war.
as a result it proved far more difficult for the new latin american republics to achieve economic development than the united states.
the monroe doctrine john quincy adams who was serving as james monroes secretary of state was devoted to consolidating the power of the national government at home and abroad.
adams feared that spain would try to regain its latin american colonies.
in 1823 he drafted a section of the presidents annual message to congress that became known as the monroe doctrine.
it expressed three principles.
first the united states would oppose any further efforts at colonization by european powers in the americas a statement aimed not only against spain but also at france which had designs on cuba and at russia which was seeking to expand its holdings on the pacific coast.
second the united states would abstain from involvement in the wars of europe.
finally monroe warned european powers not to interfere with the newly independent states of latin america.
the monroe doctrine is sometimes called americas diplomatic declaration of independence.
for many decades it remained a cornerstone of american foreign policy.
based on the assumption that the old and new worlds formed separate political and diplomatic systems it claimed for the united states the role of dominant power in the western hemisphere.
for adams the commercial implications were as important as the political ones.
in 1823 latin america was a major market for british goods and british citizens were heavily involved in mining banking and commercial enterprises there.
adams hoped that the united states could eventually assume britains economic role.

but sectionalism seemed to rule domestic politics.
as the election of 1824 approached only andrew jackson could claim truly national support.
jacksons popularity rested not on any specific public policy few voters knew his views but on military victories over the british at the battle of fa l k l a n d i sl a n d s b r this map depicts the western hemisphere after most of spains colonies achieved their independence.

other candidates included john quincy adams secretary of the treasury william h crawford of georgia and henry clay of kentucky.
adamss support was concentrated in new england and more generally in the north where republican leaders insisted the time had come for the south to relinquish the presidency.
crawford represented the souths old republicans who wanted the party to reaffirm the principles of states rights and limited government.
clay was one of the eras most popular politicians but his support in 1824 lay primarily in the west.
a caucus of republican congressmen traditionally chose the partys nominee for president.
the caucus selected crawford but this did not deter the other candidates a sign that at a time of expanding democracy a small group of officials could no longer determine who ran for office.
jackson received 153 544 votes and carried states in all the regions outside of new england.
but with four candidates in the field none received a majority of the electoral votes.
as required by the constitution clay who finished fourth was eliminated and the choice among the other three fell to the house of representatives.
sincerely believing adams to be the most qualified candidate and the one most likely to promote the american system and probably calculating that the election of jackson a westerner would impede his own presidential ambitions clay gave his support to adams helping to elect him.
he soon became secretary of state in adamss cabinet.
the charge that he had made a corrupt bargain bartering critical votes in the presidential contest for a public office clung to clay for the rest of his career making it all but impossible for him to reach the white house.
the election of 1824 laid the groundwork for a new system of political parties.
supporters of jackson and crawford would soon unite in a new organization the democratic party determined to place jackson in the white house in 1828.
the alliance of clay and adams became the basis for the whig party of the 1830s.

nationalism john quincy of adams john quincy adams enjoyed one of the most distinguished pre presidential careers of any american president.
the son of john adams he had witnessed the battle of bunker hill at age eight and at fourteen had worked as private secretary and french interpreter for an american envoy in europe.
he had gone on to serve as ambassador to prussia the netherlands britain and russia and as senator from massachusetts.
although elected as a federalist adams cast one of new englands few votes in favor of jeffersons embargo policy arguing that his region must rise above sectional self interest to defend the national good.
given the intense political passions of the time he had been forced to resign his seat as a result of his vote and he soon abandoned the federalist party.
adams was not an engaging figure.
he described himself what were the major areas of conflict between nationalism and sectionalism.
as a man of cold austere and foreboding manners but he had a clear vision of national greatness.
at home he strongly supported the american system of government sponsored economic development.
abroad he hoped to encourage american commerce throughout the world and as illustrated by his authorship of the monroe doctrine enhance american influence in the western hemisphere.
as monroes secretary of state he had been the only cabinet member to oppose reprimanding andrew jackson for his violent incursion into florida.
in 1819 as noted in the previous chapter adams negotiated a treaty by which the united states acquired florida from spain.
he also concluded an agreement with great britain fixing the canadian american border at the northern boundary of the louisiana purchase.
an ardent expansionist adams was certain that the united states would eventually and peacefully absorb canada cuba and at least part of mexico.
indeed he once said the proper domain of the united states was the entire continent of north america liberty is power adams held a view of federal power far more expansive than most of his contemporaries.
in his first message to congress in december 1825 he set forth a comprehensive program for an activist national state.
the spirit of improvement is abroad in the land adams announced and the federal government should be its patron.
he called for legislation promoting agriculture commerce manufacturing and the mechanical and elegant arts his plans included the establishment of a national university an astronomical observatory and a naval academy.
at a time when many americans felt that governmental authority posed the greatest threat to freedom adams astonished many listeners with the bold statement liberty is power the united states the freest nation on earth would also he predicted become the mightiest.
adamss proposals alarmed all believers in strict construction of the constitution.
his administration spent more on internal improvements than his five predecessors combined and it enacted a steep increase in tariff rates in 1828.
but the rest of adamss ambitious ideas received little support in congress.
not until the twentieth century would the kind of national economic and educational planning envisioned by adams be realized.
some of his proposals like the adoption by the united states of the metric system of weights and measures used by nearly every other nation in the world and the building of a national university have yet to be implemented.
martin van buren and the democratic party adamss program handed his political rivals a powerful weapon.
with individual liberty states rights and limited government as their rallying cries jacksons supporters began to organize for the election of 1828 almost as soon as adams assumed office.
martin van buren a senator from new york oversaw the task.
the clash between adams and van buren demonstrated how democracy was changing the nature of american politics.
adams typified the old politics he was the son of a john quincy adams in an 1843 daguerreotype.
10 democracy in america 1815 1840 nation section and party president and like jefferson and madison a man of sterling intellectual accomplishments.
van buren represented the new political era.
the son of a tavern keeper he was a talented party manager not a person of great vision or intellect.
but van buren did have a compelling idea.
rather than being dangerous and divisive as the founding generation had believed political parties he insisted were a necessary and indeed desirable element of political life.
party competition provided a check on those in power and offered voters a real choice in elections.
and by bringing together political leaders from different regions in support of common candidates and principles national parties could counteract the sectionalism that had reared its head during the 1820s.
like many of his contemporaries van buren had been alarmed when politics divided along sectional lines in the missouri debates and again in the election of 1824.
he attributed this in part to a loss of discipline within the ruling republican party.
party attachment van buren wrote to virginia editor thomas ritchie in former times furnished a complete antidote for sectional prejudices by producing counteracting feelings.
it was not until that defense had been broken down that the clamor against southern influence and african slavery could be made effectual in the north national political parties van buren realized formed a bond of unity in a divided nation.
he set out to reconstruct the jeffersonian political alliance between the planters of the south and the plain republicans the farmers and urban workers of the north the a broadside from the 1828 campaign illustrates how andrew jacksons supporters promoted him as a military hero and man of the people election of by 1828 van buren had established the political apparatus of the democratic party complete with local and state party units overseen by a national committee and a network of local newspapers devoted to the party.
adams for his part disdained political organization.
despite clays urging he refused to dismiss federal officeholders who campaigned for jackson and did little to promote his own reelection.
apart from a general commitment to limited government jacksons supporters made few campaign promises relying on their candidates popularity and the workings of party machinery to get out the vote.
the 1828 election campaign was scurrilous.
jacksons supporters accused adams of having had a series of mistresses while serving as a diplomat in europe.
they praised their candidates frontier manliness and ridiculed adamss intellectual attainments.
vote for andrew jackson who can fight not john quincy adams who can write declared one campaign slogan.
jacksons opponents condemned him as a murderer for having executed army deserters and killing men in duels.
they questioned the morality of his wife rachel because she had married jackson before her divorce from her first husband had become final.
jackson always believed his opponents slanders had contributed to his wifes death shortly after the election.
by 1828 voters not the legislature chose presidential electors in every state except south carolina a fact that helped to encourage vigorous campaigning and high turnout.
nearly 57 percent of the eligible electorate cast ballots more than double the percentage four years earlier.
jackson won a resounding victory with around 650 000 votes to 500 000 for adams.
he carried the entire south and west along with pennsylvania.
jacksons what were the major areas of conflict between nationalism and sectionalism.
election was the first to demonstrate how the advent of universal white male voting organized by national political parties had transformed american politics.
for better or worse the united states had entered the age of jackson.
the presidential election of 1828 the age of jackson andrew jackson was a man of many contradictions.
although he had little formal education adams called him a barbarian who could not write a sentence of grammar jackson was capable of genuine eloquence in his public statements.
a self proclaimed champion of the common man his vision of democracy excluded any role for indians who he believed should be pushed west of the non voting territory mississippi river and african americans who should remain as slaves or be freed and sent abroad.
although he party candidate democrat jackson rose from modest beginnings on the south carolina fronnational republican adams tier to become one of the richest men in tennessee he had an abiding suspicion of banks and paper money and he shared the fears of many americans that the market revolution was a source of moral decay rather than progress.
a strong nationalist jackson nonetheless believed that the states not washington d c should be the focal point of governmental activity.
he opposed federal efforts to shape the economy or interfere in individuals private lives.
the party system by the time of jacksons presidency politics had become more than a series of political contests it was a spectacle a form of mass entertainment a part of americans daily lives.
every year witnessed elections to some office local state or national and millions took part in the parades and rallies organized by the parties.
politicians were popular heroes with mass followings and popular nicknames.
jackson was old hickory clay was harry of the west and van buren the little magician or to his critics the sly fox.
thousands of americans willingly attended lengthy political orations and debates.
an audience of 100 000 was said to have gathered on a massachusetts hillside to hear a speech by the great whig orator daniel webster.
politics one newspaper editor remarked seems to enter into everything indeed party machines headed by professional politicians reached into every neighborhood especially in cities.
they provided benefits like jobs to constituents and ensured that voters went to the polls on election day.
party functionaries were rewarded with political offices.
government posts jackson declared should be open to the people not reserved for a privileged class of permanent bureaucrats.
he introduced the principle of rotation in office called the spoils system by opponents into national government making loyalty to the party the main qualification for jobs like postmaster and customs official.
large national conventions where state leaders gathered to hammer out a platform now chose national candidates.
newspapers played a greater and greater role in politics.
nearly 400 were published in 1830 compared 5 16 5 9 electoral vote share 178 68 83 32 popular vote share 647 286 56 508 064 44 visions of freedom stump speaking.
in this painting from the 1850s george caleb bingham depicts a candidate in a county election addressing a group of voters an illustration of grassroots democracy in action.
one of the listeners appears about to question or challenge the speaker.
binghams paintings generally depict scenes in the american west including exploration landscapes and life on the missouri and mississippi rivers.
but he was also fascinated by democratic politics.
a founder of the whig party in missouri bingham himself ran for office several times and was elected to the state legislature in 1848.
questions 1.
what does the painting tell us about the extent and limits of american democracy in the mid nineteenth century.
what does the clothing of those in the painting indicate about their occupations or status.

to 90 in 1790.
every significant town it seemed had its democratic and whig papers whose job was not so much to report the news as to present the partys position on issues of the day.
jacksons kitchen cabinet an informal group of advisers who helped to write his speeches and supervise communication between the white house and local party officials mostly consisted of newspaper editors.
democrats and whigs there was more to party politics however than spectacle and organization.
jacksonian politics revolved around issues spawned by the market revolution and the continuing tension between national and sectional loyalties.
the central elements of political debate were the governments stance toward banks tariffs currency and internal improvements and the balance of power between national and local authority.
although both parties were coalitions of groups with varied sometimes contradictory approaches to the issues of the day the market revolution did much to determine their views and makeup.
democrats tended to be alarmed by the widening gap between social classes.
they warned that nonproducers bankers merchants and speculators were seeking to use connections with government to enhance their wealth to the disadvantage of the producing classes of farmers artisans and laborers.
they believed the government should adopt a hands off attitude toward the economy and not award special favors to entrenched economic interests.
all bank charters all acts of incorporation declared a democratic newspaper are calculated to enhance the power of wealth produce inequalities among the people and to subvert liberty if the national government removed itself from the economy ordinary americans could test their abilities in the fair competition of the self regulating market.
the democratic party attracted aspiring entrepreneurs who resented govern procession of victuallers a lithograph commemorating a parade of butchers through the streets of philadelphia in 1821.
their banner we feed the hungry illustrates the belief among members of the producing classes that their work led to practical benefits for society unlike the activities of nonproducers like bankers.

in this 1852 work a voter takes an oath while party workers dispense liquor seek to persuade voters and keep track of who has cast ballots.
the banner on the pole reads the will of the people the supreme law the slogan is meant to be ironic.
bingham includes a number of democratic politicians he accused of cheating him in a recent election.
the age of jackson ment aid to established businessmen as well as large numbers of farmers and city workingmen suspicious of new corporate enterprises.
poorer farming regions isolated from markets like the lower northwest and the southern backcountry tended to vote democratic.
whigs united behind the american system believing that via a protective tariff a national bank and aid to internal improvements the federal government could guide economic development.
they were strongest in the northeast the most rapidly modernizing region of the country.
most established businessmen and bankers supported their program of government promoted economic growth as did farmers in regions near rivers canals and the great lakes who benefited from economic changes or hoped to do so.
the counties of upstate new york along the erie canal for example became a whig stronghold while more isolated rural communities tended to vote democratic.
many slaveholders supported the democrats believing states rights to be slaverys first line of defense.
but like well to do merchants and industrialists in the north the largest southern planters generally voted whig.
public and private freedom the party battles of the jacksonian era reflected the clash between public and private definitions of american freedom and their relationship to governmental power a persistent tension in the nations history.
for democrats liberty was a private entitlement best secured by local governments and endangered by powerful national authority.
the limitation of power in every branch of our government wrote a democratic newspaper in 1842 is the only safeguard of liberty a splendid government was always built upon the ruins of popular rights under jackson even as democracy expanded the power of the national government waned.
weak national authority in the democratic view was essential to both private freedom and states rights the freedom of the individual in the social union and the freedom of the state in the federative union ralph waldo emerson called antebellum americans fanatics in freedom whose obsession expressed itself in hatred of tolls taxes turnpikes banks hierarchies governors yea almost laws democrats regularly condemned the faraway federal government as the greatest danger to liberty in america and identified government granted privilege as the root cause of social inequality.
during jacksons presidency democrats reduced expenditures lowered the tariff killed the national bank and refused pleas for federal aid to internal improvements.
by 1835 jackson had even managed to pay off the national debt.
as a result states replaced the federal government as the countrys main economic actors planning systems of canals and roads and chartering banks and other corporations.

politics and morality democrats moreover considered individual morality a private matter not a public concern.
they opposed attempts to impose a unified moral vision on society such as temperance legislation which restricted or outlawed the production and sale of liquor and laws prohibiting various kinds of entertainment on sundays.
as noted in chapter 9 catholic irish and german immigrants who began arriving in significant numbers in the 1830s flocked to the democratic party.
one reason was that they did not wish to have protestant moral standards enforced by the government.
in this country declared the new york journal of commerce in 1848 liberty is understood to be the absence of government from private affairs the test of public policies was not whether they enhanced the common good but the extent to which they allowed scope for free agency that is for individuals to make decisions pursue their interests and cultivate their unique talents without outside interference.
whigs for their part insisted that liberty and power reinforced each other.
a weak government wrote francis lieber the founding father of american political science was a negation of liberty an activist national government on the other hand could enhance the realm of freedom.
liberty whigs believed required a prosperous and moral america.
the government should create the conditions for balanced and regulated economic development thereby promoting a prosperity in which all classes and regions would share.
like the federalists before them wealthy whigs tended to view society as a hierarchy of social classes in contrast to the disorderly world of unrestrained individual competition embraced by many democrats.
but unlike most federalists they insisted that in the united states class status was not fixed since any individual could achieve upward mobility.
whigs moreover rejected the premise that the government must not interfere in private life.
to function as free that is self directed and selfdisciplined moral agents individuals required certain character traits which government could help to instill.
the role of government declared one new york whig was not simply to stand aside but actively to promote the welfare of the people many evangelical protestants supported the whigs convinced that via public education the building of schools and asylums temperance legislation and the like democratic governments could inculcate the principles of morality and during the jacksonian era popularly elected local authorities enacted numerous laws ordinances and regulations that tried to shape public morals by banning prostitution and the consumption of alcohol and regulating other kinds of personal behavior.
pennsylvania was as renowned in the nineteenth century for its stringent laws against profanity and desecrating the sabbath as it had been in the colonial era for its commitment to religious liberty.
south carolina and nullification andrew jackson it has been said left office with many more principles than he came in with.
elected as a military hero backed by an efficient party machinery he was soon forced to define his stance on public issues.
despite his commitment to states rights jacksons first term was dominated by a c h.
10 democracy in america 1815 1840 the age of jackson battle to uphold the supremacy of federal over state law.
the tariff of 1828 which raised taxes on imported manufactured goods made of wool as well as on raw materials like iron had aroused considerable opposition in the south nowhere more than in south carolina where it was called the tariff of abominations the states leaders no longer believed it possible or desirable to compete with the north in industrial development.
insisting that the tariff on imported manufactured goods raised the prices paid by southern consumers to benefit the north the legislature threatened to nullify it that is declare it null and void within their state.
the state with the largest proportion of slaves in its population 55 percent in 1830 south carolina was controlled by a tightly knit group of large planters.
they maintained their grip on power by a state constitution that gave plantation counties far greater representation in the legislature than their population warranted as well as through high property qualifications for officeholders.
they had been thoroughly alarmed by the missouri crisis and by the steady strengthening of national authority by john marshalls supreme court.
behind their economic complaints against the tariff lay the conviction that the federal government must be weakened lest it one day take action against slavery.
a cartoon published in 1833 at the height of the nullification controversy shows john c calhoun climbing steps including those marked nullification treason and civil war toward the goal of despotism he is flanked by james h hammond and robert y hayne two of south carolinas political leaders.
on the right president andrew jackson threatens to hang them.
calhouns political theory john c calhoun soon emerged as the leading theorist of nullification.
as the south began to fall behind the rest of the country in population calhoun had evolved from the nationalist of 1812 into a powerful defender of southern sectionalism.
having been elected vice president in 1828 calhoun at first remained behind the scenes secretly drafting the exposition and protest in which the south carolina legislature justified nullification.
the document drew on the arguments in the virginia and kentucky resolutions of 1798 discussed in chapter 8.
the national government calhoun insisted had been created by an agreement among sovereign states each of which retained the right to prevent the enforcement within its borders of acts of congress that exceeded the powers specifically spelled out in the constitution.
almost from the beginning of jacksons first term calhouns influence in the administration waned while secretary of state martin van buren emerged as the presidents closest adviser.
one incident that helped set jackson against calhoun occurred a few weeks after the inauguration.
led by calhouns wife floride washington society women ostracized peggy eaton the wife of jacksons secretary of war because she was the daughter of a washington tav i n w h a t w a y s d i d a n d r e w ja c k s o n e m b o d y t h e c o n t r a d i c t i o n s o f d e m o c r a t i c n a t i o n a l i s m.
ern keeper and allegedly a woman of easy virtue van buren a widower stood by her as did jackson who identified criticism of peggy eaton with the abuse his own wife had suffered during the campaign of 1828.
far weightier matters soon divided jackson and calhoun.
debate over nullification raged in washington.
in a memorable exchange in the senate in january 1830 daniel webster responded to south carolina senator robert y hayne a disciple of calhoun.
the people not the states declared webster created the constitution making the federal government sovereign.
he called nullification illegal unconstitutional and treasonous.
websters ending was widely hailed throughout the country liberty and union now and forever one and inseparable a few weeks later at a white house dinner jackson delivered a toast while fixing his gaze on calhoun our federal union it must be preserved calhouns reply came immediately the union next to our liberty most dear by 1831 calhoun had publicly emerged as the leading theorist of states rights.
the nullification crisis nullification was not a purely sectional issue.
south carolina stood alone during the crisis and several southern states passed resolutions condemning its action.
nonetheless the elaboration of the compact theory of the constitution gave the south a well developed political philosophy to which it would turn when sectional conflict became more intense.
calhoun denied that nullification was a step toward disunion.
on the contrary the only way to ensure the stability of a large diverse nation was for each state to be assured that national actions would never trample on its rights or vital interests.
according to calhouns theory of the concurrent majority each major interest including slaveholders should have a veto over all measures that affected it.
to jackson however nullification amounted to nothing less than disunion.
he dismissed calhouns constitutional arguments out of hand can anyone of common sense believe the absurdity that a faction of any state or a state has a right to secede and destroy this union and the liberty of the country with it the issue came to a head in 1832 when a new tariff was enacted.
despite a reduction in tariff rates south carolina declared the tax on imported goods null and void in the state after the following february.
in response jackson persuaded congress to enact a force bill authorizing him to use the army and navy to collect customs duties.
to avert a confrontation henry clay with calhouns assistance engineered the passage of a new tariff in 1833 further reducing duties.
south carolina then rescinded the ordinance of nullification although it proceeded to nullify the force act.
calhoun abandoned the democratic party for the whigs where with clay and webster he became part of a formida an 1834 print portrays the united states as a temple of liberty.

10 democracy in america 1815 1840 the age of jackson ble trio of political leaders even though the three agreed on virtually nothing except hostility to jackson.
it is perhaps ironic that andrew jackson a firm believer in states rights and limited government did more than any other individual to give an emotional aura to the idea of union and to offer an example of willingness to go to war if necessary to preserve what he considered the national governments legitimate powers.
indian black hawk and his son whirling thunder painted in 1833 by the artist john wesley jarvis shortly after the black hawk war.
jarvis hoped that traditional indian ways symbolized by the sons dress would be replaced by black hawks civilized appearance.
a lithograph from 1836 depicts sequoia with the alphabet of the cherokee language that he developed.
because of their written language and constitution the cherokee were considered by many white americans to be a civilized tribe removal the nullification crisis underscored jacksons commitment to the sovereignty of the nation.
his exclusion of indians from the eras assertive democratic nationalism led to the final act in the centuries long conflict between white americans and indians east of the mississippi river.
the last indian resistance to the advance of white settlement in the old northwest came in 1832 when federal troops and local militiamen routed the sauk leader black hawk who with about 1 000 followers attempted to reclaim ancestral land in illinois.
one of the illinois militiamen was the young abraham lincoln although as he later remarked he saw no action except against mosquitoes.
in the slave states the onward march of cotton cultivation placed enormous pressure on remaining indian holdings.
extending the area of slavery proclaimed thomas hart benton who represented missouri in the senate for thirty years required converting indian soil into slave soil during the 1820s missouri forced its indian population to leave the state.
soon the policy of expulsion was enacted in the older slave states.
one of the early laws of jacksons administration the indian removal act of 1830 provided funds for uprooting the so called five civilized tribes the cherokee chickasaw choctaw creek and seminole with a population of around 60 000 living in north carolina georgia florida alabama and mississippi.
the law marked a repudiation of the jeffersonian idea that civilized indians could be assimilated into the american population.
these tribes had made great efforts to become everything republican citizens should be.
the cherokee had taken the lead establishing schools adopting written laws and a constitution modeled on that of the united states and becoming successful farmers many of whom owned slaves.
but in his messages to congress jackson repeatedly referred to them as savages and supported georgias effort to seize cherokee land and nullify the tribes laws.
free citizens of the cherokee nation petitioned congress for aid in remaining in peace and quietude upon their ancient territory in good american fashion cherokee leaders also went to court to protect their rights guaranteed in treaties with the federal government.
their appeals forced the supreme court to clarify the unique status of american indians.
the supreme court and the indians in a crucial case involving indians in 1823 johnson v mintosh the court had proclaimed that indians were not in fact owners of their land but merely had a right of occupancy chief justice john marshall himself a speculator in western lands claimed that from the early colonial era indians had lived as nomads and hunters not farmers.

in cherokee nation v georgia 1831 marshall described indians as wards of the federal government.
they deserved paternal regard and protection but they lacked the standing as citizens that would allow the supreme court to enforce their rights.
the justices could not therefore block georgias effort to extend its jurisdiction over the tribe.
marshall however believed strongly in the supremacy of the federal government over the states.
in 1832 in worcester v georgia the court seemed to change its mind holding that indian nations were a distinct people with the right to maintain a separate political identity.
they must be dealt with by the federal government not the states and georgias actions violated the cherokees treaties with washington.
but despite his strong assertion of national supremacy in the nullification crisis jackson refused to recognize the validity of the worcester ruling.
john marshall has made his decision he supposedly declared now let him enforce it with legal appeals exhausted one faction of the tribe agreed to cede their lands but the majority led by john ross who had been elected principal chief under the cherokee constitution adopted a policy of passive resistance.

but the seminoles of sparsely settled florida resisted.
osceola one of the leaders of seminole resistance to removal was a red stick who had survived andrew jacksons assault on hostile creeks during the war of 1812.
the indians were assisted by escaped slaves.
as early as colonial times florida had been a refuge for fugitive slaves from south carolina and georgia to whom spanish officials offered freedom.
the administration of george washington attempted to persuade the seminoles to expel the fugitives but they refused.
georgia sent the militia into florida to recapture them but it was driven out by seminole and african american fighters.
in the second seminole war which lasted from 1835 to 1842 the first had followed american acquisition of florida in 1819 some 1 500 american soldiers and the same number of seminoles were killed and perhaps 3 000 indians and 500 blacks were forced to move to the west.
a small number of seminoles managed to remain in florida a tiny remnant of the once sizable indian population east of the mississippi river.
in 1831 william apess a descendant of metacom or king philip who had battled new england colonists in the 1670s published a son of the forest the first significant autobiography by a native american.

he later converted to methodism and became a revivalist preacher.
his book appealed for harmony between white americans and indians.

buffalo chase over prairie bluffs a painting from the 1830s by george catlin who created dozens of works depicting native americans in the trans mississippi west.
catlin saw himself as recording for posterity a vanishing way of life.
at the time millions of buffalo inhabited the west providing food and hides for native americans.
would be if the whites would act like civilized people and give every one his due apess wrote.
what do they the indians want.
you have only to look at the unjust laws made for them and say they want what i want removal was the alternative to the coexistence championed by apess.
it powerfully reinforced the racial definition of american nationhood and freedom.
at the time of independence indians had been a familiar presence in many parts of the united states.
john adams once recalled how when he was young local indians were frequent visitors in my fathers house and how he would visit a nearby indian family where i never failed to be treated with whortleberries blackberries strawberries or apples plums peaches etc by 1840 in the eyes of most whites east of the mississippi river they were simply a curiosity a relic of an earlier period of american history.
although indians still dominated the trans mississippi west as american settlement pushed relentlessly westward it was clear that their days of freedom there also were numbered.
t h e b a n k wa r a n d a f t e r biddles bank the central political struggle of the age of jackson was the presidents war on the bank of the united states.
the bank symbolized the hopes and fears inspired by the market revolution.
the expansion of banking helped to finance the nations economic development.
but many americans including jackson distrusted bankers as nonproducers who contributed nothing to the nations wealth but profited from the labor of others.
the tendency of banks to overissue paper money whose deterioration in value reduced the real income of wage earners reinforced this conviction.
jackson himself had c h.

president andrew jackson topples the building by brandishing his order removing federal funds from the bank.
led by nicholas biddle with the head of a demon the banks corrupt supporters flee among them henry clay daniel webster and newspaper editors allegedly paid by the institution.
the bank war and after long believed that hard money gold and silver was the only honest currency.
nonetheless when he assumed office there was little reason to believe that the bank war would become the major event of his presidency.
heading the bank was nicholas biddle of pennsylvania who during the 1820s had effectively used the institutions power discussed earlier in this chapter to curb the overissuing of money by local banks and to create a stable currency throughout the nation.
a snobbish aristocratic philadelphian biddle was as strong willed as jackson and as unwilling to back down in a fight.
in 1832 he told a congressional committee that his bank had the ability to destroy any state bank.
he hastened to add that he had never injured any of them.
but democrats wondered whether any institution public or private ought to possess such power.
many called it the monster bank an illegitimate union of political authority and entrenched economic privilege.
the issue of the banks future came to a head in 1832.
although the institutions charter would not expire until 1836 biddles allies persuaded congress to approve a bill extending it for another twenty years.
jackson saw the tactic as a form of blackmail if he did not sign the bill the bank would use its considerable resources to oppose his reelection.
the bank he told van buren is trying to destroy me but i will kill it jacksons veto message is perhaps the central document of his presidency.
its argument resonated with popular values.
in a democratic government jackson insisted it was unacceptable for congress to create a source of concentrated power and economic privilege unaccountable to the people.
it is to be regretted he declared that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes exclusive privileges like the banks charter widened the gap between the wealthy and the humble members of society the farmers mechanics and laborers jackson presented himself as the defender of these humble americans.
the bank war reflected how jackson enhanced the power of the presidency during his eight years in office proclaiming himself the symbolic representative of all the people.
he was the first president to use the veto power h o w d i d t h e b a n k wa r i n f l u e n c e t h e e c o n o m y a n d p a r t y c o m p e t i t i o n.
as a major weapon and to appeal directly to the public for political support over the head of congress.
whigs denounced him for usurping the power of the legislature.
they insisted that congress not the president represented the will of the people and that the veto power while created by the constitution should only be used in extraordinary circumstances.
but jacksons effective appeal to democratic popular sentiments helped him win a sweeping reelection victory in 1832 over the whig candidate henry clay.
his victory ensured the death of the bank of the united states.
ironically jacksons image today adorns the twenty dollar bill issued by the federal reserve bank in some respects a successor of the bank of the united states.
the pet banks and the economy what however would take the banks place.
two very different groups applauded jacksons veto state bankers who wished to free themselves from biddles regulations and issue more paper currency called soft money and hard money advocates who opposed all banks whether chartered by the states or the federal government and believed that gold and silver formed the only reliable currency.
during jacksons second term state bankers were in the ascendancy.
not content to wait for the charter of the bank of the united states to expire in 1836 jackson authorized the removal of federal funds from its vaults and their deposit in local banks.
not surprisingly political and personal connections often determined the choice of these pet banks the director of the maine bank of portland for example was the brother in law of levi woodbury a member of jacksons cabinet.
a justice of the supreme court recommended the planters bank of savannah.
two secretaries of the treasury refused to transfer federal money to the pet banks since the law creating the bank had specified that government funds could not be removed except for a good cause as communicated to congress.
jackson finally appointed attorney general roger b taney a loyal maryland democrat to the treasury post and he carried out the order.
when john marshall died in 1835 jackson rewarded taney by appointing him chief justice.
without government deposits the bank of the united states lost its ability to regulate the activities of state banks.
they issued more and more paper money partly to help finance the rapid expansion of industrial development in new england agriculture in the south and west and canal and railroad systems planned by the states.
the value of bank notes in circulation rose from 10 million in 1833 to 149 million in 1837.
prices rose dramatically and even though wages also increased they failed to keep pace.
as a result workers real wages the actual value of their pay declined.
numerous labor unions emerged which attempted to protect the earnings of urban workers.
speculators hastened to cash in on rising land prices.
using paper money they bought up huge blocks of public land which they resold to farmers or to eastern purchasers of lots in entirely nonexistent western towns.
states projected tens of millions of dollars in internal improvements.
the panic of inevitably the speculative boom collapsed.

the bank war and after it paid for in paper money often of questionable value.
in july 1836 the jackson administration issued the specie circular declaring that henceforth it would only accept gold and silver as payment for public land.
at the same time the bank of england increasingly suspicious about the value of american bank notes demanded that american merchants pay their creditors in london in gold or silver.
then an economic downturn in britain dampened demand for american cotton the countrys major export.
taken together these events triggered an economic collapse in the united states the panic of 1837 followed by a depression that lasted to 1843.
prices fell by 25 percent in the first year of the downturn.
businesses throughout the country failed and many farmers unable to meet mortgage payments because of declining income lost their land.
tens of thousands of urban workers saw their jobs disappear.
the fledgling labor movement collapsed as strikes became impossible given the surplus of unemployed labor.
by 1842 nine states had defaulted on their debts mostly incurred to finance ambitious internal improvement projects.
during the 1840s states amended their constitutions to prohibit legislatures from borrowing money issuing corporate charters and buying stock in private enterprises.
for the time being the jacksonians had succeeded in separating government both federal and state from the economy.
van buren in office the president forced to deal with the depression was martin van buren who had been elected in 1836 over three regional candidates put forward by the whigs in an attempt to maximize the partys electoral vote and throw the election into the house of representatives.
under van buren the hard money anti bank wing of the democratic party came to power.
in h o w d i d t h e b a n k wa r i n f l u e n c e t h e e c o n o m y a n d p a r t y c o m p e t i t i o n.
1837 the administration announced its intention to remove federal funds from the pet banks and hold them in the treasury department in washington under the control of government officials.
not until 1840 did congress approve the new policy known as the independent treasury which completely separated the federal government from the nations banking system.
it would be repealed in 1841 when the whigs returned to power but it was reinstated under president james k polk in 1846.
making federal funds unavailable for banks to use for investment would have dampened future economic growth had not the discovery of gold in california in 1848 poured new money into the economy.
the independent treasury split the democratic party.
business oriented democrats often connected with the state banks strongly opposed van burens policy and shifted wholesale to the whigs.
meanwhile the partys agrarian wing small farmers and urban laborers opposed to all banking and paper money and uncomfortable with the market revolution in general rallied to van buren.
many advocates of state sovereignty who had joined the whigs after the nullification crisis now returned to the democratic fold including van burens old nemesis john c calhoun.
the election of despite his reputation as a political magician van buren found that without jacksons personal popularity he could not hold the democratic coalition together.
in 1840 he also discovered that his whig opponents had mastered the political techniques he had helped to pioneer.
confronting an unprecedented opportunity for victory because of the continuing economic depression the whigs abandoned their most prominent leader henry clay and nominated william henry harrison.
like jackson when he first sought the presi a political cartoon from the 1840 presidential campaign shows public opinion as the almighty lever of politics in a democracy.
under the gaze of the american eagle loco foco democrats slide into an abyss while the people are poised to lift william henry harrison the whig candidate to victory.
10 democracy in america 1815 1840 suggested reading dency harrisons main claim to fame was military success against the british and indians during the war of 1812.
the party nominated harrison without a platform.
in a flood of publications banners parades and mass meetings they promoted him as the log cabin candidate the cham7 7 10 pion of the common man.
this tactic proved enormously effective even though it bore little relationship to the actu42 al life of the wealthy harrison.
the whigs also denounced van buren as an aristocrat who had squandered the peoples 5 9 hard earned money on expensive furniture china glass15 ware and gold spoons for the white house.
harrisons run11 ning mate was john tyler a states rights democrat from 4 7 virginia who had joined the whigs after the nullification crisis and did not follow calhoun back to the democrats.
on almost every issue of political significance tyler held views totally opposed to those of other whigs.

most of the cabinet resigned and his party repudiated him.
whig newspapers were soon calling the president his accidency and the executive ass.
tylers four years in office were nearly devoid of accomplishment.
if the campaign that resulted in the election of harrison and tyler demonstrated how a flourishing system of democratic politics had come into existence tylers lack of success showed that political parties had become central to american government.
without a party behind him a president could not govern.
but a storm was now gathering that would test the stability of american democracy and the statesmanship of its political leaders.

a new nation emerged from the civil war with slavery abolished and the meaning of freedom transformed for all americans.
despite the hope of some of the founders that slavery might die out the institution grew in size and economic importance as the nineteenth century progressed.
slavery expanded westward with the young republic and the slave population grew to nearly 4 million by 1860.
after the northern states abolished slavery it became the peculiar institution of the south the basis of a society growing ever more different from the rest of the country in economic structure and social values.
planters who dominated southern life also exerted enormous influence in national affairs.
they developed a defense of slavery that insisted the institution was the foundation of genuine freedom for white citizens.
slaves meanwhile created their own semiautonomous culture that nurtured from one generation to the next their hope for liberation from bondage.
nonetheless slavery was in some ways a national institution.
slave grown cotton a source of wealth to slaveowners also provided the raw material for the norths growing textile industry and became the countrys most important export.
during the 1820s and 1830s numerous social movements arose that worked to reform american society.
their inspiration lay primarily in the second great awakening the religious revivals that swept both north and south and offered salvation to sinners and improvement to society at large.
while some reform movements were national in scope others existed only in the north.
most notable among the latter was a new militant movement demanding the immediate abolition of slavery and the incorporation of blacks as equal citizens of the republic.
the abolitionists helped to focus discussions of freedom on the sharp contradiction between liberty and slavery.
they promoted an understanding of freedom as control over ones self and participation as an equal member in social and political life.
they not only helped to place the issue of slavery squarely on the national agenda but also inspired the stirrings of protest among a number of northern women whose work in the antislavery movement led them to resent their own lack of legal rights and educational and economic opportunities.
in the 1840s the conflict between free and slave societies moved to the center stage of american politics.
it did so as a result of the nations territorial expansion.
the acquisition of a vast new area of land as the result of the mexican war raised the question of whether slavery would be able to expand further westward.
by the 1850s this issue had destroyed the whig party weakened the democrats and led to the creation of an entirely new party the republicans dedicated to confining slavery to the states where it already existed.
exalting the superiority of northern society based on free labor to southern society based on slavery republicans elected abraham lincoln as president in 1860 even though he did not receive a single vote in most of the southern states.
in response seven slave states seceded from the union and formed a new nation the confederate states of america.
when southern forces fired on fort sumter an enclave of union control in charleston harbor they inaugurated the civil war by far the bloodiest conflict in american history.
begun as a struggle to preserve the union the civil war eventually became a crusade for emancipation which brought the nation what president lincoln called a new birth of freedom the norths failure to achieve military victory in the first two years of the war coupled with the actions of slaves who by the thousands abandoned the plantations to flee to union lines propelled the lincoln administration down the road to emancipation.
although it freed few slaves on the day it was issued january 1 1863 lincolns emancipation proclamation proved to be the turning point of the civil war for it announced that henceforth the union army would serve as an agent of freedom.
and by authorizing for the first time the enlistment of black men into the union army the proclamation raised the question of black citizenship in the postwar world.
the era of reconstruction that followed the civil war was a time of intense political and social conflict in which the definition of freedom and the question of who was entitled to enjoy it played a central role.
former slaves claimed that freedom meant full incorporation into american society with the same rights and opportunities whites enjoyed.
they also demanded that the government guarantee them access to land to provide an economic foundation for their freedom.
most southern whites believed that blacks should go back to work on the plantations enjoying very few political and civil rights.
andrew johnson who succeeded lincoln as president shared their view.
but the majority of northern republicans came to believe that the emancipated slaves should enjoy the same legal rights as whites.
in 1867 they granted black men in the south the right to vote.
during reconstruction northern republicans rewrote the laws and constitution to incorporate the ideal of equal citizenship for all americans regardless of race.
this was a dramatic expansion of the meaning of freedom.
in the south reconstruction witnessed a short lived period in which former slaves voted and held office alongside whites a remarkable experiment in interracial democracy.
on the other hand the former slaves failed to achieve the economic freedom they desired since the north proved unwilling to distribute land.
as a result most former slaves and increasing numbers of whites in the war devastated south found themselves confined to working as sharecroppers on land owned by others.
but the genuine advances achieved during reconstruction such as improved access to education exercise of political rights and the creation of new black institutions like independent churches produced a violent reaction by upholders of white supremacy.
during the 1870s the north retreated from its commitment to equality.
in 1877 reconstruction came to an end.
many of the rights guaranteed to the former slaves were violated in the years that followed.
although reconstruction only lasted from 1865 to 1877 the issues debated then forecast many of the controversies that would envelop american society in the decades that followed.
the definition of american citizenship the power of the federal government and its relationship to the states the future of political democracy in a society marked by increasing economic inequality all these were reconstruction issues and all reverberated in the gilded age and progressive era that followed.
the civil war era resolved the contradiction of the existence of slavery in a land that celebrated freedom.
but just as the american revolution left to nineteenth century americans the problem of slavery the civil war and reconstruction left to future generations the challenge of bringing genuine freedom to the descendants of slavery.

a photograph of frederick douglass the fugitive slave who became a prominent abolitionist taken between 1847 and 1852.
as a fellow abolitionist noted at the time the very look and bearing of douglass are an irresistible logic against the oppression of his race l i n an age of self made men no american rose more dramatically from humble origins to national and international distinction than frederick douglass.
born into slavery in 1818 he became a major figure in the crusade for abolition the drama of emancipation and the effort during reconstruction to give meaning to black freedom.
douglass was the son of a slave mother and an unidentified white man possibly his owner.
as a youth in maryland he gazed out at the ships in chesapeake bay seeing them as freedoms swift winged angels in violation of maryland law douglass learned to read and write initially with the assistance of his owners wife and then after her husband forbade her to continue with the help of local white children.
from that moment he later wrote he understood that knowledge was the pathway from slavery to freedom douglass experienced slavery in all its variety from work as a house servant and as a skilled craftsman in a baltimore shipyard to labor as a plantation field hand.
when he was fifteen douglasss owner sent him to a slave breaker to curb his independent spirit.
after numerous whippings douglass defiantly refused to allow himself to be disciplined again.
this confrontation he recalled was the turning point in my career as a slave it rekindled his desire for freedom.
in 1838 having borrowed the free papers of a black sailor he escaped to the north.
frederick douglass went on to become the most influential africanamerican of the nineteenth century and the nations preeminent advocate of racial equality.
he who has endured the cruel pangs of slavery he wrote is the man to advocate liberty douglass lectured against slavery throughout the north and the british isles and he edited a succession of antislavery publications.
he published a widely read autobiography that offered an eloquent condemnation of slavery and racism.
indeed his own accomplishments testified to the incorrectness of prevailing ideas about blacks inborn inferiority.
douglass was also active in other reform movements including the campaign for womens rights.
during the civil war he advised abraham lincoln on the employment of black soldiers and became an early advocate of giving the right to vote to the emancipated slaves.
douglass died in 1895 as a new system of white supremacy based on segregation and disenfranchisement was being fastened upon the south.
throughout his career douglass insisted that slavery could only be overthrown by continuous resistance.
those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation he declared are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters in effect douglass argued that in their desire for freedom the slaves were truer to the nations underlying principles than the white americans who annually celebrated the fourth of july while allowing the continued existence of slavery.
how did slavery shape social and economic relations in the old south.
the old south table 11 1 growth of the slave population when frederick douglass was born slavery was already an old institution in america.
two centuries had passed since the first twenty africans were landed in virginia from a dutch ship.
after abolition in the north slavery had become the peculiar institution of the south that is an institution unique to southern society.
the mason dixon line drawn by two surveyors in the eighteenth century to settle a boundary dispute between maryland and pennsylvania eventually became the dividing line between slavery and freedom.
despite the hope of some of the founders that slavery might die out in fact the institution survived the crisis of the american revolution and rapidly expanded westward.
during the first thirty years of douglasss life the number of slaves and the economic and political importance of slavery continued to grow.
on the eve of the civil war the slave population had risen to nearly 4 million its high rate of natural increase more than making up for the prohibition in 1808 of further slave imports from africa.
in the south as a whole slaves made up one third of the total population and in the cotton producing states of the deep south around half.
by the 1850s slavery had crossed the mississippi river and was expanding rapidly in arkansas louisiana and eastern texas.
in 1860 one third of the nations cotton crop was grown west of the mississippi.

and although slavery survived in brazil and the spanish and french caribbean its abolition in the british empire in 1833 made the united states indisputably the center of new world slavery.

by 1860 a significant percentage of the slave population had been transported from the atlantic coast to the deep south via the internal slave trade.
300 miles 300 kilometers when measured by slaverys geographic extent the numbers held in bondage and the institutions economic importance both regionally and nationally the old south was the largest and most powerful slave society the modern world has known.
its strength rested on a virtual monopoly of cotton the souths white gold cotton had been grown for thousands of years in many parts of the globe.
the conquistador hernn corts was impressed by the high quality of woven cotton clothing worn by the aztecs.
but in the nineteenth century cotton assumed an unprecedented role in the world economy.
because the early industrial revolution centered on factories using cotton as the raw material to manufacture cloth cotton had become by far the most important commodity in international trade.
and three fourths of the worlds cotton supply came from the southern united states.
throughout the world hundreds of thousands of workers loaded unloaded spun and wove cotton and thousands of manufacturers and merchants owed their wealth to the cotton trade.
textile manufacturers in places as far flung as massachusetts lancashire in great britain normandy in france and the suburbs of moscow depended on a regular supply of american cotton.
as early as 1803 cotton had become the most important american export.
cotton sales earned the money from abroad that allowed the united states to pay for imported manufactured goods.
on the eve of the civil war it represented well over half of the total value of american exports.
in 1860 how did slavery shape social and economic relations in the old south.
the economic investment represented by the slave population exceeded the value of the nations factories railroads and banks combined.
the second middle passage as noted in chapter 9 to replace the slave trade from africa which had been prohibited by congress in 1808 a massive trade in slaves developed within the united states.
more than 2 million slaves were sold between 1820 and 1860 a majority to local buyers but hundreds of thousands from older states to importing states of the lower south.
slave trading was a visible established business.
the main business districts of southern cities contained the offices of slave traders complete with signs reading negro sales or negroes bought here auctions of slaves took place at public slave markets as in new orleans or at courthouses.
southern newspapers carried advertisements for slave sales southern banks financed slave trading southern ships and railroads carried slaves from buyers to sellers and southern states and municipalities earned revenue by taxing the sale of slaves.
virtually every slaveowner at one time or another bought and sold slaves.
the cotton kingdom could not have arisen without the internal slave trade and the economies of older states like virginia came increasingly to rely on the sale of slaves.

the free states had ended slavery but they were hardly unaffected by it.
the constitution as we have seen enhanced the power of the south in the house of representatives and electoral college and required all states to return fugitives from bondage.
slavery shaped the lives of all americans white as well as black.
it helped to determine where they lived how they worked and under what conditions they could exercise their freedoms of speech assembly and the press.
northern merchants and manufacturers participated in the slave economy and shared in its profits.
money earned in the cotton trade helped to finance industrial development and internal improvements in the north.
northern ships carried cotton to new york and europe northern bankers financed cotton plantations northern companies insured slave property and northern factories turned cotton into cloth.
new york citys rise to commercial prominence depended as much on the establishment of shipping lines that gathered the souths cotton and transported it to europe as on the erie canal.
the lords of the loom new englands early factory owners relied on cotton supplied by the lords of the lash southern slaveowners.
northern manufacturers like brooks brothers supplied cheap fabrics called negro cloth to clothe the souths slaves.

dealers like griggs played a crucial role in moving slaves from the upper south to the burgeoning cotton kingdom of the gulf coast states.
11 the peculiar institution this 1860 view of new orleans captures the size and scale of the cotton trade in the souths largest city.
more than 3 500 steamboats arrived in new orleans in 1860.
the the old south southern economy there was no single south before the civil war.
in the eight slave states of the upper south slaves and slaveowners made up a smaller percentage of the total population than in the seven deep south states that stretched from south carolina west to texas.
the upper south had major centers of industry in baltimore richmond and st louis and its economies were more diversified than those in the deep south which was heavily dependent on cotton.
not surprisingly during the secession crisis of 1860 1861 the deep south states were the first to leave the union.
even after the war began four upper south states delaware maryland kentucky and missouri refused to join the confederacy.
nonetheless slavery led the south down a very different path of economic development than the norths limiting the growth of industry discouraging immigrants from entering the region and inhibiting technological progress.
the south did not share in the urban growth experienced by the rest of the country.
most southern cities were located on the regions periphery and served mainly as centers for gathering and shipping cotton.
southern banks existed primarily to help finance the plantations.
they loaned money for the purchase of land and slaves not manufacturing development.
southern railroads mostly consisted of short lines that brought cotton from the interior to coastal ports.
in the cotton kingdom the only city of significant size was new orleans.
with a population of 168 000 in 1860 new orleans ranked as the nations sixth largest city.
as the gathering point for cotton grown along the mississippi river and sugar from the plantations of southeastern louisiana it was the worlds leading exporter of slave grown crops.
unlike other cities with slavery apart from st louis and baltimore on the periphery of the south new orleans also attracted large numbers of european immigrants.
in 1860 40 percent of its population was foreign born.
and new orleanss how did slavery shape social and economic relations in the old south.
rich french heritage and close connections with the caribbean produced a local culture quite different from that of the rest of the united states reflected in the citys distinctive music dance religion and cuisine.
in 1860 the south produced less than 10 percent of the nations manufactured goods.
many northerners viewed slavery as an obstacle to american economic progress.
but as new orleans showed slavery and economic growth could go hand in hand.
in general the southern economy was hardly stagnant and slavery proved very profitable for most owners.
the profits produced by slavery for the south and the nation as a whole formed a powerful obstacle to abolition.
speaking of cotton senator james henry hammond of south carolina declared no power on earth dares to make war upon it.
cotton is king plain folk of the old south the foundation of the old souths economy slavery powerfully shaped race relations politics religion and the law.
its influence was pervasive nothing escaped writes one historian nothing and no one this was true despite the fact that the majority of white southerners three out of four white families owned no slaves.
since planters monopolized the best land most small white farmers lived outside the plantation belt in hilly areas unsuitable for cotton production.
they worked the land using family labor rather than slaves or hired workers.
many southern farmers lived lives of economic self sufficiency remote from the market revolution.
they raised livestock and grew food for their families purchasing relatively few goods at local stores.
those residing on marginal land in isolated hill areas and the appalachian mountains were often desperately poor and since nearly all the southern states lacked systems of free public education were more often illiterate than their northern counterparts.
not until the arrival of railroads and coal mining later in the nineteenth century would such areas become integrated into the market economy.
most yeoman farmers enjoyed a comfortable standard of living and many owned a slave or two.
but even successful small farmers relied heavily on home production to supply their basic needs.
unlike northern farmers therefore they did not provide a market for manufactured goods.
this was one of the main reasons why the south did not develop an industrial base.
some poorer whites resented the power and privileges of the great planters.
politicians like andrew johnson of tennessee and joseph brown of georgia rose to power as self proclaimed spokesmen of the common man against the slaveocracy but most poor whites made their peace with the planters in whose hands economic and social power was concentrated.

this photograph was taken in 1862 but reflects the prewar way of life.
11 the peculiar institution the old south the face of outside criticism all served to cement bonds between planters and the souths plain folk in the plantation regions moreover small farmers manned the slave patrols that kept a lookout for runaway slaves and those on the roads without permission.
non slaveholders frequently rented slaves from planters and regularly elected slaveowners to public offices in the south.
like other white southerners most small farmers believed their economic and personal freedom rested on slavery.
not until the civil war would class tensions among the white population threaten the planters domination.
the a detail from normans chart of the lower mississppi river 1858 shows slave plantations laid out so that each fronted on the river and therefore had easy access to the market.
planter class even among slaveholders the planter was far from typical.
in 1850 a majority of slaveholding families owned five or fewer slaves.
less than 40 000 families possessed the twenty or more slaves that qualified them as planters.
fewer than 2 000 families owned a hundred slaves or more.
nonetheless even though the planter was not the typical slaveholder or white southerner his values and aspirations dominated southern life.
the plantation wrote frederick douglass was a little nation by itself with its own language its own rules regulations and customs these rules and customs set the tone for southern society.
ownership of slaves provided the route to wealth status and influence.
planters not only held the majority of slaves but they controlled the most fertile land enjoyed the highest incomes and dominated state and local offices and the leadership of both political parties.
small slaveholders aspired to move up into the ranks of the planter class.
those who acquired wealth almost always invested it in land and slaves.
but as the price of a prime field hand rose from 1 000 in 1840 to 1 800 in 1860 the latter figure equivalent to around 40 000 today it became more and more difficult for poorer white southerners to become slaveholders.
slavery of course was a profit making system and slaveowners kept close watch on world prices for their products invested in enterprises such as railroads and canals and carefully supervised their plantations.
their wives the plantation mistresses idealized in southern lore for femininity beauty and dependence on men were hardly idle.
they cared for sick slaves directed the domestic servants and supervised the entire plantation when their husbands were away.
the wealthiest americans before the civil war were planters in the south carolina low country and the cotton region around natchez mississippi.
frederick stanton a cotton broker turned planter in the natchez area owned 444 slaves and more than 15 000 acres of land in mississippi and louisiana.
nonetheless alexis de tocqueville observed that the northerner loves to make money the southerner to spend it many of the richest planters squandered their wealth in a lifestyle complete with lavish entertain ments and summer vacations in newport and saratoga.
house slaves were so numerous in charleston wrote one visitor to the city that the charlestonians are obliged to exercise their wits to devise sufficient variety to keep them employed on the cotton how did slavery shape social and economic relations in the old south.
frontier many planters lived in crude log homes.
but in the older slave states and as settled society developed in the deep south they constructed elegant mansions adorned with white columns in the greek revival style of architecture.
planters discouraged their sons from entering lowly trades like commerce and manufacturing one reason why the south remained overwhelmingly agricultural.
table 11 2 slaveholding 1850 in round numbers number of slaves owned the paternalist ethos the slave plantation was deeply embedded in the world market and planters sought to accumulate land slaves and profits.
many invested in railroads and banks as well as slaves.
but planters values glorified not the competitive capitalist marketplace but a hierarchical agrarian society in which slaveholding gentlemen took personal responsibility for the physical and moral well being of their dependents women children and slaves.
the master wrote one planter as the head of the system has a right to the obedience and labor of the slave but the slave has also his mutual rights in the master the right of protection the right of counsel and guidance the right of subsistence the right of care and attention in sickness and old age this outlook known as paternalism from the latin word for father had been a feature of american slavery even in the eighteenth century.
but it became more ingrained after the closing of the african slave trade in 1808 which narrowed the cultural gap between master and slave and gave owners an economic interest in the survival of their human property.
unlike the absentee planters of the west indies many of whom resided in great britain southern slaveholders lived on their plantations and thus had year round contact with their slaves.
the paternalist outlook both masked and justified the brutal reality of slavery.
it enabled slaveowners to think of themselves as kind responsible masters even as they bought and sold their human property a practice at odds with the claim that slaves formed part of the masters family some slaveowners tried to reform the system to eliminate its most oppressive features.
the reverend charles c jones a wealthy planter of liberty county georgia organized his neighbors to promote the religious instruction of slaves improve slave housing diet and medical care and discourage severe punishments.
but even jones believed his slaves so degraded and lacking in moral self discipline that he could not contemplate an end to slavery.

in the south for example both upper and lowerclass whites adhered to a code of personal honor in which men were expected to defend with violence if necessary their own reputation and that of their families.
although dueling was illegal many prominent southerners took part in duels to avenge supposed insults.
in 1826 henry clay and john randolph two of the most important southern political leaders fought a duel with pistols after clay took exception to criticisms by randolph on the floor of congress.
fortunately each missed the other.
twenty years later however john h pleasants editor of the richmond whig died in a duel with the son of a rival newspaperman.

just as southern men had a heightened sense of their own honor and masculinity white southern women even more than in the north were confined within the domestic circle a man loves his children wrote george fitzhugh a virginia lawyer and author of numerous books and articles on social issues because they are weak helpless and dependent.
he loves his wife for similar reasons as will be discussed in the next chapter many northern women before the civil war became part of a thriving female culture centered on voluntary religious and reform organizations.
few parallels existed in the south and plantation mistresses often complained of loneliness and isolation.
the proslavery argument some southerners worried about their standing in the eyes of the world especially how others viewed the intellectual life of their region.
we of the south one wrote must to europe continue to appear inferior to the north in intellectual cultivation the free states outstripped the slave states in public education the number of colleges and in newspapers literary journals and other publications.
nonetheless the life of the mind flourished in the old south and the region did not lack for novelists political philosophers scientists and the like.
how did slavery shape social and economic relations in the old south.
in the thirty years before the outbreak of the civil war however even as northern criticism of the peculiar institution began to deepen proslavery thought came to dominate southern public life.
fewer and fewer white southerners shared the view common among the founding fathers that slavery was at best a necessary evil many in the south john c calhoun proclaimed in 1837 once believed that slavery was a moral and political evil.
that folly and delusion are gone we see it now in its true light and regard it as the most safe and stable basis for free institutions in the world even those who had no direct stake in slavery shared with planters a deep commitment to white supremacy.
indeed racism the belief that blacks were innately inferior to whites and unsuited for life in any condition other than slavery formed one pillar of the proslavery ideology.
most slaveholders also found legitimation for slavery in biblical passages such as the injunction that servants should obey their masters.
others argued that slavery was essential to human progress.
had not the ancient republics of greece and rome and the great european empires of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries rested on slave labor.
without slavery planters would be unable to cultivate the arts sciences and other civilized pursuits.
still other defenders of slavery insisted that the institution guaranteed equality for whites by preventing the growth of a class doomed to a life of unskilled labor.
like northerners they claimed to be committed to the ideal of freedom.
slavery for blacks they declared was the surest guarantee of perfect equality among whites liberating them from the low menial jobs like factory labor and domestic service performed by wage laborers in the north.
slavery made possible the considerable degree of economic autonomy the social condition of freedom enjoyed not only by planters but by non slaveholding whites.
because of slavery claimed one congressman white southerners were as independent as the bird which cleaves the air and because independence was necessary for citizenship slavery was the cornerstone of our republican edifice abolition in the americas american slaveowners were well aware of developments in slave systems elsewhere in the western hemisphere.
as noted in chapter 8 the slave revolution in haiti sent shock waves of fear throughout the american south.
white southerners were further alarmed by slave uprisings early in the nineteenth century in barbados british guiana and jamaica.

how did slavery shape social and economic relations in the old south.
hemisphere in the first four decades of the century.
in these years slavery was abolished in most of spanish america and in the british empire.
in most latin american nations the end of slavery followed the pattern established earlier in the northern united states gradual emancipation accompanied by some kind of recognition of the owners legal right to property in slaves.
these laws of the free womb allowed slaveholders to retain ownership of existing slaves while freeing their slaves children after they worked for the mothers owner for a specified number of years.
such laws wrote one official respected the past and corrected only the future abolition was far swifter in the british empire where parliament in 1833 mandated almost immediate emancipation with a seven year transitional period of apprenticeship this system produced so much conflict between former master and former slave that britain decreed complete freedom in 1838.
the law appropriated 20 million pounds to compensate the owners.
the experience of emancipation in other parts of the hemisphere strongly affected debates over slavery in the united states.
southern slaveowners judged the vitality of the caribbean economy by how much sugar and other crops it produced for the world market.
since many former slaves preferred to grow food for their own families defenders of slavery in the united states charged that british emancipation had been a failure.
abolitionists disagreed pointing to the rising standard of living of freed slaves the spread of education among them and other improvements in their lives.
but the stark fact remained that in a hemispheric perspective slavery was a declining institution.
by 1840 slavery had been outlawed in mexico central america and chile and only small numbers of aging slaves remained in venezuela colombia and peru.
during the european revolutions of 1848 france and denmark emancipated their colonial slaves.
at mid century significant new world slave systems remained only in cuba puerto rico brazil and the united states.
slavery and liberty many white southerners declared themselves the true heirs of the american revolution.
they claimed to be inspired by the same spirit of freedom and independence that motivated the founding generation.
like their ancestors of the 1760s and 1770s their political language was filled with contrasts between liberty and slavery and complaints that outsiders proposed to reduce them to slaves by interfering with their local institutions.
southern state constitutions enshrined the idea of equal rights for free men and the south participated fully in the movement toward political democracy for whites.
beginning in the 1830s however proslavery writers began to question the ideals of liberty equality and democracy so widely shared elsewhere in the nation.
south carolina the only southern state where a majority of white families owned slaves became the home of an aggressive defense of slavery that repudiated the idea that freedom and equality were universal entitlements.
the language of the declaration of independence that all men were created equal and entitled to liberty was the most false and dangerous of all political errors insisted john c calhoun.

11 the peculiar institution the old south spokesmen returned to the older definition of freedom as a privilege rather than a universal entitlement a reward to be earned not a blessing to be gratuitously lavished on all alike as the sectional controversy intensified after 1830 a number of southern writers and politicians came to defend slavery less as the basis of equality for whites than as the foundation of an organic hierarchical society.
many southern clergymen in the course of offering a religious defense of slavery argued that inequality and hence the submission of inferior to superior black to white female to male lower classes to upper classes was a fundamental law of human existence.
a hierarchy of ranks and orders in human society insisted john b alger a presbyterian minister in south carolina formed part of the divine arrangement of the world.
slavery and civilization the virginia writer george fitzhugh took the argument to its most radical conclusion repudiating not only jeffersonian ideals but the notion of americas special mission in the world.
far from being the natural condition of mankind fitzhugh wrote universal liberty was the exception an experiment carried on for a little while in a corner of europe and the northern united states.
taking the world and its history as a whole slavery without regard to race and color was the general.
normal natural basis of civilized society indeed wrote fitzhugh slaveowners and slaves shared a community of interest unknown in free society since they lacked economic cares he contended the negro slaves of the south are the happiest and in some degree the freest people in the world white workers in both the north and south according to fitzhugh would fare better having individual owners rather than living as slaves of the economic marketplace.
it seems safe to assume that few non slaveholding white southerners agreed that enslavement would offer them greater freedom than they already enjoyed.
nor was fitzhugh entirely consistent.
sometimes he argued that all free laborers would be better off as slaves.
on other occasions he spoke of slavery only for blacks perpetual children for whom liberty would be a curse abraham lincoln would later observe that the essential function of the proslavery argument was to serve the interests of those who benefited from a system of extreme inequality.
he imagined dr frederick a ross a leading proslavery clergyman considering whether he should free his slave sambo.
gods view of the subject lincoln noted was not entirely clear and no one thinks of asking sambos opinion therefore it fell to dr ross to decide the question.
if he decides that god wills sambo to continue a slave lincoln wrote he thereby retains his own comfortable position but if he decides that god wills sambo to be free he thereby has to walk out of the shade take off his gloves and work for his own bread under these circumstances it was hardly surprising that dr ross found the argument that sambo should remain a slave very persuasive.
after 1830 southern writers newspaper editors politicians and clergymen increasingly devoted themselves to spreading the defense of slavery.
the majority of white southerners came to believe that freedom for whites rested on the power to command the labor of blacks.
in the words of the richmond enquirer freedom is not possible without slavery how did slavery shape social and economic relations in the old south.
l i f e u n d e r s l av e ry slaves and the law for slaves the peculiar institution meant a life of incessant toil brutal punishment and the constant fear that their families would be destroyed by sale.
before the law slaves were property.
although they had a few legal rights all states made it illegal to kill a slave except in self defense and slaves accused of serious crimes were entitled to their day in court before all white judges and juries these were haphazardly enforced.
slaves could be sold or leased by their owners at will and lacked any voice in the governments that ruled over them.
they could not testify in court against a white person sign contracts or acquire property own firearms hold meetings unless a white person was present or leave the farm or plantation without the permission of their owner.
by the 1830s it was against the law to teach a slave to read or write.
not all of these laws were rigorously enforced.
some members of slaveholding families taught slave children to read although rather few since well over 90 percent of the slave population was illiterate in 1860.
in the south carolina rice fields owners allowed some slaves to carry shotguns in defiance of the law to scare off birds feasting on rice seeds.
it was quite common throughout the south for slaves to gather without white supervision at crossroads villages and country stores on sunday their day of rest.
but the extent to which authorities enforced or bent the law depended on the decisions of the individual owners.
the slave declared a louisiana law owes to his master.
a respect without bounds and an absolute obedience not only did the owner have the legal right to what alabamas legal code called the time labor and services of his slaves but no aspect of their lives from the choice of marriage partners to how they spent their free time was immune from his interference.
the entire system of southern justice from the state militia and courts down to armed patrols in each locality was designed to enforce the masters control over the person and labor of his slaves.
in one famous case a missouri court considered the crime of celia a slave who had killed her master in 1855 while resisting a sexual assault.
state law deemed any woman in such circumstances to be acting in selfdefense.
but celia the court ruled was not a woman in the eyes of the law.
she was a slave whose master had complete power over her person.
the court sentenced her to death.
however since celia was pregnant her execution was postponed until the child was born so as not to deprive her owners heirs of their property rights.
conditions of slave life as the nineteenth century progressed some southern states enacted laws to prevent the mistreatment of slaves and their material living conditions improved.
food supplies and wild game were abundant in the south and many slaves supplemented the food provided by their owners primarily cornmeal and pork or bacon with chickens and vegetables they raised themselves animals they hunted in the forests and not infrequently items they stole from the plantation smokehouse.

two years later learning that a slave catcher was in the neighborhood the tapers fled to canada.
in 1840 taper wrote to a white acquaintance in virginia recounting some of his experiences.
the biblical passage to which taper refers reads and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the lord of hosts dear sir i now take the opportunity to inform you that i am in brutes.

an advocate of rigorous plantation discipline he drew up a series of strict rules which he recommended to other owners.
if i employ a laborer to perform a certain quantum of work per day and i agree to pay him a certain amount for the performance of said work when he has accomplished it i of course have no further claim on him for his time or services but how different is it with a slave.
if i furnish my negro with every necessary of life without the least care on his part if i support him in sickness however long it may be and pay all his expenses though he does nothing if i maintain him in his no negro shall leave the place at any time without my permission.
no negro shall be allowed to marry out of the plantation.
no negro shall be allowed to sell anything without my express permission.
i have ever maintained the doctrine that my negroes have no time whatever that they are always liable to my call without questioning for a moment the propriety of it.
i adhere to this on the grounds of expediency and right.
the very security of the plantation requires that a general and uniform control over the people of it should be exercised.

11 the peculiar institution life under slavery parts in the west indies and brazil american slaves enjoyed better diets lower rates of infant mortality and longer life expectancies.
many factors contributed to improving material conditions.
one was the growing strength of the planters paternalist outlook.
douglass himself noted that not to give a slave enough to eat is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders most of the south moreover lies outside the geographical area where tropical diseases like malaria yellow fever and typhoid fever flourish so health among all southerners was better than in the caribbean.
and with the price of slaves rising dramatically after the closing of the african slave trade it made economic sense for owners to become concerned with the health and living conditions of their human property.
improvements in the slaves living conditions were meant to strengthen slavery not undermine it.
even as the material lives of the majority of slaves improved the south drew tighter and tighter the chains of bondage.
if slaves in the united states enjoyed better health and diets than elsewhere in the western hemisphere they had far less access to freedom.
in brazil it was not uncommon for an owner to free slaves as a form of celebration on the occasion of a wedding in the owners family for example or to allow slaves to purchase their freedom.
although slavery in brazil lasted until 1888 more than half the population of african descent was already free in 1850.
the comparable figure in the american south was well below 10 percent.
in the nineteenth century south more and more states set limits on voluntary manumission requiring that such acts be approved by the legislature.
all the powers of earth declared abraham lincoln in 1857 seemed to be rapidly combining to fasten bondage ever more securely upon american slaves.
few slave societies in history have so systematically closed off all avenues to freedom as the old south.
free blacks in the old south the existence of slavery helped to define the status of those blacks who did enjoy freedom.
on the eve of the civil war nearly half a million free blacks lived in the united states a majority in the south.
most were the descendants of slaves freed by southern owners in the aftermath of the revolution or by the gradual emancipation laws of the northern states.
their numbers were supplemented by slaves who had been voluntarily liberated by their masters who had been allowed to purchase their freedom or who succeeded in running away.
when followed by black or negro the word free took on an entirely new meaning.
whites defined their freedom in part by their distance from slavery.
but among blacks wrote douglass the distinction between the slave and the free is not great northern free blacks as noted in chapter 10 generally could not vote and enjoyed few economic opportunities.
free blacks in the south could legally own property and marry and of course could not be bought and sold.

free blacks had no voice in selecting public officials.

some new orleans free blacks sent their children to france for an education.
these elite free blacks did everything they could to maintain a separation from the slave population.
the brown fellowship society of charleston for example would not even allow dark skinned free men to join.
even in these cities however most free blacks were poor unskilled laborers.
in the upper south where the large majority of southern free blacks lived they generally worked for wages as farm laborers.
here where tobacco had exhausted the soil many planters shifted to grain production which required less year round labor.
they sold off many slaves to the lower south and freed others.
by 1860 half the african american population of maryland was free.
planters hired local free blacks to work alongside their slaves at harvest time.
free blacks in virginia and maryland were closely tied to the slave community and often had relatives in bondage.
some owned slaves but usually these were free men who had purchased their slave wives and children but could not liberate them because the law required any slave who became free to leave the state.
overall in the words of willis a hodges a member of a free virginia family that helped runaways to reach the north free blacks and slaves were one man of sorrow slave labor first and foremost slavery was a system of labor from sunup to first dark with only brief interruptions for meals work occupied most of the slaves time.
large plantations were diversified communities where slaves performed all kinds of work.
the 125 slaves on one plantation for instance included a butler two waitresses a nurse a dairymaid a gardener ten carpenters and two shoemakers.
other plantations counted among their slaves engineers blacksmiths and weavers as well as domestic workers from cooks to coachmen.
slaves cut wood to provide fuel for steamboats worked in iron and coal mines manned the docks in southern seaports and laid railroad track.
they were set to work by local authorities to construct and repair bridges roads and other facilities and by the federal government to build forts and other public buildings in the south.
businessmen merchants lawyers and civil servants owned slaves and by 1860 some 200 000 worked in industry especially in the ironworks and tobacco factories of the upper south.
in southern cities thousands were employed as unskilled laborers and skilled artisans.
reliance on unfree labor moreover extended well beyond the ranks of slaveholders for as noted earlier many small farmers and manufacturers rented slaves from plantation owners.

300 miles 300 kilometers slaves however lived and worked on plantations in the cotton belt where men women and children labored in gangs often under the direction of an overseer and perhaps a slave driver who assisted him.
among slaves overseers had a reputation for meting out harsh treatment.
the requisite qualifications for an overseer wrote solomon northup a free black who spent twelve years in slavery after being kidnapped from the north are utter heartlessness brutality and cruelty.
it is his business to produce large crops no matter what the cost the 150 000 slaves who worked in the sugar fields of southern louisiana also labored in large gangs.
conditions here were among the harshest in the south for the late fall harvest season required round the clock labor to cut and process the sugarcane before it spoiled.
on the rice plantations of south carolina and georgia the system of task labor which had originated in the colonial era prevailed.
with few whites willing to venture into the malariainfested swamps slaves were assigned daily tasks and allowed to set their what were the legal and material constraints on slaves lives and work.
own pace of work.
once a slaves task had been completed he or she could spend the rest of the day hunting fishing or cultivating garden crops.
slavery in the cities from the slaves point of view slavery in the different regions of the south could be worse in some respects and better in others.
slaves in the rice fields for example endured harsh working conditions but enjoyed more independence than other rural slaves because of the task system of labor and the absence of a large resident white population.
skilled urban craftsmen also enjoyed considerable autonomy.
most city slaves were servants cooks and other domestic laborers.
but owners sometimes allowed those with craft skills to hire their own time this meant that they could make work arrangements individually with employers with most of the wages going to the slaves owner.
many urban slaves even lived on their own.
but slaveholders increasingly became convinced that as one wrote the growing independence of skilled urban slaves exerts a most injurious influence upon the relation of master and servant for this reason many owners in the 1850s sold city slaves to the countryside and sought replacements among skilled white labor.
during his time in baltimore frederick douglass sought my own employment made my own contracts and collected my own earnings compared to conditions on the plantation he concluded i was really well off douglass hastened to add however that his favored treatment in no way lessened his desire for freedom it was slavery not its mere incidents that i hated maintaining order slaveowners employed a variety of means in their attempts to maintain order and discipline among their human property and persuade them to labor productively.
at base the system rested on force.
masters had almost complete discretion in inflicting punishment and rare was the slave who went through his or her life without experiencing a whipping.
josiah henson who escaped to the north and published an autobiography wrote that he could never erase from his memory the traumatic experience of seeing his father brutally whipped for striking a white man.
any infraction of plantation rules no matter how minor could be punished by the lash.

11 the peculiar institution a public whipping of slaves in lexington missouri in 1856 an illustration from the abolitionist publication the suppressed book about slavery.
whipping was a common form of punishment for slaves.
s l a v e c u lt u r e exploited divisions among the slaves especially between field hands and house servants.
they created systems of incentives that rewarded good work with time off or even money payments.
one virginia slaveholder gave his slaves ten cents per day for good work and reported that this made them labor with as much steadiness and cheerfulness as whites thereby saving all the expense of overseers probably the most powerful weapon wielded by slaveowners was the threat of sale which separated slaves from their immediate families and from the communities that despite overwhelming odds african americans created on plantations throughout the south.
s l a v e c u lt u r e slaves never abandoned their desire for freedom or their determination to resist total white control over their lives.
in the face of grim realities they succeeded in forging a semi independent culture centered on the family and church.
this enabled them to survive the experience of bondage without surrendering their self esteem and to pass from generation to generation a set of ideas and values fundamentally at odds with those of their masters.
slave culture drew on the african heritage.
african influences were evident in the slaves music and dances style of religious worship and the use of herbs by slave healers to combat disease.
given the primitive nature of professional medical treatment some whites sought out slave healers instead of trained physicians.
unlike the plantation regions of the caribbean and brazil where the african slave trade continued into the nineteenth century and the black population far outnumbered the white most slaves in the united states were american born and lived amidst a white majority.
slave culture was a new creation shaped by african traditions and american values and experiences.
the slave fa m i ly at the center of the slave community stood the family.
on the sugar plantations of the west indies the number of males far exceeded that of females the workers lived in barracks type buildings and settled family life was nearly impossible.
the united states where the slave population grew from natural increase rather than continued importation from africa had an even male female ratio making the creation of families far more possible.
to be sure the law did not recognize the legality of slave mar h o w d i d f a m i l y g e n d e r r e l i g i o n a n d v a l u e s c o m b i n e t o c r e a t e d i s t i n c t slave cultures in the old south.
the master had to consent before a man and woman could jump over the broomstick the slaves marriage ceremony and families stood in constant danger of being broken up by sale.
nonetheless most adult slaves married and their unions when not disrupted by sale typically lasted for a lifetime.
to solidify a sense of family continuity slaves frequently named children after cousins uncles grandparents and other relatives.
nor did the slave family simply mirror kinship patterns among whites.
slaves for example did not marry first cousins a practice common among white southerners.
most slaves lived in two parent families.
but because of constant sales the slave community had a significantly higher number of femaleheaded households than among whites as well as families in which grandparents other relatives or even non kin assumed responsibility for raising children.
the threat of sale as noted above the threat of sale which disrupted family ties was perhaps the most powerful disciplinary weapon slaveholders possessed.
as the domestic slave trade expanded with the rise of the cotton kingdom about one slave marriage in three in slave selling states like virginia was broken by sale.
many children were separated from their parents by sale.
according to one estimate at least 10 percent of the teenage slaves in the upper south were sold in the interstate slave trade.
fear of sale permeated slave life especially in the upper south.
mother is massa going to sell us tomorrow ran a line in a popular slave song.
as a reflection of their paternalist responsibilities some owners encouraged slaves to marry.
others however remained unaware of their slaves family connections and their interest in slave children was generally limited to the childrens ability to work in the fields.
the federal census broke down the white population by five year age categories but it divided slaves only once at age ten the point at which they became old enough to enter the plantation labor force.
slave traders gave little attention to preserving family ties.
a public notice sale of slaves and stock announced the 1852 auction of property belonging to a recently deceased georgia planter.
it listed thirty six individuals ranging from an infant to a sixty nine year old woman and ended with the proviso slaves will be sold separate or in lots as best suits the purchaser sales like this were a human tragedy.

my dear wife for you and my children my pen cannot express the grief i feel to be parted from you all gender roles among slaves in some ways gender roles under slavery differed markedly from those in the larger society.
slave men and women experienced in a sense the equality of powerlessness.
the nineteenth centurys cult of domesticity which defined the home as a womans proper sphere did not apply to slave women who regularly worked in the fields.
slave men could not act as the economic providers for their families.
nor could they protect their wives from physical or sexual abuse by owners and overseers a frequent occurrence on many plantations or determine when and under what conditions their children worked.
when slaves worked on their own time however more conventional gender roles prevailed.
slave men chopped wood hunted and fished while women washed sewed and assumed primary responsibility for the care of children.
some planters allowed their slaves small plots of land on which to grow food to supplement the rations provided by the owner women usually took charge of these garden plots but whatever its internal arrangements the family was central to the slave community allowing for the transmission of values traditions and survival strategies in a word of slave culture from one generation to the next.

virginian luxuries.
originally painted on the back panel of a formal portrait this image illustrates two luxuries of a virginia slaveowner the power to sexually abuse slave women and to whip slaves.
religion a distinctive version of christianity also offered solace to slaves in the face of hardship and hope for liberation from bondage.
some blacks free and slave had taken part in the great awakening of the colonial era and even more were swept into the souths baptist and methodist churches during h o w d i d f a m i l y g e n d e r r e l i g i o n a n d v a l u e s c o m b i n e t o c r e a t e d i s t i n c t slave cultures in the old south.
the religious revivals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
as one preacher recalled of the great camp meeting that drew thousands of worshipers to cane ridge kentucky in 1801 no distinctions were made as to age sex color or anything of a temporary nature old and young male and female black and white had equal privilege to minister the light which they received in whatever way the spirit directed even though the law prohibited slaves from gathering without a white person present every plantation it seemed had its own black preacher.
usually the preacher was a self called slave who possessed little or no formal education but whose rhetorical abilities and familiarity with the bible made him one of the most respected members of the slave community.
especially in southern cities slaves also worshiped in biracial congregations with white ministers where they generally were required to sit in the back pews or in the balcony.
urban free blacks established their own churches sometimes attended by slaves.
to masters christianity offered another means of social control.
many required slaves to attend services conducted by white ministers who preached that theft was immoral and that the bible required servants to obey their masters.
one slave later recalled being told in a white ministers sermon how good god was in bringing us over to this country from dark and benighted africa and permitting us to listen to the sound of the gospel several slaves walked out of the service during a sermon by charles c jones stressing that god had commanded servants to obey their masters and that they should not try to run away.
one man came up to jones at the end and said the doctrine is one sided the gospel of freedom the slaves transformed the christianity they had embraced turning it to their own purposes.
a blend of african traditions and christian belief slave religion was practiced in secret nighttime gatherings on plantations and in praise meetings replete with shouts dances and frequent emotional interchanges between the preacher and the congregation.
one former slave later recalled typical secret religious gatherings we used to slip off into the woods in the old slave days on sunday evening way down in the swamps to sing and pray to our own liking.
we prayed for this day of freedom the biblical story of exodus in which god chose moses to lead the enslaved jews of egypt into a promised land of freedom played a central role in black christianity.
slaves identified themselves as a chosen people whom god in the fullness of time would deliver from bondage.
at the same time the figure of jesus christ represented to slaves a personal redeemer one who truly cared for the oppressed.
slaves found other heroes and symbols in the bible as well jonah who overcame hard luck and escaped from the belly of a whale david who vanquished the more powerful goliath and daniel who escaped from the lions den.
and the christian a black preacher as portrayed in harpers weekly february 2 1867.
although engraved after the civil war the scene is the same as religious services under slavery.
11 the peculiar institution s l a v e c u lt u r e message of brotherhood and the equality of all souls before the creator in the slaves eyes offered an irrefutable indictment of the institution of slavery.

this is a rare eyewitness depiction of black culture under slavery.
desire for liberty if their masters developed an elaborate ideology defending the souths peculiar institution slave culture rested on a conviction of the unjustness of bondage and the desire for freedom.
nobody the british political philosopher edmund burke had written during the american revolution will be argued into slavery frederick douglass called the proslavery argument flimsy nonsense which men would be ashamed to remember once slavery had been abolished.
whatever proslavery writers asserted and ministers preached blacks thought of themselves as a working people unjustly deprived of the fruits of their labor by idle planters who lived in luxury.
we bake the bread they give us the crust said a line from one slave song.
most slaves fully understood the impossibility of directly confronting the system.
their folk tales had no figures equivalent to paul bunyan the powerful larger than life backwoodsman popular in white folklore.
slaves folklore such as the brer rabbit stories glorified the weak hare who outwitted stronger foes like the bear and fox rather than challenging them directly.
their religious songs or spirituals spoke of lives of sorrow ive been buked and ive been scorned while holding out hope for ultimate liberation didnt my lord deliver daniel.
when they sang im bound for the land of canaan slaves meant not only relief from worldly woes in an afterlife but also escaping to the north or in gods good time witnessing the breaking of slaverys chains.
freedom declared a black minister after emancipation burned in the black heart long before freedom was born a fugitive who reached the north later recalled that the desire for freedom was the constant theme of conversations in the slave quarters.
even the most ignorant slave observed solomon northup could not fail to observe the difference between their own condition and the meanest white mans and to realize the injustice of laws which place it within the owners power not only to appropriate the profits of their industry but to subject them to unmediated and unprovoked punishment without remedy the world of most rural slaves was bounded by their local communities and kin.
they became extremely familiar with the local landscape crops and population but had little knowledge of the larger world.
nonetheless slaves could not remain indifferent to the currents of thought unleashed by the american revolution or to the language of freedom in the society around them.
i am in a land of liberty wrote joseph taper a virginia slave who escaped to canada around 1840.
here man is as god intended he should be.
not like the southern laws which put man made in the image h o w d i d f a m i l y g e n d e r r e l i g i o n a n d v a l u e s c o m b i n e t o c r e a t e d i s t i n c t slave cultures in the old south.
of god on level with brutes the social and political agenda africanamericans would put forward in the reconstruction era that followed emancipation stressing civil and political equality the strengthening of the black community and autonomy in their working lives flowed directly out of their experience in slavery.
r e s i s ta n c e t o s l av e r y confronted with federal state and local authorities committed to preserving slavery and outnumbered within the south as a whole by the white population slaves could only rarely express their desire for freedom by outright rebellion.
compared to brazil and the west indies which experienced numerous uprisings involving hundreds or even thousands of slaves revolts in the united states were smaller and less frequent.
there was no parallel of course to the successful slave revolution in haiti discussed in chapter 8 or to the unsuccessful 1831 rebellion in jamaica that appears to have involved as many as 20 000 slaves.
this does not however mean that slaves in the united states placidly accepted the system under which they were compelled to live.
resistance to slavery took many forms in the old south from individual acts of defiance to occasional uprisings.
these actions posed a constant challenge to the slaveholders self image as benign paternalists and their belief that slaves were obedient subjects grateful for their owners care.
forms of resistance the most widespread expression of hostility to slavery was day to day resistance or silent sabotage doing poor work breaking tools abusing animals and in other ways disrupting the plantation routine.
frederick law olmsted a northerner who toured the south in the 1850s took note of gates left open rails removed from fences by the negroes mules lamed and implements broken a flat boat set adrift in the river men ordered to cart rails for a new fence depositing them so that a double expense of labor would be required to lay them many slaves made believe that they were ill to avoid work although almost no slaves reported themselves sick on sunday their only day of rest.
then there was the theft of food a form of resistance so common that one southern physician diagnosed it as a hereditary disease unique to blacks.
less frequent but more dangerous were serious crimes committed by slaves including arson poisoning and armed assaults against individual whites.
fugitive slaves even more threatening to the stability of the slave system were slaves who ran away.
formidable obstacles confronted the prospective fugitive.
as solomon northup recalled every white mans hand is raised against him the patrollers are watching for him the hounds are ready to follow in his track slaves had little or no knowledge of geography apart from understanding that following the north star led to freedom.
no one knows how many slaves succeeded in reaching the north or canada the most common rough estimate is around 1 000 per year.
not surprisingly most of those who succeeded lived like frederick douglass in the upper south c h.

denemarra 1823 especially maryland virginia and kentucky which bordered on the free states.
douglass who escaped at age twenty was also typical in that the large majority of fugitives were young men.
most slave women were not willing to leave children behind and to take them along on the arduous escape journey was nearly impossible.
what were the major forms of resistance to slavery.
in the deep south fugitives tended to head for cities like new orleans or charleston where they hoped to lose themselves in the free black community.
other escapees fled to remote areas like the great dismal swamp of virginia or the florida everglades where the seminole indians offered refuge before they were forced to move west.
even in tennessee a study of newspaper advertisements for runaways finds that around 40 percent were thought to have remained in the local neighborhood 30 percent to have headed to other locations in the south while only 25 percent tried to reach the north.
the underground railroad a loose organization of sympathetic abolitionists who hid fugitives in their homes and sent them on to the next station assisted some runaway slaves.
a few courageous individuals made forays into the south to liberate slaves.
the best known was harriet tubman.
born in maryland in 1820 tubman escaped to philadelphia in 1849 and during the next decade risked her life by making some twenty trips back to her state of birth to lead relatives and other slaves to freedom.
but most who managed to reach the north did so on their own initiative sometimes showing remarkable ingenuity.
william and ellen craft impersonated a sickly owner traveling with her slave.
henry box brown packed himself inside a crate and literally had himself shipped from georgia to freedom in the north.
the amistad in a few instances large groups of slaves collectively seized their freedom.
the most celebrated instance involved fifty three slaves who in 1839 took control of the amistad a ship transporting them from one port in cuba to another and tried to force the navigator to steer it to africa.
the amistad wended its way up the atlantic coast until an american vessel seized it off the coast of long island.
president martin van buren favored returning the slaves to cuba.
but abolitionists brought their case to the supreme court where former president john quincy adams argued that since they had been recently brought from africa in violation of international treaties banning the slave trade the captives should be freed.
the court accepted adamss reasoning and most of the captives made their way back to africa.
the amistad case had no legal bearing on slaves within the united states.
but it may well have inspired a similar uprising in 1841 when 135 slaves being transported by sea from norfolk virginia to new orleans seized control of the ship creole and sailed for nassau in the british bahamas.
their leader had the evocative name madison washington.
to the dismay of the tyler administration the british gave refuge to the creole slaves.
slave r e v o lt s resistance to slavery occasionally moved beyond such individual and group acts of defiance to outright rebellion.
the four largest conspiracies in american history occurred within the space of thirty one years in the early nineteenth century.
the first organized by the virginia slave gabriel in 1800 was discussed in chapter 8.
it was followed eleven years later by an uprising on sugar plantations upriver from new orleans.
somewhere between 200 and 500 men and women armed with sugarcane knives axes clubs and a few guns marched toward the city destroying property as they proceeded.
the white population along the route fled in panic to new a typical broadside offering a reward for the capture of a runaway slave.

resistance to slavery orleans.
within two days the militia and regular army troops met the rebels and dispersed them in a pitched battle killing sixty six.
soon afterwards the principal leaders were executed.
captured rebels offered little explanation for their revolt other than the desire as one put it to kill the white but they seem to have been inspired by the recent success of the slave revolution in haiti.
the next major conspiracy was organized in 1822 by denmark vesey a slave carpenter in charleston south carolina who had purchased his freedom after winning a local lottery.
an outspoken charismatic leader vesey rebuked blacks who stepped off the citys sidewalks to allow whites to pass and took a leading role in the local african methodist church.
his conspiracy reflected the combination of american and african influences then circulating in the atlantic world and coming together in black culture.
he studied the bible a great deal recalled one of his followers and tried to prove from it that slavery and bondage is against the bible vesey also quoted the declaration of independence pored over newspaper reports of the debates in congress regarding the missouri compromise and made pronouncements like all men had equal rights blacks as well as whites and he read to his coconspirators accounts of the successful slave revolution in haiti.
the african heritage was present in the person of veseys lieutenant gullah jack a religious conjurer from angola who claimed to be able to protect the rebels against injury or death.
the plot was discovered before it could reach fruition.
as in the case of many slave conspiracies evidence about the vesey plot is contradictory and disputed.
much of it comes from a series of trials in which the court operated in secret and failed to allow the accused to confront those who testified against them.
south carolinas governor thomas bennett jr a number of whose slaves were among the accused complained to robert y hayne the states attorney general that the court proceedings violated the rules which universally obtain among civilized nations hayne replied that to try a free white man under such circumstances would clearly violate his fundamental rights.
but he added slaves are not entitled to these rights since all the provisions of our constitution in what were the major forms of resistance to slavery.
favor of liberty are intended for freemen only in the end thirty five slaves and free blacks among them vesey and three slaves belonging to the governor were executed and an equal number banished from the state.
nat turners rebellion the best known of all slave rebels was nat turner a slave preacher and religious mystic in southampton county virginia who came to believe that god had chosen him to lead a black uprising.
turner traveled widely in the county conducting religious services.
he told of seeing black and white angels fighting in the sky and the heavens running red with blood.
perhaps from a sense of irony turner initially chose july 4 1831 for his rebellion only to fall ill on the appointed day.
on august 22 he and a handful of followers marched from farm to farm assaulting the white inhabitants.
most of their victims were women and children for many of the areas men were attending a religious revival across the border in north carolina.
by the time the militia put down the uprising about eighty slaves had joined turners band and some sixty whites had been killed.
turner was subsequently captured and with seventeen other rebels condemned to die.
asked before his execution whether he regretted what he had done turner responded was not christ crucified nat turners was the last large scale rebellion in southern history.
like gabriels and veseys conspiracies turners took place outside the heart of the plantation south where slavery was most rigidly policed.
because turner began with only a handful of followers he faced less chance of discovery or betrayal than gabriel or vesey.
nonetheless his revolt demonstrated conclusively that in a region where whites outnumbered blacks and the white community was armed and united slaves stood at a fatal disadvantage in any violent encounter.
only an outside force could alter the balance of power within the south.
slave resistance however hardly disappeared.
turners uprising in fact demonstrated the connection between outright rebellion and less dramatic forms of resistance.
for in its aftermath numerous reports circulated of insubordinate behavior by slaves on virginias farms and plantations.
turners rebellion sent shock waves through the entire south.
a nat turner one white virginian warned might be in any family in the panic that followed the revolt hundreds of innocent slaves were whipped and scores executed.
for one last time virginias leaders openly debated whether steps ought to be taken to do away with the peculiar institution the blood of turner and his innocent victims declared a richmond newspaper has opened the doors which have been shut for fifty years but a proposal to commit the state to gradual emancipation and the removal of the black population from the state failed to win legislative approval.
the measure gained overwhelming support in the western part of virginia where slaves represented less than 10 percent of the population but it failed to win sufficient votes in the eastern counties where slavery was centered.
instead of moving toward emancipation the virginia legislature of 1832 decided to fasten even more tightly the chains of bondage.
new laws prohibited blacks free or slave from acting as preachers a measure that proved impossible to enforce strengthened the militia and patrol systems banned free blacks from owning firearms and prohibited teaching slaves c h.
11 the peculiar institution suggested reading an engraving depicting nat turners slave rebellion of 1831 from a book published soon after the revolt.
other southern states followed suit.
in the debates aftermath thomas r dew a professor at the college of william and mary in virginia published an influential pamphlet pointing to the absurdity of deporting the bulk of the states labor force.
the state he insisted faced a stark choice retain slavery or free the slaves and absorb them into virginia society.
few critics of slavery were willing to accept the latter alternative.
in some ways 1831 marked a turning point for the old south.
in that year parliament launched a program for abolishing slavery throughout the british empire a process completed in 1838 underscoring the souths growing isolation in the western world.
turners rebellion following only a few months after the appearance in boston of william lloyd garrisons abolitionist journal the liberator discussed in the next chapter suggested that american slavery faced enemies both within and outside the south.
the proslavery argument increasingly permeated southern intellectual and political life while dissenting opinions were suppressed.
some states made membership in an abolitionist society a criminal offense while mobs drove critics of slavery from their homes.
the souths great reaction produced one of the most thoroughgoing suppressions of freedom of speech in american history.
even as reform movements arose in the north that condemned slavery as contrary to christianity and to basic american values and national debate over the peculiar institution intensified southern society closed in defense of slavery.

l a mong the many americans who devoted their lives to the crusade against slavery few were as selfless or courageous as abby kelley.
born in massachusetts in 1811 she was educated at a quaker boarding school in rhode island.
as a teacher in lynn massachusetts she joined the female anti slavery society and like thousands of other northern women threw herself into the abolitionist movement.
in 1838 kelley began to give public speeches about slavery.
her first lecture outside of lynn was literally a baptism of fire.
enraged by reports that abolitionists favored amalgamation of the races that is sexual relations between whites and blacks residents of philadelphia stormed the meeting hall and burned it to the ground.
for two decades kelley traveled throughout the north speaking almost daily in churches public halls and antislavery homes on the holy cause of human rights her career illustrated the interconnections of the eras reform movements.
in addition to abolitionism she was active in pacifist organizations which opposed the use of force including war to settle disputes and was a pioneer in the early struggle for womens rights.
in striving to strike the slaves irons off she wrote women found most surely that we were manacled ourselves kelley was not the first american woman to speak in public.
but she covered more miles and gave more speeches than any other female orator.
she forthrightly challenged her eras assumption that womans place was in the home.
more than any other individual remarked lucy stone another womens rights advocate kelley earned for us all the right of free speech abby kelleys private life was as unconventional as her public career.
she enjoyed a long and happy marriage to stephen s foster a strongwilled abolitionist given to interrupting sunday sermons to denounce ministers who failed to condemn slavery.
she gave birth to a daughter in 1847 but soon returned to lecturing.

frederick douglass sits immediately to her right.
social activities were organized through voluntary associations churches fraternal orders political clubs and the like.
the reform impulse was part of this proliferation of voluntary groups.
americans established organizations that worked to prevent the manufacture and sale of liquor end public entertainments and the delivery of the mail on sunday improve conditions in prisons expand public education uplift the condition of wage laborers and reorganize society on the basis of cooperation rather than competitive individualism.
nearly all these groups worked to convert public opinion to their cause.
they sent out speakers gathered signatures on petitions and published pamphlets.
like abby kelley many reformers were active in more than one crusade.
some reform movements like restraining the consumption of liquor and alleviating the plight of the blind and insane flourished throughout the nation.
others including womens rights labor unionism and educational reform were weak or nonexistent in the south where they were widely associated with antislavery sentiment.
reform was an international crusade.
peace temperance womens rights and antislavery advocates regularly crisscrossed the atlantic to promote their cause.
reformers adopted a wide variety of tactics to bring about social change.
some relied on moral suasion to convert people to their cause.
others like opponents of the demon rum sought to use the power of the government to force sinners to change their ways.
some reformers decided to withdraw altogether from the larger society and establish their own cooperative settlements.
they hoped to change american life by creating heavens on earth where they could demonstrate by example the superiority of a collective way of life.
reformers never amounted to anything like a majority of the population even in the north but they had a profound impact on both politics and society.

new hampshire massachusetts io utopian new jersey modern times connecticut delaware 200 miles 200 kilometers brook farm fourierist rappite oneidan mormon shaker owenite pietistic others mainly new englander settlement communities about 100 reform communities were established in the decades before the civil war.
historians call them utopian after thomas mores sixteenthcentury novel utopia an outline of a perfect society.
the word has also come to imply that such plans are impractical and impossible to realize.
these communities differed greatly in structure and motivation.
some were subject to the iron discipline of a single leader while others operated in a democratic fashion.
most arose from religious conviction but others were inspired by the secular desire to counteract the social and economic changes set in motion by the market revolution.
nearly all the communities set out to reorganize society on a cooperative basis hoping to restore social harmony to a world of excessive individualism and to narrow the widening gap between rich and poor.
through their efforts the words socialism and communism meaning a social organization in which productive property is owned by the community rather than private individuals entered the language of politics.
most utopian communities also tried to find substitutes for conventional gender relations and marriage patterns.
some prohibited sexual relations between men and women altogether others allowed them to change partners at will.
but nearly all insisted that the abolition of private property must be accompanied by an end to mens property in women.
what were the major movements and goals of antebellum reform.
the shakers religious communities attracted those who sought to find a retreat from a society permeated by sin a refuge from the evils of this sodom as the founders of zoar in ohio put it.
but the shakers the most successful of the religious communities also had a significant impact on the outside world.
at their peak during the 1840s cooperative shaker settlements which stretched from maine to kentucky included more than 5 000 members.
the shakers were founded in the late eighteenth century by mother ann lee the daughter of an english blacksmith who became a religious exhorter and claimed that christ had directed her to emigrate with her followers to america.
the first shaker community was established in upstate new york in 1787.
god the shakers believed had a dual personality both male and female and thus the two sexes were spiritually equal.
their work was deemed equally important although each man was assigned a sister to take care of his washing and sewing.
virgin purity formed a pillar of the shakers faith.
they completely abandoned traditional family life.
men and women lived separately in large dormitory like structures and ate in communal dining rooms.
their numbers grew by attracting converts and adopting children from orphanages rather than through natural increase.
numerous outsiders visited shaker communities to observe the religious services that gave the group its name in which men and women separated by sex engaged in frenzied dancing.
although they rejected the individual accumulation of private property the shakers proved remarkably successful economically.
they were among the first to market vegetable and flower seeds and herbal medicines commercially and to breed cattle for profit.
their beautifully crafted furniture is still widely admired today.

12 an age of reform 1820 1840 the mormons the reform impulse trek another migration brought thousands of members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints or mormons to modern day utah.
one of the eras numerous religious sects that hoped to create a kingdom of god on earth the mormons had been founded in the 1820s by joseph smith a young farmer in upstate new york.
smith claimed to have been led by an angel to a set of golden plates covered with strange writing which he translated as the book of mormon.
it claimed that ancient hebrews had emigrated to the new world and become the ancestors of the american indians.
the absolute authority smith exercised over his followers as well as the refusal of the mormons to separate church and state alarmed many neighbors.
even more outrageous to the general community was the mormon practice of polygamy which allows one man to have more than one wife a repudiation of traditional christian teaching and nineteenthcentury morality.
mobs drove smith and his followers out of new york ohio and missouri before they settled in 1839 in nauvoo illinois where they hoped to await the second coming of christ.
there five years later smith was arrested on the charge of inciting a riot that destroyed an antimormon newspaper.
while in jail awaiting trial smith was murdered by a group of intruders.
his successor as mormon leader brigham young led more than 10 000 followers across the great plains and rocky mountains to the shores of the great salt lake in present day utah seeking a refuge where they could practice their faith undisturbed.
the mormons plight revealed the limits of religious toleration in nineteenthcentury america.
oneida another influential and controversial community was oneida founded in 1848 in upstate new york by john humphrey noyes the vermont born son of a u s congressman.
after graduating from dartmouth college noyes briefly studied law but soon experienced a conversion at a religious revival and decided to become a minister.
noyes took the revivalists message that man could achieve moral perfection to an atypical extreme.
he preached that he and his followers had become so perfect that they had achieved a state of complete purity of heart or sinlessness.
in 1836 noyes and his followers formed a small community in putney vermont.
like the shakers noyes did away with private property and abandoned traditional marriage.
but in contrast to shaker celibacy he taught that all members of his community formed a single holy family of equals.
his community became notorious for what noyes called complex marriage whereby any man could propose sexual relations to any woman who had the right to reject or accept his invitation which would then be registered in a public record book.
the great danger was exclusive affections which noyes felt destroyed the harmony of the community.
after being indicted for adultery by local officials noyes in 1848 moved his community to oneida where it survived until 1881.
oneida was an extremely dictatorial environment.
to become a member of the community one had to demonstrate command of noyess religious teachings and what were the major movements and goals of antebellum reform.
live according to his rules.
members carefully observed each others conduct and publicly criticized those who violated noyess regulations.
by the 1860s a committee was even determining which couples would be permitted to have children an early example of eugenics as the effort to improve the human race by regulating reproduction came to be known.
w o r l d ly communities to outside observers utopian communities like oneida seemed a case of voluntary slavery but because of their members selfless devotion to the teachings and rules laid down by their leader spiritually oriented communities often achieved remarkable longevity.
the shakers survived well into the twentieth century.
communities with a more worldly orientation tended to be beset by internal divisions and therefore lasted for much shorter periods.
in 1841 new england transcendentalists established brook farm not far from boston where they hoped to demonstrate that manual and intellectual labor could coexist harmoniously.
they modeled the community in part on the ideas of the french social reformer charles fourier who envisioned communal living and working arrangements while retaining private property.
fouriers blueprint for phalanxes as he called his settlements planned everything to the last detail from the number of residents 2 000 to how much income would be generated by charging admission to sightseers.
with leisure time devoted to music dancing dramatic readings and intellectual discussion brook farm was like an exciting miniature university.
but it attracted mostly writers teachers and ministers some of whom disliked farm labor.
the novelist nathaniel hawthorne a resident for a time complained about having to shovel manure.
brook farm disbanded after a few years and hawthorne offered a skeptical view of life there in his 1852 novel the blithedale romance.
the owenites the most important secular communitarian meaning a person who plans or lives in a cooperative community was robert owen a british factory owner.
appalled by the degradation of workers in the early industrial revolution owen created a model factory village at new lanark scotland which combined strict rules of work discipline with comfortable housing and free public education.
around 1815 its 1 500 employees made new lanark the largest center of cotton manufacturing in the world.
convinced that the rich and the poor the governors and the governed have really but one interest owen promoted communitarianism as a peaceful means of ensuring that workers received the full value of their labor.
in 1824 he purchased the harmony community in indiana originally founded by the german protestant religious leader george rapp who had emigrated to america with his followers at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
here owen established new harmony where he hoped to create a new moral world the character of man is without a single exception always formed for him owen declared.
individuals could be transformed by changing the the crisis a publication by the communitarian robert owen and his son robert dale owen.

the reform impulse circumstances in which they lived.
in owens scheme children would be removed at an early age from the care of their parents to be educated in schools where they would be trained to subordinate individual ambition to the common good.
owen also defended womens rights especially access to education and the right to divorce.
at new harmony he promised women would no longer be enslaved to their husbands and false notions about innate differences between the sexes would be abandoned.
harmony eluded the residents of new harmony.
they squabbled about everything from the communitys constitution to the distribution of property.
owens settlement survived for only a few years but it strongly influenced the labor movement educational reformers and womens rights advocates.
owens vision resonated with the widely held american belief that a community of equals could be created in the new world.
quite different from owens planned system were the short lived secular communities founded by josiah warren an early american anarchist one who believes that all institutions that exercise power over individuals including government are illegitimate.
at utopia ohio and modern times new york warren established totally unregulated voluntary settlements.
like other communitarians warren tried to address the sources of labor unrest and womens inequality.
in an attempt to solve the labor problem he created stores where goods were exchanged according to the amount of work that had gone into producing them thus preventing middlemen like bankers and merchants from sharing in the hard earned income of farmers laborers and manufacturers.
marriage in warrens communities was a purely voluntary arrangement since no laws regulated personal behavior.
in effect warren took american individualism to its logi what were the major movements and goals of antebellum reform.
cal extreme.
freedom he declared meant allowing each individual to be absolute despot or sovereign over himself.
religion and reform most americans saw the ownership of property as the key to economic independence and therefore to freedom and marriage as the foundation of the social order.
few were likely to join communities that required them to surrender both.
far more typical of the reform impulse were movements that aimed at liberating men and women either from restraints external to themselves such as slavery and war or from forms of internal servitude like drinking illiteracy and a tendency toward criminality.
drinkers proclaimed one reformer could not be considered free they were chained to alcohol bound to the demon rum many of these reform movements drew their inspiration from the religious revivalism of the second great awakening discussed in chapter 9.
if as the revivalist preachers maintained god had created man as a free moral agent sinners could not only reform themselves but could also remake the world.
the revivals popularized the outlook known as perfectionism which saw both individuals and society at large as capable of indefinite improvement.
regions like upstate new york and northern ohio became known as burned over districts because of the intense revivals they experienced in the 1820s and 1830s.
such areas became fertile soil for the eras reform movements and their vision of a society freed from sin.
under the impact of the revivals older reform efforts moved in a new radical direction.
temperance which literally means moderation in the consumption of liquor was transformed into a crusade to eliminate drinking entirely.
criticism of war became outright pacifism.
and as will be related below critics of slavery now demanded not gradual emancipation but immediate and total abolition.
the temperance movement to members of the norths emerging middle class culture reform became a badge of respectability an indication that individuals had taken control of their own lives and had become morally accountable human beings.
the american temperance society founded in 1826 directed its efforts to redeeming not only habitual drunkards but also the occasional drinker.
it claimed by the 1830s to have persuaded hundreds of thousands of americans to renounce liquor.
by 1840 the consumption of alcohol per person had fallen to less than half the level of a decade earlier.
it had peaked in 1830 at seven gallons per person per year compared to around two gallons today.
during the 1840s the washingtonian society gathered reformed drinkers in experience meetings where they offered public testimony about their previous sins.
the temperance crusade and other reform movements aroused considerable hostility.
one persons sin is anothers pleasure or cherished custom.
those americans who enjoyed sunday recreation or a stiff drink from time to time did not think they were any less moral than those who had been reborn at a religious camp meeting had abandoned drinking and devoted the sabbath to religious observances.
a temperance banner from around 1850 depicts a young man torn between a woman in white who illustrates female purity and a temptress who offers him a drink of liquor.
12 an age of reform 1820 1840 the reform impulse a german beer garden on sunday evening an engraving from harpers weekly october 15 1858.
german and irish immigrants resented efforts of temperance reformers to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages.
critics of reform many americans saw the reform impulse as an attack on their own freedom.
drinking was a prominent feature of festive celebrations and events like militia gatherings.
as in the colonial era taverns were popular meeting places for workingmen in early nineteenth century towns and cities sites not only of drinking but also of political discussions organizational meetings and popular recreations.
a liberty loving citizen of worcester massachusetts wondered what gave one group of citizens the right to dictate to others how to conduct their personal lives.
american catholics their numbers growing because of irish and german immigration proved hostile to the reform impulse.
catholics understood freedom in ways quite different from protestant reformers.
they viewed sin as an inescapable burden of individuals and society.
the perfectionist idea that evil could be banished from the world struck them as an affront to genuine religion and they bitterly opposed what they saw as reformers efforts to impose their own version of protestant morality on their neighbors.
while reformers spoke of man as a free moral agent catholics tended to place less emphasis on individual independence and more on the importance of communities centered on family and church.
man declared archbishop john hughes of new york the nations most prominent catholic leader was not an autonomous creature but by his nature a being of society reformers and freedom reformers had to reconcile their desire to create moral order and their quest to enhance personal freedom.
they did this through a vision of freedom that was liberating and controlling at the same time.
on the one hand reformers insisted that their goal was to enable americans to enjoy gen what were the major movements and goals of antebellum reform.
uine liberty.
in a world in which personal freedom increasingly meant the opportunity to compete for economic gain and individual self improvement they spoke of liberating americans from various forms of slavery that made it impossible to succeed slavery to drink to poverty to sin.
on the other hand reformers insisted that self fulfillment came through self discipline.
their definition of the free individual was the person who internalized the practice of self control.
philip schaff a german minister who emigrated to pennsylvania in 1843 wrote that true national freedom in the american view was anything but an absence of restraint rather it rests upon a moral groundwork upon the virtue of self possession and self control in individual citizens in some ways reformers believed american society suffered from an excess of liberty the anarchic natural liberty john winthrop had warned against in the early days of puritan massachusetts as opposed to the christian liberty of the morally upright citizen.
many religious groups in the east worried that settlers in the west and immigrants from abroad lacked self control and led lives of vice exhibited by drinking violations of the sabbath and lack of protestant devotion.
they formed the american tract society the american bible society and other groups that flooded eastern cities and the western frontier with copies of the gospel and pamphlets promoting religious virtue.
between 1825 and 1835 the pamphlets distributed by the tract society amounted to more than 500 million pages.
both their understanding of freedom and their ability to take advantage of the new printing technologies influenced the eras reform movements.
the invention of the asylum the tension between liberation and control in the eras reform movements was vividly evident in the proliferation of new institutions that reformers hoped could remake human beings into free morally upright citizens.
in colonial america crime had mostly been punished by whipping fines or banishment.
the poor received relief in their own homes orphans lived with neighbors and families took care of mentally ill members.
the new york house of refuge one of many institutions established in the 1820s and 1830s to address social ills by assisting and reforming criminals and the poor.
young boys and girls convicted of petty theft were assigned to the house of refuge where they performed supervised labor and received some educational instruction.
12 an age of reform 1820 1840 the reform impulse during the 1830s and 1840s americans embarked on a program of institution building jails for criminals poorhouses for the destitute asylums for the insane and orphanages for children without families.
these institutions differed in many respects but they shared with communitarians and religious believers in perfectionism the idea that social ills once considered incurable could in fact be eliminated.
the way to cure undesirable elements of society was to place afflicted persons and impressionable youths in an environment where their character could be transformed.
prisons and asylums would eventually become overcrowded places where rehabilitating the inmates seemed less important than simply holding them at bay away from society.
at the outset however these institutions were inspired by the conviction that those who passed through their doors could eventually be released to become productive self disciplined citizens.
the this daguerreotype from around 1850 depicts a classroom in a school for girls presided over by a male teacher.
common school the largest effort at institution building before the civil war came in the movement to establish common schools that is tax supported state school systems open to all children.
in the early nineteenth century most children were educated in locally supported schools private academies charity schools or at home and many had no access to learning at all.
school reform reflected the numerous purposes that came together in the eras reform impulse.
horace mann a massachusetts lawyer and whig politician who served as director of the states board of education was the eras leading educational reformer.
his annual reports widely read throughout the country combined conservatism and radicalism liberation and social control.
mann embraced the new industrial order of his state.
but he hoped that universal public education could restore equality to a fractured society by bringing the children of all classes together in a common learning experience and equipping the less fortunate to advance in the social scale.
education would equalize the conditions of men in effect it would serve as industrial societys alternative to moving west to acquire a farm.
this view of free public education as an avenue to social advancement was also shared by the early labor movement which made the establishment of common schools one of its goals.
at the same time mann argued that the schools would reinforce social stability by rescuing students from the influence of parents who failed to instill the proper discipline.
character building was as important a function of education as reading writing and arithmetic.
to some extent the schools silent curriculum obedience to authority promptness in attendance organizing ones day according to predetermined time periods that changed at the ringing of a bell helped to prepare students for work in the new industrial economy.
the schools mann believed were training free individuals meaning persons who internalized selfdiscipline.
but he encountered persistent opposition what were the major movements and goals of antebellum reform.
from parents who did not wish to surrender the moral education of their children to teachers and bureaucrats.
nonetheless with labor organizations factory owners and middle class reformers all supporting the idea every northern state by 1860 had established tax supported school systems for its children.
the common school movement created the first real career opportunity for women who quickly came to dominate the ranks of teachers.
the south where literate blacks were increasingly viewed as a danger to social order and planters had no desire to tax themselves to pay for education for poor white children lagged far behind in public education.
this was one of many ways in which north and south seemed to be growing apart.
the crusade against slavery compared with drinking sabbath breaking and illiteracy the greatest evil in american society at first appeared to attract the least attention from reformers.
for many years it seemed that the only americans willing to challenge the existence of slavery were quakers slaves and free blacks.
after the antislavery impulse spawned by the revolution died out the slavery question faded from national life with occasional eruptions like the missouri controversy of 1819 1821.
colonization before the 1830s those white americans willing to contemplate an end to bondage almost always coupled calls for abolition with the colonization of freed slaves their deportation to africa the caribbean or central america.
in 1816 proponents of this idea founded the american colonization society which promoted the gradual abolition of slavery and the settlement of black americans in africa.
it soon established liberia on the coast of west africa an outpost of american influence whose capital monrovia was named for president james monroe.
colonization struck many observers as totally impractical.
when the english writer harriet martineau visited the united states in the 1830s she was amazed that former president james madison endorsed the idea.
how such a mind as his could be convinced that slavery would not end unless blacks were deported from the country she could not understand.
in her account of her travels society in america 1837 she called colonization a way in which slave owners who had scruples about holding men as property might by sending their slaves away over sea relieve their consciences without annoying their neighbors nonetheless numerous prominent political leaders of the jacksonian era including henry clay john marshall daniel webster and jackson himself supported the colonization society.
many northerners saw colonization as the only way to rid the nation of slavery.
southern supporters of colonization devoted most of their energy to persuading those africanamericans who were already free to leave the united states.
free blacks they insisted were a degraded group whose presence posed a danger to white society.
other colonizationists believed that slavery and racism were so deeply embedded in american life that blacks could never a pamphlet issued in 1848 by the american colonization society urging free blacks to emigrate to liberia in west africa and defending the society against certain cavilings that is abolitionist criticism.

like indian removal colonization rested on the premise that america is fundamentally a white society.
blacks and colonization in the decades before the civil war several thousand black americans did emigrate to liberia with the aid of the colonization society.
some were slaves emancipated by their owners on the condition that they depart while others left voluntarily motivated by a desire to spread christianity in africa or to enjoy rights denied them in the united states.
having experienced the legal slavery of the south and the social slavery of the north wrote one emigrant on leaving for liberia he knew he could never be a free man in this country but most african americans adamantly opposed the idea of colonization.
in fact the formation of the american colonization society galvanized free blacks to claim their rights as americans.
early in 1817 some 3 000 free blacks assembled in philadelphia for the first national black convention.
their resolutions insisted that blacks were americans entitled to the same freedom and rights enjoyed by whites.
we have no wish to separate from our present homes they declared.
in the years that followed a number of black organizations removed the word african from their names to eliminate a possible reason for being deported from the land of their birth.
militant william lloyd garrison editor of the liberator and probably the nations most prominent abolitionist in a daguerreotype from around 1850.
abolitionism the abolitionist movement that arose in the 1830s differed profoundly from its genteel conservative predecessor.
drawing on the religious conviction that slavery was an unparalleled sin and the secular one that it contradicted the values enshrined in the declaration of independence a new generation of reformers rejected the traditional approach of gradual emancipation and demanded immediate abolition.
also unlike their predecessors they directed explosive language against slavery and slaveholders and insisted that blacks once free should be incorporated as equal citizens of the republic rather than being deported.
white abolitionists themselves were hardly free of the racism that pervaded american society.
some indeed wondered whether the slaves were too feminine in character to revolt against oppression which they claimed manly anglo saxons would surely do.
nonetheless nearly all abolitionists insisted that economic civil and political rights in the united states should be equally enjoyed without regard to race.
perfecting american society they insisted meant rooting out not just slavery but racism in all its forms.
the first indication of the new spirit of abolitionism came in 1829 with the appearance of an appeal to the coloured citizens of the world by david walker a free black who had been born in north carolina and now operated a used clothing store in boston.
a passionate indictment of slavery and racial prejudice the appeal called on black americans to mobilize for abolition by force if necessary and warned whites that the nation faced divine punishment if it did not mend its sinful ways.
walker invoked the what were the different varieties of abolitionism.
bible and the declaration of independence but he went beyond these familiar arguments to call on blacks to take pride in the achievements of ancient african civilizations and to claim all their rights as americans.
tell us no more about colonization walker wrote addressing white readers for america is as much our country as it is yours the emergence of garrison walkers language alarmed both slaveholders and many white critics of slavery.
when free black sailors secretly distributed the pamphlet in the south some southern states put a price on walkers head.
walker however did not create an abolitionist organization and he died in mysterious circumstances in 1830.
not until the appearance in 1831 of the liberator william lloyd garrisons weekly journal published in boston did the new breed of abolitionism find a permanent voice.
i will be as harsh as truth garrison announced and as uncompromising as justice.
on this subject i do not wish to think or speak or write with moderation.
i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard and heard he was partly because southerners outraged by his inflammatory rhetoric one editorial called slaveowners an adulterous and perverse generation a brood of vipers reprinted garrisons editorials in their own newspapers in order to condemn them thus providing him with instant notoriety.
some of garrisons ideas such as his suggestion that the north abrogate the constitution and dissolve the union to end its complicity in the evil of slavery were rejected by many abolitionists.
but his call for the immediate abolition of slavery echoed throughout antislavery circles.
garrisons pamphlet thoughts on african colonization persuaded many foes of slavery that blacks must be recognized as part of american society not viewed as aliens to be shipped overseas.
other antislavery publications soon emerged but the liberator remained the preeminent abolitionist journal.
spreading the abolitionist message beginning with a handful of activists the abolitionist movement expanded rapidly throughout the north.
antislavery leaders took advantage of the rapid development of print technology and the expansion of literacy due to common school education to spread their message.
like radical pamphlet the masthead of william lloyd garrisons the liberator with engravings of scenes of slavery and freedom.

eers of the american revolution and evangelical ministers of the second great awakening they recognized the democratic potential in the production of printed material.
abolitionists seized upon the recently invented steam printing press to produce millions of copies of pamphlets newspapers petitions novels and broadsides.
between the formation of the american anti slavery society in 1833 and the end of the decade some 100 000 northerners joined local groups devoted to abolition.
most were ordinary citizens farmers shopkeepers craftsmen laborers along with a few prominent businessmen like the merchants arthur and lewis tappan of new york.
if garrison was the movements most notable propagandist theodore weld a young minister who had been converted by the evangelical preacher charles g finney helped to create its mass constituency.
a brilliant orator weld trained a band of speakers who brought the abolitionist message into the heart of the rural and small town north.
their methods were those of the revivals fervent preaching lengthy meetings calls for individuals to renounce their immoral ways and their message was a simple one slavery was a sin.
in discussing the subject of slavery wrote weld i have always presented it as preeminently a moral question arresting the conscience of the nation.
as a question of politics and national economy i have passed it with scarce a look or a word there was far more to welds moralistic approach than a concern for religious righteousness.
identifying slavery as a sin was essential to replacing the traditional strategies of gradual emancipation and colonization with immediate abolition.
the only proper response to the sin of slavery abolitionist speakers proclaimed was the institutions immediate elimination.
weld also supervised the publication of abolitionist pamphlets including what were the different varieties of abolitionism.
his own slavery as it is 1839 a compilation of accounts of the maltreatment of slaves.
since weld took all his examples from the southern press they could not be dismissed as figments of the northern imagination.
slavery and moral suasion many southerners feared that the abolitionists intended to spark a slave insurrection a belief strengthened by the outbreak of nat turners rebellion a few months after the liberator made its appearance.
yet not only was garrison completely unknown to turner but nearly all abolitionists despite their militant language rejected violence as a means of ending slavery.
many were pacifists or non resistants who believed that coercion should be eliminated from all human relationships and institutions.
their strategy was moral suasion and their arena the public sphere.
slaveholders must be convinced of the sinfulness of their ways and the north of its complicity in the peculiar institution.
some critics charged that this approach left nothing for the slaves to do in seeking their own liberation but await the nations moral regeneration.
standing outside established institutions abolitionists adopted the role of radical social critics.
among the first to appreciate the key role of public opinion in a mass democracy they focused their efforts not on infiltrating the existing political parties but on awakening the nation to the moral evil of slavery.
their language was deliberately provocative calculated to seize public attention.
slavery said garrison will not be overthrown without excitement without a most tremendous excitement abolitionists and the idea of freedom the abolitionist crusade both reinforced and challenged common understandings of freedom in jacksonian america.
abolitionists helped to popularize the concept fortified by the market revolution that personal freedom derived not from the ownership of productive property such as land slave market of america an engraving produced by the american anti slavery society in 1836 illustrates how abolitionists sought to identify their cause with american traditions even as they mocked the nations claim to be a land of the free c h.
12 an age of reform 1820 1840 the crusade against slavery but from ownership of ones self and the ability to enjoy the fruits of ones labor.
abolitionists repudiated the idea of wage slavery which had been popularized by the eras labor movement.
compared with the slave the person working for wages they insisted was an embodiment of freedom the free laborer could change jobs if he wished accumulate property and enjoy a stable family life.
only slavery wrote the abolitionist william goodell deprived human beings of their grand central right the inherent right of self ownership on the other hand abolitionists argued that slavery was so deeply embedded in american life that its destruction would require fundamental changes in the north as well as the south.
they insisted that the inherent natural and absolute right to personal liberty regardless of race took precedence over other forms of freedom such as the right of citizens to accumulate and hold property or self government by local political communities.

new vision of america in a society in which the rights of citizenship had become more and more closely associated with whiteness the antislavery movement sought to reinvigorate the idea of freedom as a truly universal entitlement.
the origins of the idea of an american people unbounded by race lies not with the founders who by and large made their peace with slavery but with the abolitionists.
the antislavery crusade viewed slaves and free blacks as members of the national community a position summarized in the title of lydia maria childs popular treatise of 1833 an appeal in favor of that class of americans called africans.
childs text insisted that blacks were fellow countrymen not foreigners or a permanently inferior caste.
they should no more be considered africans than whites were englishmen.
the idea that birthplace alone not race should determine who was an american later enshrined in the fourteenth amendment represented a radical departure from the traditions of american life.
we do not admit declared the new england magazine in 1832 that america is as much the country of the blacks bound and free as it is ours but abolitionists maintained that the slaves once freed should be empowered to participate fully in the public life of the united states.
abolitionists also pioneered the modern idea that human rights took precedence over national sovereignty.
they urged the united states to participate in the courts that brought together judges from britain and other countries to punish those who violated the ban on the atlantic slave trade.
these courts were perhaps the first example of transnational human rights enforcement.
but with southerners exerting powerful influence in washington the united states did not join the court system until 1862 in the midst of the civil war.
the crusade against slavery wrote angelina grimk who became a leading abolitionist speaker was the nations preeminent school in which human rights are.
investigated abolitionists debated the constitutions relationship to slavery.
william lloyd garrison burned the document calling it a covenant with the devil frederick douglass came to believe that it offered no national protection to slavery.
but despite this difference of opin what were the different varieties of abolitionism.
ion abolitionists developed an alternative rights oriented view of constitutional law grounded in their universalistic understanding of liberty.
seeking to define the core rights to which all americans were entitled the meaning of freedom in concrete legal terms abolitionists invented the concept of equality before the law regardless of race one all but unknown in american life before the civil war.
abolitionist literature also helped to expand the definition of cruelty.
the graphic descriptions of the beatings brandings and other physical sufferings of the slaves helped to popularize the idea of bodily integrity as a basic right that slavery violated.
despite being denounced by their opponents as enemies of american principles abolitionists consciously identified their movement with the revolutionary heritage.
the declaration of independence was not as fundamental to public oratory in the early republic as it would later become.
abolitionists seized upon it interpreting the documents preamble as a condemnation of slavery.
the liberty bell later one of the nations most venerated emblems of freedom did not achieve that status until abolitionists adopted it as a symbol and gave it its name as part of an effort to identify their principles with those of the founders.
prior to the 1830s it was simply the old state house bell used at various times to mark the death of prominent citizens summon students at the university of pennsylvania to their classes and celebrate patriotic holidays.
of course americans of all regions and political beliefs claimed the revolutions legacy.
mobs that disrupted abolitionist meetings invoked the spirit of 76 as did southern defenders of slavery.
abolitionists never represented more than a small part of the norths population.
but as the slavery controversy intensified the belief spread far beyond abolitionist circles that slavery contradicted the nations heritage of freedom.
black and white abolitionism black abolitionists blacks played a leading role in the antislavery movement.
even before the appearance of the liberator as we have seen northern free blacks had organized in opposition to the colonization society.
james forten a successful black sailmaker in philadelphia helped to finance the liberator in its early years.
as late as 1834 northern blacks attracted by garrisons rejection of colonization and his demand for equal rights for black americans made up a majority of the journals subscribers.
several blacks served on the board of directors of the american anti slavery society and northern born blacks and fugitive slaves quickly emerged as major organizers and speakers.
frederick douglass was only one among many former slaves who published accounts of their lives in bondage these accounts convinced thousands of northerners of the evils of slavery.
indeed the most effective piece of antislavery literature of the entire period harriet beecher stowes novel uncle toms cabin was to some extent modeled on the autobiography of fugitive slave josiah henson.
serialized in 1851 in a washington antislavery newspaper and published as a book the following year uncle toms harriet beecher stowe author of the abolitionist novel uncle toms cabin.

abolitionists sought to counter the pseudoscientific defenses of slavery and racism.
and race the first racially integrated social movement in american history and the first to give equal rights for blacks a central place in its political agenda abolitionism was nonetheless a product of its time and place.
racism as we have seen was pervasive in nineteenth century america north as well as south.
white abolitionists could not free themselves entirely from this prejudice.
they monopolized the key decision making posts charged black spokesman martin r delany relegating blacks to a mere secondary underling position by the 1840s black abolitionists sought an independent role within the movement regularly holding their own conventions.
the black abolitionist henry highland garnet who as a child had escaped from slavery in maryland with his father proclaimed at one such gathering in 1843 that slaves should rise in rebellion to throw off their shackles.
his position was so at odds with the prevailing belief in moral suasion that the published proceedings entirely omitted the speech.
not until 1848 did garnets speech appear in print along with david walkers appeal in a pamphlet partially financed by a then obscure abolitionist named john brown.
what is remarkable however is not that white abolitionists reflected the prejudices of their society but the extent to which they managed to rise how did abolitionism challenge barriers to racial equality and free speech.
above them.
while the word white is on the statute book of massachusetts declared edmund quincy an active associate of william lloyd garrison massachusetts is a slave state defying overwhelming odds abolitionists launched legal and political battles against racial discrimination in the north.
they achieved occasional victories such as the end of school segregation in massachusetts in 1855.
not only did abolitionists struggle to overturn northern laws discriminating against blacks but they refused to compromise the principle that the slave was a moral being created in the image of god.

most adamant in contending that the struggle against slavery required a redefinition of both freedom and americanness were black members of the abolitionist crusade.
black abolitionists developed an understanding of freedom that went well beyond the usage of most of their white contemporaries.
they worked to attack the intellectual foundations of racism seeking to disprove pseudoscientific arguments for black inferiority.
they challenged the prevailing image of africa as a continent without civilization.
many black abolitionists called on free blacks to seek out skilled and dignified employment in order to demonstrate the races capacity for advancement.
slavery and american freedom at every opportunity black abolitionists rejected the nations pretensions as a land of liberty.
many free blacks dramatically reversed the common association of the united states with the progress of freedom.
black communities in the north devised an alternative calendar of freedom celebrations centered on january 1 the date in 1808 on which the slave trade became illegal and august 1 the anniversary of west indian emancipation rather than july 4.
many localities forcibly barred them from independence day festivities.
in doing so they offered a stinging rebuke to white americans claims to live in a land of freedom.
thanks to its embrace of emancipation in the 1830s declared a group of black abolitionists in philadelphia britain had become a model of liberty and justice while the united states remained a land of tyranny.
even more persistently than their white counterparts black abolitionists articulated the ideal of color blind citizenship.
the real battleground between liberty and slavery wrote samuel cornish is prejudice against color cornish a presbyterian minister had helped to establish the nations first black newspaper freedoms journal in new york city in 1827.
the first editor john b russwurm closed the paper after two years and moved to liberia explaining we consider it a waste of mere words to talk of ever enjoying citizenship in this country black abolitionists also identified the widespread poverty of the free black population as a consequence of slavery and insisted that freedom possessed an economic dimension.

12 an age of reform 1820 1840 black and white abolitionism the greatest oration on american slavery and american freedom was delivered in rochester in 1852 by frederick douglass.
speaking just after the annual independence day celebration douglass posed the question what to the slave is the fourth of july see p 481 and the appendix for excerpts from the speech.
he answered that fourth of july festivities revealed the hypocrisy of a nation that proclaimed its belief in liberty yet daily committed practices more shocking and bloody than any other country on earth.
like other abolitionists however douglass also laid claim to the founders legacy.
the revolution had left a rich inheritance of justice liberty prosperity and independence from which subsequent generations had tragically strayed.
only by abolishing slavery and freeing the great doctrines of the declaration of independence from the narrow bounds of race could the united states recapture its original mission.

before starting the fire however the mob patriotically carried a portrait of george washington to safety.
elsewhere crowds of southerners with the unspoken approval of andrew jacksons postmaster general amos kendall burned abolitionist literature that they had removed from the mails.
in 1836 when abolitionists began to flood washington with petitions calling for emancipation in the nations capital the house of representatives adopted the notorious gag rule which prohibited their consideration.
the rule was repealed in 1844 thanks largely to the tireless opposition of former president john quincy adams who since 1831 had represented massachusetts in the house.

for the liberty of speech of the press and of conscience the abolitionist movement now broadened its appeal so as to win the support of northerners who cared little about the rights of blacks but could be convinced that slavery endangered their own cherished freedoms.

tocqueville had noted that in a democracy individual dissenters found it difficult to stand up against the overwhelming power of majority opinion.
americans valued free speech he wrote but he did not know any country where in general less independence of mind and genuine freedom of discussion reign than in america the fight for the right to debate slavery openly and without reprisal led abolitionists to elevate free opinion freedom of speech and of the press and the right of petition to a central place in what garrison called the gospel of freedom in defending free speech abolitionists claimed to have become custodians of the rights of every freeman the origins of feminism the rise of the public woman when the true history of the antislavery cause shall be written frederick douglass later recalled women will occupy a large space in its pages much of the movements grassroots strength derived from northern women who joined by the thousands.
most were evangelical protestants new england congregationalists or quakers convinced as martha higginson of vermont wrote that slavery was a disgrace in this land of christian light and liberty a few became famous but most antislavery women remain virtually unknown to history.
one such activist was lucy colman whose mother sang her antislavery songs when she was a child.
colmans career illustrated how the eras reform movements often overlapped.
she became an abolitionist lecturer a teacher at a school for blacks in upstate new york an advocate of womens rights and an opponent of capital punishment.
the public sphere was open to women in ways government and party politics were not.
long before they could vote women circulated petitions attended meetings marched in parades and delivered public lectures.
they became active in the temperance movement the building of asylums and other reform activities.
dorothea dix a massachusetts schoolteacher for example was the leading advocate of more humane treatment of the insane who at the time generally were placed in jails alongside debtors and hardened criminals.
thanks to her efforts twenty eight states constructed visions of freedom a womens rights quilt.
made by an unknown woman only a few years after the seneca falls convention of 1848 this quilt embodies an unusual form of political expression.
it includes scenes visualizing a woman engaged in various activities that violated the eras cult of domesticity and it illustrates some of the demands of the early womens rights movement.
the individual blocks show a woman driving her own buggy and a banner advocating womens rights another dressing to go out while her husband remains at home wearing an apron and a third addressing a public meeting with a mixed male female audience.
questions 1.
which aspects of freedom does the quiltmaker emphasize.
what aspects of womens rights are not depicted in the quilt.

the origins of feminism mental hospitals before the civil war.
in 1834 middle class women in new york city organized the female moral reform society which sought to redeem prostitutes from lives of sin and to protect the morality of single women.
they attacked the eras sexual double standard by publishing lists of men who frequented prostitutes or abused women.
by 1840 the society had been replicated in hundreds of american communities.
women and free speech all these activities enabled women to carve out a place in the public sphere.
but it was participation in abolitionism that inspired the early movement for womens rights.
in working for the rights of the slave not a few women developed a new understanding of their own subordinate social and legal status.
the daughters of a prominent south carolina slaveholder angelina and sarah grimk had been converted first to quakerism and then abolitionism while visiting philadelphia.
during the 1830s they began to deliver popular lectures that offered a scathing condemnation of slavery from the perspective of those who had witnessed its evils firsthand.
the grimk sisters were neither the first women to lecture in public nor the first to be feverishly condemned by self proclaimed guardians of female modesty.
frances wright a scottish born follower of reformer robert owen spoke at new yorks hall of science in the late 1820s and early 1830s on subjects ranging from communitarianism to slavery womens rights and the plight of northern laborers.
one new york newspaper called wright a female monster for shamefully obtruding herself upon the public maria stewart a black bostonian in 1832 became the first american woman to lecture to mixed male and female audiences.
she too received intense criticism.
i have made myself contemptible in the eyes of what were the diverse sources of the antebellum womens rights movement and its significance.
many stewart wrote.
this is the land of freedom she added and we claim our rights including the right to speak in public.
stewart left boston in 1833 and rarely lectured again.
the grimk sisters however used the controversy over their speeches as a springboard for a vigorous argument against the idea that taking part in assemblies demonstrations and lectures was unfeminine.
outraged by the sight of females sacrificing all modesty and delicacy by appearing on the public lecture platform a group of massachusetts clergymen denounced the sisters.
in reply they forthrightly defended not only the right of women to take part in political debate but also their right to share the social and educational privileges enjoyed by men.
since i engaged in the investigation of the rights of the slave declared angelina grimk i have necessarily been led to a better understanding of my own her sister sarah proceeded to publish letters on the equality of the sexes 1838 a powerful call for equal rights for women and a critique of the notion of separate spheres.
the book raised numerous issues familiar even today including what later generations would call equal pay for equal work why sarah grimk wondered did male teachers invariably receive higher wages than women and a male tailor earn two or three times as much as a female counterpart although the work done by each may be equally good womens rights the grimks were the first to apply the abolitionist doctrine of universal freedom and equality to the status of women.
when the prominent writer catharine beecher reprimanded the sisters for stepping outside the domestic and social sphere urging them to accept the fact that heaven had designated man the superior and woman the subordinate angelina grimk issued a stinging answer.
i know nothing she wrote of mens rights and womens rights.
my doctrine then is that whatever it is morally right for man to do it is morally right for woman to do like their predecessors frances wright and maria stewart the grimk sisters soon retired from the fray unwilling to endure the intense criticism to which they were subjected.
but their writings helped to spark the movement for womens rights which arose in the 1840s.
elizabeth cady stanton and lucretia mott the key organizers of the seneca falls convention of 1848 were veterans of the antislavery crusade.
in 1840 they had traveled to london as delegates to the world anti slavery convention only to be barred from participating because of their sex.
the seneca falls convention a gathering on behalf of womens rights held in the upstate new york town where stanton lived raised the issue of womans suffrage for the first time.
stanton the principal author modeled the seneca falls declaration of sentiments on the declaration of independence see the appendix for the full text.
but the document added women to jeffersons axiom all men are created equal and in place of a list of injustices committed by george iii it condemned the injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman the first to be listed was denying her the right to vote.
as stanton told the convention only the vote would make woman free as man is free since in a democratic society freedom was impossible without access to the ballot.
the argument was recent h1 voices of freedom from angelina grimk letter in the liberator august 2 1837 the daughters of a prominent south carolina slaveholder angelina and sarah grimk became abolitionists after being sent to philadelphia for education.
in this article angelina grimk explains how participation in the movement against slavery led her to a greater recognition of womens lack of basic freedoms.
distinction in sex sinks to insignificance and nothingness for i believe it regulates rights and responsibilities no more than the color of the skin or the eyes.
my doctrine then is that whatever it is morally right for man to do it is morally right for woman to do.
this regulation of duty by the mere circumstance of sex.
has led to all that numerous train of evils flowing out of the antichristian doctrine of masculine and feminine virtues.
by this doctrine man has been converted since i engaged in the investigation of the rights of the slave i have necessarily been led to a better understanding of my own for i have found the anti slavery cause to be.
the school in which human rights are more fully investigated and better understood and taught than in any other reform enterprise.
here we are led to examine why human beings have any rights.
it is because they are moral beings.
now it naturally occurred to me that if rights were founded in moral being then the circumstance of sex could not give to man higher rights and responsibilities than to woman.
when i look at human beings as moral beings all into the warrior and clothed in sternness.
whilst woman has been taught to lean upon an arm of flesh to.
be admired for her personal charms and caressed and humored like a spoiled child or converted into a mere drudge to suit the convenience of her lord and master.

from frederick douglass s p e e c h o n j u l y 5 1 8 5 2 r o c h e s t e r n e w yo r k one of the most prominent reform leaders of his era frederick douglass escaped from slavery in 1838 and soon became an internationally known writer and orator against slavery.
his speech of july 1852 condemned the hypocrisy of a nation that proclaimed its devotion to freedom while practicing slavery.
it was reprinted in 1855 in his autobiography my bondage and my freedom.
fellow citizens pardon me allow me to ask why am i called upon to speak here to day.
what have i or those i represent to do with your national independence.
are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice embodied in that declaration of independence extended to us.
such is not the case.
i say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us.
i am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary.
your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.
the rich inheritance of justice liberty prosperity and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you not by me.
for the present it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the negro race.
is it not astonishing that while we are ploughing planting and reaping using all kinds of mechanical tools erecting houses constructing bridges building ships.
acting as clerks merchants and secretaries.
confessing and worshiping the christians god and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave we are called upon to prove that we are men.
would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty.
that he is the rightful owner of his body.
you have already declared it.
must i argue the wrongfulness of slavery.
that men have a natural right to freedom.
to do so would be to make myself ridiculous and to offer an insult to your understanding.
there is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.
what to the american slave is your 4th of july.
i answer a day that reveals to him more than all other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.
to him your celebration is a sham your boasted liberty an unholy license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless your denunciations of tyrants brass fronted impudence your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery a thin veil to cover up crimes that would disgrace a nation of savages.
there is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these united states at this very hour.

12 an age of reform 1820 1840 the origins of feminism simple and irrefutable in the words of lydia maria child either the theory of our government the democratic principle that government rests on the will of the people is false or women have a right to vote seneca falls marked the beginning of the seventy year struggle for womans suffrage.
the vote however was hardly the only issue raised at the convention.
the declaration of sentiments condemned the entire structure of inequality that denied women access to education and employment gave husbands control over the property and wages of their wives and custody of children in the event of divorce deprived women of independent legal status after they married and restricted them to the home as their sphere of action equal rights became the rallying cry of the early movement for womens rights and equal rights meant claiming access to all the prevailing definitions of freedom.
portrait of feminist margaret fuller 1810 1850 from an undated daguerreotype.
feminism and freedom like abolitionism temperance and other reforms womens rights was an international movement.
lacking broad backing at home early feminists found allies abroad.
women alone will say what freedom they want declared an article in the free woman a journal established in paris in 1832.
with their household chores diminished because of the availability of manufactured goods and domestic servants many middle class women chafed at the restrictions that made it impossible for them to gain an education enter the professions and in other ways exercise their talents.
whether married or not early feminists insisted women deserved the range of individual choices the possibility of self realization that constituted the essence of freedom.
women wrote margaret fuller had the same right as men to develop their talents to grow.
to live freely and unimpeded the daughter of a jeffersonian congressman fuller was educated at home at first under her fathers supervision she learned latin before the age of six and later on her own.
she became part of new englands transcendentalist circle discussed in chapter 9 and from 1840 to 1842 edited the dial a magazine that reflected the groups views.
in 1844 fuller became literary editor of the new york tribune the first woman to achieve so important a position in american journalism.
in woman in the nineteenth century published in 1845 fuller sought to apply to women the transcendentalist idea that freedom meant a quest for personal development.
every path to self fulfillment she insisted should be open to woman as freely as to man fuller singled out abby kelley as a gentle hero for continuing to speak in public despite being denounced by men for venturing out of her sphere fearing that marriage to an american would inevitably mean subordination to male dictation fuller traveled to europe as a correspondent for the tribune.
there she married an italian patriot.
along with her husband and baby she died in a shipwreck in 1850 while returning to the united states.
women and work women also demanded the right to participate in the market revolution.
at an 1851 womens rights convention the black abolitionist sojourner truth what were the diverse sources of the antebellum womens rights movement and its significance.
insisted that the movement devote attention to the plight of poor and working class women and repudiate the idea that women were too delicate to engage in work outside the home.
born a slave in new york state around 1799 truth did not obtain her freedom until the states emancipation law of 1827.
a listener at her 1851 speech which was not recorded at the time later recalled that truth had spoken of her years of hard physical labor had flexed her arm to show her strength and exclaimed and arent i a woman although those who convened at seneca falls were predominantly from the middle class no representatives of the growing number of factory girls and domestic servants took part the participants rejected the identification of the home as the womens sphere women wrote pauline davis in 1853 must go to work to emancipate themselves from bondage during the 1850s some feminists tried to popularize a new style of dress devised by amelia bloomer consisting of a loose fitting tunic and trousers.
in her autobiography published in 1898 elizabeth cady stanton recalled that women who adopted bloomers attire were ridiculed by the press and insulted by crowds of boys in the streets they found that the physical freedom enjoyed did not compensate for the persistent persecution and petty annoyances suffered at every turn the target of innumerable male jokes the bloomer costume attempted to make a serious point that the long dresses tight corsets and numerous petticoats considered to be appropriate female attire were so confining that they made it almost impossible for women to claim a place in the public sphere or to work outside the home.
in one sense feminism demanded an expansion of the boundaries of freedom rather than a redefinition of the idea.
women in the words of one reformer should enjoy the rights and liberties that every free white male citizen takes to himself as god given but even as it sought to apply prevailing notions of freedom to women the movement posed a fundamental challenge to some of societys central beliefs that the capacity for independence and rationality were male traits that the world was properly womans emancipation a satirical engraving from harpers monthly august 1851 illustrating the muchridiculed bloomer costume.
12 an age of reform 1820 1840 the origins of feminism divided into public and private realms and that issues of justice and freedom did not apply to relations within the family.
in every realm of life including the inner workings of the family declared elizabeth cady stanton there could be no happiness without freedom the am i not a woman and a sister an illustration from the liberator 1849.
identifying with the plight of the female slave enabled free women to see more clearly the inequalities they themselves faced.
slavery of sex the dichotomy between freedom and slavery powerfully shaped early feminists political language.
just as the idea of wage slavery enabled northern workers to challenge the inequalities inherent in market definitions of freedom the concept of the slavery of sex empowered the womens movement to develop an all encompassing critique of male authority and their own subordination.
feminists of the 1840s and 1850s pointed out that the law of marriage made nonsense of the description of the family as a private institution independent of public authority.
when the abolitionists and womens rights activitists lucy stone and henry blackwell married they felt obliged to repudiate new yorks laws that clothed the husband with legal powers which.
no man should possess feminist abolitionists did not invent the analogy between marriage and slavery.
the english writer mary wollstonecraft had invoked it as early as the 1790s in a vindication of the rights of woman discussed in chapter 8.
but the analogy between free women and slaves gained prominence as it was swept up in the accelerating debate over slavery.
woman is a slave from the cradle to the grave asserted ernestine rose.
father guardian husband master still.
one conveys her like a piece of property over to the other for their part southern defenders of slavery frequently linked slavery and marriage as natural and just forms of inequality.
eliminating the former institution they charged would threaten the latter.
marriage was not literally speaking equivalent to slavery.
the married woman however did not enjoy the fruits of her own labor a central element of freedom.
beginning with mississippi in 1839 numerous states enacted married womens property laws shielding from a husbands creditors property brought into a marriage by his wife.
such laws initially aimed not to expand womens rights as much as to prevent families from losing their property during the depression that began in 1837.
but in 1860 new york enacted a more far reaching measure allowing married women to sign contracts buy and sell property and keep their own wages.
in most states however property accumulated after marriage as well as wages earned by the wife still belonged to the husband.
social freedom influenced by abolitionism womens rights advocates turned another popular understanding of freedom self ownership or control over ones own person in an entirely new direction.
the emphasis in abolitionist literature on the violation of the slave womans body by her master helped to give the idea of self ownership a concrete reality that encouraged application to free women as well.
the law of domestic relations presupposed the husbands right of sexual access to his wife and to inflict corporal punishment on her.
courts proved reluctant to intervene in cases of physical what were the diverse sources of the antebellum womens rights movement and its significance.
abuse so long as it was not extreme or intolerable womens rights declared a boston meeting in 1859 included freedom and equal rights in the family the demand that women should enjoy the rights to regulate their own sexual activity and procreation and to be protected by the state against violence at the hands of their husbands challenged the notion that claims for justice freedom and individual rights should stop at the households door.
the issue of womens private freedom revealed underlying differences within the movement for womens rights.
belief in equality between the sexes and in the sexes natural differences coexisted in antebellum feminist thought.
even as they entered the public sphere and thereby challenged some aspects of the eras cult of domesticity discussed in chapter 9 many early feminists accepted other elements.
allowing women a greater role in the public sphere many female reformers argued would bring their inborn maternal instincts to bear on public life to the benefit of the entire society.
even feminists critical of the existing institution of marriage generally refrained from raising in public the explosive issue of womens private freedom.
the question frequently arose however in the correspondence of feminist leaders.
social freedom susan b anthony observed to lucy stone lies at the bottom of all and until woman gets that she must continue the slave of men in all other things women like anthony who never married and stone who with her husband created their own definition of marriage reflected the same dissatisfactions with traditional family life as the women who joined communitarian experiments.
not until the twentieth century would the demand that freedom be extended to intimate aspects of life inspire a mass movement.
but the dramatic fall in the birthrate over the course of the nineteenth century suggests that many women were quietly exercising personal freedom in their most intimate relationships.
the abolitionist schism even in reform circles the demand for a greater public role for women remained extremely controversial.
massachusetts physician samuel gridley howe pioneered humane treatment of the blind and educational reform and he was an ardent abolitionist.
but howe did not support his wifes participation in the movement for female suffrage which he complained caused her to neglect domestic relations when organized abolitionism split into two wings in 1840 the immediate cause was a dispute over the proper role of women in antislavery work.
abby kelleys appointment to the business committee of the american anti slavery society sparked the formation of a rival abolitionist organization the american and foreign anti slavery society which believed it wrong for a woman to occupy so prominent a position.
the antislavery poet john greenleaf whittier compared kelley to eve delilah and helen of troy women who had sown the seeds of male destruction.
behind the split lay the fear among some abolitionists that garrisons radicalism on issues like womens rights as well as his refusal to support the idea of abolitionists voting or running for public office impeded the movements growth.

in 1840 antislavery northerners saw little wisdom in throwing away their ballots on a third party candidate.
while the achievement of most of their demands lay far in the future the womens rights movement succeeded in making the woman question a permanent part of the transatlantic discussion of social reform.
as for abolitionism although it remained a significant presence in northern public life until emancipation was achieved by 1840 the movement had accomplished its most important work.
more than 1 000 local antislavery societies were now scattered throughout the north representing a broad constituency awakened to the moral issue of slavery.
the great duty of freedom ralph waldo emerson had declared in 1837 was to open our halls to discussion of this question the abolitionists greatest achievement lay in shattering the conspiracy of silence that had sought to preserve national unity by suppressing public debate over slavery.

l i n 1855 thomas crawford one of the eras most prominent american sculptors was asked to design a statue to adorn the capitols dome still under construction in washington d c.
he proposed a statue of freedom a female figure wearing a liberty cap.
secretary of war jefferson davis of mississippi one of the countrys largest slaveholders objected to crawfords plan.
a familiar symbol in the colonial era the liberty cap had fallen into disfavor among some americans after becoming closely identified with the french revolution.
daviss disapproval however rested on other grounds.
ancient romans he noted regarded the cap as the badge of the freed slave its use he feared might suggest that there was a connection between the slaves longing for freedom and the liberty of free born americans.
davis ordered the liberty cap replaced with a less controversial military symbol a feathered helmet.
crawford died in italy where he had spent most of his career in 1857.
two years later the colossal statue of freedom which weighed 15 000 pounds was transported to the united states in several pieces and assembled at a maryland foundry under the direction of philip reed a slave craftsman.
in 1863 it was installed atop the capitol where it can still be seen today.
by the time it was put in place the country was immersed in the civil war and jefferson davis had become president of the confederate states of america.

fruits of manifest destiny continental expansion in the 1840s slavery moved to the center stage of american politics.
it did so not in the moral language or with the immediatist program of abolitionism but as a result of the nations territorial expansion.
by 1840 with the completion of indian removal virtually all the land east of the mississippi river was in white hands.
the depression that began in 1837 sparked a large migration of settlers further west.
some headed to oregon whose willamette valley was reputed to be one of the continents most beautiful and fertile regions.
until the 1840s the american presence in the area had been limited to a few fur traders and explorers.
but between 1840 and 1845 some 5 000 emigrants made the difficult 2 000 mile journey by wagon train to oregon from jumping off places on the banks of the missouri river.
by 1860 nearly 300 000 men women and children had braved disease starvation the natural barrier of the rocky mountains and occasional indian attacks to travel overland to oregon and california.
during most of the 1840s the united states and great britain jointly administered oregon and utah was part of mexico.
this did not stop americans from settling in either region.

questions 1.
how does gast explain the conquest of the west by white americans.
what elements of indian white relations does the artist leave out.
what were the major factors contributing to u s territorial expansion in the 1840s.
the mexican and california frontier new mexico settlement of oregon did not directly raise the issue of slavery.
but the nations acquisition of part of mexico did.
when mexico achieved its independence from spain in 1821 it was nearly as large as the united states and its population of 6 5 million was about two thirds that of its northern neighbor.
mexicos northern provinces california new mexico and texas however were isolated and sparsely settled outposts surrounded by indian country.
new mexicos population at the time of mexican independence consisted of around 30 000 persons of spanish origin 10 000 pueblo indians and an indeterminate number of wild indians nomadic bands of apaches comanches navajos and utes.
with the opening in 1821 of the santa fe trail linking that city with independence missouri new mexicos commerce with the united states eclipsed trade with the rest of mexico.
californias non indian population in 1821 some 3 200 missionaries soldiers and settlers was vastly outnumbered by about 20 000 indians living and working on land owned by religious missions and by 150 000 members of unsubdued tribes in the interior.
in 1834 in the hope of reducing the power of the catholic church and attracting mexican and foreign settlers to california the mexican government dissolved the great mission landholdings and emancipated indians working for the friars.
most of the land ended up in the hands of a new class of mexican cattle ranchers the californios who defined their own identity in large measure against the surrounding indian population.
californios referred to themselves as gente de razn people capable of reason as opposed to the indios whom they called gente sin razn people without reason.
for the common good indians were required to continue to work for the new landholders.
a watercolor of a scene on a ranch near monterey california in 1849 depicts californios supervising the work of native americans.
8 securing the republic 1790 1815 the bank of pennsylvania philadelphia.
designed by the architect benjamin latrobe and built between 1798 and 1801 this elegant structure with greek columns housed one of the countrys first banks.
hamiltons program was intended to give the countrys financial leaders a stake in the stability of the federal government.
the emergence politics in an age of passion of opposition hamiltons vision of a powerful commercial republic won strong support from american financiers manufacturers and merchants.
but it alarmed those who believed the new nations destiny lay in charting a different path of development.
hamiltons plans hinged on close ties with britain americas main trading partner.
to james madison and thomas jefferson the future lay in westward expansion not connections with europe.
they had little desire to promote manufacturing or urban growth or to see economic policy shaped in the interests of bankers and business leaders.
their goal was a republic of independent farmers marketing grain tobacco and other products freely to the entire world.
free trade they believed not a system of government favoritism through tariffs and subsidies would promote american prosperity while fostering greater social equality.
jefferson and madison quickly concluded that the greatest threat to american freedom lay in the alliance of a powerful central government with an emerging class of commercial capitalists such as hamilton appeared to envision.
to jefferson hamiltons system flowed from principles adverse to liberty and was calculated to undermine and demolish the republic hamiltons plans for a standing army seemed to his critics a bold threat to freedom.
the national bank and assumption of state debts they feared would introduce into american politics the same corruption that had undermined british liberty and enrich those already wealthy at the expense of ordinary americans.
during the 1780s speculators had bought up at great discounts often only a few cents on the dollar government bonds and paper notes that had been used to pay those who fought in the revolution or supplied the army.
under hamiltons plan speculators would reap a windfall by being paid at face value while the original holders received nothing.
because transportation was so poor moreover many backcountry farmers were used to distilling their grain harvest into whiskey which could then be carried more easily to market.
hamiltons whiskey tax seemed to single them out unfairly in order to enrich bondholders.
what issues made the politics of the 1790s so divisive.
the jefferson h a m i lt o n bargain at first opposition to hamiltons program arose almost entirely from the south the region that had the least interest in manufacturing development and the least diversified economy.
it also had fewer holders of federal bonds than the middle states and new england.
virginia had pretty much paid off its war debt it did not see why it should be taxed to benefit states like massachusetts that had failed to do so.
hamilton insisted that all his plans were authorized by the constitutions ambiguous clause empowering congress to enact laws for the general welfare as a result many southerners who had supported the new constitution now became strict constructionists who insisted that the federal government could only exercise powers specifically listed in the document.
jefferson for example believed the new national bank unconstitutional since the right of congress to create a bank was not mentioned in the constitution.
opposition in congress threatened the enactment of hamiltons plans.
behind the scenes negotiations followed.
they culminated at a famous dinner in 1790 at which jefferson brokered an agreement whereby southerners accepted hamiltons fiscal program with the exception of subsidies to manufacturers in exchange for the establishment of the permanent national capital on the potomac river between maryland and virginia.
southerners hoped that the location would enhance their own power in the government while removing it from the influence of the northern financiers and merchants with whom hamilton seemed to be allied.
major pierre charles lenfant a french born veteran of the war of independence designed a grandiose plan for the federal city modeled on the great urban centers of europe with wide boulevards parks and fountains.
the job of surveying was done in part by benjamin banneker the free africanamerican scientist mentioned in the previous chapter.
when it came to constructing public buildings in the nations new capital most of the labor was done by slaves.
the impact of the french revolution political divisions began over hamiltons fiscal program but they deepened in response to events in europe.
when it began in 1789 nearly all americans welcomed the french revolution inspired in part by the example of their own rebellion.
john marshall a virginian who would become chief justice of the supreme court later recalled i sincerely believed human liberty to depend in a great measure on the success of the french revolution but in 1793 the revolution took a more radical turn with the execution of king louis xvi along with numerous aristocrats and other foes of the new government and war broke out between france and great britain.
events in france became a source of bitter conflict in america.
jefferson and his followers believed that despite its excesses the revolution marked a historic victory for the idea of popular self government which must be defended at all costs.
enthusiasm for france inspired a rebirth of symbols of liberty.
liberty poles and caps reappeared on the streets of american towns and cities.
to washington hamilton and their supporters however the revolution raised the specter of anarchy.
america they believed had no choice but to draw closer to britain.
venerate the plough a medal of the philadelphia society for the promotion of agriculture 1786.
americans like jefferson and madison believed that farmers were the most virtuous citizens and therefore agriculture must remain the foundation of american life.
8 securing the republic 1790 1815 pierre charles lenfants 1791 plan for washington d c includes broad avenues that crisscross the city and that are named for the thirteen states and a long mall stretching from the potomac river to the capitol building slightly to the right of center.
politics in an age of passion american leaders feared being divided into parties swayed by rival european powers in the words of john quincy adams.
but the rivalry between britain and france did much to shape early american politics.
the permanent alliance between france and the united states which dated to 1778 complicated the situation.
no one advocated that the united states should become involved in the european war and washington in april 1793 issued a proclamation of american neutrality.
but that spring the french revolutions american admirers organized tumultuous welcomes for edmond genet a french envoy seeking to arouse support for his beleaguered government.
when genet began commissioning american ships to attack british vessels under the french flag the washington administration asked for his recall.
deeming the situation in france too dangerous he decided to remain in america and married the daughter of george clinton the governor of new york.
meanwhile the british seized hundreds of american ships trading with the french west indies and resumed the hated practice of impressment kidnapping sailors including american citizens of british origin to serve in their navy.
sent to london to present objections while still serving as chief justice john jay negotiated an agreement in 1794 that produced the greatest public controversy of washingtons presidency.
jays treaty contained no british concessions on impressment or the rights of american shipping.
britain did agree to abandon outposts on the western frontier which it was supposed to have done in 1783.
in return the united states guaranteed favored treatment to british imported goods.
in effect the treaty canceled the american french alliance and recognized british economic and naval supremacy as unavoidable facts of life.
critics of the what issues made the politics of the 1790s so divisive.
administration charged that it aligned the united states with monarchical britain in its conflict with republican france.
ultimately jays treaty sharpened political divisions in the united states and led directly to the formation of an organized opposition party.
political parties by the mid 1790s two increasingly coherent parties had appeared in congress calling themselves federalists and republicans.
the latter had no connection with todays republican party which was founded in the 1850s.
both parties laid claim to the language of liberty and each accused its opponent of engaging in a conspiracy to destroy it.
the federalists supporters of the washington administration favored hamiltons economic program and close ties with britain.
prosperous merchants farmers lawyers and established political leaders especially outside the south tended to support the federalists.
their outlook was generally elitist reflecting the traditional eighteenth century view of society as a fixed hierarchy and of public office as reserved for men of economic substance the rich the able and the well born as hamilton put it.
freedom federalists insisted rested on deference to authority.
it did not mean the right to stand up in opposition to government.
federalists feared that the spirit of liberty unleashed by the american revolution was degenerating into anarchy and licentiousness when the new york federalist leader rufus king wrote an essay on the words.
with wrong meaning that had done great harm to american society his first example was liberty the whiskey rebellion the federalists may have been the only major party in american history forthrightly to proclaim democracy and freedom dangerous in the hands of infant liberty nursed by mother mob a federalist cartoon from 1807 illustrates the partys fear that the spirit of liberty was degenerating into anarchy.

politics in an age of passion ordinary citizens.
the whiskey rebellion of 1794 which broke out when backcountry pennsylvania farmers sought to block collection of the new tax on distilled spirits reinforced this conviction.
the rebels invoked the symbols of 1776 displaying liberty poles and banners reading liberty or death the citizens of the western country one group wrote to the president consider the tax as repugnant to liberty and an invasion of those privileges which the revolution bestowed upon them but washington dispatched 13 000 militiamen to western pennsylvania a larger force than he had commanded during the revolution.
he accompanied them part of the way to the scene of the disturbances the only time in american history that the president has actually commanded an army in the field.
the rebels offered no resistance.
his vigorous response washington wrote was motivated in part by concern for the impression the restoration of public order will make on others the others being europeans who did not believe the american experiment in self government could survive.
the republican party republicans led by madison and jefferson were more sympathetic to france than the federalists and had more faith in democratic self government.
they drew their support from an unusual alliance of wealthy southern planters and ordinary farmers throughout the country.
enthusiasm for the french revolution increasingly drew urban artisans into republican ranks as well.
republicans preferred what a new hampshire editor called the boisterous sea of liberty to the calm of despotism they were far more critical than the federalists of social and economic inequality and more accepting of broad democratic participation as essential to freedom.
each emerging party considered itself the representative of the nation and the other an illegitimate faction as early as 1792 madison composed an imaginary dialogue between spokesmen for the two groups.
the federalist described ordinary people as stupid suspicious licentious and accused the republican of being an accomplice of atheism and anarchy the latter called the federalist an opponent of liberty and an idolater of tyranny in real life too political language became more and more heated.
federalists denounced republicans as french agents anarchists and traitors.
republicans called their opponents monarchists intent on transforming the new national government into a corrupt british style aristocracy.
each charged the other with betraying the principles of the war of independence and of american freedom.
washington himself received mounting abuse.
when he left office a republican newspaper declared what issues made the politics of the 1790s so divisive.
that his name had become synonymous with political iniquity and legalized corruption one contemporary complained that the american press one of the great safeguards of free government had become the most scurrilous in the civilized world an expanding public sphere the debates of the 1790s produced not only one of the most intense periods of partisan warfare in american history but also an enduring expansion of the public sphere and with it the democratic content of american freedom.
more and more citizens attended political meetings and became avid readers of pamphlets and newspapers.
the establishment of nearly 1 000 post offices made possible the wider circulation of personal letters and printed materials.
the era witnessed the rapid growth of the american press the number of newspapers rose from around 100 to 260 during the 1790s and reached nearly 400 by 1810.
hundreds of obscure men wrote pamphlets and newspaper essays and formed political organizations.
the decades democratic ferment was reflected in writings like the key of liberty by william manning a selfeducated massachusetts farmer who had fought at the battle of concord that began the war of independence.
although not published until many years later mannings work addressed to friends to liberty and free government reflected the eras popular political thought.
the most important division in society manning declared was between the few and the many he called for the latter to form a national political association to prevent the few from destroying free government and tyrannizing over the people.
the democratic republican societies inspired by the jacobin clubs of paris supporters of the french revolution and critics of the washington administration in 1793 and 1794 formed nearly fifty democratic republican societies.
the republican press publicized their meetings replete with toasts to french and american liberty.
the declaration of the democratic society of addison county vermont was typical that all men are naturally free and possess equal rights.
that all legitimate government originates in the voluntary social compact of the people federalists saw the societies as another example of how liberty was getting out of hand.
the government not self created societies declared the president was the authentic voice of the american people.
forced to justify their existence the societies developed a defense of the right of the people to debate political issues and organize to affect public policy.
to the societies free inquiry and free communication formed the first line of defense of the unalienable rights of free men political liberty meant not simply voting at elections but constant involvement in public affairs.
we make no apology for thus associating ourselves declared the addison a print shop in the early republic.

the pennsylvania society issued an address defending itself against critics who questioned its right to criticize the administration of george washington.
thinking merely for of this right the greatest tyrant cannot deprive his meanest slave but it is freedom in the communication of sentiments by speech or through the press.
this liberty is an imprescriptable unlimitable right independent of any constitution or social compact it is as complete a right as that which any man has to the enjoyment of his life.
these principles are eternal they are recognized by our constitution and that nation is already enslaved that does not acknowledge their the principles and proceedings of our association have lately been caluminated tarred by malicious falsehoods.
we should think ourselves unworthy to be ranked as freemen if awed by the name of any man however he may command the public gratitude for past services we could suffer in silence so sacred a right so important a principle as the freedom of opinion to be infringed by attack on societies which stand on that constitutional basis.
freedom of thought and a free communication of opinions by speech through the medium of the press are the safeguards of our liberties.
by the freedom of opinion cannot be meant the right of truth.

she herself is most unhappy she feels the want of a cultivated of the first women to demand equal educational opportunities for women.

is it indeed a fact that she hath yielded to one half of the human species so unquestionable a mental superiority.
i know that to both sexes elevated understandings and the reverse are common.
but suffer me to ask in what the minds of females are so notoriously deficient or unequal.
are we deficient in reason.
we can only reason from what we know and if an opportunity of mind.

yes ye lordly ye haughty sex our souls are by nature equal to yours.
acquiring knowledge hath been denied us the inferiority of our sex cannot fairly be deduced from thence.
will it be said that the judgment of a male of two years old is more sage than that of a females of the same age.

but from that period what partiality.

how does murray answer the argument that offering education to women will lead them to neglect their domestic employments.
how do these documents reflect expanding ideas about who should enjoy the freedom to express ones ideas in the early republic.

but much of their organization and outlook was absorbed into the emerging republican party.
they helped to legitimize the right of any portion of the people regardless of station in life to express political opinions and take an active role in public life.
the republicans also gained support from immigrants from the british isles where war with france inspired a severe crackdown on dissent.
thomas paine had returned to britain in 1787.
five years later after publishing the rights of man a defense of the french revolution and a stirring call for democratic change at home he was forced to flee to france one step ahead of the law.
but his writings inspired the emergence of a mass movement for political and social change which authorities brutally suppressed.
threatened with arrest for treason a number of british and irish radicals emigrated to america.
they included journalists like joseph gales and john d burk who soon found themselves editing republican newspapers that condemned social privilege on both sides of the atlantic and charged the federalists with attempting to introduce european tyranny in america.
the rights of women the democratic ferment of the 1790s inspired renewed discussion about womens rights.
in 1792 mary wollstonecraft published in england her extraordinary pamphlet a vindication of the rights of woman.
inspired by paines rights of man she asserted that the rights of humanity should not be confined to the male line wollstonecraft did not directly challenge traditional gender roles.
her call for greater access to education and to paid employment for women rested on the idea that this would enable single women to support themselves and married women to perform more capably as wives and mothers.
but she did drop a hint as she put it that women ought to have representation in government.
within two years american editions of wollstonecrafts work had appeared along with pamphlets defending and attacking her arguments.
a short lived womens rights magazine was published in 1795 in new york city.
the expansion of the public sphere offered new opportunities to women.
increasing numbers began expressing their thoughts in print.

1790 murray insisted that women had as much right as men to exercise all their talents and should be allowed equal educational opportunities to enable them to do so.
womens apparent mental inferiority to men she insisted simply reflected the fact that they had been denied the opportunity of acquiring knowledge the idea of the incapability of women she maintained was totally inadmissable in this enlightened age women and the republic were women part of the new body politic.
until after the civil war the word male did not appear in the constitution.
women were counted fully in determining representation in congress and there was nothing explicitly limiting the rights outlined in the constitution to men.
a few contributors to the pamphlet debate on womens rights admitted that according to the logic of democracy women ought to have a voice in government.
the constitutions use of the word he to describe officeholders however reflected an assumption so widespread that it scarcely required explicit defense politics was a realm for men.
the time had not yet arrived for a broad assault on gender inequality.
but like the activities of the democratic republican societies the discussion of womens status helped to popularize the language of rights in the new republic.
the men who wrote the constitution did not envision the active and continuing involvement of ordinary citizens in affairs of state.
but the rise of political parties seeking to mobilize voters in hotly contested elections the emergence of the self created societies the stirrings of womens political consciousness and even armed uprisings like the whiskey rebellion broadened and deepened the democratization of public life set in motion by the american revolution.
the adams presidency in 1792 washington won unanimous reelection.
four years later he decided to retire from public life in part to establish the precedent that the presidency is not a life office.
in his farewell address mostly drafted by hamilton and published in the newspapers rather than delivered orally see the appendix for excerpts from the speech washington defended his administration against criticism warned against the party spirit and advised his countrymen to steer clear of international power politics by avoiding permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world the election of george washingtons departure unleashed fierce party competition over the choice of his successor.

8 securing the republic 1790 1815 the adams presidency two tickets presented themselves john adams with thomas pinckney of south carolina for vice president representing the federalists and thomas jefferson with aaron burr of new york for the republicans.
in a majority of the sixteen states vermont kentucky and tennessee had been added to the original thirteen during washingtons presidency the legislature still chose presidential electors.
but in the six states where the people voted for electors directly intense campaigning took place.
adams received seventy one electoral votes to jeffersons sixty eight.
because of factionalism among the federalists pinckney received only fifty nine votes so jefferson the leader of the opposition party became vice president.
voting fell almost entirely along sectional lines adams carried new england new york and new jersey while jefferson swept the south along with pennsylvania.
in 1797 john adams assumed leadership of a divided nation.
brilliant but austere stubborn and self important he was disliked even by those who honored his long career of service to the cause of independence.
his presidency was beset by crises.
on the international front the country was nearly dragged into the ongoing european war.
as a neutral nation the united states claimed the right to trade nonmilitary goods with both britain and france but both countries seized american ships with impunity.
in 1797 american diplomats were sent to paris to negotiate a treaty to replace the old alliance of 1778.
french officials presented them with a demand for bribes before negotiations could proceed.
when adams made public the envoys dispatches the french officials were designated by the last three letters of the alphabet.
this xyz affair poisoned americas relations with its former ally.
by 1798 the united states and france were engaged in a quasi war at sea with french ships seizing american vessels in the caribbean and a newly enlarged american navy harassing the french.
in effect the united states had become a military ally of great britain.
despite pressure from hamilton who desired a declaration of war adams in 1800 negotiated peace with france.
adams was less cautious in domestic affairs.
unrest continued in many rural areas.
in 1799 farmers in southeastern pennsylvania obstructed the assessment of a tax on land and houses that congress had imposed to help fund an expanded army and navy.
a crowd led by john fries a local militia leader and auctioneer released arrested men from prison.
no shots were fired in what came to be called friess rebellion but adams dispatched units of the federal army to the area.
the army arrested fries for treason and proceeded to terrorize his supporters tear down liberty poles and whip republican newspaper editors.
adams pardoned fries in 1800 but the area which had supported his election in 1796 never again voted federalist.
the reign of witches but the greatest crisis of the adams administration arose over the alien and sedition acts of 1798.
confronted with mounting opposition some of it voiced by immigrant pamphleteers and editors federalists moved to silence their critics.
a new naturalization act extended from five to fourteen years the residency requirement for immigrants seeking american citizenship.
the alien act allowed the deportation of persons from abroad deemed dangerous by federal authorities.
the sedition act which was set to expire in 1801 by which time adams hoped to have been reelected authorized the prosecu how did competing views of freedom and global events promote the political divisions of the 1790s.
tion of virtually any public assembly or publication critical of the government.
while more lenient than many such measures in europe it did not authorize legal action before publication and allowed for trials by jury the new law meant that opposition editors could be prosecuted for almost any political comment they printed.
the main target was the republican press seen by federalists as a group of upstart workingmen most editors had started out as printers whose persistent criticism of the administration fomented popular rebelliousness and endangered genuine liberty the passage of these measures launched what jefferson recalling events in salem massachusetts a century earlier termed a reign of witches eighteen individuals including several republican newspaper editors were charged under the sedition act.
ten were convicted for spreading false scandalous and malicious information about the government.
matthew lyon a member of congress from vermont and editor of a republican newspaper the scourge of aristocracy received a sentence of four months in prison and a fine of 1 000.
lyon had been the first former printer and most likely the first former indentured servant elected to congress.
the government also imprisoned thomas cooper a lawyer and physician in pennsylvania who had emigrated from england in 1794 for writings accusing the adams administration of pro british bias.
in massachusetts authorities indicted several men for erecting a liberty pole bearing the inscription no stamp act no sedition no alien bill no land tax downfall to the tyrants of america the virginia and kentucky resolutions the alien and sedition acts failed to silence the republican press.
some newspapers ceased publication but new ones with names like sun of liberty and tree of liberty entered the field.
the sedition act thrust freedom of expression to the center of discussions of american liberty.
madison and jefferson mobilized opposition drafting resolutions adopted by the virginia and kentucky legislatures.
both resolutions attacked the sedition act as an unconstitutional violation of the first amendment.
virginias written by madison called on the federal courts to protect free speech.
the original version of jeffersons kentucky resolution went further asserting that states could nullify laws of congress that violated the constitution that is states could unilaterally prevent the enforcement of such laws within their borders.
the legislature prudently deleted this passage.
the resolutions were directed against assaults on freedom of expression by the federal government not the states.
jefferson took care to insist that the states fully possessed the authority to punish seditious speech even if the national government did not.
indeed state level prosecutions of newspapers for seditious libel did not end when the sedition act expired in 1801.

8 securing the republic 1790 1815 the adams presidency no other state endorsed the virginia and kentucky resolutions.
many americans including many republicans were horrified by the idea of state action that might endanger the union.
but the crisis of freedom of the late 1790s strongly reinforced the idea that freedom of discussion was an indispensable attribute of american liberty and of democratic government.
free speech as massachusetts federalist harrison gray otis noted had become the peoples darling privilege the broad revulsion against the alien and sedition acts contributed greatly to jeffersons election as president in 1800.
the an 1800 campaign banner with a portrait of thomas jefferson and the words john adams is no more revolution of 1800 jefferson and liberty became the watchword of the republican campaign.
by this time republicans had developed effective techniques for mobilizing voters such as printing pamphlets handbills and newspapers and holding mass meetings to promote their cause.
the federalists who viewed politics as an activity for a small group of elite men found it difficult to match their opponents mobilization.
nonetheless they still dominated new england and enjoyed considerable support in the middle atlantic states.
jefferson triumphed with seventy three electoral votes to adamss sixty five.
before assuming office jefferson was forced to weather an unusual constitutional crisis.
each party arranged to have an elector throw away one of his two votes for president so that its presidential candidate would come out a vote ahead of the vice presidential.
but the designated republican elector failed to do so.
as a result both jefferson and his running mate aaron burr received seventy three electoral votes.
with no candidate having a majority the election was thrown into the house of representatives that had been elected in 1798 where the federalists enjoyed a slight majority.
for thirty five ballots neither man received a majority of the votes.
finally hamilton intervened.
he disliked jefferson but believed him enough of a statesman to recognize that the federalist financial system could not be dismantled.
burr he warned was obsessed with power an embryo caesar hamiltons support for jefferson tipped the balance.
to avoid a repetition of the crisis congress and the states soon adopted the twelfth amendment to the constitution requiring electors to cast separate votes for president and vice president.
the election of 1800 also set in motion a chain of events that culminated four years later when burr killed hamilton in a duel.
burr appears to have subsequently engaged in a plot to form a new nation in the west from land detached from the united states and the spanish empire.
acquitted of treason in 1807 he went into exile in europe eventually returning to new york where he practiced law until his death in 1836.
the events of the 1790s demonstrated that a majority of americans believed ordinary people had a right to play an active role in politics how did competing views of freedom and global events promote the political divisions of the 1790s.
express their opinions freely and contest the policies of their government.
his party wrote samuel goodrich a prominent connecticut federalist was overthrown because democracy had become the watchword of popular liberty to their credit federalists never considered resistance to the election result.
adamss acceptance of defeat established the vital precedent of a peaceful transfer of power from a defeated party to its successor.
slavery and politics lurking behind the political battles of the 1790s lay the potentially divisive issue of slavery.
jefferson after all received every one of the souths fortyone electoral votes.
he always referred to his victory as the revolution of 1800 and saw it not simply as a party success but as a vindication of american freedom securing for posterity the fruits of independence.
yet the triumph of jefferson and liberty would not have been possible without slavery.
had three fifths of the slaves not been counted in apportionment john adams would have been reelected in 1800.
the issue of slavery would not disappear.
the very first congress under the new constitution received petitions calling for emancipation.
one bore the weighty signature of benjamin franklin who in 1787 had agreed to serve as president of the pennsylvania abolition society.
the blessings of liberty franklins petition insisted should be available without distinction of color to all descriptions of people a long debate followed in which speakers from georgia and south carolina vigorously defended the institution and warned that behind northern criticism of slavery they heard the trumpets of civil war madison found their forthright defense of slavery an embarrassment.
but he concluded that the slavery question was so divisive that it must be kept out of national politics.
he opposed congresss even receiving a petition from north carolina slaves on the grounds that they were not part of the american people and had no claim on the lawmakers attention in 1793 to implement the constitutions fugitive slave clause congress enacted a law providing for federal and state judges and local officials to facilitate the return of escaped slaves.
the haitian revolution events during the 1790s underscored how powerfully slavery defined and distorted american freedom.
the same jeffersonians who hailed the french revolution as a step in the universal progress of liberty reacted in horror against the slave revolution that began in 1791 in saint domingue the jewel of the french overseas empire situated not far from the southern coast of the united states.
toussaint louverture an educated slave on a sugar plantation forged the rebellious slaves into an army able to defeat british forces seeking to seize the island and then an expedition hoping to reestablish french authority.
the slave uprising led to the establishment of haiti as an independent nation in 1804.
although much of the country was left in ruins by years of warfare the haitian revolution affirmed the universality of the revolutionary eras creed of liberty.
it inspired hopes for freedom among slaves in the united states.

during the 1820s several thousand free african americans emigrated to haiti whose government promised newcomers political rights and economic opportunity they did not enjoy in the united states.
among white americans the response to the haitian revolution was different.
thousands of refugees from haiti poured into the united states fleeing the upheaval.
many spread tales of the massacres of slaveowners and the burning of their plantations which reinforced white americans fears of slave insurrection at home.
to most whites the rebellious slaves seemed not men and women seeking liberty in the tradition of 1776 but a danger to american institutions.
that the slaves had resorted to violence was widely taken to illustrate blacks unfitness for republican freedom.
ironically the adams administration which hoped that american merchants could replace their french counterparts in the islands lucrative sugar trade encouraged the independence of black haiti.
when jefferson became president on the other hand he sought to quarantine and destroy the hemispheres second independent republic.
rebellion the momentous year of 1800 witnessed not only the revolution of jeffersons election but an attempted real one a plot by slaves in virginia itself to gain their freedom.
it was organized by a richmond blacksmith gabriel and his brothers solomon also a blacksmith and martin a slave preacher.
the conspirators planned to march on the city which had recently become the state capital from surrounding plantations.
they would kill some white inhabitants and hold the rest including governor james monroe hostage until their demand for the abolition of slavery was met.
gabriel hoped that poor white people would join the insurrection and he ordered that quakers and methodists many of whom were critics of slavery and french people whose country was engaged in the quasiwar with the united states described earlier be spared.
on the night when the slaves were to gather a storm washed out the roads to richmond.
the plot was soon discovered and the leaders arrested.
twentysix slaves including gabriel were hanged and dozens more transported out of the state.
blacks in 1800 made up half of richmonds population.
one fifth were free.
a black community had emerged in the 1780s and 1790s and the conspiracy was rooted in its institutions.
gabriel gathered recruits at black baptist churches funerals barbecues and other gatherings.
in cities like richmond many skilled slave craftsmen including gabriel himself could read and write and enjoyed the privilege of hiring themselves out to employers that is negotiating their own labor arrangements with their owner receiving their wages their relative autonomy helps account for slave artisans prominent role in the conspiracy.
gabriels rebellion was a product of its age.
gabriel himself had been how did competing views of freedom and global events promote the political divisions of the 1790s.
born in 1776.
like other virginians the participants in the conspiracy spoke the language of liberty forged in the american revolution and reinvigorated during the 1790s.
the rebels even planned to carry a banner emblazoned with the slogan reminiscent of patrick henry death or liberty we have as much right one conspirator declared to fight for our liberty as any men another likened himself to george washington who had rebelled against established authority to obtain the liberty of his countrymen this analogy carried the disturbing implication that virginia officials had now replaced the british as enemies of freedom.
if gabriels conspiracy demonstrated anything commented the prominent virginian george tucker it was that slaves possessed the love of freedom as fully as other men.
gabriels words he added reflected the advance of knowledge among virginias slaves including knowledge of the american language of liberty.
when slaves escaped to join lord dunmore during the war of independence he wrote they sought freedom merely as a good now they also claim it as a right tucker believed virginians should emancipate their slaves and settle them outside of the state.
the legislature however moved in the opposite direction.
it tightened controls over the black population making it illegal for them to congregate on sundays without white supervision and severely restricted the possibility of masters voluntarily freeing their slaves.
any slave freed after 1806 was required to leave virginia or be sold back into slavery.
the door to emancipation thrown open during the american revolution had been slammed shut.
jefferson in power the first president to begin his term in washington d c jefferson assumed office on march 4 1801.
the city with its unpaved streets impoverished residents and unfinished public buildings scarcely resembled lenfants grand plan.
at one point part of the roof of the capitol collapsed narrowly missing the vice president.
the capitals condition seemed to symbolize jeffersons intention to reduce the importance of the national government in american life.
jeffersons inaugural address was conciliatory toward his opponents.
every difference of opinion he declared is not a difference of principle.

america the worlds best hope would flourish if a limited government allowed its citizens to be free to regulate their own pursuits jefferson hoped to dismantle as much of the federalist system as possible.
among his first acts as president was to pardon all those imprisoned under the sedition act.
during his eight years as president he reduced the number of government employees and slashed the army and navy.
he abolished all taxes except the tariff including the hated tax on whiskey and paid off part of the national debt.
he aimed to minimize federal power and eliminate government oversight of the economy.
his policies ensured that the united states would not become a centralized state on a european model as hamilton had envisioned.

marshall had served john adams as secretary of state and was appointed by the president to the court shortly before jefferson took office.
a strong believer in national supremacy marshall established the courts power to review laws of congress and the states.
the first landmark decision of the marshall court came in 1803 in the case of marbury v madison.
on the eve of leaving office adams had appointed a number of justices of the peace for the district of columbia.
madison jeffersons secretary of state refused to issue commissions the official documents entitling them to assume their posts to these midnight judges four including william marbury sued for their offices.
marshalls decision declared unconstitutional the section of the judiciary act of 1789 that allowed the courts to order executive officials to deliver judges commissions.
it exceeded the power of congress as outlined in the constitution and was therefore void.
marbury in other words may have been entitled to his commission but the court had no power under the constitution to order madison to deliver it.
on the immediate issue therefore the administration got its way.
but the cost as jefferson saw it was high.
the supreme court had assumed the right to determine whether an act of congress violates the constitution a power known as judicial review seven years later in fletcher v peck the court extended judicial review to state laws.
in 1794 four land companies had paid nearly every member of the state legislature georgias two u s senators and a number of federal judges to secure their right to purchase land in present day alabama and mississippi claimed by georgia.
they then sold the land to individual buyers at a large profit.
two years later many of the corrupt lawmakers were defeated for reelection and the new legislature rescinded the land grant and subsequent sales.
whatever the circumstances of the legislatures initial action marshall declared the constitution forbade georgia from taking any action that impaired a contract.
therefore the individual purchasers could keep their land and the legislature could not repeal the original grant.
the louisiana purchase but the greatest irony of jeffersons presidency involved his greatest achievement the louisiana purchase.
this resulted not from astute what were the achievements and failures of jeffersons presidency.
american diplomacy but because the rebellious slaves of saint domingue defeated forces sent by the ruler of france napoleon bonaparte to reconquer the island.
moreover to take advantage of the sudden opportunity to purchase louisiana jefferson had to abandon his conviction that the federal government was limited to powers specifically mentioned in the constitution since the document said nothing about buying territory from a foreign power.
this vast louisiana territory which stretched from the gulf of mexico to canada and from the mississippi river to the rocky mountains had been ceded by france to spain in 1762 as part of the reshuffling of colonial possessions at the end of the seven years war.
france secretly reacquired it in 1800.
soon after taking office jefferson learned of the arrangement.
he had long been concerned about american access to the port of new orleans which lay within louisiana at the mouth of the mississippi river.
the right to trade through new orleans essential to western farmers had been acknowledged in the treaty of san lorenzo also known as pinckneys treaty of 1795 between the united states and spain.
but jefferson feared that the far more powerful french might try to interfere with american commerce.
he dispatched envoys to france offering to purchase the city.
needing money for military campaigns in europe and with his dreams of american empire in ruins because of his inability to reestablish control over saint domingue napoleon offered to sell the entire louisiana territory.
the cost 15 million the equivalent of perhaps 250 million in todays money made the louisiana purchase one of historys greatest realestate bargains.
in a stroke jefferson had doubled the size of the united states and ended the french presence in north america.
federalists were appalled.
we are to give money of which we have too little one declared for land of which we already have too much jefferson admitted that he had done an act beyond the constitution but he believed the benefits justified his transgression.
farmers jefferson had written were the chosen people of god and the country would remain virtuous as long as it was chiefly agricultural madison in federalist no.

now jefferson believed he had ensured the agrarian character of the united states and its political stability for centuries to come.
lewis and clark within a year of the purchase jefferson dispatched an expedition led by meriwether lewis and william clark two virginia born veterans of indian wars in the ohio valley to explore the new territory.
their objects were both scientific and commercial to study the areas plants animal life and geography and to discover how the region could be exploited economically.
jefferson hoped the explorers would establish trading relations with western indians and locate a water route to the pacific ocean an updated version of the old dream of a northwest passage that could facilitate commerce with asia.
what were the achievements and failures of jeffersons presidency.
in the spring of 1804 lewis and clarks fifty member corps of discovery set out from st louis on the most famous exploring party in american history.
they spent the winter in the area of present day north dakota and then resumed their journey in april 1805.
they were now accompanied by a fifteen year old shoshone indian woman sacajawea the wife of a french fur trader who served as their guide and interpreter.
after crossing the rocky mountains the expedition reached the pacific ocean in the area of present day oregon which lay beyond the nations new boundaries in november 1805.
they returned in 1806 bringing with them an immense amount of information about the region as well as numerous plant and animal specimens.
reports about geography plant and animal life and indian cultures filled their daily journals.
although lewis and clark failed to find a commercial route to asia they demonstrated the possibility of overland travel to the pacific coast.
they found indians in the trans mississippi west accustomed to dealing with european traders and already connected to global markets.
the success of their journey helped to strengthen the idea that american territory was destined to reach all the way to the pacific.
incorporating louisiana the only part of the louisiana purchase with a significant non indian population in 1803 was the region around new orleans.
when the united states took control the city had around 8 000 inhabitants including nearly 3 000 slaves and 1 300 free persons of color.
incorporating this diverse population into the united states was by no means easy.
french and spanish law accorded free blacks many of whom were the offspring of unions between white military officers and slave women nearly all the rights of white citizens.
slaves in louisiana as in florida and texas under spanish rule enjoyed legal protections unknown in the united states.
spain made it easy for slaves to obtain their freedom through purchase or voluntary emancipation by the owners.
slave women had the right to go to court for protection against cruelty or rape by their owners.
the treaty that transferred louisiana to the united states promised that all free inhabitants would enjoy the rights advantages and immunities of citizens spanish and french civil codes unlike british and american law recognized women as co owners of family property.
under american rule louisiana retained this principle of community property within marriage.
but free blacks suffered a steady decline in status.
and the local legislature soon adopted one of the most sweeping slave codes in the south forbidding blacks to ever consider themselves the equal of whites and limiting the practice of manumission and access to the courts.
louisianas slaves had enjoyed far more freedom under the rule of tyrannical spain than as part of the liberty loving united states.
the barbary wars among other things the louisiana purchase demonstrated that despite its vaunted isolation from the old world the united states continued to be deeply affected by events throughout the atlantic world.
at a time when americans still relied on british markets to purchase their farm produce a page from william clarks journal of the lewis and clark expedition depicting a salmon.
among their tasks was to record information about the wests plants animal life and geography.

jefferson in power and british suppliers for imported manufactured goods european wars directly influenced the livelihood of american farmers merchants and artisans.
jefferson hoped to avoid foreign entanglements but he found it impossible as president to avoid being drawn into the continuing wars of europe.
even as he sought to limit the power of the national government foreign relations compelled him to expand it.
the first war fought by the united states was to protect american commerce in a dangerous world.
only a few months after taking office jefferson employed the very navy whose expansion by john adams he had strongly criticized.
the barbary states on the northern coast of africa had long preyed on shipping in the mediterranean and atlantic receiving tribute from several countries including the united states to protect their vessels.
between 1785 and 1796 pirates captured thirteen american ships and held more than 100 sailors as slaves paralyzing american trade with the mediterranean.
the federal government paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in ransom and agreed to annual sums to purchase peace.
in 1801 jefferson refused demands for increased payments and the pasha of tripoli declared war on the united states.
the naval conflict lasted until 1804 when an american squadron won a victory at tripoli harbor a victory commemorated in the official hymn of the marine corps which mentions fighting on the shores of tripoli.
the treaty ending the war guaranteed the freedom of american commerce but tripoli soon resumed harassing american ships.
only after the war of 1812 and one final american show of force did barbary interference with american shipping end.
the barbary wars were the new nations first encounter with the islamic world.
in the 1790s as part of an attempt to establish peaceful relations the federal government declared that the united states was not in any sense founded on the christian religion but the conflicts helped to establish a long lasting pattern in which americans viewed muslims as an exotic people whose way of life did not adhere to western standards.
in the eyes what were the achievements and failures of jeffersons presidency.
of many americans islam joined monarchy and aristocracy as forms of old world despotism that stood as opposites to freedom.
the embargo far more serious in its impact on the united states was warfare between britain and france which resumed in 1803 after a brief lull.
according to international law neutral nations had a right to trade nonmilitary goods with countries at war.
by 1806 however each combatant had declared the other under blockade seeking to deny trade with america to its rival.
the royal navy resumed the practice of impressment.
by the end of 1807 it had seized more than 6 000 american sailors claiming they were british citizens and deserters including men from the u s warship chesapeake which the british frigate leopard bombarded and boarded in american waters off the coast of maryland.
to jefferson the economic health of the united states required freedom of trade with which no foreign government had a right to interfere.
american farmers needed access to markets in europe and the caribbean.
as colonial patriots had done in the 1760s and 1770s he decided to use trade as weapon.
in december 1807 he persuaded congress to enact the embargo a ban on all american vessels sailing for foreign ports.
for a believer in limited government this was an amazing exercise of federal power.
enforcement of the embargo brought back memories of the intolerable acts of 1774 with the navy sealing off ports and seizing goods without warrants and the army arresting accused smugglers.
jefferson hoped it would lead europeans to stop their interference with american shipping and also reduce the occasion for impressment.
in 1808 american exports plummeted by 80 percent.
unfortunately neither britain nor france locked in a death struggle took much notice.
but the embargo devastated the economies of american port cities.
just before his term ended in march 1809 jefferson signed the non intercourse act banning trade only with britain and france but providing that if either side rescinded its edicts against american shipping commerce with that country would resume.
madison and pressure for war jefferson left office at the lowest point of his career.
he had won a sweeping reelection in 1804 receiving 162 electoral votes to only 14 for the federalist candidate charles c pinckney.
with the exception of connecticut he even carried the federalist stronghold of new england.
four years later his handpicked successor james madison also won an easy victory.
the embargo however had failed to achieve its diplomatic aims and was increasingly violated by american shippers and resented by persons whose livelihoods depended on trade.
in 1810 madison adopted a new policy.
congress enacted a measure known as macons bill no.
2 which allowed trade to resume but provided that if either france or britain ceased interfering with american rights the president could reimpose an embargo on the other.
with little to lose since britain controlled the seas the french emperor napoleon announced that he had repealed his decrees against neutral shipping.
but the british continued to attack american vessels and with their navy hard pressed for manpower stepped up the impressment c h.

the second war of independence of american sailors.
in the spring of 1812 madison reimposed the embargo on trade with britain.
meanwhile a group of younger congressmen mostly from the west were calling for war with britain.
known as the war hawks this new generation of political leaders had come of age after the winning of independence and were ardent nationalists.
their leaders included henry clay of kentucky elected speaker of the house of representatives in 1810 and john c calhoun of south carolina.
the war hawks spoke passionately of defending the national honor against british insults but they also had more practical goals in mind notably the annexation of canada.
agrarian cupidity greed not maritime rights declared congressman john randolph of virginia urges the war.
we have heard but one word.
canada randolph exaggerated for many southern war hawks also pressed for the conquest of florida a haven for fugitive slaves owned by britains ally spain.
members of congress also spoke of the necessity of upholding the principle of free trade and liberating the united states once and for all from european infringements on its independence.
unimpeded access to overseas markets was essential if the agrarian republic were to prosper.
t h e s e c o n d wa r o f i n d e p e n d e n c e the growing crisis between the united states and britain took place against the background of deteriorating indian relations in the west which also helped propel the united states down the road to war.
jefferson had long favored the removal beyond the mississippi river of indian tribes who refused to cooperate in civilizing themselves.
the louisiana purchase made this policy more feasible.
the acquisition of louisiana he wrote will it is hoped put in our power the means of inducing all the indians on this side of the mississippi river to transplant themselves to the other side jefferson enthusiastically pursued efforts to purchase indian lands west of the appalachian mountains.
he encouraged traders to lend money to indians in the hope that accumulating debt would force them to sell some of their holdings thus freeing up more land for our increasing numbers on the other hand the government continued president washingtons policy of promoting settled farming among the indians.
benjamin hawkins a friend of jefferson who served as american agent for indian affairs south of the ohio river also encouraged the expansion of african american slavery among the tribes as one of the elements of advancing civilization.
the indian response by 1800 nearly 400 000 american settlers lived west of the appalachian mountains.
they far outnumbered the remaining indians whose seemingly w h a t w e r e t h e c a u s e s a n d s i g n i f i c a n t r e s u l t s o f t h e wa r o f 1 8 1 2.
irreversible decline in power led some indians to rethink their opposition to assimilation.
among the creek and cherokee a group led by men of mixed indian white ancestry like major ridge and john ross enthusiastically endorsed the federal policy of promoting civilization many had established businesses as traders and slaveowning farmers with the help of their white fathers.
their views in turn infuriated nativists who wished to root out european influences and resist further white encroachment on indian lands.
the period from 1800 to 1812 was an age of prophecy among the indians.
movements for the revitalization of indian life arose among the creeks cherokees shawnees iroquois and other tribes.
handsome lake of the seneca who had overcome an earlier addiction to alcohol preached that indians must refrain from fighting gambling drinking and sexual promiscuity.
he believed indians could regain their autonomy without directly challenging whites or repudiating all white ways and he urged his people to take up farming and attend school.
tecumseh s vision a more militant message was expounded by two shawnee brothers tecumseh a chief who had refused to sign the treaty of greenville in 1795 and tenskwatawa a religious prophet who called for complete separation from whites the revival of traditional indian culture and resistance to federal policies.
white people tenskwatawa preached were the source of all evil in the world and indians should abandon american alcohol clothing food and manufactured goods.
his followers gathered at prophetstown located on the wabash river in indiana.
tecumseh meanwhile traversed the mississippi valley seeking to revive neolins pan indian alliance of the 1760s discussed in chapter 4.
the alternative to resistance was extermination.
where today are the pequot he asked.
where are the narragansett the mohican the pocanet and other powerful tribes of our people.
they have vanished before the avarice greed and oppression of the white man as snow before the summer sun indians he proclaimed must recognize that they were a single people and unite in claiming a common and equal right in the land he repudiated chiefs who had sold land to the federal government sell a country.
why not sell the air the great sea as well as the earth.
did not the great spirit make them all for the use of his children in 1810 tecumseh called for attacks on american frontier settlements.
in november 1811 while he was absent american forces under william henry harrison destroyed prophetstown in the battle of tippecanoe.
the war of in 1795 james madison had written that war is the greatest enemy of true liberty war he explained is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few nonetheless madison became a war president.
reports that the british were encouraging tecumsehs efforts contributed to the coming of the war of 1812.
in june 1812 with assaults on american shipping continuing visions of freedom benjamin hawkins trading with the creek indians.
painted around 1805 by an unidentified artist this work depicts hawkins explaining the advantages of settled agriculture as part of a plan to promote civilization among native americans.
having served in the continental army during the war of independence and as a senator from north carolina hawkins was appointed in 1795 superintendent of indian affairs for the southeastern united states.
he supplied the creeks cherokees and choctaws with agricultural training and farm implements and married a creek woman.
questions 1.
in what ways does the artist depict indians having adopted the kind of social order hawkins is encouraging.
what elements of traditional indian culture remain.
w h a t w e r e t h e c a u s e s a n d s i g n i f i c a n t r e s u l t s o f t h e wa r o f 1 8 1 2.
madison asked congress for a declaration of war.
american nationality the president declared was at stake would americans remain an independent people or become colonists and vassals of great britain.
the vote revealed a deeply divided country.
both federalists and republicans representing the states from new jersey northward where most of the mercantile and financial resources of the country were concentrated voted against war.
the south and west were strongly in favor.
the bill passed the house by a vote of 79 49 and the senate by 19 13.
it was the first time the united states declared war on another country and was approved by the smallest margin of any declaration of war in american history.
in retrospect it seems remarkably foolhardy for a disunited and militarily unprepared nation to go to war with one of the worlds two major powers.
and with the expiration in 1811 of the charter of the bank of the united states and the refusal of northern merchants and bankers to loan money the federal government found it increasingly difficult to finance the war.
before the conflict ended it was essentially bankrupt.
fortunately for the united states great britain at the outset was preoccupied with the struggle in europe.
but it easily repelled two feeble american invasions of canada and imposed a blockade that all but destroyed american commerce.
in 1814 having finally defeated napoleon britain invaded the united states.
its forces seized washington d c and burned the white house while the government fled for safety.
americans did enjoy a few military successes.
in august 1812 the american frigate constitution defeated the british warship guerriere.
commodore oliver h perry defeated a british naval force in september 1813 on lake erie a startling result considering that britain prided itself on having the worlds most powerful navy although the americans outgunned them on the great lakes.
in the following year a british assault on baltimore was repulsed when fort mchenry at the entrance to the harbor withstood a british bombardment.
this was the occasion when francis scott key composed the star spangled banner an ode to the land of the free and home of the brave that became the national anthem during the 1930s.
like the war of independence the war of 1812 was a two front struggle against the british and against the indians.
the war produced significant victories over western indians who sided with the british.
in 1813 pan indian forces led by tecumseh who had been commissioned a general in the british army were defeated and he himself was killed at the battle of the thames near detroit by an american force led by william henry harrison.
in march 1814 an army of americans and pro assimilation cherokees and creeks under the command of andrew jackson defeated hostile creeks known as the red sticks at the battle of horseshoe bend in alabama killing more than 800 of them.
the power of the creeks is forever broken jackson wrote and he dictated terms of surrender that the lid of a chest decorated with scenes from the war of 1812.

jackson then proceeded to new orleans where he engineered the wars greatest american victory fighting off a british invasion in january 1815.
although a slaveholder jackson recruited the citys free men of color into his forces appealing to them as sons of freedom and promising them the w h a t w e r e t h e c a u s e s a n d s i g n i f i c a n t r e s u l t s o f t h e wa r o f 1 8 1 2.

a number of prominent political careers flowed from american victories.
jackson and harrison would ride their reputations as military heroes all the way to the white house.
colonel richard m johnson who claimed to have actually killed tecumseh would later be elected vice president.
with neither side wishing to continue the conflict the united states and britain signed the treaty of ghent ending the war.
although the treaty was signed in december 1814 ships carrying news of the agreement did not reach america until after the battle of new orleans had been fought.
the treaty restored the previous status quo.
no territory exchanged hands nor did any provisions relate to impressment or neutral shipping rights.
considering that the war had not been a military success for the united states the treaty of ghent was about as good an outcome as could be expected.
the wars aftermath a number of contemporaries called the war of 1812 the second war of independence.
despite widespread opposition to the conflict it confirmed the ability of a republican government to conduct a war without surrendering its institutions.
jacksons victory at new orleans not only made him a national hero but also became a celebrated example of the ability of virtuous citizens of a republic to defeat the forces of despotic europe.
moreover the war completed the conquest of the area east of the mississippi river which had begun during the revolution.
never again would the british or indians pose a threat to american control of this vast region.
the war also broke the remaining power of indians in the old northwest and significantly reduced their holdings in the south opening rich new lands to american settlers.
in its aftermath white settlers poured into indiana michigan alabama and mississippi bringing with them their distinctive forms of social organization.
i have no doubt jackson wrote to his wife but in a few years the banks of the alabama will present a beautiful view of elegant mansions and extensive rich and productive farms he did not mention that those mansions would be built and the farms worked by slaves.
britains defeat of napoleon inaugurated a long period of peace in europe.
with diplomatic affairs playing less and less of a role in american public life americans sense of separateness from the old world grew ever stronger.
the war also strengthened a growing sense of nationalism in canada based in part on separateness from the united states.
as in 1775 canadians did not rise up to welcome an invading army from the south to the puzzlement of americans who could not understand why they did not wish to become part of the empire of liberty.
the taking of the city of washington an 1814 engraving produced in london portrays the assault during which british forces captured the undefended city and burned the white house the capitol and several warships.
8 securing the republic 1790 1815 the second war of independence the end of federalist the bombardment of baltimores fort mchenry in september 1814 was of minor military importance but it is remembered as the inspiration for francis scott keys poem the star spangled banner the party jefferson and madison succeeded in one major political aim the elimination of the federalist party.
at first the war led to a revival of federalist fortunes.
with antiwar sentiment at its peak in 1812 madison had been reelected by the relatively narrow margin of 128 electoral votes to 89 over his federalist opponent dewitt clinton of new york.
but then came a self inflicted blow.
in december 1814 a group of new england federalists gathered at hartford connecticut to give voice to their partys long standing grievances especially the domination of the federal government by virginia presidents and their own regions declining influence as new western states entered the union.
they called for amending the constitution to eliminate the three fifths clause that strengthened southern political power and to require a two thirds vote of congress for the admission of new states declarations of war and laws restricting trade.
contrary to later myth the hartford convention did not call for secession or disunion.
but it affirmed the right of a state to interpose its authority if the federal government violated the constitution.
the hartford convention had barely adjourned before jackson electrified the nation with his victory at new orleans.
rising glory of the american republic one newspaper exulted.
in speeches and sermons political and religious leaders alike proclaimed that jacksons triumph revealed once again that a divine hand oversaw americas destiny.
the federalists could not free themselves from the charge of lacking patriotism.
within a few years their party no longer existed.
its stance on the war was only one cause of the partys demise.
the urban commercial and financial interests it championed represented a small minority in an expanding agricultural nation.
their elitism and distrust of popular self government placed federalists more and more at odds with the new nations democratic ethos.
yet in their dying moments federalists had raised an issue southern domination of the national government that would long outlive their political party.
and the country stood on the verge of a profound economic and social transformation that strengthened the very forces of commercial development that federalists had welcomed and many republicans feared.

how did the market revolution affect the lives of workers women and african americans.
l i n 1824 the marquis de lafayette visited the united states.
nearly fifty years had passed since as a youth of twenty the french nobleman fought at washingtons side in the war of independence.
now his thirteen month tour became a triumphant jubilee of liberty.
americans had good reason to celebrate lafayettes visit and their own freedom.
since 1784 when he had last journeyed to the united states the nations population had tripled to nearly 12 million its land area had more than doubled and its political institutions had thrived.
lafayettes tour demonstrated how profoundly the nation had changed.
the thirteen states of 1784 had grown to twenty four and he visited every one a journey that would have been almost impossible forty years earlier.
lafayette traveled up the mississippi and ohio rivers by steamboat a recent invention that was helping to bring economic development to the trans appalachian west and crossed upstate new york via the erie canal the worlds longest man made waterway which linked the region around the great lakes with the atlantic coast via the hudson river.
americans in the first half of the nineteenth century were fond of describing liberty as the defining quality of their new nation the unique genius of its institutions.
the poet walt whitman wrote of his countrymens deathless attachment to freedom likenesses of the goddess of liberty a familiar figure in eighteenth century british visual imagery became even more common in the united states appearing in paintings and sculpture and on folk art from weather vanes to quilts and tavern signs.
never declared president andrew jackson in his farewell address in 1837 had any population enjoyed so much freedom and happiness as the people of these united states the celebration of freedom could be found in sermons newspaper editorials and political pronouncements in every region of the country.
in democracy in america the french historian and politician alexis de tocqueville wrote of the holy cult of freedom he encountered on his own visit to the united states during the early 1830s.
for fifty years he wrote the inhabitants of the united states have been repeatedly and constantly told that they are the only religious enlightened and free people.
have an immensely high opinion of themselves and are not far from believing that they form a species apart from the rest of the human race even as lafayette tocqueville and numerous other visitors from abroad toured the united states however americans understandings of freedom were changing.
three historical processes unleashed by the revolution accelerated after the war of 1812 the spread of market relations the westward movement of the population and the rise of a vigorous political democracy.
the first two will be discussed in this chapter the third in chapter 10.
all powerfully affected the what were the main elements of the market revolution.
development of american society.
they also helped to reshape the idea of freedom identifying it ever more closely with economic opportunity physical mobility and participation in a vibrantly democratic political system.
but american freedom also continued to be shaped by the presence of slavery.
lafayette who had purchased a plantation in the west indies and freed its slaves once wrote i would never have drawn my sword in the cause of america if i could have conceived that thereby i was founding a land of slavery yet slavery was moving westward with the young republic.
the same steamboats and canals that enabled millions of farm families to send their goods to market also facilitated the growth of slave based cotton plantations in the south.
and slavery drew a strict racial boundary around american democracy making voting officeholding and participation in the public sphere privileges for whites alone.
in several southern cities public notices warned persons of color to stay away from the ceremonies honoring lafayette.
half a century after the winning of independence the coexistence of liberty and slavery and their simultaneous expansion remained the central contradiction of american life.
a new economy in the first half of the nineteenth century an economic transformation known to historians as the market revolution swept over the united states.
its catalyst was a series of innovations in transportation and communication.
american technology had hardly changed during the colonial era.
no important alterations were made in sailing ships no major canals were built and manufacturing continued to be done by hand with skills passed on from artisan to journeyman and apprentice.
at the dawn of the nineteenth century most roads were little more than rutted paths through the woods.
apart from sailing ships plying the atlantic coast and flatboats floating downstream on major rivers trade within the new nation faced insuperable barriers.
transporting goods thirty miles inland by road cost as much as shipping the same cargo from england.
in 1800 it took fifty days to move goods from cincinnati to new york city via a flatboat ride down the mississippi river to new orleans and then a journey by sail along the gulf and atlantic coasts.
the market revolution represented an acceleration of developments already under way in the colonial era.
as noted in previous chapters southern planters were marketing the products of slave labor in the international market as early as the seventeenth century.
by the eighteenth many colonists had been drawn into britains commercial empire.
consumer goods like an 1810 advertisement for a stagecoach route linking boston and sandwich massachusetts reveals the slow speed and high cost of land transportation in the early nineteenth century.
it took the entire day beginning at 5 a m and cost around fifty dollars in todays money to travel the fifty seven miles between the towns with stops along the way for breakfast and lunch.
9 the market revolution 1800 1840 a new economy sugar and tea and market oriented tactics like the boycott of british goods had been central to the political battles leading up to independence.
nonetheless as americans moved across the appalachian mountains and into interior regions of the states along the atlantic coast they found themselves more and more isolated from markets.
in 1800 american farm families produced at home most of what they needed from clothing to farm implements.
what they could not make themselves they obtained by bartering with their neighbors or purchasing from local stores and from rural craftsmen like blacksmiths and shoemakers.
those farmers not located near cities or navigable waterways found it almost impossible to market their produce.
the early life of abraham lincoln was typical of those who grew up in the pre market world.
lincoln was born in kentucky in 1809 and seven years later moved with his family to indiana where he lived until 1831.
his father occasionally took pork down the ohio and mississippi rivers to market in new orleans and lincoln himself at age nineteen traveled by flatboat to that city to sell the goods of a local merchant.
but essentially the lincoln family was self sufficient.
they hunted game for much of their food and sewed most of their clothing at home.
they relied little on cash lincolns father sometimes sent young abraham to work for neighbors as a way of settling debts.
as an adult however lincoln embraced the market revolution.
in the illinois legislature in the 1830s he eagerly promoted the improvement of rivers to facilitate access to markets.
as a lawyer he eventually came to represent the illinois central railroad which opened large areas of illinois to commercial farming.
many americans devoted their energies to solving the technological problems that inhibited commerce within the country.
thomas paine spent the 1780s and 1790s not only promoting democracy in america and europe but also developing a design for an iron bridge so that rivers could be crossed in all seasons of the year without impeding river traffic.
an 1837 copy of a color drawing that accompanied a patent application for a type of raft designed in 1818.
for many years rafts like this were used to transport goods to market on western rivers.
what were the main elements of the market revolution.
roads and steamboats in the first half of the nineteenth century in rapid succession the steamboat canal railroad and telegraph wrenched america out of its economic past.
these innovations opened new land to settlement lowered transportation costs and made it far easier for economic enterprises to sell their products.
they linked farmers to national and world markets and made them major consumers of manufactured goods.
americans wrote tocqueville had annihilated space and time the first advance in overland transportation came through the construction of toll roads or turnpikes by localities states and private companies.
between 1800 and 1830 the new england and middle atlantic states alone chartered more than 900 companies to build new roads.
in 1806 congress authorized the construction of the paved national road from cumberland maryland to the old northwest.
it reached wheeling on the ohio river in 1818 and by 1838 extended to illinois where it ended.
because maintenance costs were higher than expected and many towns built shunpikes short detours that enabled residents to avoid tollgates most private toll roads never turned a profit.
even on the new roads horsedrawn wagons remained an inefficient mode of getting goods to market except over short distances.
it was improved water transportation that most dramatically increased the speed and lowered the expense of commerce.
robert fulton a pennsylvania born artist and engineer had experimented with steamboat designs while living in france during the 1790s.
he even launched a steamboat on the seine river in paris in 1803.
but not until 1807 when fultons ship the clermont navigated the hudson river from new york city to albany was the steamboats technological and commercial feasibility demonstrated.
the invention made possible upstream commerce that is travel against the current on the countrys major rivers as well as rapid transport across the great lakes and eventually the atlantic ocean.
by 1811 the first steamboat had been introduced on the mississippi river twenty years later some 200 plied its waters.
a view of new york city in 1849 by the noted lithographer nathaniel currier.
steamships and sailing vessels of various sizes crowd the harbor of the nations largest city and busiest port.
9 the market revolution 1800 1840 the erie a new economy canal the completion in 1825 of the 363 mile erie canal across upstate new york a remarkable feat of engineering at a time when americas next largest canal was only twenty eight miles long allowed goods to flow between the great lakes and new york city.
almost instantaneously the canal attracted an influx of farmers migrating from new england giving birth to cities like buffalo rochester and syracuse along its path.
its water wrote the novelist nathaniel hawthorne after a trip on the canal served as a miraculous fertilizer for it causes towns with their masses of brick and stone their churches and theaters their business.
to spring up new york governor dewitt clinton who oversaw the construction of the state financed canal predicted that it would make new york city the granary of the world the emporium of commerce the seat of manufactures the focus of great moneyed operations and indeed the canal gave new york city primacy over competing ports in access to trade with the old northwest.
in its financing by the state government the erie canal typified the developing transportation infrastructure.
with the federal government generally under the control of political leaders hostile to federal funding for internal improvements the burden fell on the states.
between 1787 and 1860 the federal government spent about 60 million building roads and canals and improving harbors the states spent nearly ten times that sum.
the completion of the erie canal set off a scramble among other states to match new yorks success.
several borrowed so much money to finance elaborate programs of canal construction that they went bankrupt during the economic depression that began in 1837.
by then however more than 3 000 miles of canals had been built creating a network linking the atlantic states with the ohio and mississippi valleys and drastically reducing the cost of transportation.
a watercolor from 1830 depicts the erie canal five years after it opened.
boats carrying passengers and goods traverse the waterway along whose banks farms and villages have sprung up.

the railroad opened vast new areas of the american interior to settlement while stimulating the mining of coal for fuel and the manufacture of iron for locomotives and rails.
work on the baltimore and ohio the nations first commercial railroad began in 1828.
the improvement of existing roads and building of new roads and canals sharply reduced transportation times and costs and stimulated the growth of the market economy.
9 the market revolution 1800 1840 an 1827 engraving designed to show the feasibility of railroads driven by steampowered locomotives and dedicated to the president of the baltimore and ohio railroad which began construction in the following year.
the engraver placed passengers as far from the locomotive as possible to ensure their safety in case of an explosion.
a new economy five years later the south carolina canal and railroad which stretched from charleston across the state to hamburg became the first long distance line to begin operation.
by 1860 the railroad network had grown to 30 000 miles more than the total in the rest of the world combined.
at the same time the telegraph made possible instantaneous communication throughout the nation.
the device was invented during the 1830s by samuel f b morse an artist and amateur scientist living in new york city and it was put into commercial operation in 1844.
using morse code messages could be sent over electric wires with each letter and number represented by its own pattern of electrical pulses.
within sixteen years some 50 000 miles of telegraph wire had been strung.
initially the telegraph was a service for businesses and especially newspapers rather than individuals.
it helped speed the flow of information and brought uniformity to prices throughout the country.
the rise of the west improvements in transportation and communication made possible the rise of the west as a powerful self conscious region of the new nation.
between 1790 and 1840 some 4 5 million people crossed the appalachian mountains more than the entire u s population at the time of washingtons first inauguration.
most of this migration took place after the end of the war of 1812 which unleashed a flood of land hungry settlers moving from eastern states.
in the six years following the end of the war in 1815 six new states entered the union indiana illinois missouri alabama mississippi and maine the last an eastern frontier for new england.
few americans moved west as lone pioneers.
more frequently people traveled in groups and once they arrived in the west cooperated with each other to clear land build houses and barns and establish communities.
one stream of migration including both small farmers and planters with their slaves flowed out of the south to create the new cotton kingdom of alabama mississippi louisiana and arkansas.
many farm families from the upper south crossed into southern ohio indiana and illinois.
a third population stream moved from new england across new york to the what were the main elements of the market revolution.
upper northwest northern ohio indiana and illinois and michigan and wisconsin.
some western migrants became squatters setting up farms on unoccupied land without a clear legal title.
those who purchased land acquired it either from the federal government at the price after 1820 of 1 25 per acre payable in cash or from land speculators on long term credit.
by 1840 settlement had reached the mississippi river and two large new regions the old northwest and old southwest had entered the union.
the west became the home of regional cultures very much like those the migrants had left behind.
upstate new york and the upper northwest resembled new england with its small towns churches and schools while the lower south replicated the plantation based society of the southern atlantic states.
as population moved west the nations borders expanded.
national boundaries made little difference to territorial expansion in florida and later in texas and oregon american settlers rushed in to claim land under the jurisdiction of foreign countries spain mexico and britain or indian tribes confident that american sovereignty would soon follow in their wake.
nor did the desire of local inhabitants to remain outside the american republic deter the nations expansion.
florida for example fell into american hands despite the resistance of local indians and spains rejection of american offers to buy the area.
in 1810 american residents of west florida rebelled and seized baton rouge and the united states soon annexed the area.
the drive for the acquisition of east florida was spurred by georgia and alabama planters who wished to eliminate a refuge for fugitive slaves and hostile seminole indians.
andrew jackson led troops into the area in 1818.
while on foreign soil he created an international crisis by executing two british traders and a number of indian chiefs.
although jackson withdrew spain aware that it could not defend the territory sold it to the united states in the adams ons treaty of 1819.
successive censuses told the remarkable story of western growth.

in some ways the most dynamic feature of the american economy in the first thirty years of the nineteenth century was the rise of the cotton kingdom.
the early industrial revolution which began in england and soon spread to parts of the north centered on factories producing cotton textiles with water powered spinning and weaving machinery.
these factories generated an immense demand for cotton a crop the deep south was particularly suited to growing because of its climate and soil fertility.
until 1793 the marketing of cotton had been slowed by the laborious task of removing seeds from the plant itself.
but in that year eli whitney a yale graduate working in georgia as a private tutor invented the cotton gin.
a fairly simple device consisting of rollers and brushes the gin quickly separated the seed from the cotton.
it made possible the growing and selling of cotton on a large scale.
coupled with rising demand for cotton and the opening of new lands in the west to settlement whitneys invention revolutionized american slavery.
an institution that many americans had expected to die out because its major crop tobacco exhausted the soil now embarked on a period of unprecedented expansion.
in the first decade of the nineteenth century cotton plantations spread into the south carolina upcountry the region inland from the atlantic coast previously dominated by small farms a major reason why the state reopened the african slave trade between these maps illustrate how the transportation revolution of the early nineteenth century made possible much more rapid travel within the united states.

after the war of 1812 the federal government moved to consolidate american control over the deep south forcing defeated indians to cede land encouraging white settlement and acquiring florida.
with american sovereignty came the expansion of slavery.
settlers from the older southern states flooded into the region.
planters monopolized the most fertile land while poorer farmers were generally confined to less productive and less accessible areas in the hill country and piney woods.
after congress prohibited the atlantic slave trade in 1808 the earliest date allowed by the constitution a massive trade in slaves developed within the united states supplying the labor force required by the new cotton kingdom.
the unfree westward movement slave trader sold to tennessee a watercolor sketch by the artist lewis miller from the mid 1850s.
miller depicts a group of slaves being marched from virginia to tennessee.
once congress voted to prohibit the further importation of slaves into the country slaveowners in newly opened areas of the country had to obtain slaves from other parts of the united states.
historians estimate that around 1 million slaves were shifted from the older slave states to the deep south between 1800 and 1860.
some traveled with their owners to newly established plantations but the majority were transported by slave traders to be sold at auction for work in the cotton fields.
slave trading became a well organized business with firms gathering slaves in maryland virginia and south carolina and shipping them to markets in mobile natchez and new orleans.
slave coffles groups chained to one another on forced marches to the deep south became a common sight.
a british visitor to the united states in the 1840s encountered what he called a disgusting and hideous spectacle a file of about two hundred slaves manacled and chained together being marched from virginia to louisiana.
a source of greater freedom for many whites the westward movement meant to african americans the destruction of family ties the breakup of longstanding communities and receding opportunities for liberty.
in 1793 when whitney designed his invention the united states produced 5 million pounds of cotton.
by 1820 the crop had grown to nearly 170 million pounds.
thomas jefferson had believed that european demand for american grain would underpin the nations economic growth and the small farmers independence.
but as the southern economy expanded westward it was cotton produced on slave plantations not grain grown by sturdy yeomen that became the linchpin of southern development and by far the most important export of the empire of liberty.
market society since cotton was produced solely for sale in national and international markets the south was in some ways the most commercially oriented how did the market revolution spark social change.

yet rather than spurring economic change the souths expansion westward simply reproduced the same agrarian slavebased social order of the older states.
the region remained overwhelmingly rural.
in 1860 roughly 80 percent of southerners worked the land the same proportion as in 1800.

fa r m e r s in the north however the market revolution and westward expansion set in motion changes that transformed the region into an integrated economy of commercial farms and manufacturing cities.
as in the case of lincolns family the initial pioneer stage of settlement reinforced the farmers self sufficiency for the tasks of felling trees building cabins breaking the soil and feeding the family left little time for agriculture geared to the market.
but as the old northwest became a more settled society bound by a web of transportation and credit to eastern centers of commerce and banking farmers found themselves drawn into the new market economy.
they increasingly concentrated on growing crops and raising livestock for sale while purchasing at stores goods previously produced at home.
western farmers found in the growing cities of the east a market for their produce and a source of credit.
loans originating with eastern banks and insurance companies financed the acquisition of land and supplies and in the 1840s and 1850s the purchase of fertilizer and new agricultural machinery to expand production.
the steel plow invented by john deere in 1837 and mass produced by the 1850s made possible the rapid subduing of the western prairies.
the reaper a horse drawn machine that greatly increased the amount of wheat a farmer could harvest was invented by cyrus mccormick in 1831 and produced in large quantities soon afterward.
tens of thousands were in use on the eve of the civil war.
between 1840 and 1860 americas output of wheat nearly tripled.
unlike cotton however the bulk of the crop was consumed within the country.
eastern farmers unable to grow wheat and corn as cheaply as their western counterparts increasingly concentrated on producing dairy products fruits and vegetables for nearby urban centers.
the growth of cities from the beginning cities formed part of the western frontier.
western cities like cincinnati and st louis that stood at the crossroads of inter regional trade experienced extraordinary growth.
cincinnati was known as porkopolis after its slaughterhouses where hundreds of thousands of pigs were butchered each year and processed for shipment to eastern consumers of meat.
the greatest of all the western cities was chicago.
in the early 1830s it was a tiny settlement on the shore of lake michigan.
by 1860 thanks to the railroad chicago had become the nations fourth largest city how did the market revolution spark social change.

like rural areas urban centers witnessed dramatic changes due to the market revolution.
the number of cities with populations exceeding 5 000 rose from 12 in 1820 to nearly 150 three decades later by which time the urban population numbered more than 6 million.
urban merchants bankers and master craftsmen took advantage of the economic opportunities created by the expanding market among commercial farmers.
the drive among these businessmen to increase production and reduce labor costs fundamentally altered the nature of work.
traditionally skilled artisans had manufactured goods at home where they controlled the pace and intensity of their own labor.
now entrepreneurs gathered artisans into large workshops in order to oversee their work and subdivide their tasks.
craftsmen who traditionally produced an entire pair of shoes or piece of furniture saw the labor process broken down into numerous steps requiring far less skill and training.
they found themselves subjected to constant supervision by their employers and relentless pressure for greater output and lower wages.
the fac t o ry system in some industries most notably textiles the factory superceded traditional craft production altogether.
factories gathered large groups of workers under central supervision and replaced hand tools with power driven machinery.

the south lagged far behind in urban growth.
most cities were located on navigable waterways either the atlantic coast or inland rivers or on rivers that provided water power for early factories.
how did the market revolution spark social change.
spinning factories such as slaters produced yarn which was then sent to traditional hand loom weavers and farm families to be woven into cloth.
this outwork system in which rural men and women earned money by taking in jobs from factories typified early industrialization.
before shoe production was fully mechanized for example various parts of the shoe were produced in factories then stitched together in nearby homes and then returned to the factories for finishing.
eventually however the entire manufacturing process in textiles shoes and many other products was brought under a single factory roof.
the cutoff of british imports because of the embargo of 1807 and the war of 1812 stimulated the establishment of the first large scale american factory utilizing power looms for weaving cotton cloth.
this was constructed in 1814 at waltham massachusetts by a group of merchants who came to be called the boston associates.
in the 1820s they expanded their enterprise by creating an entirely new factory town incorporated as the city of lowell in 1836 on the merrimack river twenty seven miles from boston.
here they built a group of modern textile factories that brought together all phases of production from the spinning of thread to the weaving and finishing of cloth.
by 1850 lowells fifty two mills employed more than 10 000 workers.
across new england small industrial cities sprang up pat a group of shoemakers with their tools photographed in 1837.
artisan production survived in many crafts but shoemakers found themselves in dire straits as factories began industrializing shoe production.

massachusetts soon became the second most industrialized region of the world after great britain.
the earliest factories including those at pawtucket waltham and lowell were located along the fall line where waterfalls and river rapids could be harnessed to provide power for spinning and weaving machinery.
by the 1840s steam power made it possible for factory owners to locate in towns like new bedford nearer to the coast and in large cities like philadelphia and chicago with their immense local markets.
in 1850 manufacturers produced in factories not only textiles but also a wide variety of other goods including tools firearms shoes clocks ironware and agricultural machinery.
what came to be called the american system of manufactures relied on the mass production of interchangeable parts that could be rapidly assembled into standardized finished products.
this technique was first perfected in the manufacture of clocks by eli terry a how did the market revolution spark social change.
connecticut craftsman and in small arms production by eli whitney who had previously invented the cotton gin.
more impressive in a way than factory production was the wide dispersion of mechanical skills throughout northern society.
every town it seemed had its sawmill paper mill iron works shoemaker hatmaker tailor and a host of other such small enterprises.
the early industrial revolution was largely confined to new england and a few cities outside it.
lacking a strong internal market and with its slaveholding class generally opposed to industrial development the south lagged in factory production.
and outside new england most northern manufacturing was still done in small scale establishments employing a handful of workers not in factories.
in cincinnati for example most workers in 1850 still labored in small unmechanized workshops.
the industrial worker the market revolution helped to change americans conception of time itself.
farm life continued to be regulated by the rhythms of the seasons.
but in cities clocks became part of daily life and work time and leisure time came to be clearly marked off from one another.
in artisan workshops of the colonial and early national eras bouts of intense work alternated with periods of leisure.
artisans would set down their tools to enjoy a drink at a tavern or attend a political discussion.
as the market revolution accelerated work in factories workshops and even for servants in americans homes took place for a specified number of hours per day.
in colonial america an artisans pay was known as his price since it was linked to the goods he produced.
in the nineteenth century pay increasingly became a wage paid according to an hourly or daily rate.
the increasing reliance on railroads which operated according to fixed schedules also made americans more conscious of arranging their lives according to clock time closely supervised work tending a machine for a period determined by a clock seemed to violate the independence americans considered an essential element of freedom.
consequently few native born men could be attracted to work in the early factories.
employers turned instead to those who lacked other ways of earning a living.

while some factories employed entire families the early new england textile mills relied largely on female and child labor.
at lowell the most famous center of early textile manufacturing young unmarried women from yankee farm families dominated the workforce that tended the spinning machines.
to persuade parents to allow their daughters to leave home to work in the mills lowell owners set up boarding houses with strict rules regulating personal behavior.
they also established lecture halls churches and even a periodical edited by factory workers the lowell offering to occupy the womens free time.
the constant supervision of the workers private lives seems impossibly restrictive from a modern point of view.
but this was the first time in history that large numbers of women left their homes to participate in the pub women at work tending machines in the lowell textile mills.

home life lucy larcom later recalled was narrow and confining while living and working at lowell gave the mill girls a larger firmer idea of womanhood teaching them to go out of themselves and enter into the lives of others.
it was like a young mans pleasure in entering upon business for himself but women like larcom did not become a permanent class of factory workers.
they typically remained in the factories for only a few years after which they left to return home marry or move west.
larcom herself migrated to illinois where she became a teacher and writer.
the shortage of industrial labor continued easing only when largescale immigration began in the 1840s and 1850s.

between 1790 and 1830 immigrants contributed only marginally to american population growth.
but between 1840 and 1860 over 4 million people more than the entire population of 1790 entered the united states the majority from ireland and germany.
about 90 percent headed for the northern states where job opportunities were most abundant and the new arrivals would not have to compete with slave labor.
immigrants were virtually unknown in the slave states except in cities on the periphery of the south such as new orleans st louis and baltimore.
in the north however they became a visible presence in both urban and rural areas.
in 1860 the 814 000 residents of new york city the major port of entry included more than 384 000 immigrants and one third of the population of wisconsin was foreign born.
numerous factors inspired this massive flow of population across the atlantic.
in europe the modernization of agriculture and the industrial revolution disrupted centuries old patterns of life pushing peasants off the land and eliminating the jobs of traditional craft workers.
the introduction of the ocean going steamship and the railroad made long distance travel more practical.
the cunard line began regular sailings with inexpensive fares from britain to boston and new york city in the 1840s.
beginning around 1840 emigration from europe accelerated not only to the united states but to canada and australia as well.

an estimated 1 million persons starved to death and another million emigrated in those years most of them to the united states.
lacking industrial skills and capital these impoverished agricultural laborers and small farmers ended up filling the low wage unskilled jobs native born americans sought to avoid.
male irish immigrants built americas railroads dug canals and worked as common laborers servants longshoremen and factory operatives.
irish women frequently went to work as servants in the homes of native born americans although some preferred factory work to domestic service.

by the end of the 1850s the lowell textile mills had largely replaced yankee farm women with immigrant irish families.
four fifths of irish immigrants remained in the northeast.
in boston new york and smaller industrial cities they congregated in overcrowded urban ghettos notorious for poverty crime and disease.
the second largest group of immigrants germans included a considerably larger number of skilled craftsmen than the irish.
germans also settled in tightly knit neighborhoods in eastern cities but many were able to move to the west where they established themselves as craftsmen shopkeepers and farmers.

the continuing expansion of industry and the failure of the chartist movement of the 1840s which sought to democratize the system of government in britain also inspired many english workers to emigrate to the united states.
the rise of nativism immigrants from england whose ranks included the actor junius brutus booth father of john wilkes booth were easily absorbed but those from ireland encountered intense hostility.
as roman catholics they faced discrimination in a largely protestant society in which the tradition of antipopery still ran deep.
the irish influx greatly enhanced the visibility and power of the catholic church previously a minor presence in most parts of the country.
during the 1840s and 1850s archbishop john hughes of new york city made the church a more assertive institution.
hughes pressed catholic parents to send their children to an expanding network of parochial schools and he sought government funding to pay for them.
he aggressively attempted to win converts from protestantism.
the idea of the united states as a refuge for those seeking economic opportunity or as an escape from oppression has always coexisted with suspicion of and hostility to foreign newcomers.
american history has witnessed periods of intense anxiety over immigration.
the alien act of 1798 reflected fear of immigrants with radical political views.
during the early twentieth century as will be discussed below there was widespread hostility to the new immigration from southern and eastern europe.
in the early twenty first century the question of how many persons should be allowed to enter the united states and under what circumstances remains a volatile political issue.
the irish influx of the 1840s and 1850s thoroughly alarmed many native born americans.
those who feared the impact of immigration on american political and social life were called nativists they blamed immigrants for urban crime political corruption and a fondness for intoxicating liquor and they accused them of undercutting native born skilled laborers by working for starvation wages.
the irish were quickly brought into the urban political machines of the democratic party whose local bosses provided jobs and poor relief to struggling newcomers.
nativists contended that the irish supposedly unfamiliar with american conceptions of liberty and subservient to the catholic church posed a threat to democratic institutions social reform and public education.
stereotypes similar to those directed at blacks flourished regarding the irish as well childlike lazy and slaves of their passions they were said to be unsuited for republican freedom.
nativism would not become a national political movement until the 1850s as we will see in chapter 13.
but in the 1840s new york city and philadelphia witnessed violent anti immigrant riots.
appealing mainly to skilled native born workers who feared that immigrants were taking their jobs and undercutting their wages a nativist candidate was elected new york citys mayor in 1844.
how did the market revolution spark social change.
the transformation of law american law increasingly supported the efforts of entrepreneurs to participate in the market revolution while shielding them from interference by local governments and liability for some of the less desirable results of economic growth.
the corporate form of business organization became central to the new market economy.
a corporate firm enjoys special privileges and powers granted in a charter from the government among them that investors and directors are not personally liable for the companys debts.
unlike companies owned by an individual family or limited partnership in other words a corporation can fail without ruining its directors and stockholders.
corporations were therefore able to raise far more capital than the traditional forms of enterprise.
by the 1830s many states had replaced the granting of charters through specific acts of legislation with general incorporation laws allowing any company to obtain a corporate charter if it paid a specified fee.
many americans distrusted corporate charters as a form of governmentgranted special privilege.
but the courts upheld their validity while opposing efforts by established firms to limit competition from newcomers.
in dartmouth college v woodward 1819 john marshalls supreme court defined corporate charters issued by state legislatures as contracts which future lawmakers could not alter or rescind.
five years later in gibbons v ogden the court struck down a monopoly the new york legislature had granted for steamboat navigation.
and in 1837 with roger b taney now the chief justice the court ruled that the massachusetts legislature did not infringe the charter of an existing company that had constructed a bridge over the charles river when it empowered a second company to build a competing bridge.
the community taney declared had a legitimate interest in promoting transportation and prosperity.
local judges meanwhile held businessmen blameless for property damage done by factory construction such as the flooding of upstream farmlands and the disruption of fishing when dams were built to harness water power.
numerous court decisions also affirmed employers full authority over the workplace and invoked the old common law of conspiracy to punish workers who sought to strike for higher wages.
not until 1842 in commonwealth v hunt did massachusetts chief justice lemuel shaw decree that there was nothing inherently illegal in workers organizing a union or a strike.
like changes in work and time changes in the law illustrated the comment of horace bushnell a connecticut minister that the market economy had produced a complete revolution in americans life and manners the free individual by the 1830s the market revolution and westward expansion had produced a society that amazed european visitors energetic materialistic and seemingly in constant motion.

9 the market revolution 1800 1840 the free individual with offers of farms and all manner of land lots advising them to speculate before the price of land rose higher alexis de tocqueville was struck by americans restless energy and apparent lack of attachment to place.
no sooner do you set foot on american soil he observed than you find yourself in a sort of tumult.
all around you everything is on the move westward migration and urban development created a large mobile population no longer tied to local communities who sought to seize the opportunities offered by economic change.
in the united states wrote tocqueville a man builds a house in which to spend his old age and sells it before the roof is on he plants a garden and rents it just as the trees are coming into bearing he brings a field into tillage and leaves other men to gather the crops the west and freedom westward expansion and the market revolution profoundly affected the lives of all americans.
they reinforced some older ideas of freedom and helped to create new ones.
american freedom for example had long been linked with the availability of land in the west.
a new york journalist john l osullivan first employed the phrase manifest destiny meaning that the united states had a divinely appointed mission so obvious as to be beyond dispute to occupy all of north america.
americans he proclaimed had a far better title to western lands than could be provided by any international treaty right of discovery or long term settlement.
their right to the continent was provided by the nations mission to extend the area of freedom.
other peoples claims osullivan wrote must give way to our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which providence has given us for the development of the great experiment in liberty those who stood in the way of expansion european powers like great britain and spain native americans mexicans were by definition obstacles to the progress of freedom.
osullivan wrote these words in 1845 but the essential idea was familiar much earlier.
as the population moved across the appalachian mountains so did the linkage between westward expansion and freedom.
the goddess of liberty declared senator john breckinridge of kentucky was not governed by geographical limits a sense of spatial openness of the constant opportunity to pick up and move when the pursuit of happiness seemed to demand it became more and more a central component of american freedom.
like its predecessors this generation of americans believed that the united states had been selected by god for the greatest experiment in human history the achievement of liberty and that westward expansion was part and parcel of this destiny.
freedom in the united states wrote the french historian michel chevalier one of the many europeans who visited the country in the 1830s was a practical idea as much as a mystical one it meant a liberty of action and motion which the american uses to expand over the vast territory that providence has given him and to subdue it to his uses in national myth and ideology the west would long remain as the writer wallace stegner would later put it the last home of the freeborn american the settlement and economic exploitation of the west prom how did the meanings of american freedom change in this period.
ised to prevent the united states from following down the path of europe and becoming a society with fixed social classes and a large group of wageearning poor.
in the west land was more readily available and oppressive factory labor far less common.
with population and the price of land rising dramatically in the older states and young mens prospects for acquiring a farm or setting up an independent artisan shop declining the west still held out the chance to achieve economic independence the social condition of freedom.
the transcendentalists the restless competitive world of the market revolution strongly encouraged the identification of american freedom with the absence of restraints on self directed individuals seeking economic advancement and personal development.
the one important revolution of the day the philosopher ralph waldo emerson wrote in the 1830s was the new value of the private man the opportunity for personal growth offered a new definition of jeffersons pursuit of happiness one well suited to a world in which territorial expansion and the market revolution had shattered traditional spatial and social boundaries and made moving from place to place and status to status common features of american life.
in a widely reprinted 1837 address the american scholar emerson called on the person engaged in writing and thinking to feel all confidence in himself.
to never defer to the popular cry and to find and trust his own definition of freedom in emersons definition rather than a preexisting set of rights or privileges freedom was an open ended process of selfrealization by which individuals could remake themselves and their own lives.
the keynote of the times he declared was the new importance given to the single person and the emancipation of the individual the american idea emerson was perhaps the most prominent member of a group of new england intellectuals known as the transcendentalists who insisted on the primacy of individual judgment over existing social traditions and institutions.
emersons concord massachusetts neighbor the writer henry david thoreau echoed his call for individual self reliance.
any man more right than his neighbors thoreau wrote is a majority of one individualism ironies abounded in the eras individualism a term that first entered the language in the 1820s.
for even as the market revolution promoted commercial connections between far flung people the idea of the sovereign individual proclaimed that americans should depend on no one but themselves.
of course personal independence had long been associated with american freedom.
but eighteenth century thinkers generally saw no contradiction between private happiness and self sacrificing public virtue defined as devotion to the common good.
now tocqueville observed individualism led each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his fellows and to draw apart with his family and his the daguerreotype an early form of photography required the sitter to remain perfectly still for twenty seconds or longer.
the philosopher ralph waldo emerson depicted here did not like the result.

in this famous address delivered at harvard college he insisted on the primacy of individual judgment over existing social traditions as the essence of freedom.

shall the worthy laborer be awed into silence by wealth and power and for fear of being deprived of the means of procuring his daily bread.
shall tyranny and cruel oppression be allowed to rivet the chains of physical and mental slavery on the millions of our country who are the real producers of all its improvements and wealth and they fear to speak out in noble self defense.

much has been written and spoken in womans behalf especially in america and yet a large class of females are and have been destined to a state of servitude as degrading as unceasing toil can make it.

slaves to a system of labor which requires them to toil from five until seven oclock with one hour only to attend to the wants of nature allowed slaves to the will and requirements of the powers that be however they may infringe on the rights or conflict with the feelings of the operative slaves to however great the desire may be for knowledge.
again we hear much said on the subject of benevolence among the wealthy and so called christian part of community.
have we not cause to question the sincerity of those who while they talk benevolence in the parlor compel their help to labor for a mean paltry pittance in the kitchen.
and while they manifest great concern for the souls of the heathen in distant lands care nothing for the bodies and intellects of those within their own precincts.
in the strength of our united influence we will soon show these drivelling cotton lords this mushroom aristocracy of new england who so arrogantly aspire to lord it over gods heritage that our rights cannot be trampled upon with impunity that we will not longer submit to that arbitrary power which has for the last ten years been so abundantly exercised over us.
questions 1.
how does emerson define the freedom of what he calls the single individual.
why does the female factory worker compare her conditions with those of slaves.
what does the contrast between these two documents suggest about the impact of the market revolution on american thought.
9 the market revolution 1800 1840 the free individual outing on the hudson painted by an unknown artist around 1850.
the steamboat pictured in the foreground made it possible for city dwellers to enjoy rural excursions such as this although as the tree stump suggests they were not experiencing unspoiled nature.
leaving society at large to itself americans increasingly understood the realm of the self which came to be called privacy as one with which neither other individuals nor government had a right to interfere.
as will be discussed in the next chapter individualism also helped to inspire the expansion of democracy.
ownership of ones self rather than ownership of property now made a person capable of exercising the right to vote.
looking back from the 1880s emerson would recall the era before the civil war as a time when social existence gave way to the enlargement and independency of the individual.
driven to find all his resources hopes rewards society and deity within himself in his own life thoreau illustrated emersons point about the primacy of individual conscience in matters political social and personal and the need to find ones own way rather than following the crowd.
like other transcendentalists he did not approve of the way individuals in a market economy engaged in this pursuit of happiness.
thoreau became persuaded that modern society stifled individual judgment by making men tools of their tools trapped in stultifying jobs by their obsession with acquiring wealth.
even in this comparatively free country he wrote most persons were so preoccupied with material things that they had no time to contemplate the beauties of nature.
to escape this fate thoreau retreated for two years to a cabin on walden pond near concord where he could enjoy the freedom of isolation from the economical and moral tyranny he believed ruled american society.
he subsequently published walden 1854 an account of his experiences and a critique of how the market revolution was in his opinion degrading both americans values and the natural environment.
an area that had been covered with dense forest in his youth he observed had been so how did the meanings of american freedom change in this period.
transformed by woodcutters and farmers that it had become almost completely devoid of trees and wild animals.
in one famous passage thoreau noted how his enjoyment of nature was disturbed by the distant sound of a locomotive whistle a symbol of how it seemed impossible to escape the market revolution.
thoreau appealed to americans to simplify their lives rather than become obsessed with the accumulation of wealth.
genuine freedom he insisted lay within.
the second great awakening the popular religious revivals that swept over the country during the second great awakening added a religious underpinning to the celebration of personal self improvement self reliance and self determination.
these revivals which began at the turn of the century were originally organized by established religious leaders alarmed by low levels of church attendance in the young republic perhaps as few as 10 percent of white americans regularly attended church during the 1790s.
but they quickly expanded far beyond existing churches.
they reached a crescendo in the 1820s and early 1830s when the reverend charles grandison finney held months long revival meetings in upstate new york and new york city.
the son of connecticut farmers finney had been inspired to preach after attending a religious revival in 1821.
like the evangelists traveling preachers of the first great awakening of the mid eighteenth century discussed in chapter 4 finney warned of hell in vivid language while offering the promise of salvation to converts who abandoned their sinful ways.
he became a national celebrity after his success in oneida county in upstate new york.
after finneys preaching according to one report the area had religious camp meeting a watercolor from the late 1830s depicting an evangelical preacher at a revival meeting.
some of the audience members seem inattentive while others are moved by his fiery sermon.

been completely overthrown by the holy ghost so that the theater has been deserted the tavern sanctified.
and far higher and purer enjoyment has been found in exercises of devotion the second great awakening democratized american christianity making it a truly mass enterprise.
at the time of independence fewer than 2 000 christian ministers preached in the united states.
in 1845 they numbered 40 000.
evangelical denominations like the methodists and baptists enjoyed explosive growth in membership and smaller sects proliferated.
by the 1840s methodism with more than 1 million members had become the countrys largest denomination.
deism a form of religious belief hostile to organized churches had been prominent among the generation of the founding fathers.
it now waned and christianity became even more central to american culture.
americans wrote tocqueville combine the notions of christianity and of liberty so intimately in their minds that it is impossible to make them conceive the one without the other new religious prophets seemed to appear regularly in early nineteenthcentury america determined in novelist herman melvilles phrase to gospelize the world anew at large camp meetings especially prominent on the frontier fiery revivalist preachers rejected the idea that man is a sinful creature with a preordained fate promoting instead the doctrine of human free will.
at these gatherings rich and poor male and female and in some instances whites and blacks worshiped alongside one another and pledged to abandon worldly sins in favor of the godly life.
the awakening s impact even more than its predecessor of several decades earlier the second great awakening stressed the right of private judgment in spiritual matters and the possibility of universal salvation through faith and good works.

these images offer two responses to the market revolution.
the official seal of arkansas 1836 juxtaposes a woman holding a cap of liberty with symbols of technological progress an iron plow and a steamboat and material prosperity horns of plenty.
the sketch of henry david thoreaus cabin on walden pond illustrates his belief that americans could enjoy what he called absolute freedom by rejecting market society and retreating into the wilderness.
only in this way he insisted could they preserve both individual independence and the natural environment.

sinners could experience a change of heart and embrace spiritual freedom defined in the words of evangelical minister jonathan blanchard as christ ruling in and over rational creatures who are obeying him freely and from choice revivalist ministers seized the opportunities offered by the market revolution to spread their message.
they raised funds embarked on lengthy preaching tours by canal steamboat and railroad and flooded the country with mass produced inexpensive religious tracts.
the revivals opening of religion to mass participation and their message that ordinary americans could shape their own spiritual destinies resonated with the spread of market values.
to be sure evangelical preachers can hardly be described as cheerleaders for a market society.
they regularly railed against greed and indifference to the welfare of others as sins.
finney called selfishness an extreme form of individualism encouraged by the scramble for wealth produced by the market revolution the law of satans empire not gods.
yet the revivals thrived in areas caught up in the rapid expansion of the market economy such as the region of upstate new york along the path of the erie canal.
most of finneys converts here came from the commercial and professional classes.
evangelical ministers promoted what might be called a controlled individualism as the essence of freedom.
in stressing the importance of industry sobriety and self discipline as examples of freely chosen moral behavior evangelical preachers promoted the very qualities necessary for success in a market culture.

and prosperity as the market revolution progressed the right to compete for economic advancement became a touchstone of american freedom.
the whole question of freedom or slavery for man argued henry c carey perhaps the eras most prominent economist was bound up with economic achievement.
official imagery linked the goddess of liberty ever more closely to emblems of material wealth.
new jersey whose official seal adopted in 1776 had paired liberty with ceres the roman goddess of agriculture in 1821 added the motto liberty and prosperity the state seal of arkansas admitted to the union in 1836 pictured liberty atop an image of a steamboat and two overflowing horns of plenty.
many enterprising americans seized the opportunities offered by the market revolution to enrich themselves.
john jacob astor the son of a poor german butcher who emigrated to the united states at the end of the war of independence earned large profits in the early nineteenth century by shipping furs to china and importing teas and silk.
astor invested his wealth in manhattan real estate which was rapidly rising in value and built astor house which quickly became the nations most famous hotel.
he died in 1848 the richest man in the united states leaving a fortune of perhaps 10 million the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars today.
astors story seemed to exemplify the opportunities open to the selfmade man a term that came into use during his lifetime.
according to this how did the market revolution affect the lives of workers women and african americans.
idea those who achieved success in america did so not as a result of hereditary privilege or government favoritism as in europe but through their own intelligence and hard work.
in the extent of his wealth of course astor was hardly typical.
but the market revolution and the quickening of commercial life enriched numerous bankers merchants industrialists and planters.
it produced a new middle class an army of clerks accountants and other office employees who staffed businesses in boston new york and elsewhere.
it created new opportunities for farmers who profited from the growing demand at home and abroad for american agricultural products and for skilled craftsmen like thomas rodgers a machine builder who established a successful locomotive factory in paterson new jersey.
new opportunities for talented men opened in professions like law medicine and teaching.
by the early 1820s there were an estimated 10 000 physicians in the united states.
race and opportunity the market revolution affected the lives of all americans.
but not all were positioned to take advantage of its benefits.
most blacks of course were slaves but even free blacks found themselves excluded from the new economic opportunities.
the 220 000 blacks living in the free states on the eve of the civil war less than 2 percent of the norths population suffered discrimination in every phase of their lives.
although virtually every northern county east of the mississippi river reported some black residents the majority of blacks lived in the poorest unhealthiest sections of cities like new york philadelphia and cincinnati.
and even these neighborhoods were subjected to occasional violent assault by white mobs like the armed bands that attacked blacks and destroyed their homes and businesses in cincinnati in 1829.
barred from schools and other public facilities free blacks laboriously constructed their own institutional life centered on mutual aid and educational societies as well as independent churches most notably the african methodist episcopal church.
richard allen of philadelphia a methodist preacher had been spurred to found the church after being forcibly removed from his former church for praying at the altar rail a place reserved for whites.
while many white americans could look forward to a life of economic accumulation and individual advancement large numbers of free blacks experienced downward mobility.
as noted in chapter 6 northern free blacks were the last large group to experience indentured servitude since the terms of emancipation generally required children of slave mothers to work for their owners before being freed.
at the time of abolition because of widespread slave ownership among eighteenth century artisans a considerable number of northern blacks possessed craft skills.
but it became more and more difficult for blacks to utilize these skills once they became free.
although many white artisans criticized slavery most viewed the freed slaves as low wage competitors and sought to bar them from skilled employment.
they are leaders in the cause of equal rights for themselves a black editor commented of new york citys artisans in the 1830s.
hostility from white craftsmen however was only one of many obstacles that kept blacks confined to the lowest ranks of the labor market.

many protestant denominations allowed women to preach although their presence also aroused much criticism.
9 the market revolution 1800 1840 the crowning of flora a painting from 1816 depicts idealized women of virtue and modesty.
these were the qualities the nineteenth centurys cult of domesticity emphasized as essential to proper womanhood.
the limits of prosperity employers refused to hire them in anything but menial positions and white customers did not wish to be served by them.
the result was a rapid decline in economic status until by mid century the vast majority of northern blacks labored for wages in unskilled jobs and as domestic servants.
the state census of 1855 revealed 122 black barbers and 808 black servants in new york city but only 1 lawyer and 6 doctors.
nor could free blacks take advantage of the opening of the west to improve their economic status a central component of american freedom.
federal law barred them from access to public land and by 1860 four states indiana illinois iowa and oregon prohibited them from entering their territory altogether.
the c u lt of domesticity women too found many of the opportunities opened by the market revolution closed to them.
as the household declined as a center of economic production many women saw their traditional roles undermined by the availability of mass produced goods previously made at home.
some women as noted above followed work as it moved from household to factory.
others embraced a new definition of femininity which glorified not a womans contribution to the familys economic well being but her ability to create a private environment shielded from the competitive tensions of the market economy.
womans place was in the home a site increasingly emptied of economically productive functions as work moved from the household to workshops and factories.
her role was to sustain nonmarket values like love friendship and mutual obligation providing men with a shelter from the competitive marketplace.
the earlier ideology of republican motherhood which allowed how did the market revolution affect the lives of workers women and african americans.
women a kind of public role as mothers of future citizens subtly evolved into the mid nineteenth century cult of domesticity virtue which in the eighteenth century was a political characteristic of men essential to the success of republican government came to be redefined as a personal moral quality associated more and more closely with women.
virtue for a woman meant not only sexual innocence but beauty frailty and dependence on men.
in whatever situation of life a woman is placed from her cradle to her grave declared the young ladys book one of numerous popular magazines addressed to female audiences of the 1820s and 1830s a spirit of obedience and submission pliability of temper and humility of mind are required from her these magazines carried articles such as woman a source of comfort woman a being to come home to and woman mans best friend with more and more men leaving the home for work women did exercise considerable power over personal affairs within the family.
the rapid decline in the american birthrate during the nineteenth century from an average of seven children per woman in 1800 to four in 1900 cannot be explained except by the conscious decision of millions of women to limit the number of children they bore.
but the idea of domesticity minimized womens even indirect participation in the outside world.
for both sexes freedom meant fulfilling their respective inborn qualities.
men were rational aggressive and domineering while women were nurturing selfless ruled by the emotions and thus less fitted for public life.
if submission to the will of another increasingly seemed inadmissible for free men it remained a condition natural to women and expected of them.
men moved freely between the public and private spheres women were supposed to remain cloistered in the private realm of the family.
women and work prevailing ideas concerning gender bore little relation to the experience of those women who worked for wages at least some time in their lives.
they did so despite severe disadvantages.
women could not compete freely for employment since only low paying jobs were available to them.
married women still could not sign independent contracts or sue in their own name and not until after the civil war did they not their husbands control the wages they earned.
nonetheless for poor city dwellers and farm families the labor of all family members was essential to economic survival.
thousands of poor women found jobs as domestic servants factory workers and seamstresses.
early industrialization enhanced the availability of paid work for northern women as the spread of the putting out system in such indus a woman with a sewing machine in an undated photograph.

9 the market revolution 1800 1840 the limits of prosperity tries as shoemaking hatmaking and clothing manufacture allowed women laboring at home to contribute to family income even as they retained responsibility for domestic chores.
for the expanding middle class however it became a badge of respectability for wives to remain at home outside the disorderly new market economy while husbands conducted business in their offices shops and factories.
in larger cities where families of different social classes had previously lived alongside one another fashionable middle class neighborhoods populated by merchants factory owners and professionals like lawyers and doctors began to develop.
work in middle class homes was done by domestic servants the largest employment category for women in nineteenth century america.
the freedom of the middle class woman defined in part as freedom from labor rested on the employment of other women within her household.
even though most women were anything but idle in a market economy where labor increasingly meant work that created monetary value it became more and more difficult to think of labor as encompassing anyone but men.
lydia maria child wrote a popular book the frugal housewife published in 1829 that sought to prepare women for the ups and downs of the market revolution one chapter was entitled how to endure poverty.
child supported her family by her writing and became a prominent advocate of antislavery and of greater rights for women.
her diary reveals that in a single year she also sewed thirty six pieces of clothing prepared more than 700 meals and spent much time supervising household help.
by any reasonable definition child worked at home and as a writer.
but discussions of labor rarely mentioned housewives domestic servants and female outworkers except as an indication of how the spread of capitalism was degrading men.
the idea that the male head of household should command a family wage that enabled him to support his wife and children became a popular definition of social justice.

not only among middle class americans but among working class men as well.
capitalism said the newspaper workingmans advocate tore women from their role as happy and independent mistresses of the domestic sphere and forced them into the labor market thereby undermining the natural order of the household and the authority of its male head.
the e a r ly labor movement as this complaint suggests although many americans welcomed the market revolution others felt threatened by its consequences.
surviving members of the revolutionary generation feared that the obsession with personal economic gain was undermining devotion to the public good.
commerce luxury and avarice warned john adams have destroyed every republican government in the 1820s as he neared the end of his life jefferson was denouncing stockjobbers financiers speculators and others for leading the nation away from his idealized virtuous agrarian republic.
many americans experienced the market revolution not as an enhancement of the power to shape their own lives but as a loss of freedom.
the period between the war of 1812 and 1840 witnessed a sharp economic downturn in 1819 a full fledged depression starting in 1837 and numerous ups and downs in between during which employment was irregular and numerous businesses failed.
for every aspiring american who rode the tide of economic progress another seemed to sink beneath the waves.
the economic transformation produced an explosive growth in the nations output and trade and a rise in the general standard of living.
but especially in the growing cities of the northeast it significantly widened the gap between wealthy merchants and industrialists on the one hand and impoverished factory workers unskilled dockworkers and seamstresses laboring at home on the other.
in massachusetts the most industrialized state in the country the richest 5 percent of the population owned more than half the wealth.
inequality was even more pronounced in philadelphia where the top 1 percent possessed more wealth than the rest of the population combined.
bankruptcy was a common fact of life and men unable to pay their debts filled the prisons of major cities.
alarmed at the erosion of traditional skills and the threat of being reduced to the status of dependent wage earners skilled craftsmen in the late 1820s created the worlds first workingmens parties short lived political organizations that sought to mobilize lower class support for candidates who would press for free public education an end to imprisonment for debt and legislation limiting work to ten hours per day.
in the 1830s a time of rapidly rising prices union organization spread and strikes became commonplace.
along with demands for higher wages and shorter hours the early labor movement called for free homesteads for settlers on public land and an end to the imprisonment of union leaders for conspiracy.

the conviction of twenty new york tailors in 1835 under the common law of conspiracy for combining to seek higher wages inspired a public procession marking the burial of liberty such actions and language were not confined to male workers.
the young mill women of lowell walked off their jobs in 1834 to protest a reduction in wages and again two years later when employers raised rents at their boardinghouses.
they carried banners affirming their rights as daughters of free men and addressing the factory owners they charged the oppressive hand of avarice greed would enslave us freedom noah websters american dictionary declared in 1828 was a state of exemption from the power or control of another the labor movement asked how many wage earners truly enjoyed such exemption some labor spokesmen like langdon byllesby of philadelphia went so far as to describe wage labor itself as the very essence of slavery since dependence on another person for ones economic livelihood was incompatible with freedom.
the idea that permanent wage work bore some resemblance to slavery was not confined to labor radicals.
in herman melvilles short story the tartarus of maids workers in a new england paper mill stand by their machines mutely and cringingly as the slave rooted in the traditions of the small producer and the identification of freedom with economic independence labors critique of the market economy directly challenged the idea that individual improvement emersons self trust self reliance self control self culture offered an adequate response to social inequality.
wealth and labor wrote orestes brownson in his influential essay the laboring classes 1840 were at war.
workers problems he went on must be understood as institutional not individual.
they had their root in the constitution of society and their solution required not a more complete individualism but a radical change in existing social arrangements so as to produce equality between man and man we are free wrote peter rdel an immigrant german shoemaker but not free enough.
we want the liberty of living here lay the origins of the idea which would become far more prominent in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries that economic security a standard of life below which no person would fall formed an essential part of american freedom.
thus the market revolution transformed and divided american society and its conceptions of freedom.
it encouraged a new emphasis on individualism and physical mobility among white men while severely limiting the options available to women and african americans.
it opened new opportunities for economic freedom for many americans while leading others to fear that their traditional economic independence was being eroded.
in a democratic society it was inevitable that the debate over the market revolution and its consequences for freedom would be reflected in american politics.

how did the bank war influence the economy and party competition.
l t he inauguration of andrew jackson on march 4 1829 made it clear that something had changed in american politics.
the swearing in of the president had previously been a small dignified event.
jacksons inauguration attracted a crowd of some 20 000 people who poured into the white house after the ceremony ruining furniture and breaking china and glassware in the crush.
it was the reign of king mob lamented justice joseph story of the supreme court.
jackson aroused powerful feelings pro and con.
his supporters viewed his election as the advent of genuine democracy the coming to power of the common man philip hone a new york political leader who kept a detailed diary for more than thirty years recorded that jackson was the most popular man we have ever known hone had voted for president john quincy adams in 1828 but he recognized that jacksons democratic bearing and beliefs suit the people exactly jacksons critics on the other hand considered him a tyrant.
they called him king andrew i and when they organized politically they borrowed their name the whig party from the opponents of royal power in eighteenth century england.
andrew jacksons career embodied the major developments of his era the market revolution the westward movement the expansion of slavery and the growth of democracy.
he was a symbol of the self made man.
unlike previous presidents jackson rose to prominence from a humble background reflecting his eras democratic opportunities.
born in 1767 on the south carolina frontier he had been orphaned during the american revolution.
early on jackson displayed the courage and impetuousness for which he would later become famous.
while still a youth he served as a courier for patriotic forces during the war of independence.
captured and imprisoned he was almost killed when a british officer struck him with a sword after jackson refused an order to polish the officers boots.
as a young man jackson moved to tennessee where he studied law became involved in local politics and in the 1790s won election to the house of representatives and the senate and became a judge on the state supreme court.
his military campaigns against the british and indians helped to consolidate american control over the deep south making possible the rise of the cotton kingdom.
he himself acquired a large plantation in tennessee.
but more than anything else to this generation of americans andrew jackson symbolized one of the most crucial features of national life the triumph of political democracy.
americans pride themselves on being the worlds oldest democracy.

descendants of the indigenous population well before the united states.
europe lagged far behind.
britain did not achieve universal male suffrage until the 1880s.
france instituted it in 1793 abandoned it in 1799 reintroduced it in 1848 and abandoned it again a few years later.
more to the point perhaps democracy became part of the definition of american nationality and the american idea of freedom.
the triumph of democracy property and democracy the market revolution and territorial expansion were intimately connected with a third central element of american freedom political democracy.
the challenge to property qualifications for voting begun during the american revolution reached its culmination in the early nineteenth century.
not a single state that entered the union after the original thirteen required ownership of property to vote.
in the older states constitutional conventions during the 1820s and 1830s reconsidered democracys economic basis.
even as the expansion of industry and commercial agriculture increased the number of wage earners in cities and older rural areas men who could not meet property requirements insisted that they were as fit as others to exercise the rights of citizens.
their insistent pressure did much to democratize american politics.
owning property declared a petition by non freeholders landless men of richmond to the virginia constitutional convention of 1829 did not necessarily mean the possession of moral or intellectual endowments superior to those of the poor.
they alone deserve to be called free they continued who participate in the formation of their political institutions by this time only north carolina rhode island and virginia still retained property requirements.
the large slaveholders who dominated virginia politics successfully resisted demands for changes in voting qualifications in 1829 but a subsequent constitutional convention in 1850 eliminated the property requirement.
although the speed of the process varied from state to state by 1860 all but one had ended property requirements for voting although several continued to bar persons accepting poor relief on the grounds that they lacked genuine independence.
the personal independence necessary in the citizen now rested not on ownership of property but on ownership of ones self a reflection of the eras individualism.
the dorr war the lone exception to the trend toward democratization was rhode island which required voters to own real estate valued at 134 or rent property for at least 7 per year.
a center of factory production rhode island had a steadily growing population of propertyless wage earners an anti jackson cartoon from 1832 portrays andrew jackson as an aspiring monarch wielding the veto power while trampling on the constitution.
