frontier from the last of the mohicans by james fenimore cooper 1789 1851 about the reading the last of the mohicans is one of five novels known as the leatherstocking tales.
these novels follow the life and adventures of american pioneer natty bumppo also known as leatherstocking hawkeye and the deerslayer.
bumppo is the perfect woodsman resourceful honest kind to both his friends and his enemies but always a loner at heart.
as you read try to imagine what natty bumppo looks like.
on that day two men were lingering on the banks of a small but rapid stream.
while one of these loiterers showed the red skin and wild accoutrements of a native of the woods the other exhibited through the mask of his rude and nearly savage equipments the brighter though sunburnt and long faded complexion of one who might claim descent from a european parentage.
o the frame of the white man judging by such parts as were not concealed by his clothes was like that of one who had known hardships and exertion from his earliest youth.
his person though muscular was rather attenuated than full but every nerve and muscle appeared strung and indurated by unremitted exposure and toil.
he wore a hunting shirt of forest green fringed with faded yellow and a summer cap of skins which had been shorn of their fur.
he also bore a knife in a girdle of wampum like that which confined the scanty garments of the indian but no tomahawk.
his moccasins were ornamented after the fashion of the natives while the only part of his underdress which appeared below the hunting frock was a pair of buckskin leggings that laced at the sides and which were gartered above the knees with the sinews of a deer.
a pouch and horn completed his personal accoutrements though a rifle of great length which the theory of the more ingenious whites had taught them was the most dangerous of all firearms leaned against a neighboring sapling.
from the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving 1783 1859 about the reading the legend of sleepy hollow has been called one of the first american short stories.
even though it is based on an old german folktale its setting a small village in the hudson river valley is american through and through.

the dominant spirit however that haunts this enchanted region and seems to be commander in chief of all the powers of the air is the apparition of a figure on horseback without a head.
it is said by some to be the ghost of a hessian trooper o whose head had been carried away by a cannon ball in some nameless battle during the revolutionary war and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night as if on the wings of the wind.
his haunts are not confined to the valley but extend at times to the adjacent roads and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance.
indeed certain of the most authentic historians of those parts who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the church yard the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the hollow like a midnight blast is owing to his being belated and in a hurry to get back to the church yard before day break.
such is the general purport of this legendary superstition which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows and the spectre is known at all the country firesides by the name of the headless horseman of sleepy hollow.

313 social studies skills analysis i critical thinking civic participation study identifying central issues define the skill the reasons for historical events are often complex and difficult to determine.
an accurate understanding of them requires the ability to identify the central issues involved.
a central issue is the main topic of concern in a discussion or dispute.
in history these issues are usually matters of public debate or concern.
they generally involve political social moral economic or territorial matters.
being able to identify central issues lets you go beyond what the participants in an event said and gain a more accurate understanding of it.
the skill is also useful for understanding issues today and for evaluating the statements of those involved.
learn the skill in this chapter you learned about the dispute that arose over missouri s admission to the union.
yet that was not what this controversy was really about.
recognizing the central issue in this dispute helps you understand why each side fought so hard over just one state.
use the following steps to identify central issues when you read about historical events.
identify the main subject of the information.
determine the nature and purpose of what you are reading.
is it a primary source or a secondary one.
why has the information been provided.
find the strongest or most forceful phrases or statements in the material.
these are often clues to the issues or ideas the speaker or writer thinks most central or important.
determine how the information might be connected to the major events or controversies that were concerning the nation at the time.
practice the skill soon after the missouri compromise passed secretary of state john quincy adams wrote the impression produced upon my mind by the progress of this discussion the dispute over missouri is that the bargain between freedom and slavery contained in the constitution is morally and politically vicious cruel and oppressive.
i have favored this missouri compromise believing it to be all that can be effected accomplished under the present constitution and from an extreme unwillingness to put the union at hazard risk.
but perhaps it would have been a bolder course to have persisted in the restriction upon missouri till it should have terminated ended in a convention of the states to amend the constitution.
this would have produced a new union of thirteen or fourteen states unpolluted with slavery.
if the union must be dissolved slavery is precisely the question upon which it ought to break.
for the present however this contest issue is laid to sleep apply the steps to identifying central issues to analyze adams s statement and answer the following questions 1.
about what subject was adams writing.
what was his reason for making these remarks.
what did adams believe was the most important issue in the dispute.
what strong language does he use to indicate this.
what evidence suggests adams did not think the breakup of the union the central issue.

sectional differences increase regional differences had a major effect on andrew jackson s presidency.
americans views of jackson s policies were based on where they lived and the economy of those regions.
three regions emerge there were three main u s regions in the early 1800s.
the north first of all had an economy based on trade and on manufacturing.
northerners supported tariffs because tariffs helped them compete with british factories.
northerners also opposed the federal government s sale of public land at cheap prices.
cheap land encouraged potential laborers to move from northern factory towns to the west.
the second region was the south.
its economy was based on farming.
southern farmers raised all types of crops but the most popular were the cash crops of cotton and tobacco.
southerners sold a large portion of their crops to foreign nations.
26 chapter 10 regions of the united states early 1800s southerners imported their manufactured goods.
tariffs made imported goods more expensive for southern farmers.
in addition high tariffs angered some of the south s european trading partners.
these trading partners would likely raise their own tariffs in retaliation.
to avoid this situation southerners called for low tariffs.
southerners also relied on enslaved african americans to work the plantations.
the issue of slavery would become increasingly controversial between the north and south.
in the third region the west the frontier economy was just emerging.
settlers favored policies that boosted their farming economy and encouraged further settlement.
western farmers grew a wide variety of crops.
their biggest priority was cheap land and internal improvements such as better roads and water transportation.
tariff of abominations tariffs became one of the first issues that president jackson faced.
in 1827 the year before jackson s election northern manufacturers began to demand a tariff on imported woolen goods.
northerners wanted the tariff to protect their industries from foreign competition especially from great britain.
british companies were driving american ones out of business with their inexpensive manufactured goods.
the tariff northerners supported however was so high that importing wool would be impossible.
southerners opposed the tariff sayng it would hurt their economy.
before andrew jackson took office congress placed a high tariff on imports.
angry southerners called it the tariff of abominations.
an abomination is a hateful thing.
southern voters were outraged.
president john quincy adams signed the tariff legislation though he did not fully support it.
in early u s history presidents tended to reserve veto power for legislation that they believed violated the constitution.
signing the tariff bill meant adams would surely be defeated in his re election bid.
the new tariff added fuel to the growing sectional differences plaguing the young nation.

the age of jackson 327 academic vocabulary criteria basic requirements focus on reaping what conclusions can you draw about the importance of the states rights debate after reading this section.
states rights debate when andrew jackson took office in 1829 he was forced to respond to the growing conflict over tariffs.
at the core of the dispute was the question of an individual state s right to disregard a law that had been passed by the u s congress.
nullification crisis early in his political career vice president john c calhoun had supported the criteria of a strong central government.
but in 1828 when congress passed the tariff of abominations calhoun joined his fellow southerners in protest.
economic depression and previous tariffs had severely damaged the economy of his home state south carolina.
it was only beginning to recover in 1828.
some leaders in the state even spoke of leaving the union over the issue of tariffs.
in response to the tariff calhoun drafted the south carolina exposition and protest.
it said that congress should not favor one state or region over another.
calhoun used the protest to advance the states rights doctrine which said that since the states had formed the national government state power should be greater than federal power.
the doctrine challenged the idea of the supremacy and authority of a central government.
calhoun believed states had the right to nullify or reject any federal law they judged to be unconstitutional.
calhoun s theory was controversial and it drew some fierce challengers.
many of them were from the northern states that had benefited from increased tariffs.
these opponents believed that the american people not the individual states made up the union.
conflict between the supporters and the opponents of nullification deepened.
the dispute became known as the nullification crisis.
it became not only a crisis over the tariff but also a question about the ideas behind the constitution as a system of government.
although he chose not to put his name on his exposition and protest calhoun did resign from the vice presidency.
he was then elected to the senate where he continued his arguments in favor of nullification.
martin van buren replaced calhoun as vice president when jackson was re elected president.
the hayne webster debate the debate about states rights began early in our nation s history.
thomas jefferson and james madison supported the states power to disagree with the federal government in the virginia and kentucky resolutions of 1798 99.
some of the delegates at the hartford convention supported states rights.
but calhoun s theory went further.
he believed that states could judge whether a law was or was not constitutional.
this position put the power of the supreme court in question.
the issue of nullification was intensely debated on the floor of the senate in 1830.
robert y hayne senator from south carolina defended states rights.
he argued that nullification gave states a way to lawfully protest federal legislation.
daniel webster of massachusetts argued that the united states was one nation not a pact among independent states.
he believed that the welfare of the nation should override that of individual states.
jackson responds although deeply opposed to nullification jackson was concerned about economic problems in the southern states.
in 1832 he urged congress to pass another tariff that lowered the previous rate.
south carolina thought the slight change was inadequate.
the state legislature took a monumental step it decided to test the doctrine of states rights.
south carolina s first action was to pass the nullification act which declared the 1828 and 1832 tariffs null void and not binding upon this state its officers or citizens.
south carolina threatened to withdraw 8 chapter 10 from the union if federal troops were used to collect duties.
the legislature also voted to form its own army.
jackson was enraged.
the president sternly condemned nullification.
jackson declared that he would enforce the law in south carolina.
at his request congress passed the force bill approving use of the army if necessary.
in light of jackson s determined position no other state chose to support south carolina.
early in 1833 henry clay of kentucky had proposed a compromise that would gradually lower the tariff over several years.
as jackson s intentions became clear both the u s congress and south carolina moved quickly to approve the compromise.
the congress would decrease the tariff and south carolina s leaders would enforce the law.
despite the compromise neither side changed its beliefs about states rights.
the argument continued for years resulting in the huge conflict known as the civil war.
reading check summarizing what led to the nullification crisis and why was it important.
jackson attacks the bank president jackson upheld federal authority in the nullification crisis.
he did not however always support greater federal power.
for example he opposed the second bank of the united states founded by congress in 1816.
the second bank of the united states was given a 20 year charter.
this charter gave it the power to act exclusively as the federal government s financial agent.
the bank held federal deposits made transfers of federal funds between states and dealt with any payments or receipts involving the federal government.
it also issued bank notes or paper currency.
some 80 percent of the bank was privately owned but its operations were supervised by congress and the president.
the bank had helped stabilize the financial troubles the nation s economy had experienced during the war of 1812.
many states particularly in the south had opposed the bank.
small farmers believed that the bank only helped wealthy business people.
jackson also questioned the legality primary source points of view states rights vs the union the framers ofthe constitution created a document that was remarkable in its scope.
but a few issues were unresolved.
one of the most controversial was the matter of states rights versus the authority ofthe federal government.
daniel webster insisted that the interests ofthe union should prevail.
john c calhoun believed that the powers ofthe states were greater.
while the union lasts we have high exciting gratifying rewarding prospects spread out before us for us and our children.
god grant that in my day my eyes shall be turned to behold the gorgeous ensign flag ofthe republic bearing for its motto liberty and union now and forever one and inseparable.

he believed it was an unconstitutional extension of the power of congress.
the states he thought should have the power to control the banking system.
some states decided to take action.
maryland tried to pass a tax that would limit the bank s operations.
james mcculloch cashier of the bank s branch in maryland refused to pay this tax.
the state took him to court and the resulting case went all the way to the u s supreme court.
in mcculloch v maryland the court ruled that the national bank was constitutional.
nicholas biddle the bank s director decided to push for a bill to renew the bank s charter in 1832.
jackson campaigned for the bill s defeat.
i will kill it he promised.
true to his word jackson vetoed the legislation when congress sent it to him.
congress could not get the two thirds majority needed to override jackson s veto.
jackson also weakened the bank s power by moving most of its funds to state banks.
in many cases these banks used the funds to offer easy credit terms to people buying land.
while this practice helped expansion in the west it also led to inflation.
in the summer of 1836 jackson tried to slow this inflation.
he ordered americans to use only gold or silver instead of paper state bank notes to buy government owned land.
this policy did not help the national economy as jackson had hoped.
jackson did improve the economy by lowering the national debt.
however his policies opened the door for approaching economic troubles.

panic of 1837 jackson was still very popular with voters in 1836.
he chose not to run in 1836 however and the democrats nominated vice president martin van buren.
in 1834 a new political party had formed to oppose jackson.
its members called themselves whigs after an english political party that opposed the monarchy to make the point that jackson was using his power like a king.
the whig party favored the idea of a weak president and a strong congress.
unable to agree on a candidate the whigs chose four 330 chapter 10 the supreme court and capitalism connect to economics 1810 1819 1824 during the early 1800s the supreme court made several rulings that helped define federal power over contracts and commerce.

because of this indecision and with backing from jackson van buren won the election.
shortly after van buren took office the country experienced the panic of 1837 a severe economic depression.
jackson s banking policies and his unsuccessful plan to curb inflation contributed to the panic.
but people blamed van buren.

with public support he reversed the government s pledge to respect indian land claims.
the result was the brutal removal ofthe southeastern peoples to empty lands in the west indian removal act native americans had long lived in settlements stretching from georgia to mississippi.
however president jackson and other political leaders wanted to open this land to settlement by american farmers.
under pressure from jackson congress passed the indian removal act in 1830 authorizing the removal of native americans who lived east of the mississippi river to lands in the west.
congress then established indian territory u s.
land in what is now oklahoma and planned to move native americans there.
some supporters of this plan like john c calhoun argued that removal to indian territory would protect indians from further conflicts with american settlers.
one of the greatest evils to which they are subject is that incessant constant pressure of our population he noted.

the mississippi legislature abolished the choctaw government and then forced the choctaw leaders to sign the treaty of dancing rabbit creek.
this treaty gave more than 7 5 million acres of their land to the state.
the choctaw moved to indian territory during a disastrous winter trip.
federal officials in charge of the move did not provide enough food or supplies to the choctaw most of whom were on foot.
about one fourth of the choctaw died of cold disease or starvation.
news of the choctaw s hardships caused other indians to resist removal.
when the creek resisted in 1836 federal troops moved in and captured some 14 500 of them.
they led the creek many in chains to indian territory.
one creek woman remembered the trip being filled with the awful silence that showed the heartaches and sorrow at being taken from the homes and even separation from loved ones.

if you were there you live in ohio in 1840.
a few months ago you and your family heard stories about a wonderful land in the northwest with sparkling rivers and fertile valleys.
you all decide to pull up stakes and head west.
you travel to independence missouri planning to join a wagon train on the oregon trail.
in missouri you re surprised to find hundreds of other people planning to make the trip.
what would you expect your journey west to be like.
building background many americans in the jacksonian era were restless curious and eager to be on the move.
the american west drew a variety of settlers.
some looked for wealth and adventure.
others like this family on its way to the northwest dreamed of rich farmland and new homes.
americans move west in the early 1800s americans pushed steadily westward moving even beyond the territory of the united states.
they traveled by canoe and flatboat on horseback and by wagon train.
some even walked much of the way.
the era of westward expansion lasted until the late 1800s.
the rush to the west occurred in part because of a hat.
the high hat made of water repellent beaver fur was popular in the united states and europe.
while acquiring fur for the hats french british and american companies gradually killed off the beaver population in the east.
companies moved west in search of more beavers.
most of the first non native americans who traveled to the rocky mountains and the pacific northwest were fur traders and trappers.
american merchant john jacob astor created one of the largest fur businesses the american fur company.
his company bought skins from western fur traders and trappers who became known as mountain men.
these adventurers were some of the first easterners to explore and map the rocky mountains and lands west of them.
mountain men lived lonely and often dangerous lives.
they trapped animals on their own far from towns and settlements.
mountain men such as jedediah smith manuel lisa jim bridger and jim 346 chapter 11 1.
movement which trails took the longest to travel.
human environment interaction what difficulties do you think travelers on the trails faced.
beckwourth survived many hardships during their search for wealth and adventure.
to survive on the frontier mountain men adopted native american customs and clothing.
in addition they often married native american women.
the indian wives of trappers often worked hard to contribute to their success.
pioneer william ashley saw that frequently bringing furs out of the rocky mountains was expensive.
he asked his traders to stay in the mountains and meet once a year to trade and socialize.
this practice helped make the fur trade more profitable.
the yearly meeting was known as the rendezvous.
at the rendezvous mountain men and native american trappers sold their fur to fur company agents.
it was thus important to bring as many furs as possible.
one trapper described the people at a typical rendezvous in 1837.
he saw americans canadian french some europeans and indians of nearly every tribe in the rocky mountains.
the rendezvous was filled with celebrating and storytelling.
at the same time the meeting was also about conducting business.
western artist alfred jacob miller described how trade was begun in the rendezvous camp.
the fur company s great tent is raised the indians erect their picturesque beautiful white lodges the accumulated collected furs of the hunting season are brought forth and the company s tent is a busy place.
alfred jacob miller quoted in the fur trade of the american west by david j wlshart in 1811 john jacob astor founded a furtrading post called astoria at the mouth of the columbia river.
astoria was one of the first american settlements in what became known as oregon country.
american indians occupied the region which was rich in forests rivers and wildlife.
however britain russia spain and the united states all claimed the land.
the united states based its claim on expanding west 3 the exploration of merchant captain robert gray who had reached the mouth of the columbia river in 1792.
recognizing the huge economic value of the pacific northwest the united states made treaties in which spain and russia gave up their claims to various areas.
the united states also signed treaties w 1 britain allowing both countries to occupy oregon country the columbia river and its surrounding lands.
by the 1840s the era of american fur trading in the pacific northwest was drawing to a close.
the demand for beaver furs had fallen because fashions changed.
too much trapping had also greatly reduced the number of beavers.
some mountain men gave up their work and moved back east.
their daring stories however along with the treaties made by the u s government inspired other americans to move west.
lured by rich resources and a mild climate easterners poured into oregon country in the 1840s.
these new settlers soon replaced the mountain men on the frontier.
the oregon trail many settlers moving to oregon country and other western areas followed the 2 000 mile long oregon trail which stretched from places such as independence missouri or council bluffs iowa west into oregon country.
the trail followed the platte and sweetwater rivers over the plains.
after it crossed the rocky mountains the trail forked.
the northern branch led to the willamette valley in oregon.
the other branch went to california and became known as the california trail.
traveling the trail challenged the strength and determination of pioneer families.
the journey usually began after the rainy season ended in late spring and lasted about six months.
the cost about 600 for a family of four was high at a time when a typical worker usually made about 1 50 per day.
young families made up most groups of settlers.
they gathered in wagon trains for the trip.
there could be as few as 10 wagons or as many as several dozen in a wagon train.
the wagons were pulled by oxen mules or horses.
pioneers often walked to save their animals strength.
they kept up a tiring pace traveling from dawn until dusk.
settler jesse applegate recalled the advice he received from one experienced oregon pioneer travel travel travel.
nothing is good that causes a moment s delay.
some pioneers brought small herds of cattle with them on the trail.
they faced severe hardships including shortages of food supplies and water.
rough weather and geographic barriers such as rivers and mountains sometimes forced large numbers of pioneers to abandon their wagons.
in the early days of the oregon trail many native americans helped the pioneers acting as guides and messengers.
they also traded goods for food.
although newspapers sometimes reported native american massacres of pioneers few settlers died from indian attacks.
the settlers who arrived safely in oregon and california found generally healthy 348 chapter 11 and pleasant climates.
by 1845 some 5 000 settlers occupied the willamette valley.
the santa fe trail the santa fe trail was another important path west.
it led from independence missouri to santa fe new mexico.
it followed an ancient trading route first used by native americans.
american traders loaded their wagon trains with cloth and other manufactured goods to exchange for horses mules and silver from mexican traders in santa fe.
the long trip across blazing deserts and rough mountains was dangerous.
but the lure of high profits encouraged traders to take to the trail.
one trader reported a 2 000 percent profit on his cargo.
the u s government helped protect traders by sending troops to ensure that native americans were not a threat.
three communities eventually failed and an anti mormon mob murdered smith in 1844.
following smith s murder brigham young became head of the mormon church.
young chose what is now utah as the group s new home and thousands of mormons took the mormon trail to the area near the great salt lake where they prospered.
by 1860 there were about 40 000 mormons in utah.

section 1 assessment mormons travel west one large group of settlers traveled to the west in search of religious freedom.
in 1830 a young man named joseph smith founded the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in western new york.
the members of joseph smith s church became known as mormons.
smith told his followers that he had found and translated a set of golden tablets containing religious teachings.
the writings were called the book of mormon.
church membership grew rapidly but certain beliefs and practices caused mormons to be persecuted.
for example beginning in the 1850s some mormon men practiced polygamy a practice in which one man is married to several women at the same time.
this practice was outlawed by the church in 1890.
in the early 1830s smith and his growing number of converts left new york.

manifest destiny we have it in our power to start the world over again.
thomas paine from his pamphlet common sense americans had always believed they could build a new better society founded on democratic principles.
in 1839 writer john o sullivan noted we are the nation of human progress and who will what can set limits to our onward march.
actually there was one limit land.
from the beginnings of the colonies americans had been moving west in search of land and economic opportunity.
at the end of the revolution the land ordinance of 1785 and the northwest ordinance of 1787 established the method for dividing and governing new territories.
by the 1840s the united states had a booming economy and population.
barely 70 years old the nation needed even more room for farms ranches businesses and ever growing families.
americans looked west to what they saw as a vast wilderness ready to be taken.
the regions of oregon new mexico and texas were being settled by americans and the national government worked to annex those lands to the united states.
354 chapter 11 sgab ky k sb some people believed it was america s manifest destiny or obvious fate to settle land all the way to the pacific ocean in order to spread democracy.
o sullivan coined the term in 1845.
he wrote that it was america s manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole continent which providence god has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty in the 1840s and 1850s manifest destiny was tied up with the slavery issue.
if america expanded would slavery be allowed in the new territories.
several presidents became involved in the difficult issue.
among them was president john tyler.
a pro slavery whig tyler wanted to increase the power of the southern slave states by annexing texas.
his fellow whigs disagreed.
in 1844 the whig party passed up tyler and chose senator henry clay as its presidential candidate.
at first opposing annexation clay changed his mind due to pressure from southern politicians.
the democratic party chose former tennessee governor james k polk to oppose clay.
both candidates strongly favored acquiring texas and oregon.
southerners feared the loss of texas a possible new slave state.
others worried that texas might become an ally of britain.
these concerns helped polk narrowly defeat clay.
acquiring new territory president polk quickly set out to fulfill his promise to annex oregon and texas.
russia and spain had given up their claims to oregon country.
britain and the united states had agreed to occupy the territory together.
as more americans settled there they began to ask that oregon become part of the united states.
polk wanted to protect these settlers interests.
some politicians noted that oregon country would provide a pacific port for the growing u s trade with china.
meanwhile britain and the united states disagreed over how to draw the united states canadian border.
american expansionists cried fifty four forty or fight.
this slogan referred to 5440 north latitude the line to which americans wanted their northern territory to extend.
neither side really wanted a war though.
in 1846 great britain and the united states signed a treaty that gave the united states all oregon land south of the forty ninth parallel.
this treaty drew the border that still exists today.
oregon became an organized u s territory in february 1848.
expanding west 351 by march 1845 congress had approved the annexation of texas and needed only the support of the republic of texas.
americans continued to pour into texas.
texas politicians hoped that joining the united states would help solve the republic s financial and military problems.
the texas congress approved annexation in june 1845.
texas became part of the united states in december.
this action angered the mexican government which considered texas to be a stolen province.
the mexican borderlands though it had lost texas mexico still had settlements in other areas of the present day southwest to govern.
new mexico with its capital at santa fe was the oldest settled area and had the most people.
mexico also had settlements in present day arizona nevada and california.
during early spanish rule the mission system had dominated much of the present day american southwest.
over time it had become less important there especially in history close up new mexico where settlers lived in small villages.
in california however missions remained the focus of everyday life.
missions under later spanish rule carried out huge farming and ranching operations using the labor of native americans.
some of the indians came willingly to the missions.
others were brought by force.
usually they were not allowed to leave the mission once they had arrived.
they had to adopt the clothing food and religion of the spaniards.
as a result some native american groups moved and settled in different areas to avoid being controlled by the missions.
one effect of these migrations was more conflicts over land.
missions often sold their goods to local pueblos or towns that arose near the missions and presidios.
one wealthy california settler mariano guadalupe vallejo remembered the early days.
we were the pioneers of the pacific coast building towns and missions while general george washington was carrying on the war of the revolution mariano guadalupe vallejo quoted in eyewitnesses and others ranch life spanish and mexican vaqueros or cowboys were expert horse riders.
they used their horses to herd cattle on the ranches of the spanish southwest.
after winning independence from spain in 1821 mexico began to change old spanish policies toward california and texas.
by the 1830s mexico ended the mission system in the region.
in california mission lands were broken up and huge grants were given to some of the wealthiest settlers including vallejo.
they created vast ranchos or ranches with tens of thousands of acres of land.
vaqueros or cowboys managed the large herds of cattle and sheep.
cowhides were so valuable that they were called california banknotes.
hides were traded for household items and luxury goods with ship captains from the eastern united states.
some settlers also made wine and grew citrus fruits.
although they had been freed from the missions for most california indians the elements of life changed very little.
they continued to herd animals and do much of the hard physical labor on ranches and farms.
some however ran away into the wilderness or to the nearby towns of san diego and los angeles.
the californios because of the great distance between california and the center of mexico s government by the early 1820s california had only around 3 200 colonists.
these early california settlers called californios felt little connection to their faraway government.
californios developed a lasting reputation for hospitality and skilled horse riding.
in two years before the mast american novelist richard henry dana jr wrote about his encounters with californio culture.
he described for example what happened after a californio served a feast to dana and a friend.
we took out some money and asked him how much we were to pay.
he shook his head and crossed himself saying that it was charity that the lord gave it to us.
richard henry dana jr from two years before the mast in addition to traders and travelers a small number of settlers also arrived from mariano guadalupe vallejo 1808 1890 mariano guadalupe vallejo was born to an influential californio family in monterey.
he joined the mexican army shortly after mexico s independence from spain.
he was soon put in charge of mexico s efforts to increase settlement in northern california.
vallejo eventually became the richest man in california owning enormous amounts of land and livestock.
he welcomed american rule of california believing it would result in self government for californios.
he eventually lost most of his wealth fighting anglos who claimed his land.
vallejo served at the state constitutional convention as well as in the first state senate.
analyzing why did vallejo encourage american rule of california.

they were called anglos by the californios.
although there were few anglo settlers in california their calls for independence increased tensions between mexico and the united states.

academic vocabulary element a basic part of an individual s surroundings mexican american war diplomatic relations between mexico and the united states became increasingly strained.
u s involvement in california and texas contributed to this tension.
conflict breaks out mexico had long insisted that its northern border lay along the nueces river and refused to accept the u s annexation of texas.
the united states said the border was farther south along the rio grande.
in june 1845 president polk ordered general zachary taylor to lead an army into the disputed region.
expanding west 35 polk sent diplomat john slidell to mexico city to try to settle the border dispute.
slidell came with an offer to buy new mexico and california for 30 million.
mexican officials refused to speak to him.
in march 1846 general taylor led his troops to the rio grande.
he camped across from mexican forces stationed near the town of matamoros mexico.
in april the mexican commander told taylor to withdraw from mexican territory.
taylor refused.
the two sides clashed and several u s soldiers were killed.
in response polk said to congress mexico has passed the boundary of the united states has invaded our territory and shed american blood upon the american soil the two nations are now at war k polk from his address to congress may 11 1846 polk s war message was persuasive.
two days later congress declared war on mexico.
war begins at the beginning of the war with mexico the u s army had better weapons and equipment.
yet it was greatly outnumbered and poorly prepared.
the government put out a call for 50 000 volunteers.
about 200 000 responded.
many were young men who thought the war would be a grand adventure in a foreign land.
on the home front many americans supported the war.
however many whigs thought the war was unjustified and avoidable.
northern abolitionists also opposed the conflict.
they feared the spread of slavery into southwestern lands.
while americans debated the war fighting proceeded.
general taylor s soldiers won battles south of the nueces river.
taylor then crossed the rio grande and occupied matamoros mexico.
while taylor waited for more men polk ordered general stephen kearny to attack new mexico.
on august 18 1846 kearny took santa fe the capital city without a fight.
he claimed the entire province of new mexico for the united states and marched west to california where another conflict with mexico was already under way.
the bear flag revolt in 1846 only about 500 americans lived in the huge province of california in contrast to about 12 000 californios.
yet in the spirit of manifest destiny a small group of american settlers seized the town of sonoma north of san francisco on june 14.
hostilities began between the two sides when the americans took some horses that were intended for the mexican militia.
in what became known as the bear flag revolt the americans declared california to be an independent nation.
above the town the rebels hoisted a hastily made flag of a grizzly bear facing a red star.
californios laughed at the roughly made bear thinking it looked more like a pig than a bear.
john c fremont a u s army captain was leading a mapping expedition across the sierra nevada when he heard of the possible war with mexico.
fremont went to sonoma and quickly joined the american settlers in their revolt against the californios.
because war had already broken out between the united states and mexico fremont s actions were seen as beneficial to the american cause in the region.
his stated goal however was californian independence not to annex california to the united states.
during the revolt several important californios were taken prisoner including mariano vallejo.
governor vallejo and his brother were held at an anglo settlement for two months without any formal charges being brought against them.
long after his release vallejo wrote a history of california that included an account of his time as a bear flag prisoner.
but the bear flag was quick to fall.
in july u s naval forces came ashore in california and raised the stars and stripes.
kearny s army arrived from the east.
the towns of san diego los angeles and san francisco fell rapidly.
in august u s navy commodore robert stockton claimed california for the united states.

360 chapter 11 american settlement in the mexican cession the war ended after scott took mexico city.
in february 1848 the united states and mexico signed the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo which officially ended the war and forced mexico to turn over much of its northern territory to the united states.
known as the mexican cession this land included the present day states of california nevada and utah.
in addition it included most of arizona and new mexico and parts of colorado and wyoming.
the united states also won the area claimed by texas north of the rio grande.
the mexican cession totaled more than 500 000 square miles and increased the size of the united states by almost 25 percent.
agreements and payments in exchange for this vast territory the united states agreed to pay mexico 15 million.
in addition the united states assumed claims of more than 3 million held by american citizens against the mexican government.
the treaty also addressed the status of mexicans in the mexican cession.
the treaty provided that they would be protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secured in the free exercise of their religion.
the senate passed the treaty in march 1848.
after the war with mexico some americans wanted to guarantee that any southern railroad to california would be built completely on american soil.
james gadsden u s minister to mexico negotiated an important agreement with mexico in december 1853.
under the terms of the gadsden purchase the u s government paid mexico 10 million.
in exchange the united states received the southern parts of what are now arizona and new mexico.
with this purchase the existing boundary with mexico was finally fixed.
surge of american settlers after the mexican american war a flood of americans moved to the southwest.
american newcomers struggled against longtime residents to control the land and other valuable resources such as water and minerals.
most mexicans mexican americans and native americans faced legal economic and social discrimination.
as a result they found it difficult to protect their rights.
the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo promised to protect mexican american residents property rights.
yet differences between mexican and u s land laws led to great confusion.
the u s government often made mexican american landowners go to court to prove that they had titles to their land.
landowners had to pay their own travel costs as well as those of witnesses and interpreters.
they also had to pay attorneys and interpreters fees.
these legal battles often bankrupted land owners.
new settlers also tended to ignore mexican legal concepts such as community property or community water rights.

white settlers also battled with american indians over property rights.
in some areas new white settlers outnumbered native americans.
anglo settlers often tried to take control of valuable water resources and grazing lands.
in addition settlers rarely respected indian holy places.
native american peoples such as the navajo and the apache tried to protect their land and livestock from the settlers.
indians and settlers alike attacked one another to protect their interests.
cultural encounters despite conflicts different cultures shaped one another in the southwest.
in settlements with large mexican populations laws were often printed in both english and spanish.
names of places such as san antonio san diego and santa barbara show hispanic heritage.
other place names such as taos and tesuque are derived from native american words.
communities throughout the southwest regularly celebrated both mexican and american holidays.
mexican and native american knowledge and traditions also shaped many local economies.
mexican americans taught anglo settlers about mining in the mountains.
many ranching communities were first started by mexican settlers.
they also introduced new types of saddles and other equipment to american ranchers.
adobe developed by the anasazi indians was adopted from the pueblo people by the spanish.
it is still commonly used by american residents in new mexico arizona and california.
362 chapter 11 trade also changed the southwest.
for example the navajo created handwo ven woolen blankets to sell to americans.
americans in turn brought manufactured goods and money to the southwest.
due to exchanges like these the economies of many mexican american and native american communities in the southwest began to change.
water rights eastern water use laws commonly required owners whose land bordered streams or rivers to maintain a free flow of water.
these restrictions generally prevented landowners from constructing dams because doing so would infringe upon the water rights of neighbors downstream.
in the typically dry climate of the west large scale agriculture was not possible without irrigation.
dams and canals were required to direct scarce water to fields.
this need conflicted with the accepted eastern tradition of equal access to water.
brigham young established a strict code regulating water rights for the mormon community.
in any dispute over water use the good of the community would outweigh the interests of individuals.
young s approach stood as an example for modem water laws throughout the west.

discovery of gold brings settlers in the 1830s and 1840s americans who wanted to move to california started up the oregon trail.
at the snake river in present day idaho the trail split.
people bound for california took the southern route which became known as the california trail.
this path ran through the sierra nevada mountain range.
american emigrants and traders on the california trail tried to cross these mountains before the season s first snows.
although many americans traveled along the california trail few actually settled in california.
american merchants were usually more interested in trading goods made in factories than in establishing settlements.
they traded for gold and silver coins hides and tallow animal fat used to make soap and candles from mexico.
california became a meeting ground for traders from mexico and the united states.
before the mexican american war california s population consisted mostly of mexicans and native americans.
when mexico 364 chapter 11 controlled california mexican officials did not want many americans to settle there.
however in 1839 they did give swiss immigrant john sutter permission to start a colony.
sutter s fort located near the sacramento river soon became a popular rest stop for many american emigrants.
these new arrivals praised sutter s hospitality and helpfulness.
by the mid 1840s some anglo californians were publishing newspaper advertisements and guidebooks encouraging other settlers to move west.
the donner party was a group of western travelers who went to california but were stranded in the sierra nevada mountains during winter.
the party began its journey west in the spring of 1846.
trying to find a shortcut the group left the main trail and got lost.
when the donner party reached the sierra nevada mountains they became trapped by heavy snows.
they were stuck and had almost no food.
a rescue party found the starving and freezing group in february 1847.
of the original 87 travelers 42 had died.
gold in california in january 1848 sutter sent a carpenter named james marshall to build a sawmill beside a nearby river.
while working near sutter s mill marshall glanced at the ground.
i reached my hand down and picked it up it made my heart thump for i was certain it was gold.
sutter and marshall agreed to keep the discovery a secret.
however when they examined the work site the next day they met a spanish speaking native american worker holding a nugget and shouting oro gokl.
sutter s workers soon quit to search for gold.
stories of the discovery rapidly spread across the country.
president polk added to the national excitement by confirming the california gold strike in his farewell message to congress in december 1848.
in 1849 about 80 000 gold seekers came to california hoping to strike it rich.
these gold seeking migrants to california were called forty niners.

nearly 80 percent of the forty niners were americans while the rest came from all over the world.
most forty niners braved long and often dangerous journeys to reach california.
many easterners and europeans arrived via sea routes.
midwestern gold seekers usually traveled west in wagon trains.
most forty niners first arrived in san francisco.
this port town became a convenient trade center and stopping point for travelers.
as a result its population increased from around 800 in march 1848 to more than 25 000 by 1850.
staking a claim few of the forty niners had any previous gold mining experience.
the work was difficult and time consuming.
the forty niners would prospect or search for gold along the banks of streams or in shallow surface mines.
the early forty niners worked an area that ran for 70 miles along rivers in northern california.
the first person to arrive at a site would stake a claim.
early miners frequently banded together to prospect for gold.
the miners agreed that each would keep a share of whatever gold was discovered.
when one group abandoned a claim more recent arrivals often took it over hoping for success.
sometimes two or more groups arrived in an area at the same time.
in the early gold rush days before courts were established this competition often led to conflict.
occasionally violent disputes arose over competing claims.
mining methods varied according to the location.
the most popular method placer pla suhr mining was done along rivers and streams.
placer miners used pans or other devices to wash gold nuggets out of loose rock and gravel.
to reach gold deposits buried in 366 chapter 11 why might people leave their homes and travel long distances in search of gold.
the hills miners had to dig shafts and tunnels.
these tasks were usually pursued by mining companies rather than by individuals.
in 1853 california s yearly gold production peaked at more than 60 million.
individual success stories inspired many miners.
one lucky man found two and a half pounds of gold after only 15 minutes of work.
two african american miners found a rich gold deposit that became known as negro hill in honor of their discovery.
the vast majority of miners however did not become rich.
forty niner alonzo delano commented that the lean meager thin worn out and woebegone sorrowful miner might daily be seen at almost every point in the upper mines.
life in the mining camps mining camps sprang up wherever enough people gathered to look for gold.
these camps had colorful names such as hang town or poker flat.
miners in the camps came from many cultures and backgrounds.
most miners were young unmarried men in search of adventure.
only around 5 percent of gold rush immigrants were women or children.
the hardworking women generally made good money by cooking meals washing clothes and operating boardinghouses.
one such woman catherine haun recalled her first home in california.
we were glad to settle down and go housekeeping in a shed that was built in a day of lumber purchased with the first fee for neighbors we had a real live saloon.
i never have received more respectful attention than i did from these neighbors catherine haun quoted in ordinary americans edited by linda r monk haun s husband was a lawyer.
he concluded that he could make more money practicing law than he could panning for gold.
he was one of many people who made a good living supplying miners with food clothing equipment and other services.
miners paid high prices for basic necessities because the large amounts of gold in circulation caused severe inflation in california.
a loaf of bread for example might cost 5 cents in the east but it would sell for 50 to 75 cents in san francisco.
eggs sometimes sold for 1 apiece.
some settlers took full advantage of these conditions for free enterprise.
biddy mason and her family for instance had arrived in california as slaves.
a georgia slaveholder had brought them during the gold rush years.
mason quickly discovered that most californians opposed slavery particularly in the gold mines.
she and her family gained their freedom and moved to the small village of los angeles.
there she saved money until she could purchase some land.
over time mason s property increased in value from 250 to 200 000.
she became one of the wealthiest landowners in california a community leader and a well known supporter of charities.

immigrants to california the lure of gold in california attracted miners from around the world.
many were from countries that had seen few immigrants to the united states in the past.
they were drawn to california by the lure of wealth.
for example famine and economic hardship in southeastern china caused many chinese men to leave china for america.
most hoped to find great wealth and then return home to china.
these immigrants were known in chinese as gam saan haak or travelers to gold mountain.
between 1849 and 1853 about 24 000 chinese men moved to california.
from far and near we came and were pleased wrote merchant lai chun chuen in 1855.
chinese immigrants soon discovered that many americans did not welcome them however.
in 1852 california placed a high monthly tax on all foreign miners.
chinese miners had no choice but to pay this tax if they wanted to prospect for gold in california.
some chinese workers were the targets of violent attacks.
if the chinese miners dared to protest the attacks the legal system favored americans over immigrants.
despite such treatment many chinese immigrants still worked in the gold mines.
some looked for other jobs.
others opened their own businesses.
a newspaper reported chinese working as ploughmen laundry men placer miners woolen spinners and weavers domestic servants cigar makers and shoemakers.
in 1849 alone about 20 000 immigrants arrived in california not only from china but also from europe mexico and south america.
like most americans who sought gold these new arrivals intended to return home after they had made their fortunes.
however many decided to stay.
some began businesses.

the rich soil of california still supports one of the largest agricultural economies in the united states.
california faced an obstacle to growth though.
the state was isolated from the rest of the country.
it was difficult to bring in and ship out goods.
the answer to the isolation problem was to bring the railroad all the way to california.
californians would have to wait almost 20 years for that.

growth of the cotton industry if you were there you are a field worker on a cotton farm in the south in about 1800.
your job is to separate the seeds from the cotton fibers.
it is dull tiring work because the tiny seeds are tangled in the fibers.
sometimes it takes you a whole day just to clean one pound of cotton.
now you hear that someone has invented a machine that can clean cotton 50 times faster than by hand.
how might this machine change your life.
building background sectional differences had always existed between different regions of the united states.
the revolutionary changes in industry and transportation deepened the differences between north and south.
the south remained mainly agricultural.
new technology helped the region become the cotton kingdom.
reviving the south s economy before the american revolution three crops dominated southern agriculture tobacco rice and indigo.
these crops produced mostly by enslaved african americans played a central role in the southern economy and culture.
after the american revolution however prices for tobacco rice and indigo dropped.
when crop prices fell the demand for and the price of slaves also went down.
in an effort to protect their incomes many farmers tried with little success to grow other crops that needed less labor.
soon however cotton would transform the southern economy and greatly increase the demand for slave labor.
cotton becomes profitable cotton had been grown in the new world for centuries but it had not been a very profitable crop.
before cotton could be spun into thread for weaving into cloth the seeds had to be removed from the cotton fibers.
414 chapter 13 cotton gin connect to science and technology eli whitney s cotton gin enabled workers to easily remove seeds from cotton fibers.
the result was a dramatic increase in cotton production in the south.
how did the cotton gin remove seeds from cotton fibers.
o the operator turned the crank.
q the crank turned a roller with teeth that stripped the seeds away from the cotton fiber.
q brushes on a second roller lifted the seedless cotton off the teeth of the first cylinder and dropped it out of the machine.
a belt connected the rollers so that they would both turn when the crank was turned.
long staple cotton also called black seed cotton was fairly easy to process.
workers could pick the seeds from the cotton with relative ease.
but long staple cotton grew well in only a few places in the south.
more common was short staple cotton which was also known as green seed cotton.
removing the seeds from this cotton was difficult and time consuming.
a worker could spend an entire day picking the seeds from a single pound of short staple cotton.
by the early 1790s the demand for american cotton began increasing rapidly.
for instance in great britain new textile factories needed raw cotton that could be used for making cloth and american cotton producers could not keep up with the high demand for their cotton.
these producers of cotton needed a machine that could remove the seeds from the cotton more rapidly.
eli whitney s cotton gin northerner eli whitney finally patented such a machine in 1793.
the year before whitney had visited a georgia plantation owned by catherine greene where workers were using a machine that removed seeds from long staple cotton.
this machine did not work well on short staple cotton and greene asked whitney if he could improve it.
by the next spring whitney had perfected his design for the cotton gin a machine that removes seeds from short staple cotton.
gin is short for engine.
the cotton gin used a hand cranked cylinder with wire teeth to pull cotton fibers from the seeds.
the impact today the same patent law that protected whitney s invention of the cotton gin protects the rights of inventors today.
whitney hoped to keep the design of the gin a secret but the machine was so useful that his patent was often ignored by other manufacturers.
whitney described how his invention would improve the cotton business.
the south 4 one man will clean ten times as much cotton as he can in any other way before known and also clean it much better than in the usual mode method.
this machine may be turned by water or with a horse with the greatest ease and one man and a horse will do more than fifty men with the old machines eli whitney quoted in eli whitney and the birth of american technology by constance mclaughlin green whitney s gin revolutionized the cotton industry.
planters large scale farmers who held more than 20 slaves built cotton gins that could process tons of cotton much faster than hand processing.
a healthy crop almost guaranteed financial success because of high demand from the textile industry.
reading check drawing conclusions what effects did the cotton gin have on the southern economy.
the cotton boom whitney s invention of the cotton gin made cotton so profitable that southern fanners abandoned other crops in favor of growing cotton.
the removal of native americans opened up more land while the development of new types of cotton plants helped spread cotton production throughout the south as far west as texas.
this area of high cotton production became known as the cotton belt.
production increased rapidly from about 2 million pounds in 1791 to roughly a billion pounds by 1860.
as early as 1840 the united states was producing more than half of the cotton grown in the entire world.
the economic boom attracted new settlers built up wealth among wealthy white southerners and firmly put in place the institution of slavery in the south.
cotton belt cotton had many advantages as a cash crop.
it cost little to market.
unlike food staples harvested cotton could be stored for a long time.
because cotton was lighter than other staple crops it also cost less to transport long distances.
farmers eager to profit from growing cotton headed west to find land.
farmers also began to apply scientific methods to improve crop production.
cotton had one disadvantage as a crop it rapidly used up the nutrients in the soil.
after a few years cotton could make the land useless for growing anything.
some agricultural scientists recommended crop rotation changing the crop grown on a particular plot of land every few years.
different crops needed different nutrients so crop rotation would keep the land fertile longer.
other agricultural scientists began to study soil chemistry in an effort to keep the land rich and productive.
as the cotton belt grew farmers continued trying to improve the crop.
agricultural scientists worked at crossbreeding short staple cotton with other varieties.
as a result new stronger types of cotton were soon growing throughout the cotton belt.
this led to expansion of the cotton industry through the 1860s.
the cotton boom involved much more than growing and harvesting cotton.
harvested cotton had to be ginned pressed into bales and then shipped to market or to warehouses.
special agents helped do everything from marketing cotton to customers to insuring crops against loss or damage.
factories were built to produce items needed by cotton farmers such as ropes to bale cotton.
growing and harvesting cotton required many field hands.
rather than pay wages to free workers planters began to use more slave labor.
congress had made bringing slaves into the united states illegal in 1808.
however the growing demand for slaves led to an increase in the slave trade within the united states.
cotton trade in an 1858 speech before the u s senate south carolina politician james henry hammond declared cotton is king.
without cotton hammond claimed the global economy would fail.
he believed that southern cotton was one of the most valuable resources in the world.
southern cotton was used to make cloth in england and the north.
many southerners shared hammond s viewpoints about cotton.
southerner david christy declared king cotton is a profound leamed statesman and knows what measures will best sustain protect his throne.
the cotton boom made the south a major player in world trade.
great britain became the south s most valued foreign trading partner.
southerners also sold tons of cotton to the growing textile industry in the northeastern united states.
this increased trade led to the growth of major port cities in the south including charleston south carolina savannah georgia and new orleans louisiana.
in these cities crop brokers called factors managed the cotton trade.
farmers sold their cotton to merchants who then made deals with the factors.
merchants and factors also arranged loans for farmers who needed to buy supplies.
they often advised farmers on how to invest profits.
once farmers got their cotton to the port cities factors arranged for transportation aboard trading ships.
however shipping cotton by land to port cities was very difficult in the south.
the few major road projects at the time were limited to the southeast.
most southern farmers had to ship their goods on the region s rivers.
on the ohio and mississippi rivers flatboats and steamboats carried cotton and other products to port.
eventually hundreds of steamboats traveled up and down the mighty mississippi river each day.
identifying cause and effect what effect did the cotton boom have on the slave trade within the united states.
reading check the impact today almost half of the nation s largest ports are located in the south.
combined they ship more than a billion tons of cargo each year.
the south 41 i the south s cotton economy eli whitney s cotton gin began the cotton boom.
soon the cotton kingdom stretched across the south.
for the cotton planters to succeed they had to get their cotton to market.
enslaved african americans did most of the planting harvesting and processing of cotton.
other crops and industries some leaders worried that the south was depending too much on cotton.
they wanted southerners to try a variety of cash crops and investments.
these leaders wanted the south to become more self sufficient instead of relying on the north and foreign countries for basic items.
in addition to a more successful economy this kind of variety would make the south less susceptible to tariff policies.
academic vocabulary primary main most important food and cash crops one such crop was corn the primary southern food crop.
by the late 1830s the top three corn growing states in the nation were all in the south.
the south s other successful food crops included rice wheat and sugarcane.
production of tobacco the south s first major cash crop was very time consuming because tobacco leaves had to be cured or dried before they could be shipped to market.
in 1839 a slave discovered a way to improve the drying process.
the faster curing process increased tobacco production.
partly as a result of the cotton boom hemp and flax also became major cash crops.
their fibers were used to make rope and sackcloth used to bundle cotton into bales.
industry many of the first factories in the south were built to serve farmers needs by processing crops such as sugarcane.
in 1803 the nation s first steam powered sawmill was built in donaldsonville louisiana.
this new technology enabled lumber companies to cut sort and clean wood quickly.
by the 1840s entrepreneurs in georgia began investing in cotton mills.
in 1840 there were 14 cotton mills by the mid 1850s there were more than 50.
a few mill owners followed the model established by francis cabot lowell.
however most built small scale factories on the falls of a river for waterpower.
a few steam powered mills were built in towns without enough waterpower.
southerners such as hinton rowan helper encouraged industrial growth in the south.
we should keep pace with the progress of the age.
we must expand our energies and acquire habits of enterprise and industry we should rouse ourselves from the couch of lassitude laziness and inure set our minds to thought and our bodies to action hinton rowan helper the impending crisis of the south how to meet it 418 chapter 13 textile mills in great britain were the largest foreign buyers of southern cotton.
joseph r anderson followed helper s advice.
in 1848 anderson became the owner of the tredegar iron works in richmond virginia one of the most productive iron works in the nation.
it was the only factory to produce bridge materials cannons steam engines and other products.

use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the different segments of southern society.
southern society and culture popular fiction often made it seem that all white southerners had many slaves and lived on large plantations.
many fiction writers wrote about wealthy southern families who had frequent grand parties.
the ideal image of the antebellum before the war south included hospitality and well treated slaves on beautiful plantations that almost ran themselves.
this romantic view was far from the reality.
during the first half of the 1800s only about one third of white southern families had slaves.
fewer families had plantations.
despite their small numbers these planters had a powerful influence over the south.
the economy of the south was dependent on agriculture and most of the agricultural production relied on slave plantations.
many plantation owners served as political leaders.
they led a society made up of many different kinds of people including yeomen farmers poor whites slaves and free african americans.
each of these segments of society contributed to the economic success of the south.
420 chapter 13 planters as the wealthiest members of southern society planters also greatly influenced the economy.
some showed off their wealth by living in beautiful mansions.
many others chose to live more simply.
a visitor described wealthy planter alexander stephens s estate as an old wooden house surrounded by weeds.
some planters saved all of their money to buy more land and slaves.
male planters were primarily concerned with raising crops and supervising slave laborers.

this picture shows some of the more important buildings that were a part of the plantation system.
social duties of the family.
for example many southern leaders discussed political issues at the dances and dinners hosted by their wives.
planters often arranged their children s marriages based on business interests.
lucy breckinridge the daughter of a wealthy virginia planter was married by arrangement in 1865.
three years earlier she had described in her journal how she dreaded the very thought of marriage.
a woman s life after she is married unless there is an immense amount of love is nothing but suffering and hard work.
how breckinridge s life in her own arranged marriage would have turned out cannot be known.
she died of typhoid fever just months after her wedding.

the typical farm averaged 100 acres.
yeomen took great pride in their work.
in 1849 a young georgia man wrote i desire above all things to be a farmer.
it is the most honest upright and sure way of securing all the comforts of life.
yeoman families including women and children typically worked long days at a variety of tasks.
some yeomen held a few slaves but worked alongside them.
the poorest of white southerners lived on land that could not grow cash crops.
they survived by hunting fishing raising small gardens and doing odd jobs for money.
religion and society most white southerners shared similar religious beliefs.
because of the long distances between farms families often saw their neighbors only at church events such as revivals or socials.
rural women often played volunteer roles in their churches.
wealthy white southerners thought that their religion justified their position in society and the institution of slavery.
they argued that god created some people like themselves to rule others.
this belief opposed many northern christians belief that god was against slavery.
urban life many of the largest and most important cities in the south were strung along the atlantic coast and had begun as shipping centers.
although fewer in number the southern cities were similar to northern cities.
city governments built public water systems and provided well maintained streets.
public education was available in a few places.
wealthy residents occasionally gave large sums of money to charities such as orphanages and public libraries.
southern urban leaders wanted their cities to appear as modern as possible.
as on plantations slaves did much of the work in southern cities.
slaves worked as domestic servants in mills in shipyards and at skilled jobs.
many business leaders held slaves or hired them from nearby plantations.

this was true not only on large plantations but also on smaller farms and in the cities.

working at skilled jobs on larger plantations some enslaved african americans worked at skilled jobs such as blacksmithing or carpentry.
sometimes planters let these slaves sell their services to other people.
often planters collected a portion of what was earned but allowed slaves to keep the rest.

for example william ellison earned his freedom in south carolina by working for wages as a cotton gin maker.
for years he worked late at night and on sundays.
he bought his freedom with the money he earned.
eventually he was also able to buy the freedom of his wife and daughter.

life under slavery generally slaveholders viewed slaves as property not as people.
slaveholders bought and sold slaves to make a profit.
the most common method of sale was at an auction.
the auction itself determined whether families would be kept together or separated.
sometimes a buyer wanted a slave to fill a specific job such as heavy laborer carpenter or blacksmith.
the buyer might be willing to pay for the slave who could do the work but not for that slave s family.
families would then be separated with little hope of ever getting back together.
slave traders sometimes even kidnapped free african americans and then sold them into slavery.
for example solomon northup a free african american was kidnapped in washington d c.
he spent 12 years as a slave until he finally proved his identity and gained his release.
living conditions enslaved people often endured poor living conditions.
planters housed them in dirt floor cabins with few furnishings and often leaky roofs.
the clothing given to them was usually simple and made of cheap coarse fabric.
some slaves tried to brighten up their 424 chapter 13 the south academic vocabulary aspect part clothing by sewing on designs from discarded scraps of material.

some planters allowed slaves to keep their own gardens for vegetables and chickens for eggs.
other slaves were able to add a little variety to their diet by fishing or picking wild berries.
punishment and slave codes some planters offered more food or better living conditions to encourage slaves obedience.
however most slaveholders used punishment instead.
some would punish one slave in front of others as a warning to them all.

r 1 what different aspects of slavery are shown in these pictures.
enslaved parents kept their heritage alive by passing down family histories as well as african customs and traditions.
they also told folktales or stories with a moral to teach lessons about how to survive under slavery.
folktales often included a clever animal character called a trickster.
the trickster which often represented slaves defeated a stronger animal by outwitting it.
folktales reassured slaves that they could survive by outsmarting more powerful slaveholders.
religion religion also played an important part in slave culture.
by the early 1800s many slaves were christians.
they came to see themselves like the slaves in the old testament as god s chosen people much like the hebrew slaves in ancient egypt who had faith that they would someday live in freedom.
the impact today some slaves sang spirituals emotional christian songs that blended african and european music to express their religious beliefs.

there are three basic types of graphs.
line graphs and bargraphs plot changes in quantities over time.
bar graphs are also used to compare quantities within a category at a particular time.
pie charts have a similar use.
the circle represents the whole of something and the slices are a proportion of the whole.
being able to interpret charts and graphs accurately lets you see and understand some relationships more easily than in tables or in written explanations.

if you were there you live in a small pennsylvania town in the 1780s.
your father is a blacksmith but you earn money for the family too.
you raise sheep and spin their wool into yarn.
your sisters knit the yarn into warm wool gloves and mittens.
you sell your products to merchants in the city.
but now you hear that someone has invented machines that can spin thread and make cloth.
would you still be able to earn the same amount of money for your family.
i building background in the early 1700s making goods depend i ed on the hard work of humans and animals.
it had been that way for hundreds of years.
then new technology brought a change so radical that it is called a revolution.
it began in great britain and soon spread to j the united states.
j the industrial revolution at the beginning of the 1700s the majority of people in europe and the united states were farmers.
they made most of what they needed by hand.
for example female family members usually made clothing.
first they used a spinning wheel to spin raw materials such as cotton or wool into thread.
then they used a hand loom to weave the thread into cloth.
some families produced extra cloth to sell to merchants who sold it for a profit.
in towns a few skilled workers made goods by hand in their own shops.
these workers included blacksmiths carpenters and shoemakers.
their ways of life had stayed the same for generations.
a need for change by the mid 1700s however changes in great britain led to a greater demand for manufactured goods.
as agriculture and roads 384 chapter 12 after the thread was spun it moved to the loom to be woven into cloth.
workers called spoolers watched the looms and made sure that the spools of thread were improved cities and populations grew.
overseas trade also expanded.
traditional manufacturing methods did not produce enough goods to meet everyone s needs.
people began creating ways to use machines to make things more efficient.
these developments led to the industrial revolution a period of rapid growth in using machines for manufacturing and production that began in the mid 1700s.
textile industry the first important breakthrough of the industrial revolution took place in how textiles or cloth items were made.
before the industrial revolution spinning thread took much more time than making cloth.
several workers were needed to spin enough thread to supply a single weaver.
in 1769 englishman richard arkwright invented a large spinning machine called a water frame.
the water frame could produce dozens of cotton threads at the same time.
it lowered the cost of cotton cloth and increased the speed of textile production.
the water frame used flowing water as its source of power.
merchants began to build large textile mills or factories near rivers and streams.
the mills were filled with spinning machines.
merchants began hiring people to work in the mills.
additional improvements also speeded up the spinning process.
britain soon had the world s most productive textile manufacturing industry.
reading check academic vocabulary efficient productive and not wasteful drawing conclusions how did machines speed up textile manufacturing.
the north 31 new machines and processes new machines encouraged the rise of new processes in business and manufacturing.
as the machines used to make products became more efficient the processes involved changed dramatically.
slater and his secrets the new textile machines allowed great britain to produce cloth more quickly and inexpensively than other countries could.
to protect british industry the british parliament had made it illegal for skilled mechanics or machine plans to leave the country.
disguised as a farmer samuel slater a skilled british mechanic immigrated to the united states after carefully memorizing the designs of textile mill machines.
soon after arriving he sent a letter to moses brown who owned a textile business in new england.
slater claimed he could improve the way textiles were manufactured in the united states.
brown had one of his workers test slater s knowledge of machinery.
slater passed.
brown s son smith brown and son in law william almy formed a partnership with slater.
in 1793 they opened their first mill in pawtucket rhode island.
the production of cotton thread by american machines had begun.
slater ran the mill and the machinery.
he was confident that his new machines would work well.
if i do not make as good yarn as they do in england i will have nothing for my services but will throw the whole of what i have attempted over the bridge samuel slater quoted in the ingenious yankees by joseph and francis gies slater s machines worked and the pawtucket mill became a success.
slater s wife also invented a new cotton thread for sewing.
in 1798 slater formed his own company to build a mill.
by the time he died in 1835 he owned all or part of 13 textile mills.
other americans began building textile mills.
most were located in the northeast.
in new england in particular merchants had the money to invest in new mills.
more important this region had many rivers and streams that provided a reliable supply of power.
fewer mills were built in the south partly because investors in the south concentrated on expanding agriculture.
there agriculture was seen as an easier way to make money.
elements of mass production connect to economics mass production techniques allow manufacturers to efficiently create more goods for the marketplace.
mass production requires the use of interchangeable parts machine tools and the division of labor.
why are interchangeable parts important.
interchangeable parts eli whitney developed the idea of using interchangeable parts.
interchangeable or identical parts are needed so each part does not have to be custom made by hand.
386 chapter 12 a manufacturing breakthrough despite these great changes most manufacturing was still done by hand.
in the late 1790s the u s government worried about a possible war with france so it wanted more muskets for the army.
skilled workers made the parts for each weapon by hand.
no two parts were exactly alike and carefully fitting all the pieces together took much time and skill.
as a result american gun makers could not produce the muskets quickly enough to satisfy the government s demand.
factories needed better technology the tools used to produce items or to do work.
in 1798 inventor eli whitney tried to address some of these problems.
whitney gave officials a proposal for mass producing guns for the u s government using water powered machinery.
whitney explained the benefits of his ideas.
1 am persuaded that machinery moved by water and adapted to this business would greatly reduce the labor and facilitate ease the manufacture of this article.
eli whitney quoted in technology in america edited by carroll w pursell whitney also came up with the idea of using interchangeable parts parts of a machine that are identical.
using interchangeable parts made machines easier to assemble and broken parts easier to replace.
whitney promised to build 10 000 muskets in two years.
the federal government gave him money to build his factory and in 1801 whitney was called to washington d c to give a demonstration.
whitney stood before president john adams and his secretary of war.
he had an assortment of parts for 10 guns.
he then randomly chose parts and quickly assembled them into muskets.
to the audience s amazement he repeated the process several times.
whitney s influence whitney had proven that american inventors could improve upon the new british technology.
machines that produced matching parts soon became standard in industry.
interchangeable parts sped up mass production the efficient production of large numbers of identical goods.
reading check summarizing how did eli whitney influence american manufacturing.
the north 387 linking to today modern manufacturing the word manufacture comes from latin words that mean to make by hand.
yet in modern manufacturing machines not human hands do most of the work.
a key feature of modern manufacturing is the assembly line.
an assembly line is a long conveyer belt.
as the product moves along the belt or down the line workers assemble it.
often the workers use machines to help them.
on a growing number of assembly lines there are no workers at all the product is assembled by computer controlled robots.
although a far cry from eli whitney s factory modern factories use the same elements of mass production that whitney did more than 200 years ago.
how do interchangeable parts help the modern assembly line work.
manufacturing grows slowly despite the hard work of people such as samuel slater and eli whitney manufacturing in the united states grew slowly.
many businesspeople were eager to make their fortune in the new capitalist economy free from the restrictive british policies of the colonial era but there were several reasons it was difficult.
in 1810 secretary of the treasury albert gallatin suggested some reasons why there were so few factories in the united states.
the reasons include the superior attractions of agricultural pursuits farming the abundance of land compared with the population the high price of labor and the want lack of sufficient capital investment albert gallatin quoted in who built america.
by bruce levine et al.
gallatin and others believed that few people would choose to work in a factory if they could own their own farm instead.
in great britain on the other hand land was more scarce and more expensive than in the united states.
as a result fewer people were able to own farms.
british factory workers generally were willing to work for lower wages than factory workers in the united states were.
because british manufacturers had plenty of factory workers with technical skills they could produce large amounts of goods less expensively than most american businesses could.
as a result they could charge lower prices for the goods.
lower british prices made it difficult for many american manufacturers to compete with british companies.
this situation in turn discouraged american investors from spending the money needed to build new factories and machinery.
the new free market economy had not yet reached a balance between the needs of workers business owners and consumers that would result in a growing economy.
as a result only a few industries had found a place in the american economy.
these included cotton goods flour milling weapons and iron production.
these circumstances began to change around the time of the war of 1812.
since the 1790s wars between european powers had interfered with u s trade.
american customers were no longer able to get all the manufactured goods they were used to buying from 388 chapter 12 british and european manufacturers.
then during the war of 1812 british ships blockaded eastern seaports preventing foreign ships from delivering goods.
americans began to buy the items they needed from american manufacturers instead of from foreign suppliers.
as profits for american factories grew manufacturers began to spend more money expanding their factories.
state banks and private investors began to lend money to manufacturers for their businesses.
at the same time many americans began to realize that the united states had been relying too heavily on foreign goods.
if the united states could not meet its own needs it might be weak and open to attack.
former president thomas jefferson who had once opposed manufacturing changed his mind.
he too realized that the united states was too dependent on imports.
to be independent for the comforts of life we must fabricate make them ourselves.
we must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturalist farmer thomas jefferson from the writings of thomas jefferson edited by p l ford in february 1815 new yorkers celebrated the end of the war of 1812 and the return of free trade.
the streets were decorated and filled with merchants whose ships were loaded with goods.
with peace and commerce america prospers declared one display.
eager businesspeople prepared to lead the united states into a period of industrial growth.
they urged northern politicians to pass higher tariffs on foreign goods to protect american companies.
many southerners however feared that tariffs might harm their economy by making imported goods too expensive.

one dramatic change was the opportunity that factory work gave to young women.
for young women in farm families it was almost the only chance they had to earn their own money and a measure of independence.
taking notes s use the graphic organizer online to take notes on how mills changed workers lives and how workers organized to fight many of these changes.
mills change workers lives workers no longer needed the specific skills of craftspeople to run the machines of the new mills.
the lives of workers changed along with their jobs.
resistance to these changes sometimes sparked protests.
many mill owners in the united states could not find enough people to work in factories because other jobs were available.
at first samuel slater and his two partners used apprentices young men who worked for several years to learn the trade.
however they often were given only simple work.
for example their jobs might include feeding cotton into the machines and cleaning the mill equipment.
they grew tired of this work and frequently left.
apprentice james horton for example ran away from slater s mill.
mr slater keep me always at one thing horton complained.
i might have stayed there until this time and never knew nothing.
eventually slater began to hire entire families who moved to pawtucket to work in the mills.
this practice allowed slater to fill his labor needs at a low cost.
children as well as adults worked in the mills.
390 chapter 12 primary source newspaper advertisement family wanted this advertisement appeared in a massachusetts newspaper in 1823.
in it a company requests that families come to work at a factory.
the practice of hiring entire families was common at the time especially in britain.
in america it became known as the rhode island system.
the advertisement requests more than one family.
why do you think black stone wants large families.

three or four families of large size and good characters may find employment at blackstone manufactory.
stephen tripp dgcnt bfackstonc jmaniifacturiiig co mendon m v.
drawing conclusions do you think advertisements like this one had the effect the companies wanted.
analyzing primary sources on most farms children worked to help their families.
therefore few people complained about the hiring of children to work in factories.
h humphrey an author of books on raising children told parents that children needed to be useful.
humphrey wrote if he a child will not study put him on to a farm or send him into the shop or in some other way provide regular employment for him.
the machines made many tasks in the mill simple enough for children to do.
mill owners profited because they paid children low wages.
adults usually earned as much in a day as most children did in a week.
to attract families to his mill slater built housing for the workers.
he also provided them with a company store where they could buy necessities.
in addition he started the practice of paying workers with credit at the company store.
instead of paying the full price for an item all at once small payments could be made over a period of time.
this practice allowed slater to reinvest his money in his business.
slater s strategy of hiring families and dividing factory work into simple tasks became known as the rhode island system.
mill owners throughout the northeast copied slater s methods.
owners advertised with men with growing families wanted.
they also sent recruiters to poor communities to find new workers.
for many people the chance to work in a factory was a welcome opportunity to earn money and to learn a new skill.
one of the earliest of the mill towns slatersville was named after samuel slater.
the town was built by slater and his brother john.
it included two houses for workers and their families the owner s house the company store and the slatersville mill.
the mill was the largest and most modem industrial building of its time.
the mills employed not only the textile workers who operated the machinery but also machine part makers and dam builders.
although the company store sold food and necessary items to workers mill towns supported the same variety of businesses any other town needed to thrive.
these included tailors and dressmakers butchers and other small workshops.
summarizing what problem did slater have in his mills and how did he solve it.
reading check the north 39 the lowell system not all mill owners followed this system.
francis cabot lowell a businessman from new england developed a very different approach.
his ideas completely changed the textile industry in the northeast.
the lowell system was based on water powered textile mills that employed young unmarried women from local farms.
the system included a loom that could both spin thread and weave cloth in the same mill.
lowell constructed boardinghouses for the women.
boardinghouse residents were given a room and meals along with their jobs.
with financial support from investors of the boston manufacturing company lowell s first textile mill opened in waltham massachusetts in 1814.
from the first starting of the first power loom there was not doubt about the success wrote one investor.
in 1822 the company built a larger mill in a massachusetts town later named lowell.
visitors to lowell were amazed by the clean factories and neatly kept boardinghouses as well as the new machinery.
the young millworkers soon became known as lowell girls.
the mills paid them between 2 and 4 each week.
the workers paid 1 25 for room and board.
these wages were much better than those women could earn per week in other available jobs such as domestic work.
many young women came to lowell from across new england.
they wanted the chance to earn money instead of working on the family farm.
i must of course have something of my own before many more years have passed over my head wrote one young woman.
the typical lowell girl worked at the mills for about four years.
unlike other factory workers the lowell girls were encouraged to use their free time to take classes and form women s clubs.
they even wrote their own magazine the lowell offering.
lucy larcom who started working at lowell at age 11 later praised her fellow workers.
lii tfgb no record exists today of the name of this girl who worked in a mill around 1850.
judging from the photograph if she were in school today she would probably be in the seventh or eighth grade.

visitors to the mill routinely referred to the sound of the machines as deafening.
girls had to keep their hair pulled back so it did not get caught in the machines resulting in serious injury or death.
this girl is straightening threads as they enter the power loom a job that cut her hands.
is windows were rarely opened to prevent air from blowing the threads.
the result is a hot stuffy room.
the air is dirty and causes breathing problems.
one visitor remarked the atmosphere is charged with cotton filaments and dust which are very injurious to the lungs.
analyzing visuals judging from the photograph on page 392 what might be the condition of the girl s hands in this illustration.
the north 393 392 chapter 12 primary source magazine article sarah g bagley and workers rights lowell girl sarah g bagley wrote magazine articles and made speeches about working in the mills.
she organized workers to help change conditions.
bagley says that mill girls work to help their family members.
bagley believes that most mill girls would leave their jobs if they could.
is anyone such a fool as to suppose that out of six thousand factory girls in lowell sixty would be there if they could help it.
whenever i raise the point that it is immoral to shut us up in a close room twelve hours a day in the most monotonous and tedious of employment i am told that we have come to the mills voluntarily and we can leave when we will.
voluntarily.
the whip which brings us to lowell is necessity.
we must have money a father s debts are to be paid an aged mother to be supported a brother s ambition to be aided and so the factories are supplied.
is this to act from free will.
is this freedom.
to my mind it is slavery analysis skilli analyzing primary sources how did bagley view the idea that workers must endure poor conditions.
g bagley quoted in the belles of new england the women of the textile mills and the families whose wealth they wove by william moran 1 regard it as one of the privileges advantages of my youth that i grew up among those active interesting girls whose lives had principle ideals and purpose distinctly their own.
lucy larcom from a new england girlhood mill life was hard however.
the work day was between 12 and 14 hours long and daily life was carefully controlled.
ringing bells ordered workers to breakfast or lunch.
employees had to work harder and faster to keep up with new equipment.
cotton dust also began to cause health problems such as chronic cough for workers.
the impact today reading check.
in the 1950s labor union membership reached its peak about 40 percent of the workforce belonged to unions.
today only about 11 percent of the working population belongs to a labor union.
contrasting how was the lowell system different from the rhode island system.
workers organize factories continued to spread in the 1800s.
craftspeople who made goods by hand felt threatened.
factories quickly produced low priced goods.
to compete with factories shop owners had to hire more workers and pay them less.
shoemaker william frazier complained about the situation in the mid 1840s.
we have to sit on our seats from twelve to sixteen hours per day to earn one dollar.
the wages of factory workers also went down as people competed for jobs.
a wave of immigration in the 1840s brought people from other poorer countries.
they were willing to work for low pay.
more immigrants came to the northeast where the mills were located than to the south.
competition for jobs also came from people unemployed during the financial panic of 1837.
for example about 50 000 workers in new york city alone lost their jobs.
the beginning of trade unions facing low wages and the fear of losing their jobs skilled workers formed trade unions groups that tried to improve pay and working conditions.
eventually unskilled factory workers also formed trade unions.
most employers did not want to hire union workers.
employers believed that the higher cost of union employees prevented competition with other manufacturers.
sometimes labor unions staged protests called strikes.
workers on strike refuse to work until employers meet their demands.
most early strikes were not successful however.
courts and police usually supported companies not striking union members.
394 chapter 12 labor reform efforts a strong voice in the union movement was that of millworker sarah g bagley.
she founded the lowell female labor reform association in 1844 and publicized the struggles of factory laborers.
the association s two main goals were to influence an investigation of working conditions by the massachusetts state legislature and to obtain a 10 hour workday.
members of the association passed out pamphlets and circulated petitions.
president martin van buren had granted a 10 hour workday in 1840 for many federal employees.
bagley wanted this rule to apply to employees of private businesses.
these men and women often worked 12 to 14 hours per day six days per week.
many working men and women supported the 10 hour workday campaign despite the opposition of business owners.
in 1845 sarah bagley was elected vice president of the new england working men s association.
she was the first woman to hold such a high ranking position in the american labor movement.
over time the unions achieved some concrete legal victories.
connecticut maine new hampshire ohio pennsylvania and a few other states passed 10 hour workday laws.
for factory workers in other states long hours remained common.
one witness described how children were summoned by the factory bell before daylight and worked until eight o clock at night with nothing but a recess of forty five minutes to get their dinner.
union supporters continued to fight for work reforms such as an end to child labor in factories during the 1800s.

these improvements were made possible largely by the invention of two new forms of transportation the steamboat and steam powered trains.
they enabled goods people and information to travel rapidly and efficiently across the united states.
suddenly people across the nation could buy manufactured items and even food products unavailable to them before.
this boosted industry and agriculture which created a need for more labor.
in the north this meant that more people could find jobs in factories.
in the south slavery became even more important to support the 396 chapter 12 economy.
steam powered ships soon connected the united states with european mar kets spurring the economy even more.
reading check finding main ideas what benefits did the transportation revolution bring to trade and daily life.
steamboats american and european inventors had developed steam powered boats in the late 1700s.
however they were not in wide use until the early 1800s.
steamboat era in 1803 american robert fulton tested his first steamboat design in france.
several years later he tested the first full sized commercial steamboat called the clermont in the united states.
on august 9 1807 the clermont traveled against the current up the hudson river without trouble.
demand for steamboat ferry service soon arose.
the steamboat was well suited for river travel.
it could move upriver and did not rely on wind power.
steamboats increased trade and profits because goods could be moved quickly and thus more cheaply.
more than 500 steamboats were in use in the united states by 1840.
by the 1850s steamboats were also being used to carry people and goods across the atlantic ocean.
gibbons v ogden increased steamboat shipping led to conflict over waterway rights.
in 1819 aaron ogden sued thomas gibbons for operating steamboats in new york waters that ogden said he owned.
gibbons did not have a license to operate in new york but argued that his federal license gave him the right to use new york waterways.
in the case of gibbons v ogden which reached the supreme court in 1824 the court reinforced the federal government s authority to regulate trade between the states by ending monopolistic control over waterways in several states.
the ruling freed up waters to even greater trade and shipping.
almost the north 3.
overnight there were many more shipping companies traveling the waterways.
competition between the businesses brought prices down and more people could afford to buy the products brought to their local markets.

american railroads o history video wild west tech train tech.
what the steamboat did for water travel the train did for overland travel.
steam powered trains had first been developed in great britain in the early 1800s.
however they did not become popular in the united states until the 1830s.
in 1830 peter cooper built a small but powerful locomotive called the tom thumb.
he raced the locomotive against a horse drawn railcar.
eyewitness john latrobe later described the race in which tom thumb had a slow start and fell behind.
latrobe wrote the pace increased the passengers shouted the engine gained on the horse then the engine passes the horse and a great hurrah hailed the victory.
unfortunately for coo per victory was spoiled when tom thumb broke down and lost the race near the end.
despite the defeat the contest showed the power and speed of even a small locomotive.
railroad fever soon spread.
by 1840 railroad companies had laid about 2 800 miles of track more than existed in all of europe.
french economist michel chevalier described americans as having a perfect passion for railroads.
as more railroads were built engineers and mechanics overcame many tough challenges.
most british railroads for example ran on straight tracks across flat ground.
in the united states however many railroads had to run up and down steep mountains around tight curves and over swift rivers.
railroad companies also built the tracks quickly and often with the least expensive materials available.
as time went on engineers and mechanics built heavier faster and more powerful steam locomotives.
by 1860 about 30 000 miles of railroad linked almost every major city in the eastern united states.
as a result the economy surged forward.
for example american loco the steam train connect to science and technology boiling water produces steam which pushes pistons back and forth in a steam engine.
these pistons are connected to rods that rotate the wheels of the locomotive.
why does the train have a firebox.
as steam follows the path of the white arrows into the cylinder the pressure pushes the piston in the direction of the large blue arrow.
connecting rods turn the wheel half a turn.
q when the small valve rod moves the other valve is blocked pushing steam into the other side of the cylinder.
the pressure moves the piston in the direction of the large blue arrow and the wheel completes a turn.
398 chapter 12 motives hauled more freight than those in any other country.
the railroad companies quickly became some of the most powerful businesses in the nation.
as the railroad system grew manufacturers and farmers could send their goods to distant markets.
in addition to their tremendous economic impact the railroads made a powerful impression on the senses of passengers and observers.
trains were the fastest form of transportation most people had ever experienced.
while wagons often traveled less than 2 miles per hour locomotives averaged about 20 miles per hour.
writer george templeton strong of new york city described the thrill of a steam train passing by in the night whizzing and rattling and panting with its fiery furnace gleaming in front its chimney vomiting fiery smoke above and its long train of cars rushing along behind like the body and tail of a gigantic dragon and all darting forward at the rate of twenty miles an hour.
whewl george templeton strong quoted in the market revolution by charles sellers riding on the early trains was often an adventure but it could also be quite dangerous.
engineers trying to stay on time sometimes traveled too fast.
english citizen charles richard weld was on a railroad car that flew off the tracks.
to his amazement the other passengers did not complain about the accident.
instead they praised the engineer for trying to keep on schedule.
passengers accepted such risks because the railroads reduced travel time dramatically.
railroads also helped tie communities together.
in 1847 senator daniel webster spoke for many people in the united states when he declared that the railroad towers above all other inventions of this or the preceding age.
the impact today in 1883 four standard time zones were introduced in the united states to help railroads offer uniform train schedules.
today travelers might cross one or more time zones in a single airplane flight.

steamboats and railroads made getting goods to distant markets much easier and less costly.
international markets expanded and europe began to rely on southern cotton for its textile industry.
people in all areas of the nation now had access to products made and grown far away.
more than ever before there was a national economy.
the wealth however was centered in the north.
the structure of the economy adjusted with the increase in availability of goods.
the relationship between customers business owners and workers changed as people had more money to buy an increased selection of items.
both factory and agricultural workers were able to call for higher wages.
railroads contributed to the expansion of the borders of the nation and guided population growth.
towns sprang up at railroad junctions.
those towns that did not have railroads nearby suffered.
cities grew as trains brought new residents and raw materials for industry and construction.
the growing prosperity of the nation especially in the north encouraged americans to take pride in their country.
a new fuel the transportation revolution also increased the use of certain natural resources that had not been important until then.
throughout the early transportation revolution wood was the primary source of fuel for trains and steamboats as well as for cooking light and heat.
as faster locomotives were built coal replaced wood as the main source of power.
a half ton of coal produces as much energy as two tons of wood but at half the cost.
coal also became popular for heating homes.
railroads transported the coal from mines to towns and cities.
400 chapter 12 as the demand for coal increased a coalmining industry developed in many states including pennsylvania western virginia and illinois.
coal mining changed the landscape in a number of ways.
new towns such as coal city and carbondale in illinois sprang up in places where coal deposits could be mined.
miners made deep gashes in the earth removing the coal.
later in the 1870s the demand for coal increased as the demand for steel grew.
steel is made through a smelting process heating iron ore to very high temperatures.
coal was used to fire the furnaces.
steel which is much stronger than iron was increasingly used to build factories and the machines they produced.
steel was also used to make the rails that trains ride on.
the growing market for steel helped fuel the need for more railroads.
railroads transported steel to places where new factories were being built.
railroads also brought new steel farming tools and machines to farmers in the midwest.
using the new equipment farmers produced more crops.
railroads then transported their harvests to markets.
effects of railroads the railroads also played a role in the growth of other businesses.
the logging industry expanded as people in the growing towns and cities needed wood for houses and furniture.
lumber items became the primary product of new england.
settlers spreading out across the midwest cut down trees and plowed up prairies to make farmland.
deforestation or cutting down and removing trees took place on a large scale.
railroads also caused cities to grow.
some cities became transportation hubs.
chicago was one such city.
its location on lake michigan made it an ideal transportation hub linking the midwest to the east and south.

time line 402 chapter 12 the telegraph sent pulses or surges of electric current through a wire.
the telegraph operator tapped a bar that controlled the length of each pulse.
at the other end of the wire these pulses were changed into clicking sounds.
a short click was called a dot.
a long click was called a dash.
morse s partner alfred lewis vail developed a system known as morse code different combinations of dots and dashes that represent each letter of the alphabet.
for example dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot is the distress signal called sos.
several years passed before morse was able to connect two locations with telegraph wires.
people doubted his machine.
some did not think that he was reading messages sent from miles away.
morse s break came during the 1844 democratic national convention.
a telegraph wired news of the presidential candidate s nomination to politicians in washington.
the waiting politicians responded three cheers for the telegraph.
telegraphs were soon sending and receiving information for businesses the government newspapers and private citizens.
the telegraph grew with the railroad.
telegraph companies strung their wires on poles along railroads across the country.
they established telegraph offices in many train stations.
thousands of miles of telegraph line were added every year in the 1850s.
the first transcontinental line was finished samuel f b morse 1791 1872 like steamboat creator robert fulton samuel f b morse began his career as a painter rather than as an inventor.
in 1832 morse was a widower struggling to raise his three children alone.
he became interested in the idea of sending messages electrically.
morse hoped he could invent a device that would earn enough to support his family.
eventually the telegraph made morse extremely wealthy.

by the time he died in 1872 morse was famous across the united states.
with the spread of telegraph lines people could relay information and news more quickly.
the economy of the nation became even more unified as businesses used the telegraph to conduct financial transactions with distant partners.

steam powered factories during the industrial revolution factories began to rely on steam power instead of waterpower.
this shift brought major changes to the nation s industries.
water powered factories had to be built near streams or waterfalls.
in contrast steam power allowed business owners to build factories almost anywhere.
yet the northeast was still home to most of the nation s industry.
by 1860 new england alone had as many factories as the entire south did.
some companies decided to build their factories closer to cities and transportation centers.
this provided easier access to workers allowing businesses to lower wages.
being closer to cities also reduced shipping costs.
cities soon became the center of industrial growth.
people from rural areas and foreign countries flocked to the cities for jobs.
factory workers improved the designs of many kinds of machines.
mechanics invented tools that could cut and shape metal stone and wood with great precision.
by the 1840s this new machinery was able to produce interchangeable parts.
within a short period of time the growing machine tool industry was even making customized equipment.
new businesses were also aided by government policies that favored free trade.
there was little regulation of businesses and taxes were designed to benefit business owners.
many americans supported these governmental policies because they want reading check.
ed to benefit from the growing economy themselves.
thousands of new businesses were established many to market the new inventions that were being introduced every day.
although these businesses often failed they spurred technological innovation and entrepreneurship.
finding main ideas what changes resulted from the shift to steam power.
improved farm equipment during the 1830s technology began transforming the farm as well as the factory.
in 1837 blacksmith john deere saw that friends in illinois had difficulty plowing thick soil with iron plows.
he thought a steel blade might work better.
his design for a steel plow was a success.
by 1846 deere was selling 1 000 plows per year.
in 1831 cyrus mccormick developed a new harvesting machine the mechanical reaper which quickly and efficiently cut down wheat.
he began mass producing his reapers in a chicago factory.
mccormick used new methods to encourage sales.
his company advertised gave demonstrations and provided a repair and spare parts department.
he also let customers buy on credit.
the combination of deere s plow and mccormick s reaper allowed midwestern farmers to plant and harvest huge crop fields.
by 1860 u s farmers were producing more than 170 million bushels of wheat and more than 800 million bushels of corn per year.

other advances improved on everyday items.
in the 1830s iceboxes cooled by large blocks of ice became available.
iceboxes stored fresh food safely for longer periods.
iron cookstoves began replacing cooking fires and stone hearths.

j gn north 409u ffl bias define the skill everyone has firmly held beliefs.
however when we let our beliefs automatically slant or shape our point of view on topics we may be showing bias.
bias is a fixed idea or opinion about someone or something.
some bias is based on a set of ideas about a group to which the person or thing belongs.
this type of bias is called a stereotype.
if the group is defined by race religion age gender or similar characteristics the bias is known as prejudice.
learn the skill not all beliefs are biases even if those beliefs are strongly held.
biases are beliefs that have little or no evidence to support them.
the more unreasonable a person s view is in light of facts and evidence the more likely it is that the belief is a bias.
another characteristic of bias is the person s reluctance to question his or her belief if it is challenged by evidence.
sometimes people stubbornly cling to views that overwhelming evidence proves wrong.
this is why bias is defined as a fixed idea or opinion.
one of the most damaging effects of bias and a good reason for trying to avoid it is that it can prevent us from learning new things.
bias sometimes appears in written oral and visual material.
authors may include bias accidentally or in order to sway people s opinions on a topic.
to recognize bias in a source you can follow the steps below.

anti immigration movements industrialization and the waves of people from europe greatly changed the american labor force.
while many immigrants went to the midwest to get farmland other immigrants filled the need for cheap labor in towns and cities.
industrial jobs in the northeast attracted many people.

some felt implicitly threatened by the new immigrants cultures and religions.
for example before catholic immigrants arrived most americans were protestants.
conflicts between catholics and protestants in europe caused american protestants to mistrust catholic immigrants.
those americans and others who opposed immigration were called nativists.

city life held other dangers.
as urban areas grew they became centers of criminal activity.

446 chapter 14 from little women by louisa may alcott 1832 1888 guided reading about the reading little women is a novel about four sisters living in a small new england town before the civil war.
still popular with young people today little women describes a family much like the one louisa may alcott grew up in.
alcott based the main character jo march on herself.
like alcott jo was different from most women of her time.
she was outspoken eager for adventure and in conflict with the role her society expected her to play.
as you read j try to understand how jo is different from aunt march.
jo happened to suit aunt march who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her.
the childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offended because her offer was declined.
the old lady wouldn t speak to them for a time but happening to meet jo at a friend s she proposed to take her for a companion.
o this did not suit jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to everyone s surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative.
i suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since uncle march died.
the dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cozy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her jo s ambition was to do something very splendid.
what it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn t read mn and ride as much as she liked.
a quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic.
but the training she received at aunt march s was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual josy phine.

new movements in amef ica 44 history and geography during the first half of the nineteenth century daily life changed dramatically because of new inventions scientific discoveries and technological advances.
these developments affected the way people interacted with each other and acquired the basics of life.
basic goods such as meat flour gloves clocks candles and soap began to be manufactured outside of the home and sold to distant markets.
specific cities sometimes became known for particular items.
the steamboats and railroads of the transportation revolution made these goods less expensive to ship and therefore less expensive to buy.
people across the nation began to have the same products leading to an increased sense that all americans had access to the same quality of products.
scientific discoveries the first use of anesthetics improved medical care.
before safe painkillers were developed many surgeries were impossible because of the severe pain they would cause.
the first use of an anesthetic occurred in 1842 during a dental extraction.
in 1844 the hypodermic syringe was invented leading to better treatment of a variety of illnesses.
changes in medical care brought about by scientific discoveries continue to today and they continue to improve daily life.
doctors today are able to perform organ transplants because of modern anesthetics leading to longer lives for many.

bding background along with changes in american culture i es were also taking place in american society.
a religious revival the country.
reform minded men and women tried to improve all aspects of society from schools to taverns.
reforms in education opened up new opportunities for young women.
ij second great awakening during the 1790s and early 1800s some americans took part in a christian renewal movement called the second great awakening.
it swept through towns across upstate new york and through the frontier regions of kentucky ohio tennessee and south carolina.
by the 1820s and 1830s this new interest in religion had spread to new england and the south.
charles grandison finney was one of the most important leaders of the second great awakening.
after experiencing a dramatic religious conversion in 1821 finney left his career as a lawyer and began preaching.
he challenged some traditional protestant beliefs telling congregations that each individual was responsible for his or her own salvation.
he also believed that sin was avoidable.
finney held revivals emotional prayer meetings that lasted for days.
many people converted to christianity during these revivals.
finney told new converts to prove their faith by doing good deeds.
finney s style of preaching and his ideas angered some traditional ministers like boston s lyman beecher.
beecher wanted to prevent finney from holding revivals in his city.
you mean to 448 chapter 14 carry a streak of fire to boston.
if you attempt it as the lord liveth i ll meet you.
and fight every inch of the way.
despite the opposition of beecher and other traditional ministers finney s appeal remained powerful.
also the first amendment guarantee of freedom of religion prevented the government from passing laws banning the new religious practices.
ministers were therefore free to spread their message of faith and salvation to whoever wished to listen.
due to the efforts of finney and his followers church membership across the country grew a great deal during the second great awakening.
many new church members were women and african americans.
the african methodist episcopal church spread across the middle atlantic states.
although the movement had begun in the northeast and on the frontier the second great awakening renewed some people s religious faith throughout america.
drawing conclusions what impact did the second great awakening have on religion in america.
reading check.
social reformers speak out renewed religious faith often led to movements to fix the problems of urban growth.
one solution was political action.
for example in 1844 new york city created the first city police force.
members of the growing middle class especially women often led the efforts.
many of the women did not work outside the home and hired servants to care for their households.
this gave them time to work in reform groups.
the 1830s to the 1850s were an era of many reform movements.
temperance movement many social reformers worked to prevent alcohol abuse.
they believed that americans drank too much.
in the 1830s on average an american consumed seven gallons of alcohol per year.
countless americans thought that alcohol abuse caused social problems such as family violence poverty and criminal behavior.
americans worries about the effects of alcohol led to the growth of a temperance movement.
this reform effort urged people to use self discipline to stop drinking hard liquor.
reform movements reform movements in america included religious meetings called revivals where preachers urged huge crowds of people to seek salvation.
the temperance movement an effort to convince people to avoid drinking alcohol promoted posters like the one shown here.
how might the scenes in this poster encourage people to stop drinking.
reformers asked people to limit themselves to beer and wine in small amounts.
groups like the american temperance society and the american temperance union helped to spread the message.
minister lyman beecher spoke widely about the evils of alcohol.
he claimed that people who drank alcohol were neglecting the education of their families and corrupting their morals.
the impact today mcguffey s readers were among the first graded textbooks.
organizing classes by grades was a new idea that is standard practice today.
prison reform another target of reform was the prison system.
dorothea dix was a middle class reformer who visited prisons throughout massachusetts beginning in 1841.
dix reported that mentally ill people frequently were jailed with criminals.
they were sometimes left in dark cells without clothes or heat and were chained to the walls and beaten.
dix spoke of what she saw to the state legislature.
in response the massachusetts government built facilities for the mentally ill dix s work had a nationwide effect.
eventually more than 100 state hospitals were built to give mentally ill people professional care.
prisons also held runaway children and orphans.
some had survived only by begging or stealing and they got the same punishment as adult criminals.
boston mayor josiah quincy asked that young offenders receive different punishments than adults.
in the 1820s several state and local governments founded reform schools for children who had been housed in prisons.
there children lived under strict rules and learned useful skills.
some reformers also tried to end the overcrowding and cruel conditions in prisons.
their efforts led to the creation of houses of correction.
these institutions did not use punishment alone to change behavior.
they also offered prisoners education.
reading check summarizing how did reformers change the punishment of criminals.
improvements in education another challenge facing america in the early 1800s was poor public education.
during this era childhood was beginning to be viewed as a separate stage of life in which education was of the utmost importance in creating responsible citizens.
however many children worked in factories or on farms to help support their families.
if children could read the bible write and do simple math that was often considered to be enough.
education in the early 1800s the availability of education varied widely.
new england had the most schools while the south and west had the fewest.
few teachers were trained.
schoolhouses were small and students of all ages and levels worked in one room.
mcguffey s readers were the most popular textbooks.
william holmes mcguffey an educator and minister put selections from british and american literature in them as well as instruction in moral and social values.
social background and wealth affected the quality of education.
rich families sent children to private schools or hired tutors.
however poor children had only public schools.
girls could go to school but parents usually thought that girls needed little education and kept them home.
therefore few girls learned to read.
common school movement people in the common school movement wanted all children taught in a common place regardless of background.
horace mann was a leader of this movement.
in 1837 mann became massachusetts s first secretary of education.
he convinced the state to double its school budget and raise teachers salaries.
he lengthened the school year and began the first school for teacher training.
mann s success set a standard for education reform throughout the country.

for example members of the press the clergy and even some male abolitionists criticized the grimke sisters.
these critics thought that the sisters should not give public speeches.

anthony led a campaign to change laws regarding the property rights of women.
she wrote in her diary that no woman could ever be free without a purse of her own.
after forming a network to cover the entire state of new york she collected more than 6 000 signatures to petition for a new property rights law.
in 1860 due largely to the efforts of anthony new york finally gave married women ownership of their wages and property.
other states in the northeast and midwest soon created similar laws.

new movements in america 4 elizabeth cady stanton wrote many of the documents and speeches of the movement which were often delivered by anthony.

social responsibility is the obligation that every person has to the societies in which he or she is a member.

few efforts to change society have everyone s support.
some people will want things to stay the same.
they may treat you badly if you work for change.
you must be prepared for this possibility if you decide to take action.
sometimes efforts to improve things involve opposing laws or rules that need to be changed.
no matter how just your cause is if you break law or rules you must be willing to accept the consequences of your behavior.
remember that violence is never an acceptable method for change.
people who use force in seeking change are not behaving in a socially responsible manner even if their cause is good.
this chapter was filled with the stories of socially responsible people.
many of them devoted their lives to changing society for the better.
some did so at great personal risk.
boston abolitionist william lloyd garrison barely escaped with his life from a local mob that tried to lynch him because of his views.

in the election of 1800 voters were also divided.
the election of 1800 in the presidential election of 1800 federalists john adams and charles c pinckney ran against democratic republicans thomas jefferson and aaron burr.
each party believed that the american republic s survival depended upon the success of their candidates.
with so much at stake the election was hotly contested.
unlike today candidates did not travel around giving speeches.
instead the candidates supporters made their arguments in letters and newspaper editorials.
adams s supporters claimed that jefferson was a pro french radical.
put jefferson in office they warned and the violence and chaos of the french revolution would surely follow in the united states.
plus federalists argued jefferson s interest in science and philosophy proved that he wanted to destroy organized religion.
democratic republican newspapers responded that adams wanted to crown himself king.
what else they asked could be the purpose of the alien and sedition acts.
republicans also hinted that adams would use the newly created permanent army to limit americans rights.

days went by as vote after vote was called each ending in ties.
exhausted lawmakers napped on the floor.

curious travelers looked with pride at the partially completed capitol building and at the executive mansion not yet called the white house.

on the morning of march 4 1801 he left the boardinghouse and walked to the capitol.

jefferson read his speech in a quiet voice.
he wanted to make it clear that he supported the will of the majority.
he also stressed the need for a limited government and the protection of civil liberties.
from these humble surroundings in which jefferson delivered his speech washington eventually grew into a large and impressive city.
over the years the capitol and the executive mansion were joined by other state buildings and monuments.
jefferson who had long dreamed of a new national capital that would be independent of the interests of any one state was pleased to be a part of this process of building a federal city.
jefferson in office president jefferson faced the task of putting his republican ideas into practice.
one of his first actions was to select the members of his cabinet.

marbury v madison although republicans controlled the presi dency and congress federalists dominated the federal judiciary.
in an effort to continue their control over the judiciary federalist legislators passed the judiciary act of 1801 shortly before their terms of office ended.
this act created 16 new federal judgeships that president adams filled with federalists before leaving office.
the republican press called these people midnight judges arguing that adams had packed the judiciary with academic federalists the night before he left office.
functions some of these appointments were made uses or purposes so late that the documents that authorized them had not been delivered by the time adams left office.
this led to controversy once jefferson took office.
william marbury named as a justice of the peace by president adams did not receive his documents before adams left office.
when jefferson took office marburydemandedthedocuments.
on jefferson s advice however the new secretary of state james madison refused to deliver them.
jefferson argued that the appointment of the midnight judges was not valid.
marbury v madison 1803 background of the case shortly before thomas jefferson took office john adams had appointed william marbury to be a justice of the peace.
adams had signed marbury s commission but it was never delivered.
marbury sued to force madison to give him the commission.
the court s ruling the court ruled that the law marbury based his claim on was unconstitutional.
the court s reasoning the judiciary act of 1789 gave the supreme court the authority to hear a wide variety of cases including those like marbury s.
but the supreme court ruled that congress did not have the power to make such a law.
because the constitution limits the types of cases the supreme court can hear.
thus the law was in conflict with the constitution and had to be struck down.
why it matters marburyv.
madison was important for several reasons.
it confirmed the supreme court s power to declare acts of congress unconstitutional.
by doing so it established the court as the final authority on the constitution.
this helped make the judicial branch of government equal to the other two branches.
chief justice john marshall and later federal judges would use this power of judicial review as a check on the legislative and executive branches.

madison affect the constitution s system of checks and balances.
the jefferson era 269 marbury brought suit asking the supreme court to order madison to deliver the papers.
marbury claimed that the judiciary act of 1789 gave the court the power to do so.
john marshall a federalist appointed by john adams was the chief justice of the court.
marshall and president jefferson disagreed about many political issues.
when marshall agreed to hear marbury s case jefferson protested saying that the federalists have retired into the judiciary as a stronghold.
marshall wrote the court s opinion in marbury v madison a case that helped establish the supreme court s power to check the power of the other branches of government.
the constitution marshall noted gave the court authority to hear only certain types of cases.
a request like marbury s was not one of them.
the law that marbury s case depended upon was therefore unconstitutional.
in denying marbury s request in this way the court avoided a direct confrontation with jefferson s administration.
but more impor john marshall tant it established the court s power of judicial review the power to declare an act of congress unconstitutional.
marshall and later federal judges would use this power to make the judiciary a much stronger part of the national government.
under marshall s leadership the court gained additional power by beginning to issue only one decision in a case.
in british courts each justice provided a separate decision.
the system of one decision gave the courts more authority.

one day at the trading post you see a poster calling for volunteers to join the corps of discovery this expedition will explore the vast region west of the mississippi river.
you think it would be exciting but dangerous.
you might never come home.

i building background as the 1800s began the united states i was expanding steadily westward.
more lands were opened and w settlers moved in to occupy them.
americans were also curious about the vast lands that lay farther west adventurous explorers organized expeditions to find out more about those lands.
american settlers move west by the early 1800s thousands of americans settled in the area between the appalachians and the mississippi river.
as the region s population grew kentucky tennessee and ohio were admitted to the union.
settlers in these states depended upon the mississippi and ohio rivers to move their products to eastern markets.
new orleans located at the mouth of the mississippi was a very important port.
its busy docks were filled with settlers farm products and valuable furs bought from american indians.
many of these cargoes were then sent to europe.
at the same time manufactured goods passed through the port on their way upriver.
as american dependence on the river grew jefferson began to worry that a foreign power might shut down access to new orleans.
there is on the globe one single spot the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy.
it is new orleans through which the produce of three eighths of our territory must pass to market thomas jefferson quoted in annals of america volume4 1797 1820 2 chapter 8 spain controlled both new orleans and louisiana.
this region stretched west from the mighty mississippi river to the great rocky mountains.
although spain owned louisiana spanish officials found it impossible to keep americans out of the territory.
you can t put doors on open country the foreign minister said in despair.
years of effort failed to improve spain s position.
under a secret treaty spain agreed to trade louisiana to france passing the problem on to someone else.
one spanish officer expressed his relief.
i can hardly wait to leave them the americans behind me he said.
analyzing information why was new orleans important to settlers in the western regions of the united states.
reading check louisiana in 1802 just before handing over louisiana to france spain closed new orleans to american shipping.
angry farmers worried about what this would do to the economy.
president jefferson asked the u s ambassador to france robert r livingston to try to buy new orleans.
jefferson sent james monroe to help livingston.
napoleon and louisiana france was led by napoleon nuh poh lee uhn bonaparte a powerful ruler who had conquered most of europe.
he wished to rebuild france s empire in north america.
napoleon s strategy was to use the french colony of haiti in the caribbean as a supply the jefferson era 273 base.
from there he could send troops to louisiana.
however enslaved africans had revolted and freed themselves from french rule.
napoleon sent troops to try to regain control of the island but they were defeated in 1802.
this defeat ended his hopes of rebuilding a north american empire.
jefferson buys louisiana the american ambassador got a surprising offer during his negotiations with french foreign minister charles talleyrand.
when the americans tried to buy new orleans talleyrand offered to sell all of louisiana.
with his hopes for a north american empire dashed napoleon had turned his attention back to europe.
france was at war with great britain and napoleon needed money for military supplies.
he also hoped that a larger united states would challenge british power.
livingston and monroe knew a bargain when they saw one.
they quickly accepted the french offer to sell louisiana for 15 million.
the news pleased jefferson.
but as a strict constructionist he was troubled.
the constitution did not mention the purchase of foreign lands and he did not want to expand the power of the federal government.
he also did not like spending large amounts of public money.
nevertheless jefferson agreed to the purchase in the belief that doing so was best for the country.
on october 20 1803 the senate approved the louisiana purchase agreement which roughly doubled the size of the united states.
with the 15 million in the french treasury napoleon boasted i have given england a rival who sooner or later will humble her pride.

meriwether lewis 4 chapter 8 explorers head west americans knew little about western native americans or the land they lived on.
president jefferson wanted to learn more about the people and land of the west.
he also wanted to see if there was a river route that could be taken to the pacific ocean.
lewis and clark expedition in 1803 the president asked congress to fund an expedition to explore the west.
to lead it he chose former army captain meriwether lewis.
lewis then chose his friend lieutenant william clark to be the co leader of the expedition.
to prepare for the journey lewis spent weeks studying with experts about plants surveying and other subjects.
this knowledge would allow him to take careful notes on what he saw.
with clark lewis carefully selected about 50 skilled frontiersmen to join the corps of discovery as they called their group.
in may 1804 the lewis and clark expedition began its long journey to explore the louisiana purchase.
the corps of discovery traveled up the missouri river to the village of st charles.
once past this village the men would receive no more letters fresh supplies or reinforcements.
lewis and clark used the missouri river as their highway through the unknown lands.
as they moved upstream a lookout on the boats kept a sharp eye out for sandbars and for tree stumps hidden underwater.
when darkness fell the weary explorers would pull their boats ashore.
they cooked wrote in their journals and slept.

insects were not the only cause of sleeplessness for the corps of discovery.
as weeks passed without seeing any native americans the explorers wondered what their first encounter would be like.
contact with native americans during the summer of 1804 the corps of discovery had pushed more than 600 miles upriver without seeing any native americans.
but when the men spotted huge buffalo herds in the distance they guessed that indian groups would be nearby.
many indian groups depended on the buffalo for food clothing and tools.
lewis used interpreters to talk to the leaders of each of the peoples they met.
he told them that the united states now owned the land on which they lived.
yet the explorers relied on the good will of the people they met.
sacagawea sak uh juh wee uh a shoshone from the rocky mountains accompanied the group with her husband a french fur trader who lived with the mandan indians and served as a guide and interpreter.
sacagawea helped the expedition by naming plants and by gathering edible fruits and vegetables for the group.
at one point the group met with sacagawea s brother who provided horses and a guide to lead the expedition across the mountains.
after crossing the rockies lewis and clark followed the columbia river.
along the way they met the powerful nez perce.
like the shoshone the nez perce provided the expedition with food.
at last in november 1805 lewis and clark reached the pacific ocean.
the explorers stayed in the pacific northwest during the rough winter.
in march 1806 lewis and clark set out on the long trip home.
lewis and clark had not found a river route across the west to the pacific ocean.
but they had learned much about western lands and paths across the rockies.
the explorers also established contact with many native american groups and collected much valuable information about western plants and animals.
pike s exploration in 1806 a young army officer named zebulon pike was sent on another mission to the west.
he was ordered to find the starting point of the red river.
this was important because the united states considered the red river to be a part of the louisiana territory s western border with new spain.
heading into the rocky mountains in present day colorado pike tried to reach the summit of the mountain now known as pikes peak.
in 1807 he traveled into spanish held lands until spanish cavalry arrested him.
they suspected pike of being a spy.
when he was finally released he returned to the united states and reported on his trip.
despite his imprisonment he praised the opportunities for doing business with the spanish in the southwest.
pike s 5 chapter 8 linking to today the louisiana purchase when the corps of discovery headed west in 1804 an estimated 30 million buffalo roamed the plains alongside 97 000 people mostly native americans.
since that time the numbers have reversed.

the coming of war if you were there you are a tea merchant in boston in 1807 but right now a new law forbids trading with european nations.
boston harbor is full of empty ships.
it seems to you that the law is hurting american merchants more than european ones.
you know that some are breaking the law and smuggling goods just to stay in business.
would you obey the law or smuggle.
building background the united states tried to stay neutral in the conflicts between france and great britain but it was impossible to avoid getting involved.
french and british ships interfered with american trade across the atlantic.
the british also caused trouble along the western frontier.
many americans began to urge war with great britain.
violations of neutrality during the late 1700s and early 1800s american merchant ships fanned out across the oceans.
the overseas trade while profitable was also risky.
ships had to travel vast distances often through violent storms.
merchant ships sailing in the mediterranean risked capture by pirates from the barbary states of north africa who would steal cargo and hold ships crews for ransom.
the young united states had no formal navy to protect these ships.
congress provided money for just six ships but the ships were designed to compete against the largest navies in the world.
attacks continued until the united states sent the uss constitution a large warship to end them.
the barbary pirates were a serious problem but an even larger threat soon loomed.
when great britain and france went to war in 1803 each country wanted to stop the united states from supplying goods to the other.
each government passed laws designed to prevent american merchants from trading with the other.
in addition the british and french navies captured many american merchant ships searching for war supplies.
the real trouble however started when britain began stopping and searching american ships for sailors who had run away from the british navy forcing the sailors to return to british ships.
sometimes u s citizens were captured by accident and pressed into the uss constitution connect to science and technology 1.
why do you think gunpowder was stored on the bottom deck.
what was the purpose of the copper sheathing.
boys called powder monkeys carried gunpowder from the orlop or lowest deck up to the gunners.
in the early years of the republic foreign trade was critical to the nation s survival.
in 1797 congress decided to create a navy to protect american merchant ships.
the powerful warship uss constitution was a key part of the new navy and was undefeated in battle.
it is the oldest commissioned warship in the world.
this impressment or the practice of forcing people to serve in the army or navy continued despite american protests.
soon britain was even targeting american navy ships.
in june 1807 for example the british ship leopard stopped the u s navy ship chesapeake and tried to remove sailors.
when the captain of the chesapeake refused the british took the sailors by force.
the brazen attack on the chesapeake stunned americans.
the embargo act great britain s violations of u s neutrality sparked intense debate in america about how to respond.
some people wanted to go to war.
others favored an embargo or the banning of trade against britain.
without a strong navy many feared that the young nation would be unable to defend its independence in a fight against the largest navy in the world.
jefferson who had easily won re election in 1804 supported an embargo.
at his urging in late 1807 congress passed the embargo act.
the law essentially banned trade with all foreign countries.
american ships could not sail to foreign ports.
american ports were also closed to british ships.
congress hoped that the embargo would punish britain and france and protect american merchant ships from capture.
the effect of the law was devastating to american merchants.
without foreign trade the jefferson era 279 they lost enormous amounts of money.
northern states that relied heavily on trade were especially hard hit by the embargo.
congressman josiah quincy of massachusetts in a speech before congress described the situation.
all the business of the nation is in disorder.
all the nation s industry is at a standstill he said.
the free enterprise system of economics was becoming more important to the financial well being of merchants and other americans and many did not want government policies to interfere with trade.
the embargo damaged jefferson s popularity and strengthened the federalist party.
angry merchants sent jefferson hundreds of petitions demanding the embargo act s repeal.
one new englander said the embargo was like cutting one s throat to stop the nosebleed.
even worse the embargo had little effect on britain and france.
non intercourse act in 1809 congress tried to revive the nation s trade by replacing the unpopular act with the non intercourse act.
this new law banned trade only with britain france and their colonies.
it also stated that the united states would resume trading with the first side that stopped violating u s neutrality.
in time however the law was no more successful than the embargo act.

conflict in the west disagreements between great britain and the united states went beyond the neutrality issue.
in the west the british and native americans again clashed with american settlers over land.
the conflict over land in the early 1800s native americans in the old northwest territory continued to lose land as thousands of settlers poured into the region.
the united states had gained this land in the treaty of greenville but indian leaders who had not agreed to the treaty protested the settlers arrival.
frustrated indian groups considered what to do.
in the meantime britain saw an opportunity to slow america s westward growth.
british agents from canada began to arm native americans who were living along the western frontier.
rumors of british activity in the old northwest territory quickly spread filling american settlers with fear and anger.
tecumseh resists u s settlers soon an indian leader emerged who seemed more than capable of halting the american settlers.
tecumseh tuh kuhm suh a shawnee chief had watched angrily as native americans were pushed off their land.
a brilliant speaker he warned other indians about the dangers they faced from settlers.
he believed that the native americans had to do what white americans had done unite.

they founded a village called prophetstown near the wabash and tippecanoe rivers for their followers.
the battle of tippecanoe the governor of the indiana territory william henry harrison watched tecumseh s activities with alarm.
harrison called him one of those uncommon geniuses which spring up occasionally to.
overturn the established order.
the governor was convinced that tecumseh had british backing.
if true tecumseh could be a serious threat to american power in the west.
in 1810 tecumseh met face to face with harrison.
the governor urged him to follow the treaty of greenville that had been signed in 1795.
tecumseh replied the white people have no right to take the land from the indians because the indians had it first.
no single chief he insisted could sell land belonging to all american indians who used it.
in response harrison warned tecumseh not to resist the power of the united states.

reading time lines primary source points of view views of war tecumseh urged native americans to unite to oppose what he called the evil of white settlement.
the only way to stop this evil is for all the red men to unite in claiming a common and equal right to the land as it was at first and should be yet.
before the land never was divided but belonged to all for the use of each person.
no group had a right to sell not even to each other much less to strangers who want all and will not do with less j tecumseh william henry harrison was proud of his efforts to obtain land for settlers.
by my own exertions in securing the friendship of the chiefs by admitting them at all times to my house and table my propositions for the purchase of their lands were successful beyond my hopes in the course of seven years s the indian title was extinguished to the amount of fifty millions of acres william henry harrison how did harrison s and tecumseh s views on western settlement differ.
focus on reading what generalization can you make about the views on going to war.
tecumseh traveled south to ask the creek nation to join his forces.
in his absence harrison attacked.
harrison raised an army and marched his troops close to prophetstown.
fighting broke out when the prophet ordered an attack on harrison s camp on november 7 1811.
the indians broke through army lines but harrison kept a calm cool and collected manner according to one observer.
during the all day battle harrison s soldiers forced the indian warriors to retreat and then destroyed tecumseh s village.
said chief shabbona with the smoke of that town and loss of that battle i lost all hope.
although tecumseh was safe u s forces defeated tecumseh and his followers in the battle of tippecanoe.
the defeat destroyed tecumseh s dream of a great indian confederation.
he fled to canada.
the prophet was removed from power for ordering the failed attack.
reading check finding main ideas why were u s officials worried about tecumseh s actions.
call for war the evidence of british support for tecumseh further inflamed americans.
a democratic republican newspaper declared the war on the wabash river is purely british.
many americans felt that britain had encouraged tecumseh to attack settlers in the west.
the war hawks several young members of congress called war hawks by their opponents took the lead in calling for war against britain.
these legislators most of whom were from the south and west were led by henry clay of kentucky john c calhoun of south carolina and felix grundy of tennessee.
they saw war as the only answer to british insults.

war at sea when the war began the british navy had hundreds of ships.
in contrast the u s navy had fewer than 20 ships.
none of them was as powerful as the greatest british warships.
most of the british navy s ships however were scattered around the globe.

in this phrase monroe warns european nations against trying to influence events in the western hemisphere.
monroe notes here the difference between existing colonies and newly independent countries.
the occasion has been judged proper for asserting that the american continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers.
the political system of the allied powers is essentially different from that of america.
we declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety with the existing colonies we have not interfered and shall not interfere.
but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it and whose independence we have acknowledged we could not view any interposition1 for the purpose of oppressing them by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation2 of an unfriendly disposition3 toward the united states.

how does monroe say the united states will treat existing european colonies.
1 interposition interference 2 manifestation evidence 3 disposition attitude academic vocabulary circumstances surrounding situation monroe doctrine meanwhile spain had other problems.
by the early 1820s most of the spanish colonies in the americas had declared independence.
revolutionary fighter simon bolivar called the liberator led many of these struggles for independence.
the political circumstances surrounding the revolutions reminded most american leaders of the american revolution.
as a result they supported these struggles.
after mexico broke free from spain in 1821 president monroe grew worried.
he feared that rival european powers might try to take control of newly independent latin american countries.
he was also concerned about russia s interest in the northwest coast of north america.
secretary of state adams shared president monroe s concerns.
in a fourth of july speech before congress adams said that the united states had always been friendly with european powers and that the country did not want to be involved in wars with them.
he implied that he supported the newly independent countries but said the united states would not fight their battles.
great britain was also interested in restraining the influence of other european nations in the americas.
this was because britain had formed close trading ties with most of the independent latin american countries.
britain wanted to issue a joint statement with the united states to warn the rest of europe not to interfere in latin america.
instead secretary of state adams and president monroe decided to put together a document protecting american interests.
the monroe doctrine was an exclusive statement of american policy warning european powers not to interfere with the americas.
0 chapter 9 the doctrine was issued by the president on december 2 1823 during his annual message to congress.
the monroe doctrine had four basic points.
the united states would not interfere in the affairs of european nations.
the united states would recognize and not interfere with european colonies that already existed in north and south america.
the western hemisphere was to be off limits to future colonization by any foreign power.
the united states would consider any european power s attempt to colonize or interfere with nations in the western hemisphere to be a hostile act.
some europeans strongly criticized the monroe doctrine but few european countries challenged it.
one impact of the doctrine was to bring latin america under the economic political and military influ ence of the united states.
it also kept most european powers from interfering in latin american affairs.
the doctrine has remained important to u s foreign policy.
the united states has continued to consider latin america within its sphere of influence the area a nation claims some control over.
at times it has intervened in latin american affairs when its own interests such as national security were at risk.

you have never been far from your home and you are curious about their journey.

bding background peace prosperity and a growing country americans a sense of national unity.
in practical terms building and canals also helped unify the nation.
they made travel easier linking people from different regions of the country.
nevertheless some i regional conflicts continued.
growing nationalism pleased by successful negotiations with foreign powers americans enjoyed a rising sense of nationalism.
nationalism is feelings of pride in and loyalty to a nation.
americans believed in the nation s potential to build a society that was equal to european powers.
the american system the democratic republicans wanted to build a strong national economy to promote the sense of a unified country and reduce sectional conflicts.
they pushed forward a plan eventually known as the american system a series of measures intended to make the united states economically self sufficient.
the most vocal supporter of the plan was u s representative henry clay from kentucky.
to build the economy clay pushed for a national bank that would provide a single currency making interstate trade easier.
and the lessons learned in the war of 1812 led many to think that a national bank would stabilize the economy.
clay wanted the money from a protective tariff to be used to improve and build roads and canals.
02 chapter 9 economics and sectionalism industry and favored policies that made imported goods more expensive than american made goods.
these internal improvements would unite the country.
they would provide a way for both goods and people to travel more easily across the long distances of the nation.
agricultural products of the west and the south and manufactured goods made in the north would be easier to transport to distant markets.
not everyone agreed with the plan however.
most of the resistance was centered in the west and the south.
these regions were more dependent on trade to acquire manufactured goods than the north was.
the plan for a high tariff on imported manufactured goods resulted in higher prices for these goods.
this increase in prices would be felt more in the west and the south while benefiting the manufacturers in the north.
clay responded with the argument that the north would be dependent on those regions for food and cotton.
the south however still opposed the possibility of higher prices.
respected congressman daniel webster spoke against the tariff because he believed it would help one industry over others.
webster and his supporters argued that using a federal law that benefited one region of the nation more than others violated the ideals results american made goods were cheaper leading to higher sales and great profits for u s businesses.
iron and cotton would be used by u s businesses instead of foreign businesses.
american businesses would receive help in order to expand.

roads and canals in the early 1800s most roads in the united states were made of dirt making travel difficult.

the wickedest road i do think the cruellest hard heartedest road that ever a wheel rumbled upon frances anne kemble butler journal to improve the nation s roads congress agreed with clay and invested in road building.
the cumberland road was the first road built by the federal government.
it ran from cumberland maryland to wheeling a town on the ohio river in present day west virginia.
construction began in 1815.
workers had to cut a 66 foot wide band sometimes through forest to make way for the road.
then they had to use shovels and pickaxes to dig a 12 to 18 inch roadbed which they filled with crushed stone.
all of the work had to be done without the benefit of today s bulldozers and steamrollers.
by 1818 the road reached wheeling.
by 1833 the national road as the expansion was called stretched to columbus ohio.
by 1850 it reached all the way to illinois.
meanwhile americans tried to make water transportation easier by building canals.
one of the largest projects was the erie canal which ran from albany to buffalo new york.
construction of the canal began in 1817 and was completed in 1825.
using shovels british german and irish immigrants dug the entire canal by hand.
the canal cost millions of dollars but it proved to be worth the expense.
the erie canal allowed goods and people to move between towns on lake erie and new york city and the east coast.
its success served as an incentive for a canal building boom across the country.
the construction of canals and roads had direct and indirect effects on the environment.
the landscape was changed by the clearing of forests and rivers and streams were redirected or dammed.
once the canals and roads were built new farms and towns developed and further changed the environment.
even in rural areas the natural environment was changed to accommodate the needs of humans.
era of good feelings from 1815 to 1825 the united states enjoyed the era of good feelings a time of peace pride and progress.
the phrase was coined by a boston editor in 1817 during james monroe s visit to new england early in his presidency.
the emphasis on national unity was strengthened by two supreme court case decisions that reinforced the power of the federal government.
in the 1819 case mcculloch v maryland the court asserted the implied powers of congress in allowing for the creation of a national bank.
in the 1824 case gibbons v ogden the court said that the states could not interfere with the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce.
both of these court cases along with others showed the increasing control of the national government over the decisions of state governments.
congress began to make more laws based on the loose interpretation of the necessary and proper clause.

when the nation was founded the main political divisions between states followed the regional lines between those in the north and those in the south.
from the beginning the two regions had different economic and political concerns.
the north worked for laws supporting trade and commerce while the south favored policies that benefited agricultural production.
northern states insisted on equal representation for states with lower populations to make sure they were not overpowered by the more populous southern states.
but the biggest difference between the regions was the southern system of slavery.
from the beginning of the nation leaders in the two regions debated how to handle the difference.
under the articles of confederation the land ordinance of 1785 and the northwest ordinance of 1787 had established a new kind of political region in the country.
territories were not states but they were under the direct administration of the federal government.
the ordinances established the policies and political structures for new land acquired in the future.

like many people the world over americans expressed their thoughts and feelings in literature and art and sought spiritual comfort in religion and music.
developments in education and architecture also reflected the growing national identity.
the arts became a way to show the similarities among americans as well as the differences between american and european life.
to do this writers and artists used themes and images that were familiar to most americans.
chapter 9 one of the first american writers to gain international fame was washington irving.
born in 1783 he was named after george washington.
irving s works often told about american history.
through a humorous form of writing called satire irving warned that americans should learn from the past and be cautious about the future.
irving shared this idea in one of his best known short stories rip van winkle.
this story describes a man who falls asleep during the time of the american revolution.
he wakes up 20 years later to a society he does not recognize.
irving published this and another well known tale the legend of sleepy hollow in an 1819 20 collection.
in some of his most popular works irving combined european influences with american settings and characters.
his work served as a bridge between european literary traditions and a new type of writer who focused on american characters and society.
perhaps the best known of these new writers was james fenimore cooper.
cooper was born to a wealthy new jersey family in 1789.
stories about the west and the native americans who lived on the frontier fascinated him.
these subjects became the focus of his best known works.
cooper s first book was not very successful but his next novel the spy was a huge success.
published in 1821 itwas an adventure story set during the american revolution.
it appealed to american readers patriotism and desire for an exciting action filled story.
in 1823 cooper published the pioneers the first of five novels featuring the hero natty bumppo.
cooper s novels told of settling the western frontier and included historical events.
for example his novel the last of the mohicans takes place during the french and indian war.
by placing fictional characters in a real historical setting cooper popularized a type of writing called historical fiction.
some critics said that cooper s characters were not interesting.
they particularly criticized the women in his stories one writer labeled them flat as a prairie.
other authors of historical fiction such as catharine maria sedgwick wrote about interesting heroines.
sedgwick s characters were inspired by the people of the berkshire hills region of massachusetts where she lived.
her works include a new england tale and hope leslie.
analyzing how did ameri can writers such as irving and cooper help create a new cultural identity in the united states.
a new style of art the writings of irving and cooper inspired painters.
these artists began to paint landscapes that showed the history of america and the beauty of the land.
earlier american painters had mainly painted portraits.

309 the artists of the hudson river school created paintings that reflected national pride and an appreciation of the american landscape.
they took their name from the subject of many of their paintings the hudson river valley.
landscape painter thomas cole was a founder of the hudson river school.
he had moved to the united states from britain in 1819.
he soon recognized the unique qualities of the american landscape.
as his work gained fame he encouraged other american artists to show the beauty of nature.

one wildlife painter john james audubon became famous in both america and england for his paintings of birds.
he traveled throughout the west as far as yellowstone collecting images and descriptions of american wildlife.
by the 1840s the style of american painting was changing.
more artists were trying to combine images of the american landscape with scenes from people s daily lives.
painters like george caleb bingham and alfred jacob miller travelled west to paint scenes of the american frontier including trappers traders settlers and native americans.
religion and music through the early and mid 1800s several waves of religious revivalism swept the united states.
during periods of revivalism meetings were held for the purpose of reawakening religious faith.
these meetings sometimes lasted for days and included large sing alongs.
at many revival meetings people sang songs called spirituals.
spirituals are a type of folk hymn found in both white and african american folk music traditions.
this type of song developed from the practice of calling out text from the bible.
a leader would call out the text one line at a time and the congregation would sing the words using a familiar tune.
each singer added his or her own style to the tune.
the congregation of singers sang freely as inspiration led them.
while spirituals reflected the religious nature of some americans popular folk music of the period reflected the unique views of the growing nation in a different way.
one of the most popular songs of the era was hunters of kentucky which celebrated the battle of new orleans.
it became an anthem for the spirit of nationalism in the united states and was used successfully in andrew jackson s campaign for the presidency in 1828.

thomas cole s the oxbow 1836 chapter 9 noah webster publishes his first dictionary of american not british english architecture and education american creativity extended to the way in which people designed buildings.
before the american revolution most architects followed the style used in great britain.
after the revolution leaders such as thomas jefferson called for americans to model their architecture after the styles used in ancient greece and rome.
many americans admired the ancient civilization of greece and the roman republic because they contained some of the same democratic and republican ideals as the new american nation did.
as time went by more architects followed jefferson s ideas.
growing american cities soon had distinctive new buildings designed in the greek and roman styles.
these buildings were usually made of marble or other stone and featured large stately columns.
americans also embraced educational progress.
several early american political leaders expressed a belief that democracy would only succeed in a country of educated and enlightened people.
but there was no general agreement on who should provide that education.
eventually the idea of a state funded public school gathered support.
in 1837 massachusetts lawmakers created a state board of education.
other states followed this example and the number of public schools slowly grew.
