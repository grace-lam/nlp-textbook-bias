the path to salvation leads from these institutions through college and eventually up into heaven.
in the artists view americans faced a clear choice salvation or eternal damnation.
americans sought solutions for the nations social problems and clamored for reforms.
many turned to mainstream religion for guidance or joined religious reform movements.
secular reformers targeted education and prisons or alcohol.
some religious movements viewed the market economy as the root of americas problems and advocated the abandonment of private property.
secular utopian movements came to similar conclusions.
still other reformers adopted a radically different critique of market society.
champions of transcendentalism a literary and philosophical movement including ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau urged americans to reject the values of the marketplace and turn to nature or their individual consciences for inspiration.
the expanding literary marketplace prompted many writers to explore contemporary ills or use them as a backdrop for stories that probed issues as different as slavery and urbanization.
the rise of a more aggressive abolitionist movement and the development of an equally fervid defense of slavery intensified the public debate over this issue.
abolitionism helped radicalize many women and gave them the opportunity to develop organizing skills.
inspired by a more radical theory of equality and equipped with their new skills womens rights advocates applied their critique of slavery to womens status under american law.
reform efforts also affected architecture.
many reformers advocated transforming the american landscape itself including the built environment to promote social reform and spiritual renewal.
in the history of the world the doctrine of reform had never such scope as at the present hour.
we are to revise the whole of our social structure the state the school religion marriage trade science and explore their foundations in our own nature ralph waldo emerson man the reformer 1841 chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 revivalism and reform 10 1 religious camp meeting a contemporary artist captured the intense emotional experience of a revival meeting.
the cane ridge revival in kentucky 1801 was the first stirring of the larger revival movement that constituted americas second great awakening.
for a discussion of the first great awakening see chapter 3.
in the next four decades this emotional style of evangelical protestantism attracted many americans.
for those swept up in the revival the changes transforming american society were seen as a threat to the church and the family.
however the most farsighted proponents of revival such as charles grandison finney realized that the power of the market revolution might be turned to good ends and used to promote religion and reform.
by the 1830s americans began to believe that the economic political and social changes sweeping over their society were undermining individual morality the ability of communities to prosper and the integrity of the family.
this belief drove the push for moral reform.
in many cases religious impulse inspired reformers.
finney preached that true saints love reform and argued that humankind could create a perfect society here on earth if all americans made the reformation of the whole world their priority.
not all reformers were religiously motivated however.
some reform efforts promoted secular goals and drew on the enlightenments ideals of reason science and faith in humankinds ability to improve and reshape its surroundings see chapters 3 and 4.
secular reform movements led to improvements in schools care for the mentally ill and methods of reforming criminals.
whether religious or secular reform efforts targeted individual behavior such as drunkenness and prostitution.
revivalism and the market revolution one way of promoting revivalism was the camp meeting an outdoor religious revival that lasted for days.
this painting of religious camp meeting 10 1 by an english artist captures the emotional intensity of these events during which grown men and women swooned and collapsed in response to the fiery preaching of ministers.
the painting shows overwrought men and women physically exhausted from the revival splayed across the ground and on the benches in the foreground.
one observer compared the audiences response to the fiery sermons of the camp meeting with the swelling of an ocean wave an awesome spectacle of fainting shouting yelling crying sobbing and grieving the tents in the background of the painting give only a small sense of the scope of these events.
camp meetings could last for a week and attract 3 000 people and 100 preachers.
what was the second great awakening.
read the document reverend peter cartwright cane ridge and the new lights revivalism and reform revivalists faulted many mainstream ministers for their overly intellectualized preaching.
ministers also blamed americas problems on the materialism associated with the market revolution.
one minister feared that the same forces that were increasing the business and moneyed interests in the nation would by spreading vice and irreligion prove its ruin.
those very things which all regard as improvements will be our destruction for some however the new methods of communication and wealth generated by the market revolution were tools to press into the service of revivalism.
no figure proved more adept at turning the tools of the market to religious purposes than charles grandison finney a lawyer turned preacher who became a leading spokesman for spreading the revivalist message of the second great awakening to towns and cities.
his influence was felt particularly strongly in those urban centers most closely associated with the market revolution.
while walking to his law offices one day finney experienced a religious conversion.
in a lawyerly manner he declared that from that day on he would be on a retainer from the lord jesus christ to plead his cause drawing on his experience as a courtroom lawyer he fashioned a forceful and direct style of preaching that cajoled harangued and pleaded with his audience to embrace salvation.
finneys theology rejected many of the calvinist assumptions of nonevangelical churches see chapter 3.
where calvinists stressed predestination the belief that god predetermined our individual destinies including who will and will not be saved finney instead stressed free will peoples ability to seek out salvation through their own efforts.
the idea of perfectionism grew out of his emphasis on free will.
by aiming for perfection finney preached human beings could usher in the millennium.
in contrast to the pessimistic message of calvinism which condemned most people to damnation finney emphasized sobriety and hard work along with his religious message.
his sermons appealed to the expanding middle class and the wealthy.
finney found an especially eager audience in men and women in the cities and towns along the erie canal in upstate new york.
a dramatic revival occurred in rochester new york in 1830 1831.
finney adapted many of the new political techniques associated with jacksonian democracy designed to get voters involved in politics to his revivals.
politicians finney noted get up meetings circulate handbills and pamphlets blaze away in the newspapers the goal of such actions was to stimulate excitement and bring the people out finney and other evangelicals took advantage of the opportunities provided by the market revolution particularly the expansion of the publishing industry to churn out tracts bibles and evangelical periodicals.
organizations such as the american bible society and the american tract society led the way in marketing evangelical publications making an effort to use high quality wood cut images in many of them to visually reinforce the text.
temperance rising levels of alcohol consumption spurred the growth of temperance the reform movement that advocated abstinence from alcohol.
by 1830 consumption of spirits reached an all time high almost seven gallons per person of pure alcohol a year more than twice the amount that the average american drinks today.
alcohol had always been we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created temperate that they are endowed by their creator with certain natural and innocent desires that among these are the appetite for cold water and the pursuit of happiness manifesto of the washington total abstinence societies 1841 how did finney use the tools of the market revolution to further the goals of the second great awakening.
chapter 10 a militia muster although militia musters had always included drinking the scene depicted here shows a militia man too drunk to stand up.
martial virtue is nowhere to be seen.
revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 important in america.
every social class imbibed alcohol and hardly a community function took place without alcohol consumption.
workers on the job often drank alcohol during their midmorning and mid afternoon breaks.
one commentator noted that a house could not be raised a field of wheat cut down nor could there be a log rolling a husking a quilting a wedding or funeral without the aid of alcohol although western religions had always frowned on drunkenness christians had never deemed the consumption of alcohol a sin.
the great awakening changed this as spokesmen for the revival fastened on intemperance as an issue.
at first proponents of temperance merely sought to promote moderation but by the mid 1820s a more radical temperance movement sought complete abstinence from alcohol.
the first national temperance organization was founded in 1826 and within three years there were 222 similar organizations.
by the mid 1830s temperance organizations had more than 1 5 million members and more than two million americans had taken the movements pledge of abstinence.
evangelical religious leaders took the lead what does this painting of a militia muster reveal about alcohol consumption in america.
i believe in the existence of a great immortal immutable principle of natural law which proves the absolute right to an education of every human being that comes into the world horace mann 1846 in these organizations delivering sermons with titles like the nature occasions signs evils and remedy of intemperance reformers warned americans that alcohol threatened their souls as well as their bodies.
for congregational minister lyman beecher a prominent figure in the second great awakening temperance organizations were a disciplined moral militia an ironic metaphor given that the real militia had become another illustration of the problem of intemperance.
although militia musters the practice sessions of the militia had always been festive occasions that included drinking by the mid nineteenth century they had become drunken revels as this depiction of a militia day muster illustrates 10 2.
the militiaman in the foreground is so watch the video video lecture drinking and the temperance movement revivalism and reform inebriated he cannot stand and the dancing african american suggests that the atmosphere is more carnival like than military.
temperance advocates also campaigned for prohibition laws banning the sale of alcohol and temperance attracted other reformers such as the young whig politician abraham lincoln.
the whigs helped to secure laws to promote sobriety.
maine adopted the most wide sweeping law in 1851 prohibiting alcohol.
by 1855 13 of the nations 31 states had passed similar laws.
the temperance movement did not banish drinking from american life but it dramatically reduced alcohol consumption.
schools prisons and asylums alcohol consumption was hardly the only concern of reformers.
they also turned their attention to education the criminal justice system and the treatment of the mentally ill.
they founded new institutions to deal with these social problems and campaigned to change the way americans thought about these issues.
education was central to reform efforts.
lyman beecher wrote that we must educate or we must perish by our own prosperity unfettered growth and materialism according to such leaders as beecher would otherwise subvert americas moral foundations.
the leading spokesman for educational reform in america was the whig politician horace mann.
as a member of the massachusetts legislature he worked tirelessly to create a state board of education that would establish a uniform curriculum for massachusetts and improve teacher training.
mann became the first head of the new state board of education.
massachusetts also became the first state to pass a compulsory school attendance law.
for reformers such as mann the common school universal public education would cure societys ills.
as mann wrote let the common school be expanded to its capabilities and nine tenths of the crimes in the penal code would become obsolete the long catalogue of human ills would be abridged although many types of reform were curative or remedial schools according to mann were preventive he intended his reforms like much mainstream educational reform of the day to read the document horace mann report on the massachusetts board of education make good citizens and workers.
this era saw the development of many features of modern schooling.
the assignment of students to grades according to age and ability the use of standardized procedures for promotion and the notion of uniform textbooks for instruction all emerged out of the massachusetts model that mann helped pioneer.
a new textbook the popular mcguffeys reader appeared in 1836.
this text went through multiple editions for the remainder of the nineteenth century.
the mcguffey readers carried a clear political message well suited to a society in which wealth was becoming less equally distributed.
the readers instructed children not to envy their social betters but rather to remind them that it is god who makes some poor and others rich a different vision of education shaped the agenda of the working mens party which saw education as an invaluable tool in the ongoing political struggle between the people and the aristocratic few.
although they shared manns whig goal of universal education they intended education to liberate workers not make them docile.
thus a philadelphia working mens party committee declared that despotism thrived when the multitude is consigned to ignorance and education and knowledge reserved for the the rich and the rulers although educational reform attracted a wide range of supporters including religious leaders whigs such as mann and the working mens we find in the united states two distinctly separate systems the system of auburn and that of philadelphia.
the two systems opposed to each other on important points have however a common basis without which no penitentiary system is possible this basis is the isolation of the prisoners gustave de beaumont and alexis de tocqueville 1833 how did manns vision of educational reform differ from that of the working mens party.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 party opposition to such reforms could be equally ardent.
a variety of groups feared that government involvement in education would endanger individual freedom.
democrats in massachusetts for example viewed manns program as a system of centralization that would put power in a few hands and undermine the spirit of our democratic institutions farmers feared that a longer school year would rob them of a valuable source of labor and that the increased taxes to fund the new school system would fall heavily on agricultural interests.
finally catholics feared that the countrys protestant majority had designed the new system to impose its values on nonprotestants.
in response to the common school movement catholics began creating their own parochial schools.
although manns utopian vision of education as a cure for societys ills was not realized the common school movement did achieve notable successes.
by mid century over half of the white children in america between ages five and nineteen were enrolled in public schools the highest percentage in the world.
higher education also expanded dramatically.
in 1815 there were 33 colleges in america by 1835 there were 68 and 113 by 1848.
the great awakening inspired much of this growth.
almost half these new colleges were affiliated with denominations that took a prominent role in the awakening presbyterians methodists and baptists.
among the colleges and universities founded in this period were amherst i proceed gentlemen briefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this commonwealth in cages closets cellars stalls pens.
chained naked beaten with rods and lashed into obedience dorothea dix 1843 what was a panopticon.
and wesleyan in new england earlham in the midwest and emory and duke in the south.
although these schools excluded women whose educational opportunities lagged behind those for men some progress occurred in this area.
in 1821 emma willard founded the troy female seminary in troy new york and in 1837 mount holyoke female seminary was established in massachusetts.
oberlin college in ohio admitted women from its inception in 1833.
a hotbed of abolitionist sentiment oberlin admitted its first african american students in 1835.
the state universities that date from this period of educational reform include louisiana missouri mississippi and wisconsin as do some of the nations leading catholic institutions including fordham holy cross notre dame villanova and xavier in cincinnati.
the new religious emphasis on free will and commitment to moral reform also inspired new approaches to criminal justice.
in place of punishment a new reform based model of incarceration emerged the penitentiary where individuals were isolated from one another and given a chance to repent and reform.
earlier approaches to crime had cast behavior in terms of sinfulness and innate depravity and had meted out punishment accordingly.
two different models for implementing this penitential ideal emerged in prisons.
the new york state system employed the first at ossining a prison in the hudson river valley.
prisoners sent up the river from new york city to sing sing were housed in individual cells at night but were organized in communal work details during the day.
inmates worked ten hour days in stone quarries eventually the prisoners manufactured goods including barrels boots and shoes hats brushes and mattresses.
pennsylvania pioneered a different model which it implemented in eastern state penitentiary.
eastern state employed solitary confinement which isolated prisoners from all contact with other prisoners to force them to reflect on their criminality and seek repentance.
the architecture of eastern state reflected this new approach to penology.
architect john havilands vision of the ideal prison combined fashionable gothic architectural elements with watch the video video lecture who was horace mann and why were so many schools named after him.
revivalism and reform an enlightenment emphasis on geometrical forms 10 3.
thus although the outside of the prison looked like a medieval fortress the inside consisted of a series of radiating spokes emanating from a central watch tower.
a guard in the central tower could see the prisoners who themselves were unable to see the guard.
haviland believed his plan would facilitate watching convenience economy and ventilation this design which its inventor british philosopher jeremy bentham dubbed a panopticon applied the enlightenments ideals of reason to prison reform.
prisoners were potentially under surveillance at all times and could never be sure if the eyes of the state were on them.
the goal was to impose discipline and have prisoners internalize it as an ideal.
this vision of penal reform fit with the enlightenments ideals of reason and control.
life for the mentally ill had always been hard and people with mental illness were often housed with criminals.
in 1841 dorothea dix a schoolteacher volunteered to provide religious instruction for women in the massachusetts house of correction.
shocked by the treatment of the inmates particularly the mentally ill who were dressed in rags confined to one room and often beaten dix sought to change the way mental illness was treated.
after visiting jails and poorhouses where the mentally ill were housed she compiled a report to the massachusetts legislature detailing the wretched conditions in places such as the house of correction.
dix recommended that criminals be separated from the mentally ill and argued that the latter would benefit from more humane treatment.
other reformers followed her lead and by 1860 28 of 33 states had public asylums for the mentally ill 10 3 philadelphia penitentiary architects designed prisons to accommodate the penitential model.
prisoners could be isolated for reflection while still being monitored by prison authorities.
the most famous example of this new type of prison was eastern state penitentiary in philadelphia.
source the library company of philadelphia what does prison architecture reveal about reform in this period.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 abolitionism and the proslavery response the debate over slavery heated up as abolitionists demanded an immediate end to slavery.
like revivalists abolitionists also took advantage of the new tools provided by the market revolution to bombard southerners with their message particularly communications technologies such as improvements in printing.
the more aggressive style of abolitionism produced a fierce reaction from southerners who became increasingly militant in their defense of slavery.
rather than concede that slavery was a necessary evil as jefferson and others of the founding generation had southerners now touted slavery as a positive good that reformed and uplifted slaves.
the real evils in american society they argued were abolitionism and the factory system.
by mid century the slavery debate created huge divisions within american politics and society.
the rise of immediatism much of the early opposition to slavery was led by the quakers.
the ideals of the american revolution also contributed to the rise of abolitionist sentiment which attracted leading politicians including prominent federalists such as alexander hamilton and john jay.
for these abolitionists slavery threatened the republican values of liberty and virtue.
racial equality or justice was not a major concern the elimination of slavery was necessary to prevent americans from becoming corrupted by the institution of slavery.
james madison henry clay and john marshall championed a plan that included gradually liberating the slaves and returning them to africa.
the american colonization society the organization i shall strenuously contend for the immediate enfranchisement of our slave population.
i will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.
on this subject i do not wish to think or speak or write with moderation.
i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard william lloyd garrison the liberator 1831 why was david walkers appeal so radical.
devoted to implementing this idea was founded in 1817.
it helped to found the west african colony of liberia and began transporting free blacks there from the united states.
yet by 1830 only 1 400 blacks had been sent to liberia.
although gradualism and colonization had appealed to many white opponents of slavery it never attracted much interest among african americans who supported a more immediate end to slavery and were committed to remaining in the united states.
a convention of free blacks speaking of the united states proclaimed in 1831 that this is our home and this is our country in 1829 abolitionism entered a new era.
david walker a free black who had grown up in north carolina and moved to boston published an appeal which he addressed to the coloured citizens of the world but in particular and very expressly to those of the united states of america walker rejected colonization and declared that america is more our country than it is the whites we have enriched it with our blood and tears he urged slaves to defend themselves by force if necessary against their masters.
his call for slave insurrection led southern states to enact or strengthen laws making it illegal to teach slaves to read.
it also marked the end of support among many southern intellectuals for colonization.
walkers death in 1830 cut short his career as an abolitionist.
although walkers radical insurrectionary appeal had little impact on mainstream abolitionists his call for immediate abolition resonated with those most eager to abolish slavery.
since the revolution mainstream abolitionist thought had adopted a gradualist approach preferring to end read the document the american antislavery society declares its sentiments abolitionism and the proslavery response slavery in a piecemeal fashion.
now abolitionists rejected gradualism in favor of immediatism an immediate end to slavery.
the most forceful spokesman for immediatism was william lloyd garrison who founded the newspaper the liberator in 1831.
in its first issue garrison announced that he had recanted the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition with other abolitionists garrison organized the new england anti slavery society in 1832.
a year later he joined 60 other delegates including men women whites and free blacks to create the american anti slavery society aass.
by 1840 more than 1 350 antislavery societies had sprung up in the north with combined memberships of 250 000.
the success of british abolitionists who in 1833 had persuaded parliament to emancipate almost all slaves in the british empire inspired american abolitionists.
in 1835 american abolitionists taking advantage of the new opportunities provided by the market revolution to get their antislavery message across began to inundate southerners with antislavery literature.
abolitionists also worked diligently in the north to raise awareness of the evils of slavery.
in addition to using traditional print forms such as newspapers and pamphlets they developed almanacs songbooks childrens books and jigsaw puzzles.
this childrens puzzle 10 4 includes scenes typical of abolitionist literature including images of slaves being whipped and brutalized.
adept at publicizing their cause abolitionists seized opportunities provided by dramatic events such as the escape of henry box brown who had mailed himself from richmond virginia to philadelphia in a wooden box 10 5.
the trip took 26 hours and brown arrived in his box in philadelphia shaken but unscathed.
abolitionists distributed images of his escape and he later toured the north with a panorama the mirror of slavery panoramas were large pictures mounted on rollers that when unfurled slowly gave the viewer the feeling that the picture was moving.
often a narrator accompanied a panorama on tour.
browns narration complemented the panoramas depiction of the history of slavery in america.
another event that triggered public interest in slavery was the unveiling of american artist hiram powerss sculpture the greek slave.
powerss popular work depicted a beautiful greek woman enslaved by the ottoman turks who were muslims.
the image of a christian woman 10 4 abolitionist puzzle abolitionists developed a variety of ways to educate northern children about the evils of slavery including jigsaw puzzles.
degraded and held captive by muslims captivated american audiences.
the nude sculpture caused a sensation in the press.
abolitionists used the attention to remind americans of the evils of slavery.
how abolitionists accomplished this and how southerners recast its meaning to reflect their views is the subject of images as history the greek slave.
the antislavery movement attracted a strong following in new england and among transplanted new englanders in the midwest particularly evangelicals.
quakers were active abolitionists too.
a few read the document david walker a black abolitionist speaks out 10 5 mailed to freedom this image of henry box brown who mailed himself to freedom was sold to help finance a speaking tour for brown who became a spokesman against slavery.
who was henry box brown.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 images as history the greek slave the vermont artist hiram powerss statue the greek slave 1844 became one of the most popular sculptures in nineteenth century america.
powers portrayed the slave stripped naked by her turkish captors chained and placed on the auction block.
religious leaders and even reviewers had denounced earlier artists who following european conventions had portrayed women in the nude but powers avoided moral censure by explaining to his audience that by depicting the dignity of the slave in the face of such cruel treatment he had clothed her in an invisible robe of virtue.
how would viewers in different parts of the nation have responded to this work of art.
how would abolitionists have interpreted its message.
how would defenders of slavery.
cities across america and small towns in new england and ohio exhibited the greek slave.
the image here shows a crowded gallery of men women and children viewing the work in new york.
besides prompting widespread commentary in the press powerss work inspired poems.
a poet in the knickerbocker magazine described the greek slave as naked yet clothed with chastity public reaction to the sculpture became entwined in the larger debate over slavery.
while southerners praised the work focusing on the theme of christian virtue northerners compared the slaves suffering to the plight of americas slaves.
one new york correspondent wondered how an audience might be driven to tears at the sight of an insensate piece of marble and yet listens unmoved to the awful story of the american slave apologists for slavery mocked such appeals.
noting that many abolitionists had waxed poetic about the greek slave one writer wondered why we have not heard of a single effort to free her from her chains.
although a nude figure would have normally been shocking the greek slave attracted huge crowds including women and children.
exhibition guides reminded viewers that the slave was clothed in christian virtue.

the two women left the south to pursue the cause of abolitionism.
the antislavery movement galvanized many women who became the grassroots activists for abolitionism.
by 1840 more than two thirds of the signers of antislavery petitions submitted to congress were women.
anti abolitionism and the abolitionist response proslavery rhetoric intensified as northern opponents of slavery employed increasingly assertive tactics.
southerners held mass rallies to denounce northern abolitionists.
garrisons newspaper the liberator was especially galling.
within a year of its first issue the georgia legislature proposed a 5 000 reward for anyone who would bring garrison to georgia for trial.
rewards were posted for bounty hunters to kidnap other prominent abolitionists and bring them to the south for trial.
the wealthy new york abolitionist arthur tappan had a price of 50 000 on his head at one point.
in july 1835 a steamship arrived in charleston carrying thousands of antislavery tracts and newspapers addressed to southerners.
angry residents grabbed the mailbags containing the northern abolitionist literature the next night 3 000 charlestonians consigned the letters to a huge bonfire.
this antislavery northern political cartoon ridiculed southerners efforts to prevent the distribution of abolitionist materials 10 6.
southern hostility did not deter abolitionists.
they began inundating congress with petitions calling for an immediate end to slavery.
southerners reacted by passing the gag rule a procedural motion that required that the house of representatives automatically table antislavery petitions and not consider them.
the gag rule passed with the support of northern and southern democrats.
the senate was unable to pass its own gag rule but it adopted a practice that produced virtually the same effect.
once the senate had received slavery petitions a proslavery senator would simply move to table them.
yet abolitionist petitions continued to pour into congress especially from womens groups.
in 1836 1837 an all female petition from massachusetts gathered 21 000 signatures a record number.
southern efforts to stymie free speech and the right to petition congress only underscored abolitionists belief that slavery was incompatible with liberty.
to leading abolitionists interference with the u s mail and congressional refusal to deal with petitions made slavery a national as opposed to a local issue.
the proslavery argument leading southerners of the revolutionary era had attacked slavery even as they continued to profit from it.
no member of the founding generation was more conflicted over slavery than thomas jefferson who told a friend in 1820 that we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go.
justice is in one scale and self preservation in the other jefferson hoped that a new generation of statesmen would eliminate slavery.
such hopes diminished however as alabama fever swept across the south and cotton agriculture transformed the american economy.
to complicate matters nat turners insurrection see chapter 9 frightened southerners who became convinced that northern abolitionists were stirring up slave insurrections.

what was the gag rule.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 in 1832 thomas r dew a young professor at the college of william and mary published his review of the debate in the virginia legislature of 1831 and 1832.
in the aftermath of nat turners rebellion the legislature had seriously debated ending slavery but a narrow majority rejected the idea.
dew repudiated the ideas of jefferson and others who agonizing over slavery considered it unjust and recommended its elimination.
dew defended the property rights of slaveholders and dismissed the impracticality of relocating emancipated slaves outside virginia.
he even claimed that slavery was a positive good sanctioned by ancient philosophers such as aristotle and justified by the bible.
in southern colleges proslavery spokesmen championed the religious philosophical and economic benefits of slavery and in the souths leading magazines they defended their new proslavery ideology.
they even argued that slavery was good not only for masters but for slaves.
southern defenders of slavery cast themselves as benevolent patriarchs slaves they argued were the lucky beneficiaries of this system.
this selfserving vision of slavery is reflected in this lithograph appropriately entitled slavery as it exists in america 10 7.
the two shocked northerners depicted express their astonishment that slaves were so well treated and happy.
the artist also singles out the evils of british factories for condemnation.
southerners often made similar points about northern industry which they argued treated its workers more brutally than southern plantation owners treated slaves.
one of the most influential apologists for southern slavery was john c calhoun an eminent south carolina politician.
he argued that the souths peculiar institution which was the term he coined for southern slavery was not an evil a cause of shame but rather a good a positive good to be championed.

the cult of true womanhood reform and womens rights the cult of true womanhood reform and womens rights women took a leading role in reform movements.
the most active reformers were members of a growing middle class.
female reformers targeted activities that threatened the family and demeaned womens family role.
prostitution was one prominent target of reformers but hardly the only social problem that attracted notice from female reformers.
they also attacked alcoholism crime illiteracy and even slavery.
the social changes brought about by the market revolution including the rise of the factory system see chapter 9 contributed to new ideas about the family and gender roles.
a new concept of domesticity and the related notion that mens and womens proper roles lay in separate spheres of activity became the cornerstone of a new middle class ideal.
society defined the public world of work and politics as male whereas the private world of home and family became womens domain.
female reformers defended the new ideal and attacked the social evils that threatened it.
the new domestic ideal horace bushnell an influential new england minister captured the profound change that transformed american economic and social life when he remarked that the transition from mother anddaughter power to water and steam power is a great one and had produced a complete revolution in domestic life one consequence of the rise of industry was a growing separation between home and workplace.
this change facilitated the rise of a new middleclass ideology that defined womens role as a separate sphere of domesticity.
a cult of true womanhood emerged in which female values were defined in opposition to the aggressive and competitive marketplace.
women were identified with piety motherhood and sexual passivity.
although this ideal was largely unattainable for rural farm women urban working class women and free black women all of whom had to work to maintain even minimal economic subsistence this middle class ideal suffused american culture.
magazines such as godeys ladys book the growing body of middle class advice literature such as catherine beechers treatise on domestic economy and the ubiquitous prints produced by currier and ives all celebrated the new domestic ideal.
lilly martin spenser the most renowned female artist of her day made the new domestic ideal a central theme in her paintings.
rather than depict her subjects in the formal settings garbed in rich velvet clothing and seated in poses borrowed from paintings of royalty and aristocracy characteristic of the family portraits favored by earlier artists spencer often chose intimate scenes of domestic life as her settings.
in domestic happiness she depicts a husband and wife standing before their two sleeping children.
the mothers hand gently touches her husband symbolizing the new domestic ideals emphasis on emotional intimacy between husband and wife 10 8.
she also appears to be gently read the document catherine beecher treatise on domestic economy 10 8 domestic happiness lily martin spencers painting captures the new ideal of domesticity in which women were assigned the role of instilling the values of piety family and sexual passivity.
how does domestic happiness represent the ideal of the family.

controlling sexuality the new ideal of domesticity emphasized emotional control including control of sexuality.
in 1834 lydia finney the wife of charles finney established the new york female moral reform society to champion moral purity.
by 1837 the society had 15 000 members and branches across new england and new york state.
it focused on the problem of urban prostitution.
estimates vary but in some urban areas such as new york city prostitution was the second largest industry in the city well ahead of publishing brewing and baking see envisioning evidence the economics and geography of vice in midnineteenth century new york chapter 9.
the members of the society even visited brothels to urge the fallen women to abandon their involvement in commercial sex.
sometimes reformers tried to shame the male clients of the prostitutes by publishing their names in the press.
the society also lobbied to criminalize prostitution.
although they could be closed if they created a public nuisance most brothels easily avoided legal entanglements and plied their trade without fear of prosecution.
the reformer sylvester graham formulated a farreaching critique of sexuality.
in his widely reprinted lectures on chastity 1834 graham advised his which reform movements attracted antebellum woman.
readers to avoid sexual overstimulation recommending that they take more exercise in the open air and use the cold bath under proper circumstances he also believed that diet contributed to overstimulation producing a variety of physical and psychological ailments.
his followers abandoned stimulants such as tea coffee and alcohol replacing them with a bland diet built around whole grain breads and crackers the forerunner of graham crackers.
followers of graham could obtain information about bland diets from the graham journal of health and longevity or they could attend graham clubs at college or live in boarding houses committed to grahams rules.
a follower of grahams who set off on a different path mary gove became interested in womens reproductive rights and health.
she traveled across america lecturing to women about their bodies.
her lectures to ladies on anatomy and physiology 1842 included an image of a female skeleton kneeling in prayer on its frontispiece 10 9.
gove argued that the idea that women were passionless was a direct result of her enslaved and unhealthy conditions she later married the health reformer thomas low nichols and the two promoted health reform and womans rights issues.
paulina wright another lecturer on womens health carried around an anatomically correct female mannequin to help demonstrate issues relevant to sexual and reproductive health.
her lectures sometimes proved shocking causing some to faint or even run from the room interest in sexuality emerged out of a general concern to reform society and behavior.
womans involvement in antebellum reform led some to examine the values institutions and political forces that justified the oppression and exploitation of women.
the path toward seneca falls women had already been active in political and moral reform movements including opposition to president jacksons policy of indian removal see chapter 8 temperance and the crusade against prostitution.
participation in these movements had led women to organize themselves speak out in public and question the underlying political legal and social values that contributed to their oppression.
many women were drawn to the antislavery movement which further radicalized many female reformers.
of the almost 70 000 signatures on antislavery petitions submitted to congress in 1837 1838 more than two thirds were womens.
organizations such as the philadelphia female anti slavery society 1833 provided women with unprecedented read the document lucretia mott declaration of sentiments and resolutions womens rights convention seneca falls new york the cult of true womanhood reform and womens rights opportunities to become actors in one of the most important political dramas of the day.
involvement in the antislavery cause could be a harrowing experience.
the virulent hatred abolitionists faced even in the north did not make exemptions for gender.
in 1838 the anti slavery convention of american women refused to exclude black women from its meetings.
an antiabolitionist crowd then stormed the building and torched it.
support for abolitionism also led many women to question their legal status as women.
a turning point in the relationship between antislavery and womens rights occurred in 1840 when american reformers elizabeth cady stanton and lucretia mott attended an international antislavery conference in london.
the female delegates were not allowed to speak at the event and were forced to sit behind an opaque screen out of view of the other delegates.
incensed by their treatment in london stanton and mott saw the oppression of women as an evil requiring the same attention as the oppression of slavery.
stanton was born into a prosperous family.
her father was a prominent lawyer who became a state supreme court judge.
she spent hours reading law books in her fathers office.
what most galled stanton was the english common law doctrine of coverture which treated a woman as legally dead once married.
american law had inherited this concept which meant that a husband would control any property a woman might have owned before her marriage and all of the wealth gained during their marriage.
in 1837 thomas herttell introduced a bill into the new york legislature to give married women more control over their property.
eleven years later the legislature passed a landmark married womens property act that allowed women to retain control of their inherited property.
stanton helped win approval for this law.
the law did not give married women full control of any wealth or property they gathered during marriage but it was an important step forward.
the year 1848 was a momentous one in the history of womens rights.
in the same year that new york adopted the married womens property act supporters of womens rights gathered in seneca falls new york not far from rochester for a historic meeting.
the organizers of the convention were stanton and mott two veterans of moral reform and abolitionism.
about 300 men and women including noted african american abolitionist frederick douglass assembled in a church for the seneca falls convention during the history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman declaration of sentiments and resolutions of the seneca falls new york womens rights convention 1848 which a womens rights manifesto modeled on the declaration of independence was drafted.
the declaration of sentiments and resolutions declared that all men and women are created equal it noted that women were denied economic opportunities legal rights and access to education.
it also asserted that it is the duty of women of this country to secure themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise seneca falls prompted more than two dozen other such meetings in the next 12 years.
the ardent abolitionist newspaper founded by frederick douglass not only applauded the actions of the convention but also exhorted abolitionists to embrace womens rights alongside their opposition to slavery.
the mainstream press however was less sympathetic.
one newspaper mistakenly concluded that the declaration of sentiments was a parody of the declaration of independence not an attempt to appropriate its language for women.
forty percent of american newspapers printed negative accounts of seneca falls but 29 percent were favorable.
although still opposed by most americans womens rights had become a topic of national conversation for the first time.
the declaration of sentiments would become a foundational text for all subsequent efforts to promote equal rights for american women.
in stantons view the women who gathered in upstate new york in a modest church had instigated a rebellion such as the world had never seen before the womens rights question caused a major schism in the abolitionist movement.
in 1840 delegates to the american anti slavery society aass debated whether women could hold office in the organization.
william lloyd garrison a supporter of womens rights outmaneuvered his opponents and emerged victorious on this question.
however abolitionists opposed to linking the cause with womens rights responded by resigning from the aass.

chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 religious and secular utopianism as many mainstream religious groups preached the necessity of reform and worked to change american society certain sectarian groups sought a radical transformation of american society.
in some cases these groups were attempting to create a heaven on earth literally preparing the way for christs return.
the movement for reform also spawned a variety of different secular utopian movements.
both religious and secular groups engaged in bold forms of social experimentation.
many groups abolished private property and embraced some form of socialist or communist ideals abandoning the idea of private property.
10 10 millerite william millers prediction that the millennium would arrive in march 1843 prompted this satirical image of one of his followers preparing for the apocalypse by stocking up on cheese and crackers.
millennialism perfectionism and religious utopianism millennialism the belief that the millennium was imminent and that judgment day would soon follow attracted many followers in the mid nineteenth century.
some believers even named the date of christs return to establish how did the shakers recast the idea of the family.
the millennium.
the followers of william miller called millerites predicted that christ would return in march 1843.
when that prediction failed to come true miller prophesied a new date october 22 1844.
again the millennium failed to materialize.
the movement collapsed soon after the revised prediction also proved false.
indeed the failure of the millerites to predict the true date for the millennium inspired humor.
this satirical picture of a millerite depicts a man prepared to lock himself in a trunk together with crackers cheese and plenty to drink emergency provisions which might come in handy in the chaos that would precede the apocalypse before judgment day.
the sardonic image captures the popular reaction to millers failed predictions 10 10.
but aspects of millers teachings survived and were later incorporated into the seventh day adventists another nineteenthcentury religious sect one that celebrated saturday not sunday as their day of worship.
the united society of believers in christs second appearing or shakers created a successful religious utopia establishing settlements across the nation and attracting religious and secular utopianism thousands of followers.
the shaker faith was shaped by the teachings of mother ann lee an eighteenthcentury religious figure who adapted quaker teachings in light of her own experience and revelations.
the wife of an abusive husband whose four children died during infancy she experienced a revelation that sex itself was the root of human evil.
her followers became known as shaking quakers or shakers because their religious worship involved an ecstatic form of dance that one contemporary described as including extravagant postures and fantastic contortions the sect also adopted a strict rule of celibacy.
mother anns vision of christianity not only transformed ideas about sexuality but also radically recast gender roles.
she preached that god was a combination of the masculine and feminine a radical teaching given the strongly patriarchal character of most protestant theology in the nineteenth century.
judged by the standards of the day the shakers came closer to the idea of equality of the sexes than almost any other group in america.
within the shaker community there were only brothers and sisters neither husbands and wives nor mothers and fathers.
abandoning procreation the shakers grew only by taking in orphans and converting new members.
the shakers radically reconfigured the meaning of the family unit rejecting the ideal of domesticity and marriage itself.
see competing visions reactions to shaker gender roles.
shakers not only rejected the values of domesticity and mainstream attitudes toward family life but they also developed a complex relationship with the growing market economy around them.
thus while shakers participated in the expanding market economy they did not internalize its competitive values.
within the shaker community there was no private property.
shaker communities practiced a form of christian communism.
to support the community they sold a variety of goods to outsiders.
shaker craftsmen developed a reputation as skilled furniture makers and shakers sold agricultural products including seeds to eager consumers.
the shakers were hardly the only radical religious experiment that rejected the values of the market place and the traditional ideal of the family.
one of the most radical utopian leaders was john humphrey noyes.
a yale educated congregationalist minister noyes took the idea of perfectionism a doctrine that had evolved from methodism in a novel direction.
earlier perfectionists had argued that one could attain a perfect state of holiness.
read the document john noyes on free love at oneida that did not mean that a person was completely free from sin but rather that one had attained the highest level of spiritual perfection consistent with human nature.
in 1840 noyes created the putney association and by 1844 the small group was practicing a form of christian communism in which like the shakers all property was commonly owned.
the association included 37 people who worshiped together in a small chapel lived in three houses farmed and maintained a store.
in 1846 noyes took his theory of perfectionism in a new direction.
if one attained a state of religious perfection and could not sin then he argued one could be free of many laws enacted to deal with humans fallen sinful state.
marriage and monogamy were two such ideals.
noyess restructuring of the family and new ideas about sexuality ran afoul of the dominant views of marriage he was indicted for adultery in vermont but fled to upstate new york to oneida.
there noyes instituted the practice of complex marriage in which any man or woman who had experienced saving grace was free to engage in sexual relations with any other person of the opposite sex.
given their commitment to free love birth control became an important concern of the community.
noyes began to preach the necessity of something he called male continence a primitive form of natural birth control that required that men engage in sex acts without consummating them.
his views mirrored those of other nineteenth century medical reformers such as sylvester graham who believed that it was important for men to conserve their bodily fluids.
eventually the oneida community embraced a form of eugenics a theory that advocated using selective mating to produce superior children and thereby improve humanity.
at oneida only the most spiritually perfect were allowed to consummate their sexual unions and produce children.
the interior of the oneida mansion house was organized to facilitate the idea of complex marriage by weakening notions of privacy.
the tent room on the third floor replaced private rooms with semiprivate enclosures blocked off by cotton cloth.
the tent room increased the sociality of members and reduced the cold isolation of traditional apartments.
although the practice of complex marriage was radically different from the celibacy practiced by the shakers both groups sought to reconfigure the family sexuality and their relationship to the market economy.
although each group what did the oneida community believe.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 competing visions reactions to shaker gender roles the unique religious practices of the shakers drew many comments.
for americans nothing was more remarkable than the shakers reconfiguration of traditional gender roles and the family.
travelers including the english novelist charles dickens home grown literary figures such as nathaniel hawthorne and a variety of journalists toured shaker communities and commented on the sects unique practices and habitations.
in the shaker bridal nathaniel hawthorne recounts the plight of two young lovers martha and adam who give up their chance for earthly love to join the shakers.
rather than transcend earthly suffering and reach a higher spiritual level however her decision to forsake conventional marriage ultimately leaves her despondent and an object of pity.
the following account of a visit to new york shakers in 1829 paints a different portrait of life and love among this utopian community.
this visitor did not encounter a repressed and puritanical religion but something close to a religious utopia.
the brothers and sisters in this view had traded the suffering of the world for their own vision of heaven on earth i have bidden you to join your hands said he not in earthly affection for ye have cast off its chains forever but as brother and sister in spiritual love and helpers of one another in your allotted task.
teach unto others the faith which ye have received.
the aged father sank back exhausted and the surrounding elders deemed with good reason that the hour was come when the new heads of the village must enter on their patriarchal duties.
in their attention to father ephraim their eyes were turned from martha pierson who grew paler and paler unnoticed even by adam colburn.

it is impossible to describe the air of tranquility and comfort that diffuses itself over a shaker settlement.
it is no matter what the enemies of such peaceful unoffending communities may say about them.
the acute observer of human manners will testify for them that they do not live after the manner of world.

n what do reactions to shaker gender roles reveal about ninteenth century american values.
religious and secular utopianism approached the family and sex from different perspectives both groups embraced communal ownership of property and although differing in means they both also attempted to free women from traditional gender roles.

joseph smith the founder of the church of jesus christ of the latter day saints or mormonism created another model of a religious utopia.
smith grew up in western new york where the fires of the great awakening burned hot.
in this evangelical milieu he had a revelation on which mormonism was based.
according to the book of mormon in 1823 an angel steered him to a set of golden tablets written in an ancient language.
with divine help smith deciphered the tablets which told of the travails of a lost tribe of israelites who had settled in america and who mormons believed were the ancestors of native americans.
the book of mormon was published in palmyra new york in 1830 and this town became the site of one of the earliest mormon communities.
the belief that the indians were actually descendants of a lost tribe of hebrews was not unique to the mormons.
the theory attracted attention from several prominent religious authors of the time.
smiths treasure hunting was also not that unusual spurred on by popular stories about buried treasures gathered by ancient indian civilizations.
smith was influenced by the widespread belief that the millennium was at hand bringing with it an end to debt and the return of christ and a new era of peace happiness and prosperity.
the revelations detailed by smith struck a resonant chord with small farmers tradesmen and mechanics whose experience with the expanding market economy had been largely negative.
smiths new revelation attracted thousands of followers.
mormons set up their own community in kirtland ohio and then a larger community at nauvoo illinois.
the mormons did not go as far as the shakers or oneidians in embracing communism but they had a strong communal economic ethic.
smiths 1831 law of consecration urged mormons to deed their land to the church which would distribute it among the faithful and retain any surplus.
secular utopias secular utopia also attracted individuals frustrated with american society.
hostility to the market revolution provided inspiration for a variety of socialist utopian communities.
robert owens new harmony in indiana was one such ambitious experiment.
a successful textile mill owner who began his career in scotland owen was worried about the impact of industrialization on society and hoped to create an ideal community built on a socialist model.
despite early enthusiasm his community lasted only three years.
the french theorist charles fourier provided a more popular socialist alternative including a utopian theory of phalanxes ideal communities organized around socialist ideals that gained a considerable following in the 1840s.
indeed between 1841 and 1846 25 of these phalanxes popped up across new england new york and the midwest.
rather than accept the values of the marketplace fourier championed the ideas of association and cooperation individual communities divided the profits produced by agricultural labor or goods manufactured at the phalanx among the members according to a formula that included the amount invested a persons skills and the amount of his or her physical labor.
fouriers socialist theories also questioned traditional gender roles.
in his view social progress occurred in direct proportion to the advance of women toward liberty women in fourierist communities enjoyed equal pay and equal opportunities with men and benefited from under our system of isolated and separate households with separate interests and separate pursuits instead of association and combination among families there is the most deplorable waste which is one of the primary sources of the general poverty that exists and discord antagonism selfishness and an anti social spirit are engendered albert brisbane american fourierist concise exposition of the doctrine of association 1843 why did mormon values appeal to farmers and other small producers in the era of the market revolution.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 choices and consequences mary cragins experiment in free love at oneida mary cragin and her husband george were among the many americans influenced by charles grandison finneys religious leadership in the second great awakening.
george worked for a reform paper in new york the advocate of moral reform as an office manager and accountant.
he showed his wife a copy of a letter written by john humphrey noyes which introduced mary to noyess ideas of perfectionism.
mary and her husband were both taken with this doctrine and moved to vermont.
noyes began his experiment in communism in love at putney.
as a member of his first perfectionist community at the putney vermont community mary cragin faced a choice either leave the community or participate in its bold new experiment in free love.
choices persuade her husband to leave the community with her.
leave regardless of her husbands decision.
stay with her husband and participate in noyess system of complex marriage.
decision mary chose option 3 to stay at putney with her husband and participate in a complex marriage with noyes and others.
consequences mary eagerly embraced noyess theory and eventually traveled with her husband and others to oneida becoming founding members of that community.
in the published comments in the first annual report of oneida community association 1849 she declared that her life at oneida brought her closer to god than anything else she had ever done.
she died a year later when the boat she was traveling on capsized.
continuing controversies why would a nineteenth century woman be attracted to utopian movements that rejected mainstream views of the family and marriage.
modern scholars are divided over the impact of bible communism and complex marriage on womens lives.
some argue that compared to the restrictive and oppressive environment most women faced in american society oneida provided women with more power control over their sexual lives and equality.
although not a feminist utopia oneidas system of complex marriage was liberating in many ways for women.
others view oneida as just another form of female oppression.
the limited choices granted to women did not end male power and authority.
at oneida men continued to dominate womens lives controlling their sexual and reproductive choices.
why might a woman like mary cragin have been drawn to the oneida community.

an egalitarian attitude toward sex that was unusual for its time.
as the map 10 11 shows utopian experiments both secular and religious were scattered across the united states.
a host of other smaller utopian experiments were also attempted during this period.
at brook farm a community in massachusetts near boston manual labor was supplemented by activities to encourage intellectual improvement and social intercourse calculated to refine and expand the mind and soul.
nathaniel hawthorne used his brief residence in the community as the basis for his novel the blithedale romance.
like brook farm bronson alcotts utopian community fruitlands emphasized balancing manual and intellectual labor and communal ownership.
but in contrast to brook farm view the map interactive map utopian communities before the civil war although the desire of acquiring the good things of this world is the prevailing passion of the american people here and there in the midst of american society sects arise which endeavor to strike out extraordinary paths to eternal happiness alexis de tocqueville democracy in america 1835 dietary restrictions were an important part of this utopia.
fruitlands members were not only vegetarian but also ate only aspiring vegetables those that grew upward reaching up for the supreme truths.
potatoes beets and carrots which grew downward were forbidden.
one utopian community tried to tackle the problem of race directly.
francis wright a scottish abolitionist founded nashoba an interracial cooperative near memphis tennessee to demonstrate the potential for blacks and whites to live together as equals.
at nashoba slaves were to be given a formal education and allowed to earn enough to purchase their freedom.
however wrights more radical ideas included the abolition of the nuclear family religion and private property.
the community lasted only four years.
what geographical patterns are evident from this map of utopian communities.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 literature and popular culture the danger posed by the tyranny of the majority a subject explored in some detail by alexis de tocqueville in democracy in america attracted the attention of intellectuals and writers such as ralph waldo emerson a harvard trained minister who rejected orthodox religion in favor of philosophical exploration.
emersons essays beginning with his manifesto the american scholar enjoined americans to wake up reject the latest fashions of the marketplace and discover the deeper philosophical truths to be found in nature and selfreflection.
within two decades of emersons address nathaniel hawthorne published the scarlet letter 1850 herman melville moby dick 1851 henry david thoreau walden 1854 and walt whitman leaves of grass 1855.
the vigorous intellectual and poetic activity of these writers and thinkers constituted a veritable american renaissance.
some of the best known works of these literary giants explored the problems of american society in a fictional setting.
although a few literary figures crafted rich and sophisticated works of fiction and poetry many now forgotten writers marketed their books to the growing mass audience of readers.
many popular works depicted lurid tales of city life including murder and prostitution.
the marketplace also adapted to the intellectual ferment of the era by creating new institutions devoted to presenting to the people lectures by leading intellectuals including emerson.
in addition to hearing literary figures such as emerson one might also learn about the latest intellectual fads including phrenology a pseudo science that purported to enable practitioners to discern a persons character and intellect from the shape of his or her head.
finally architects explored a variety of different building styles hoping that improvements in the built environment would lead to moral and spiritual uplift.
in some cases architects turned to the lessons of the past looking to the styles of antiquity greek temples or egyptian monuments for inspiration.
those seeking a more exalted and spiritual ideal turned to the medieval period for models.
these ideas influenced everything from cemetery design to country farm houses.
literature and social criticism emersons american scholar address marked the beginning of one of the greatest periods of american literary achievement.
emerson became the leading exponent of the philosophy of transcendentalism a loose set of ideas that looked to nature for inspiration and insights.
the other leading literary figure associated with this movement was henry david thoreau.
in his masterpiece walden thoreau decried the impact of the market on american society.
ostensibly a tale of his effort to get back to nature walden asserted that the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.
the greater part of what my neighbors call good i believe in my soul to be bad only by rejecting the numbing conformity of american society the tyranny of the majority and the worldly values of the how did thoreau hawthorne and melville respond to the market revolution.
marketplace could americans rekindle the divine spark in each person.
other american literary figures turned a critical eye to american history and society.
nathaniel hawthorne parodied the excesses of utopian movements in the blithedale romance and explored the shakers views of the family in the shaker bridal see competing visions reactions to shaker gender roles.
in the celestial railroad he took aim at the connections between revivalism and the market revolution.
in this tale an updating of the christian story of the religious pilgrims search for salvation hawthorne provided his spiritual seeker with a comfortable seat on a railroad coach.
rather than patiently wait until arriving at the heavenly city the trains final stop most of the travelers prefer to exit at vanity fair a glittering city that was an epitome of whatever is brilliant gay and literature and popular culture fascinating although they failed to achieve salvation the residents of vanity fair were well supplied with clergy churches and lecturers on the latest topics of discussion and the stores sold the most fashionable goods.
herman melvilles epic novel moby dick told the story of captain ahabs pursuit of a great white whale.
a rich and complex novel ahabs quest provided another metaphor for the search for meaning spiritual fulfillment and truth by those working within an economic system that increasingly treated people as commodities.
as was true for hawthorne melvilles writing grappled with the alienation of americans resulting from the economic changes wrought by the market revolution.
one group melville discussed was the new expanding middle class of clerks for whom ocean reveries provided an escape from their dreary lives.
melville wrote of these cogs in the great machine of industry tied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks melvilles own experiences at sea not only provided him with details for his tale of the great white whale but also allowed him to escape the fate of those clerks trapped at their desks that he chronicled in his writing.
indeed one of melvilles most famous literary creations was a lowly and alienated clerk bartleby the scrivener a man drained of all creativity and energy who symbolized how commerce could turn individuals into utterly passive victims of larger social and economic forces.
bartleby responds to every request from his employer with the same bored refrain i would prefer not to susana warners the wide wide world 1850 sold more than 40 000 copies in its first year and was reprinted 67 times.
this tale of an orphaned but resourceful child who must find her way in the wider world recast the traditional tale of the christian pilgrim on the road to salvation in terms of the ideals of middle class domesticity.
by discovering her inner strength the heroine demonstrates her talents and virtues.
after proving her determination and character she finds a virtuous man whom she weds thus fulfilling the ideal of domesticity.
this general plotline carries through most of the eras works of sentimental writing and domestic fiction.
domestic fiction mirrored the same cultural values that led to the creation of the first popular board game in american history the mansion of happiness ann abbott the daughter of a massachusetts minister invented the game in 1843.
players traveled along a spiral board that led to the mansion of happiness at the center.
if they landed on such desirable spaces as temperance piety and chastity they could move forward.
landing on a space such as idleness sent the player backward.
rather than use dice which were associated with the evil of gambling players used a numbered top to determine how many spaces to move on a turn 10 12.
the game 10 12 the mansion of happiness modern style board games were invented during the period of the market revolution and moral reform to instill values into children.
this popular board game embodied many of the ideals of domestic fiction and prints.
the game sets players on a journey along a path toward piety in which they must avoid sin if they hope to finally arrive at the mansion of happiness.
domestic fiction board games and crime stories many popular writers of hawthorne and melvilles day were women which prompted hawthorne to lash out angrily at the damned mob of scribbling women whose books often sold in the hundreds of thousands many more copies than authors of serious fiction such as hawthorne ever sold.
indeed women had written the top five bestsellers by mid century.
women favored sentimental writing and domestic fiction which were immensely popular.

chapter 10 10 13 first edition of douglass narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave 1845 the eloquence of douglass led some to suggest that his account of his own escape from slavery could not have been written by an exslave.
to underscore that the book was genuine an image of douglass and a copy of his signature are prominently displayed alongside the title page.
revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 shared the ideals of popular prints such as the way of good and evil which also imagined life as a journey along a path between piety and sin see page 283.
although domestic fiction and games such as the mansion of happiness popularized the domestic values esteemed by reformers there was also a market for stories about the very evils these works advised americans to avoid lest they wind up in prison or the asylum.
the new penny press included a host of papers such as the national police gazette and the new york sun whose pages were filled with tales of crime and moral depravity.
literature embraced the sordid as much as the spiritual and crime fiction was especially popular.
george lippards the quaker city or the monks of monk hall a romance of philadelphia life mystery and crime 1845 spun a lurid tale that explored the evils of urban life.
in contrast to susana warner lippard imbued his tale of seduction murder and intrigue with a subtle classconscious critique of the debauched elites who gathered in a dilapidated old mansion monks hall filled with secret passages and murder victims.
the one writer who managed to transform such gothic tales of crime and horror into high art was edgar allan poe.
in stories such as the tell tale heart and the black cat poe explored the psychological dimensions of crime.
why did douglass need to prove that he was the author of his autobiography.
his taut gripping stories were models of literary craftsmanship.
poe brought the techniques of high literature to bear on topics that were usually the province of popular writers.
slaves tell their story slavery in american literature while the writers of the american renaissance were formulating their critique of american society other voices were also entering the expanding literary marketplace.
accounts published by runaway slaves described the brutality of slavery.
the most famous and influential slave autobiography was frederick douglasss narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave published in 1845.
more than 30 000 copies sold within a decade of its publication.
douglass awakened americans to the injustice of slavery by exposing the cruelties of it as i had myself felt them the accuracy of his account was a key element of its appeal but critics questioned his books authenticity.
douglass thus went to great lengths to prove that it was not an abolitionist hoax.
indeed douglass worried that his eloquence might itself be used as proof that a former slave could not have written the book.

jacobs had escaped to freedom in 1842 but it took almost another two decades for her to improve her writing to the point where she could publish an account of her ordeal under slavery.
she described her purpose in writing in forceful terms i have not written my experiences in order to attract attention to myself on the contrary literature and popular culture it would have been more pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history undaunted she felt compelled to add my testimony to that of abler pens to convince the people of the free states what slavery really is.
jacobss account of her life particularly the firsthand accounts of the sexual predations of white southerners on black women exposed the plight of female slaves.
lyceums and lectures josiah holbrook a teacher and lecturer began the lyceum movement in 1826.
named after the place in ancient athens where the philosopher aristotle lectured to his pupils the lyceum movement provided a forum for public lectures and debates on intellectual issues.
by 1834 more than 3 000 lyceums appeared in towns and cities across america.
as transportation improved with the rise of the railroad the lyceum movement created a national market for speakers on topics of general interest.
an especially popular lecture topic was phrenology a pseudoscience that focused on the relationship between the bumps and shape of the human head and character and personality.
americans could pay to have their heads analyzed by phrenologists at salons in major cities and towns.
by the 1850s the american phrenological journal had a circulation of more than 50 000.
phrenology became an american obsession in the mid nineteenth century.
phrenological heads made of plaster or ceramic were commonplace decorations in many american homes prompting the boston christian examiner in 1834 to complain that heads of chalk inscribed with mystic numbers disfigured every mantelpiece few of these were as striking as this impressive folk sculpture of a young girls head with the different zones of the cranium colored according to phrenological theory 10 14.
phrenology also attracted the notice of many leading public figures such as supreme court justice joseph story the moral reformer horace mann and the artist hiram powers.
godeys ladys book even advised women to use hats and other head coverings to hide or accentuate their phrenological character.
phrenology appealed to americans at a time when the nation was experiencing rapid change.
in particular it spoke to the fears of urban americans who increasingly lived and worked in a world filled with strangers.
the new market economy opened up countless opportunities for swindlers and rogues prompting a new term confidence man someone who exploited a strangers trust to fleece him of his property or money.
although one might dress like a member of the respectable middle class appearances were often deceiving and the rise of the confidence man was symbolic of the danger posed by the anonymous world of the market.
phrenology promised to allow one to see beyond appearances into a persons true character and thus past the masks and disguises of confidence men 10 14 phrenological head this colorful folk sculpture of a young girls head included hand painted zones that phrenologists believed controlled human emotion and behavior.
why was phrenology so popular during this period.

holyoke this dramatic cole landscape not only captures the wild power of nature a common theme in coles paintings but it contrasts this untamed natural world with a more placid pastoral world represented by the rich agricultural lands of the connecticut valley.
in honor of the opening of the erie canal a young artist named thomas cole staged an exhibition of landscape paintings that became an immediate sensation.
organizers of the show declared that the artists work had equaled those works which have been the boast of europe coles work would adorn our houses with the american prospects and american skies while writers such as emerson and thoreau extolled nature in prose painters such as cole captured its majesty in color on canvas.
the appreciation for nature influenced the design of urban parks and cemeteries.
reform also prompted americans to embrace architectural styles that would help transform society.
cemetery designers and prison reformers turned to ancient egypt for inspiration.
architectural reform even influenced phrenologists who championed the octagon as the perfect housing form.
landscape painting the artist thomas cole became one of americas most prominent painters.
coles landscapes became a symbol of america and its uniqueness.
for those eager to defend american culture against its european critics coles cause became the cause of america.
what does coles painting reveal about american views of nature.
an art critic noted that coles work proved that american art need not embrace the artificial beauty depicted in so much european art nature needs no fictitious charms the eye requires no borrowed assistance from the memory in 1835 in his essay on american scenery cole wrote that the most distinctive and perhaps most impressive characteristic of american scenery is its wilderness many of the themes that would become hallmarks of coles work are evident in his dramatic painting view from mt.
holyoke 10 15 cole contrasts a stormy natural landscape with the more placid panorama of the rich farm lands of the connecticut river valley.
cole places himself in the midst of the wild mountain landscape nestled between two rock outcroppings to underscore his belief that nature is the true inspiration for artistic creativity.
natures nation in this age when.
what is sometimes called improvement in its march makes us fear that the bright and tender flowers of the imagination shall all be crushed beneath its iron tramp it would be well to cultivate the oasis that yet remains to us and thus preserve the germs of a future and purer system thomas cole essay on american scenary 1835 1836 parks and cemeteries when cole and other landscape painters were celebrating nature america was undergoing one of its first great waves of urbanization.
as agriculture became more efficient americans from the countryside streamed into the nations growing cities.
while many urban homes boasted a currier and ives print of an idyllic rural setting a more concrete effort was made to bring nature itself to the city.
the creation of urban parks as retreats from the hustle and bustle of city life and a radically new approach to designing cemeteries were two highly visible results of the desire to preserve nature in the midst of rapid urbanization.
new yorks central park geographically at the center of manhattan island but originally situated at the edge of the city was the most ambitious and visible effort to bring the country to the city.
designed by frederick law olmsted and calvert vaux in 1857 and officially opened two years later central park sought to bring a varied country landscape including meadows rolling hills lakes and woodlands to urban dwellers.
to preserve the calming views the designers sunk roadways beneath the line of sight of most strollers 10 16.
for many upper and middle class protestant reformers central park was intended to help civilize the citys workers and immigrants.
these reformers believed that strolls through the different country 10 16 central park to maintain its country like setting the roads running through central park were sunk below the line of sight.
what was the rural cemetery movement.
chapter 10 revivalism reform and artistic renaissance 1820 1850 10 17 mount auburn the rural cemetery movement aimed to bring the country to the city and honor the dead by creating places of repose and reflection.

settings would spiritually uplift those whose lives were degraded by industrial life and whose private lives were confined to the squalid conditions of areas such as five points.
championed by new yorks elite and designed with middle class values in mind the land for much of the park was acquired by displacing irish immigrants and destroying one of the citys most long established african american communities.
mount auburn cemetery in cambridge massachusetts just outside of boston reflected the new view of cemeteries.

in contrast to earlier graveyards or burial grounds designers made the new cemeteries associated with the rural cemetery movement such as mount auburn places of repose for both the living and the dead.
as this painting 10 17 of a couple strolling through the landscaped terrain of mount auburn suggests the repose and sacred loveliness of natural beauty made the cemetery a destination for nearby city dwellers who wished to experience the ennobling effects of nature.
it soon became a major tourist attraction with as many as 30 000 visitors per year traveling to boston to see mount auburn.
its success led to the creation of other cemeteries designed to provide urban dwellers with places of reflection and repose.
the rural cemetery movement inspired an important architectural change.
architects looking for inspiration to represent death found it in ancient egypts pyramids other monumental structures and its funeral practices.

shaker millenial laws 1821 from ancient egypt the obelisk.
mount auburn and other cemeteries also included egyptianrevival entrances that borrowed architectural elements from ancient egyptian temples including the giant pylons that framed them.
the egyptian revival also inspired architects working on other public buildings mainly those with a grim purpose including philadelphias debtors prison and new jerseys state prison.
new york citys prison officially named the halls of justice was nicknamed the tombs because of its forbidding egyptian revival faade.
revival and reform in american architecture egypt was not the only ancient culture that inspired american architects and designers in the 1830s.
andrew jacksons rise to power in 1828 had reflected and facilitated a broad democratization of society see chapter 8.
the democratization of american life coincided with greeces war for independence from the ottoman empire that began in 1821.
the greek independence movement seemed analogous to americas own struggle against britain.
not surprisingly american culture developed a fascination with greece the birthplace of democracy.
as a result greek revival was a popular style of architecture interior design and dress during the 1820s and 1830s.
as a contemporary noted a perfect mania for the grecian orders pervaded american society and required that every building from the shop of the tradesmen to the church and the capitol must be grecian simple farmhouses were adorned with classical columns and pediments giving their doorways the appearance of mini greek temples.
the rage for all things greek also shaped the way americans designed and decorated their homes.
furniture in this period was fashioned to resemble ancient greek styles often including decorative motifs drawn from greece such as urns and classical pillars.
the obsession with ancient greece literally transformed the map of the united states.
across america cities and towns sprung up with greek names western new york alone along and near the erie canal saw the appearance of cities named troy ithaca utica and syracuse.
harriet martineau an english novelist who published accounts of her experiences in america feared that americas youth would grow up thinking that utica carthage athens palmyra and troy were simply names of towns in western new york rather than the great cities of antiquity and the cradles of western civilization.
ohio and georgia each had its athens.
although many americans embraced greek revival many utopian sects rejected mainstream architectural designs and the furnishings that accompanied them.
no group was more self conscious about the connection between architecture furnishings and reform than the shakers.
shaker buildings were sparsely furnished and shaker furniture embodied their ideal of simplicity.
the millennial law 1823 of the shakers a set of rules that governed shaker communities prescribed the styles of furniture including permissible colors and forbade designs that were merely for fancy the shakerss rejection of the dominant styles of the day is evident if one contrasts the furnishing and design of a typical shaker sitting room and a greek revival parlor in a prosperous home 10 18 and 10 19 on page 312.
the plush cushioned furniture and intricately carved furniture of the greek revival room contrast with the ascetic style of the shaker room.
shaker furniture was devoid of ornamentation and highly functional embodying the ideal of simplicity itself.
the power of architecture to transform and uplift individuals inspired reformers to propose using architecture to mold american character and thereby what was the greek revival.

reform american society.
two of the most influential architectural reformers were andrew jackson downing and alexander jackson davis who in the 1840s and 1850s helped popularize the gothic revival which looked to medieval europe for inspiration.
downing authored two popular works on architecture in the early 1840s that went through 20 editions.
downing believed that a properly designed home should serve as a spiritual sanctuary from the commercial world of the market.
his gothic revival homes which incorporated medieval architectural elements such as pointed arches were meant to uplift those who dwelled in them and inspire those who saw them by literally guiding their gaze toward heaven.
the gothic revival also drew on renewed interest in nature that had inspired painters such as thomas cole and the designers of mount auburn cemetery.
rather than embrace the regularity and balance of greek classicism enthusiasts for gothic revival championed a more organic and variegated style that mimicked the irregularities of nature.
at one level the gothic revival was part of the larger reaction against the excesses of jacksonian democracy.
its leading champions such as downing and davis also rejected the democratic values of the greek revival believing that architecture should underscore social position not seek to erase it.
davis believed that housing ought to announce ones what does shaker furniture reveal about shaker values.
status villas for the upper classes cottages for the middle class and farmhouses for the working classes.
he helped plan the nations first suburbs including llewellyn park in orange new jersey.
lyndhurst in tarrytown new york was an opulent gothic revival villa.
compared to the symmetry of greek revival buildings the irregular roofline and different shaped windows of lyndhurst evoked the unpredictability of nature 10 20.
the popular phrenologist orson s fowler championed octagon shaped houses as a cure for americas social ills 10 21.
building on his phrenological theories fowler attacked box like homes and argued that by more closely approximating a circle the octagon encouraged harmony.
although most of these houses were built in the northeast octagon houses dotted the american landscape from watertown wisconsin to natchez mississippi.
unlike reformers who feared progress and believed that the expansion of the market threatened american values fowler believed that the march of civilization was inevitable.
americans needed to accept acquisitiveness as crucial to the marketplace while tempering it with insights gained from new areas of knowledge such as phrenology.
the octagon house he believed would serve both goals admirably well.
the octagon fad dissipated when phrenologys pseudoscientific doctrines were discredited.

the war had profound consequences for the issue of slavery.
by facilitating westward expansion and bringing new lands into american possession the mexican war complicated american politics by making slavery a central issue in national life.
by 1840 all the land east of the mississippi except the territories of florida and wisconsin had been organized into new states but americans remained hungry for land.
many had come to believe that america was destined to conquer and settle the entire north american continent from the atlantic ocean to the pacific.
as a result tens of thousands of americans migrated west in search of land and opportunity.
some went along the overland trail to the pacific northwest others came with the large mormon migration to the great salt lake.

during the early nineteenth century american fur traders had engaged in a lucrative trade with western indian tribes.
the interactions between the traders and indians created a middle ground see chapter 3 in which trade and cultural interaction prospered.
by the early 1830s however this distinctive multiracial society was in decline.
the fur trade declined as over trapping decimated beaver populations and as changing tastes made consumers less eager to purchase furs.
by the mid 1840s the world of the fur trappers was gone.
americans began viewing the west as a region that had to be incorporated into an expanding democratic nation.
additional land would help preserve the ideal of a yeoman republic of honest and independent farmers that would now stretch from the atlantic to the pacific.
americans embraced westward expansion as both their destiny and a practical necessity given the nations growing population.
the rights of the indigenous indian tribes of these regions mattered little to the champions of westward expansion.
even many sympathetic to indian civilizations believed they were doomed to extinction.
the conquest and settlement of the west became an important theme for artists who helped portray the west for those americans who did not make the trek westward.
many artists memorialized an ideal version of western expansion helping to forge important american myths about intrepid pioneers taming a frontier wilderness.

even before osullivan and benton voiced the doctrine of manifest destiny word of the lush agricultural lands of oregon had reached east by the early 1840s.
the economic dislocations caused by the panic of 1837 see chapter 8 and the absence of cheap land suitable for agriculture in the east and midwest also sparked interest in western migration.
propagandists embellished their accounts of the wests riches to help attract potential migrants to the fertile lands of oregon.
some rhapsodic descriptions of oregon went beyond mere exaggeration conjuring up an image of an almost magical place in which the pigs were already cooked with knives and forks sticking in them so that you can cut off a slice whenever you are hungry drawn by these promises many joined an 1843 expedition known as the great migration.
this 2 000 mile trek along the overland trail 11 2 consisted of more than 100 wagons and helped pave the way what were the most important ideas associated with manifest destiny.
for subsequent waves of migrants.
this trail soon became the main route taken by american settlers traveling from the east and midwest to oregon california and utah.
by 1845 at least 5 000 settlers had made the arduous five to six month long overland journey to oregon territory.
migration westward placed an especially heavy burden on women whose husbands seldom consulted with them before deciding to move.
estimates are that two thirds of women opposed the idea of relocating to the west.
mary richardson walker the wife of a protestant missionary who headed to a settlement on the walla walla river in what is now washington vented her frustration in her diary i find it difficult to keep up a usual degree of cheerfulness if i were to yield to inclination i should cry half my time giving up friends and family and dealing not only with their normal responsibilities of cooking cleaning and childcare but also the added burdens of a long and perilous journey made the prospect of moving west terrifying.
during the move many women were expected to take on traditional male jobs such as repairing wagons or helping to construct bridges while carrying on their traditional roles as mothers and wives.
in effect the workload of most women doubled during the move westward.
few americans male or female were aware of this grim reality.
indeed their impressions of the west continued to be shaped by writers speakers and the many artists who traveled with the migrants and painted scenes that reflected the rosy vision of manifest destiny.
this mythic image of the west influenced artists working almost a generation later and is beautifully captured by albert bierstadt in his 1859 painting emigrants crossing the plains 11 3.
read the document john l osullivan the nation of great futurity manifest destiny and changing visions of the west bierstadt depicts settlers pausing on their westward journey to allow their livestock to graze and drink.
above them rises a stunning western landscape in the foreground bierstadt places the skeleton of a buffalo.
these bones like the indian village barely visible in the distance represent the wests past whereas the settlers symbolize its future.
the suns location in the western sky evokes gods blessing and the optimistic vision of manifest destiny a symbol of both the settlers and the nations bright future.
the native american encounter with manifest destiny one danger associated with western migration that figured prominently in representations of the west both in paintings and sensational newspaper accounts was the threat of attack by hostile indians.
even though such attacks were relatively rare these representations of indians dominated popular culture.
again american artists helped spread a popular vision of the west.
charles wimars 1856 painting attack on emigrant train 11 4 casts the indians as bloodthirsty savages and accentuates the horror of the emigrants trying to fend off the attack.
this painting became a model for later images of indians and was even used a century later by hollywood directors as a model for western fight scenes between indians and settlers.

wimars painting reflected one of two radically different visions of native americans that were deeply rooted in american culture.
from the beginning of european contact with the americas indians had been depicted as either bloodthirsty savages or noble savages see chapter 1.
the image of the noble indian chief had been propagated by artists such as benjamin west in the death of general wolfe see chapter 3.
artist george catlin borrowed from this tradition when he set out to capture the culture of western indians.
after traveling throughout the west and living among tribes in the 1830s catlin organized a popular traveling exhibit of his paintings and the indian artifacts he had gathered.
acutely aware that american expansion would likely destroy many of the native american 11 4 attack on emigrant train although indian attacks on western emigrants were rare this image was so powerful that it influenced portrayals of indians in movies made by hollywood more than a century later.
why were tales of indian attacks on immigrants so popular in american culture.
chapter 11 overspread the continent westward expansion and political conflict 1840 1848 societies of the west catlin believed that he had a responsibility to preserve a visual record of indian culture.
these themes are discussed in images as history george catlin and mah to toh pa representing indians for an american audience.
a few americans rejected both the image of the native american as a barbaric savage who ought to be exterminated and the noble savage tragically doomed to extinction.
whig and protestant reformers expressed sympathy for native americans and opposed the relocation of eastern tribes see chapter 8.
they also opposed the racist and expansionist vision of manifest destiny articulated by osullivan and benton.
william ellery channing a boston minister and reformer attacked the arrogance and shortsightedness of manifest destiny we are destined that is the word to overspread north america and intoxicated with the idea it matters little to us how we accomplish our fate for channing and like minded reformers expansion was not an unqualified good to be obtained at any cost but something that demanded that americans act honestly and respectfully to indians and do their utmost to protect them.
yet despite the qualms of reformers american demand for western land was insatiable.
the pressure to make more indian land available for settlement only grew as americans streamed westward.
following the policy that had been adopted with eastern tribes such as the cherokee see chapter 8 the federal government forced midwestern tribes in iowa including the sauk and fox to relocate to the indian territory present day oklahoma kansas and nebraska after their defeat in the black hawk war of 1832.
by the early 1840s the massive relocation of american indians was nearly complete.
one of the few tribes to successfully resist removal at least temporarily was the seminole in florida.
the american army fought a long and costly war to force the tribe to relocate.
from 1835 1842 the seminoles fought off american forces.
in the end the american government spent ten times the amount of money allocated for all of indian removal to relocate the seminole.
while americans in this era generated many descriptions of westward expansion relatively little material exists written from the indian perspective.
one rare and outstanding exception is the memoir of sarah winnemucca a paiute indian from nevada who became a champion of the rights of indigenous peoples see 15 16.
her memoir recounts the full range of experiences with whites from interactions with good white people who traded fairly with how did the mormon immigration differ from other westward migrations.
her family and her people to traumatic encounters with hostile settlers.
in one of the more harrowing episodes she describes an occasion when a band of white men appeared while the village men were away hunting.
winnemuccas mother and the other women feared that the whites intended to kidnap or sexually assault their children so she and the other women hid them burying them in mud and covering their faces with brush.
winnemucca described her anguish heart throbbing and not daring to breathe as she lay hidden all day till the hostile visitors left.
the mormon flight to utah most western migrants went in search of economic opportunities.
the members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints were an exception to this rule.
joseph smith founded this sect whose members were popularly known as mormons in new york in the early 1830s see chapter 10.
smith and his followers had been the victims of violent persecution wherever they settled in the east and midwest so the west appealed to them as a potential refuge from such hostility.
the mormon trek westward was the largest organized migration in american history.
prior to their exodus the mormons endured a long period of internal dissension and harassment by their non mormon neighbors.
after leaving new york joseph smith established mormon communities in ohio and missouri.
in ohio the mormons experimented with communal economic arrangements.
the mormon doctrine of consecration and stewardship required individuals to deed their property to the church which then provided an allotment of land whose size was tied to the size of the family unit.
mormons also created cooperative agricultural enterprises pooling their resources and labor.
for additional discussion of the communal dimensions of mormonism see chapter 10.
non mormons resented the economic advantages such cooperation brought to mormon farmers and businesses.
as tensions between mormons and nonmormons rose smith moved most of his followers to nauvoo illinois on the mississippi river.
the fastestgrowing town in the midwest in the 1840s surpassing even chicago nauvoo was a boomtown shaped by a distinctive religious vision.
by the end of the 1840s the mormon population of this booming city had soared to over 10 000.
the mormon system of tithing required donations to the church enabled the church to buy land and build a monumental temple read the document black hawk from life of black hawk manifest destiny and changing visions of the west images as history george catlin and mah to toh pa representing indians for an american audience through his paintings of western indians george catlin sought to preserve a visual record of their culture and accomplishments.
he also felt obliged to portray these doomed peoples in a noble light.
capturing the nobility of indians required representing them in a way that would evoke sympathy and respect from his american audience.
one of the many indians catlin painted during his years in the west was the mandan chief mah totoh pa also known as four bears in his diary catlin noted that the chief wanted to be painted in a manner that reflected the mandan notions of beauty and masculinity.
both were closely tied to the ideal of the warrior.
accordingly mah to toh pa dressed for the painting in all the trappings of a warrior chief.
catlin noted in his journal his dress was complete in all its parts and consisted of a shirt or tunic leggings moccasins head dress necklace shield bow and catlins journal informed his viewers that only a warrior of extraordinary renown was allowed to wear horns on his headdress.
quiver lance tobacco sack and pipe robe belt and knife medicine bag tomahawk and war club yet catlin omitted most of these items believing that they distracted from the chiefs grace and simplicity the notions of beauty that shaped catlins artistic decisions stretched back to antiquity and were different from those of the mandan chief.
in essence catlin painted his subject as if he were a frontier cincinnatus an indian george washington see chapter five.
the resulting painting was an idealized version of how an indian chief ought to appear to an american audience not a representation of how a specific indian chief wished the american people to see him.
how did catlin represent his indian subject to his american audience.
what does this tell us about american attitudes toward indians in the early nineteenth century.
by omitting the chiefs war club tomahawk and other objects associated with his prowess as a warrior catlin made him less frightening to an american audience.

chapter 11 11 5 the nauvoo temple the mormon temple at nauvoo stood on the highest point of land in the new town and towered over the surrounding landscape.
its architecture includes greek revival elements masonic symbolism and ideas inspired by mormon theology.
overspread the continent westward expansion and political conflict 1840 1848 in nauvoo.
as this contemporary image shows the temple 11 5 dominated the landscape around it.
as smith and his followers faced increasing hostility from their non mormon neighbors the church also encountered internal dissent.
when dissident mormons founded an anti smith paper in nauvoo smith who was also the mayor of nauvoo ordered the city marshal and nauvoo militia to shut down the paper and destroy its printing press.
the governor of illinois then ordered the state militia to seize smith and bring him to carthage illinois for trial.
while awaiting trial an angry crowd burst into smiths jail cell and shot him to death.
smiths successor brigham young decided to move the entire mormon community to the west beyond the reach of the churchs critics.
some 16 000 mormons eventually migrated to the salt lake valley of what is now utah.
youngs organizational skills and an almost military discipline among his people helped them negotiate the difficult journey.
it also helped the mormons survive and in their new environment.
during the first years of settlement when food rationing became necessary young confiscated how did mormon communalism affect their experiences at nauvoo.
food surpluses and distributed them to those in need.
mormon communalism again helped the community through a difficult time.
over time the mormons built an economic and religious community that combined communalism and private enterprise.
safely ensconced in the great salt lake basin far beyond the control of the federal government they also began openly to practice polygamy the practice of men taking more than one wife.
brigham young himself took over 20 wives.
polygamy shocked americans particularly in an era when the dominant culture venerated the conventional nuclear family and the cult of true womanhood see chapter 10.
in remaking the conventional idea of the family the mormons resembled the shakers and oneida perfectionists two other religious movement of the day that experimented with different models of the family and sexual practices see chapter 10.
mormon law required men to provide for their wives and children which meant that most could not afford polygamy.
although the mormon economic and religious elite practiced it most mormons were monogamous.
american expansionism into the southwest american expansionism into the southwest to stabilize and secure its territories that bordered the united states mexico adopted policies that transformed its northern provinces in the west and texas.
changes were made in the way indians were treated under the old colonial system in california and new mexico and mexico opened texas to american settlers in the 1820s.
but the americans in texas became a source of discord for mexico.
committed to slavery and reluctant to adopt mexican ways the americans fomented an uprising of settlers that created the republic of texas.
despite opposition from abolitionists and some whigs the united states eventually annexed texas.
rather than mark the end of expansionist sentiments the annexation only whetted the appetite of proponents of expansionism.
in 1846 the united states declared war on mexico.
the war proved unpopular with some americans but nonetheless resulted in an american victory and seizure of northern mexico vastly increasing the size of the united states.
the transformation of northern mexico until 1800 spain still controlled a huge swath of north america a holding acquired in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries see chapter 1 and constituting all of present day texas new mexico arizona and california and parts of nevada colorado and utah.
the spanish had invested most of their resources in mineral rich areas of peru and mexico and the sugar islands of the caribbean see chapter 2 and had neglected this northern region of their colonial empire.
but by the mid eighteenth century the spanish had begun to organize california into four coastal presidios forts at san diego santa barbara monterey and san francisco.
these administrative and military jurisdictions included 21 catholic missions run by franciscans and extending as far north as sonoma california.
under this mission system thousands of native americans were forced to convert to catholicism and labor for the spanish.
held in an oppressive condition little better than slavery they herded livestock tended crops and worked as skilled and unskilled laborers.
indeed the russian artist and explorer louis choris painted this view 11 6 of the presidio of san francisco in 1816.
this image showing indian laborers being herded at the point of a lance by a mounted spaniard illustrates choriss belief that the spanish treated indians like cattle.
when mexico declared its independence from spain in 1821 the economy politics and social structure of this region began to change.
apart from achieving internal political stability one of the new nations chief concerns was securing its northern border with the united states.
mexicos northern borderlands were underpopulated and controlled by the comanches and apaches.
the introduction of horses and guns to the region transformed the comanche and apache tribes both tribes proved extremely adept at the use of both guns and horses and as a result they gained almost complete control of the area between mexico city and its northern provinces.
americas westward expansion also threatened mexicos control of its distant provinces.
mindful of these threats mexican officials took steps to gain greater control of the region.
to speed economic development in california mexico abolished the mission system and released indians from their dependent status as bound laborers.
to replace the mission system they adopted the ranchero system in california and new mexico.
huge tracts of former mission owned land came into the possession of a relatively few families and poorly paid indians performed much of the labor.
in texas to encourage population growth and economic development the mexican government in 1824 offered land grants to american settlers who agreed to become catholics and learn spanish.
by 1830 there were almost 7 000 american texans to 4 000 hispanic texans who were known as tejanos.
the what was the ranchero system.

the caravan has arrived.
josiah gregg commerce of the prairies or the journal of a santa fe trader 1844 11 6 view of the san francisco presidio this depiction of the mission system by a russian artist captures the exploitation of the indian population.
american settlers were an economic boon to the region.
texans exported an estimated 500 000 worth of goods to new orleans mainly cotton and cattle.
additional trade networks developed elsewhere along the mexican american border.
in california new england merchants sought seal and sea otter pelts to sell in china.
in 1821 american traders established a trade route from missouri to santa fe.
far safer and less rugged than the nearly 1 700 mile journey to mexico city the santa fe trail became a thriving trade route.
american traders whose profits on the sale of goods ranging from cloth to what advantages did americans have over mexicans in the lucrative trade with santa fe.
manufactured items such as umbrellas sometimes reached 40 percent were often paid in hard currency.
indeed trade with santa fe became so crucial that the mexican silver peso became the unofficial unit of exchange for much of the western united states.
the clash of interests in texas although mexico benefited from the increased trade with the united states the presence of so many american settlers in texas worried mexican officials.
three issues were particularly troubling.
first the americans flouted the laws requiring they learn spanish and convert to catholicism.
second they brought thousands of slaves into texas at a time when mexico was heading toward the abolition of slavery a goal it achieved in 1829.
third many american settlers did little to conceal their interest in joining the united states.
a small uprising in 1826 of americans hoping to secede was easily crushed by the mexican army.
the mexican government reacted by banning further immigration from the united states.
still americans came and mexico lifted the ban in 1833.
before long there were 30 000 americans in texas.
view the image texas home for the emigrant american expansionism into the southwest a well organized effort to separate from mexico occurred in 1834.
this time americans took advantage of the instability of mexican politics.
in 1834 mexican general antonio lpez de santa anna staged a coup and assumed dictatorial powers.
when american settlers in texas revolted demanding a restoration of the constitution santa anna decided to crush the rebellion.
the ensuing war between santa annas forces and the american texans was brutal.
one of the bloodiest battles occurred in early 1836 near san antonio at the alamo an old spanish mission defended by a small force of texans including legendary frontiersman and politician davy crockett and jim bowie for whom the bowie knife was named.
historians continue to argue over the exact death toll but few dispute that the fighting was fierce and many died that day.
images such as this woodcut of crocketts death inspired americans whose battle cry for the rest of the war against mexico became remember the alamo 11 7.
even as santa annas forces assaulted the alamo american texans declared independence from mexico march 2 1836 and drafted a new constitution.
meanwhile his victory at the alamo convinced santa anna that the texas forces were no match for his army.
overconfident he recklessly divided his troops leading to his defeat and capture at the battle of san jacinto by the texans under sam houston.
the republic of texas and the politics of annexation the citizens of the now independent republic of texas expected the united states to act quickly and annex texas into the expanding american republic.
they would have to wait nearly a decade however as annexation proved to be a divisive issue in american politics.
opponents of slavery feared annexation would upset the delicate balance between free and slave states.
conversely southerners and others who favored slavery supported texas annexation.
heated debate in 1836 and 1837 died down as both the democrats and whigs sought to avoid the texas issue.
for the moment the economic problems associated with the panic of 1837 see chapter 8 preoccupied americans.

chapter 11 overspread the continent westward expansion and political conflict 1840 1848 11 8 texas coming in in this political cartoon polk welcomes texas while whigs including henry clay and daniel webster vainly try to hold back the lone star republic from joining the union.
the whigs are dragged into the salt river a contemporary political term synonymous with a political dead end oblivion or an insurmountable obstacle.
texas annexation reemerged as a major political issue in 1844 reviving sectional tensions over slavery and western expansion.
it started when president john tyler a proslavery whig began touting his support for annexation to gain the support of southern whigs and secure the partys presidential nomination.
his strategy backfired however when many whigs opposed his plans for texas annexation viewing it as a thinly veiled effort to expand slavery into the west.
tylers proslavery stance cost him the nomination when the whigs seeking to avoid the controversy chose henry clay perhaps the best known whig politician in america as their candidate.
the democrats were also shaken by the annexation and slavery issues.
although martin van buren was the leading figure in the democratic party southerners opposed him because of his abolitionist leanings.
after nine ballots the democrats finally settled on a proslavery southerner james k polk as their candidate.
polk favored annexation of texas.
in this political cartoon from the election of 1844 11 8 the whigs led by henry clay attempt to hold back texas from entering the union.
james k polk stands with an american flag ready to welcome texas into how did the liberty party affect the election of 1844.
texans stephen austin left and sam houston right each wave the lone star flag of the texas republic.
polks expansionist agenda appealed to southerners and northerners who hoped that westward expansion would mean more land for agriculture.
polks strong stance on annexation rattled the whigs including clay who feared the democratic partys aggressive stance on texas was popular enough to give it an electoral victory.
clay equivocated about opposing annexation and his flip flop alienated many antislavery whigs in the north.
a small third party the newly formed liberty party adopted a staunchly antislavery anti annexation stance and captured 62 000 votes enough some scholars argue to rob henry clay of electoral victories in new york and michigan thereby handing polk the presidency in 1844.
emboldened by polks victory tyler the sitting president secured texas annexation by a joint resolution of both houses of congress which allowed him to bypass the constitutional requirement that treaties be approved by a twothirds majority in the senate tyler could have never mustered enough votes to approve a treaty of annexation.
this tactic bypassed the constitutional roadblock preventing the acquisition of texas.
opponents of slavery viewed his actions as yet another example of the unscrupulous nature of proslavery forces.
in 1845 texas entered the union as a slave state.
polks expansionist vision a tennessee lawyer and a protg of andrew jackson james k polk earned the nickname young hickory a reference to his mentor andrew jacksons reputation as old hickory see chapter 8.
polk shared jacksons view of the importance of a strong executive and his belief in the necessity and inevitability of western expansion.
he also shared jacksons racial views which watch the video video lecture the annexation of texas american expansionism into the southwest 11 9 mexican war rmont sonoma f this map depicts the major offensan francisco sives of the war.

indeed former mexican victory president john quincy adams who had become a prominent whig congressman denounced polk as a slave holding exterminator of indians polk wasted little time in acting on his expansionist vision.
polk first moved to acquire oregon an area that the united states and britain had been wrangling over for decades.
polk had campaigned on the slogan fifty four forty or fight a reference to the u s demand that the geographical boundary separating oregon from british canada be fixed at the latitude 54 40.
ultimately polk agreed to a border further south that extended across the 49th parallel.
this shrewd compromise secured the most valuable agricultural lands sought by american settlers.
the oregon settlement in 1846 enabled polk to focus his attention on mexico.
as the ardently pro expansion democratic paper the new york herald noted we can now thrash mexico into decency at our leisure the annexation of texas in 1845 had left open the question of the exact boundary between the united states and mexico.
polk sent john slidell a lawyer and democratic politician to mexico to settle the boundary question and debts that mexicans owed to americans.
slidell was also instructed to santa anna mazatlan matamoros santa anna ni ea buena vista san lucas palo alto monterrey mexico la paz san jose corpus christi ces r taylor or oc vy na ic.

this aggressive negotiating posture reflected polks expansionist desires.
he and his advisors feared that mexico might pay off part of its debts by ceding california to britain americas chief commercial rival.
by being so belligerent polk ensured that the negotiations would fail.
still angry over the loss of texas mexicans were not interested in losing any further land.
the specific issue dividing the united states and mexico was the exact boundary between texas and mexico.
the mexican government claimed the southern boundary of texas was the nueces river not the rio grande as the united states maintained 11 9.
the rio grande would give texas more territory at the expense of mexico.
polk dispatched american troops under general zachary taylor into the disputed zone between the two rivers.
when a small group of mexican forces attacked taylors troops on april 25 1846 polk informed congress that mexico has passed the boundary of the united states and shed american blood on american soil congress formally declared war on mexico on may 13.

america now controlled most of northern mexico.
although supporters of manifest destiny had seen geographic expansion as a panacea for the nations economic and social problems few could foresee how the defeat of mexico and acquisition of new lands would usher in more intense political conflict.
the debate over whether to allow slavery in the territories gained from mexico would strain the two party system splitting whigs and democrats into northern and southern wings.
a third party the free soil party emerged during this period committed to blocking the spread of slavery.
a controversial war the mexican war divided americans along sectional lines and split both the democratic and whig parties.
southern whigs supported polks efforts.
every battle fought in mexico one south carolina paper averred insures the acquisition of territory which must widen the field of southern enterprise and power in the future northern whigs in contrast denounced the war as an unjust conflict manufactured by polk to secure california and new mexico.

see choices and consequences henry david thoreau and civil disobedience.
the mexican war was the first conflict america fought primarily on foreign soil.
it was also the most logistically complex war in the nations brief history involving multiple fronts long supply lines and the coordination of ground and amphibious assaults.
the mexican war also produced two of the greatest generals in american history zachary taylor and winfield scott.
taylor was the common soldiers general a man without pretensions whose reputation for bravery earned him the nickname among what were the most important differences between the leadership style of generals zachary taylor and winfield scott.
his troops old rough and ready scott was in many respects the opposite of taylor.
a brilliant tactician and strategist old fuss and feathers was arrogant and fond of pomp and ceremony.
the mexican war also provided a proving ground for a host of military leaders who later became important generals of the civil war era including ulysses s grant robert e lee thomas stonewall jackson george mcclellan george g meade and p g t beauregard.
the united states had clear military superiority over mexico.
american forces under zachary taylor scored an early victory in may 1846 at the battle of palo alto 11 9.
general stephen kearny then opened a second front by marching from fort leavenworth kansas to santa fe and then on to california where he joined up with an army under captain john c fremont.
fremont had already paved the way for the conquest of california by instigating a rebellion against mexican authority there known as the bear flag revolt for the grizzly bear emblem that decorated the rebel flag.
scotts successful amphibious assault at the port of vera cruz led to an assault on mexico city.
after five more months of fierce fighting scott captured the mexican capital on may 1 1847.
the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo ended the war 1848.
it settled the border dispute between texas and mexico and ceded to the united states a vast swath of new territory in the southwest over 500 000 square miles comprising present day california new mexico arizona and parts of texas utah colorado and nevada.
the united states had seized 55 percent of mexicos territory.
read the document thomas corwin against the mexican war the mexican war and its consequences choices and consequences henry david thoreau and civil disobedience the author henry david thoreau was a committed abolitionist.
opposition to the war with mexico among abolitionists was intense and reflected their view that the war was an effort to expand slavery.
in the political cartoon young texas in repose an unsavory texan sits on a prostrate slave whose head is rendered as a bale of cotton.
abolitionist protest against the war took a variety of forms but none have had as profound impact on subsequent history as thoreaus refusal to pay his poll tax.
his actions landed him in jail for a night.
in thoreaus view jail was the only place for a just man in an unjust legal and political system.
thoreau explored the reasons for his act of defiance two years later.
in a lyceum lecture called the rights and duties of the individual in relation to government he sketched this theory of civil disobedience.
a year later a small literary journal published a revised version of this lecture entitled resistance to civil government thoreaus essay framed in concise terms the options available to citizens facing government action they believed to be immoral unjust laws exist shall we be content to obey them or shall we endeavor to amend them and obey them until we have succeeded or shall we transgress them at once here are the options thoreau envisioned choices accept the governments decision and not criticize it.
obey the law but work to change it.
protest the law by refusing to obey it and suffer the legal consequences for challenging it.
decision thoreau chose the third option and spent a night in the concord massachusetts jail.
consequences thoreaus actions had almost no impact at the time and his essay attracted little attention.
however it became one of the most influential political essays ever written.
his theory of civil disobedience influenced the twentieth century indian leader mohandas gandhis nonviolent protests against colonial british rule in india and the campaign of reverend martin luther king jr against racial discrimination.
protestors around the world continue to use thoreaus theory to advance human rights.
continuing controversies young texas in repose is the notion of a legal right of civil disobedience a contradiction in terms.
philosophers continue to debate the morality of civil disobedience.
if one condones civil disobedience does it invariably lead to anarchy that is lawlessness and political disorder or can one support the rule of law and still accept the moral legitimacy of civil disobedience.
another controversial issue that continues to divide supporters of resistance theory is the role of nonviolence.
must civil disobedience be nonviolent or can one legitimately use violence to secure justice.
abolitionists debated this latter issue as they pondered what to do about the evil of slavery.
the issue continues to divide supporters of the ideal of civil disobedience.
many affirm that the idea can only claim the moral high ground and be effective if it forswears violence.

images of the mexican war the mexican war was the first conflict in american history that professional journalists covered and reported to the people directly almost daily.
the telegraph made such instantaneous communication possible.
competing for readers newspapers pioneered new techniques for gathering and reporting news including sending war correspondents into battle.
this practice freed newspapers from reliance on the military and government allowing the press to be more independent.
to be sure many papers continued to simply echo the official view of the war provided by the government.
but many other editors voiced dissent.
abolitionists in particular used their antislavery newspapers to challenge the polk administration and denounce the war.
indeed one military officers complaint about the negative impact of a thousand prying eyes and brazen tongues was a direct result of a free and uncontrolled press an equally significant innovation in war coverage involved the use of images by papers like the new york herald to explain important events.
the mexican war was also the first military conflict in america to be captured on film.
the daguerreotype an early form of photography produced images that are fuzzy by the standards of modern technology but that seemed miraculous in their day.
americans approached the new technology as if it were an actual facsimile of reality and not merely another artistic representation of it.
indeed the herald proclaimed that it intended its war coverage to be daguerreotype reports a term meant to convey unbiased and accurate report of reality in nearly real time.
americans embraced the new pictorial art form enthusiastically.
before shipping off a soldier might sit for a daguerreotype that he gave to family or loved ones.
soldiers might also carry daguerreotypes of loved ones into battle.
daguerreotypists even followed soldiers into mexico setting up temporary studios and recording battle scenes.
at least one artist died recording americas war effort.
an especially haunting image produced during the war was a daguerreotype of the gravesite of henry clay jr what role did images play in shaping american perceptions of the mexican war.
the mexican war and its consequences son of the noted whig politician killed at the battle of buena vista 11 10.
the scene is desolate a cross an open grave awaiting a coffin and an adobe vault over clays grave a necessity that protected the burial site from being attacked by wolves or desecrated by grave robbers.
few people were likely to have seen such an image but for those who did its emotional impact would have been immense.
this sober image contrasts with a heroic representation of clays death in a popular print produced for a mass audience 11 11.
rather than capture the desolation of a grave in a distant wilderness the lithograph shows a fallen leader urging his troops on to victory.
the artist focuses on clays final dramatic gesture with the pistol given to him by his father.
take these pistols to my father he tells a comrade and tell him i have done all i can with them and now return them to him heroic images of this sort proved the most popular and influential representations of the war.
nathaniel curriers firm alone produced at least 85 different images of the war for an american audience eager to purchase them.
11 10 and 11 11 clays grave and the death of colonel clay these representations of the death of henry clays son capture radically different views of the war.
the haunting daguerreotype left was a deeply personal artifact whereas the more widely distributed lithograph was more inspirational than morbid.
why did the artist pose henry clay in the same posture as earlier artists had used for fallen leaders such as general wolfe.
chapter 11 overspread the continent westward expansion and political conflict 1840 1848 the wilmot proviso and the realignment of american politics for a young up and coming whig from illinois the war with mexico was a decisive moment.
abraham lincoln opposed the war and viewed territorial expansion as a threat to americas future.
whigs argued that economic development not geographical expansion was the key to americas prosperity.
in what would become a hallmark of his distinctive rhetoric lincoln translated this whig ideal into a folksy idiom.
whigs did not believe in enlarging our field lincoln observed in 1848 but in keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possessions making it a garden improving the morals and education of the people supporters of slavery held a different vision acquiring a huge new swath of territory would be a boon for slavery.
the problem of how to handle slavery in the territories gained from mexico would strain americas new two party system splitting whigs and democrats into northern and southern wings and eventually setting the stage for the emergence of a new political party the republicans.
the wilmot proviso in response to concerns that land seized from mexico would lead to the spread of slavery congressmen david wilmot a pennsylvania democrat introduced a measure the wilmot proviso which would have banned slavery from all territory acquired from mexico.
the bill created a firestorm.
the controversy over the wilmot proviso heightened sectional tensions and conflict over the future of slavery.
southerners denounced it as a thinly veiled attack on slavery whereas northerners insisted that it left slavery untouched where it already existed.
the proviso passed in the house where northern representatives outnumbered southerners but it was defeated in the senate where the balance between slave and free states prevented either side from passing legislation objectionable to the other.
the wilmot proviso shifted american political debate to the problem of slavery in the territories splitting both parties into proslavery and free soil factions.
in response politicians tried to resolve the sectional argument over slavery.
president polk supported a proposal modeled on the missouri compromise see chapter 7 to extend the 36 30 line across the louisiana purchase territories separating free states from slave states to the pacific coast.
northerners opposed this idea because most of the land gained from mexico lay below this line and seemed likely to enter the union why was the wilmot proviso so controversial.
ultimately as slave states.
senator lewis cass of michigan suggested another compromise popular sovereignty which would allow the people in each territory to decide for themselves whether to permit slavery.
hoping to garner both northern and southern supporters he omitted a crucial detail when this decision on slavery would be made.
most northerners believed this decision would be made when a territorial legislature was established.
southerners however accepted john c calhouns interpretation that the decision over slavery would not be made until settlers wrote a state constitution which opponents of slavery feared would allow slaveholders time to firmly establish slavery in a territory.
sectionalism and the election of 1848 the wilmot proviso and slavery defined the presidential election of 1848.
both the democratic and whig parties tried to downplay the question of slavery to attract voters in the north and south.
democrats nominated moderate lewis cass champion of popular sovereignty.
the whigs had a more difficult time choosing a candidate.
henry clay had been the clear frontrunner but his adamant opposition to the seizure of lands from mexico was a difficult political position to take.
clay had hoped to avoid having to take a stand on the wilmot proviso and the realignment of american politics 11 12 the candidate of many parties a phrenologist probes general zachary taylors head looking for some sign of what the presidential candidate thought about key issues.
taylors campaign tried to avoid taking stands on issues such as the wilmot proviso that might alienate voters.
this issue but the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo undercut him after the treaty clays policy of non expansion made no sense.
americans had to decide what to do about slavery in the lands won from mexico.
casting clay aside the whigs eventually settled on general zachary taylor a mexican war hero who cast himself as a no party man and a unifier above partisanship.
even more useful to the party because he was a career soldier taylors views on many political issues including the wilmot proviso were unknown.
this humorous political cartoon from the election of 1848 shows a phrenologist see chapter 10 probing the generals skull supposedly to find clues to his political beliefs 11 12.
the title the candidate of many parties underscores taylors attempt to be all things to all people.
indeed the whigs ran two different campaigns in the two regions of the country.
to capture southern voters they stressed that taylor owned slaves asserting that no slaveholder would betray the interests of the south.
to appeal to northerners the whigs emphasized taylors credentials as a mexican war hero and his support for a cardinal whig principle opposition to a strong executive including the presidential veto.
by stressing his belief that the veto should view the image political cartoon fillmore and taylor be used only in exceptional cases such as when a law was clearly unconstitutional taylor signaled to northern whigs that he would not veto a wilmot proviso like law.
embracing this cherished whig constitutional ideal not only allowed taylor to underscore his whig credentials to those who doubted them but also to side step the slavery issue.
taylors election strategy enabled him to do the seemingly impossible campaign as a proslavery candidate in the south and a pro wilmot proviso candidate in the north.
the 1848 election was further complicated by the emergence of a third party the free soil party.
this party brought together disaffected democrats who supported the wilmot proviso and resented the growing influence of southerners within their party.
led by former president martin van buren antislavery democrats were known as barnburners a nickname that derived from an old dutch tale about a farmer who burned down his barn to get the rats out.
in 1848 the rats were proslavery democrats.
a political cartoon shows van buren setting fire to a barn.
lewis cass viewed as a pro slavery democrat by abolitionists flees along with a bunch of rats 11 13.
the free soil party also attracted conscience whigs who were unwilling to support a slaveholder why does this political cartoon show a phrenologist examining taylors skull.
chapter 11 11 13 smoking him out in this political cartoon martin van buren is shown at the side of a burning barn while proslavery democrat lewis cass is perched on the roof ready to jump and rats flee the building.
antislavery democrats were nicknamed barnburners overspread the continent westward expansion and political conflict 1840 1848 as their partys candidate.
it also gathered abolitionist supporters of the liberty party the antislavery party founded in 1840.
under the slogan no more slave states and no more slave territories the free soil platform took the moderate position of opposing only the extension of slavery into the west.
the whig taylor won the election handily but his victory revealed the complexity the slavery issue posed for american politics.
see competing visions slavery and the election of 1848.
he won eight of 15 slave states largely because he was a slave owner.
the race was much closer in the north but taylor prevailed in the key states of pennsylvania and new york.
he owed his narrow margin of victory in the latter state to the free soil party which drew votes away from the democrats.
the free soil party failed to win a single state but it polled 300 000 votes 10 percent of the total and elected two senators and nine representatives to congress from states in the northeast and midwest.
let the soil of our extensive domains be kept free for the hardy pioneers of our own land and the oppressed and banished of other lands seeking homes of comfort and fields of enterprise in the new world who were the barnburners.
free soil party platform 1848 the wilmot proviso and the realignment of american politics competing visions slavery and the election of 1848 what to do with the vast territory acquired from mexico became a contentious issue in the election of 1848.
the two party system fractured producing a new third party the free soil party which opposed the spread of slavery westward.
the new party met in buffalo new york as reflected in the cartoon showing martin van buren its candidate riding a buffalo.
the party platforms of the democrats and whig party each adopted a different approach to slavery.
the democrat party platform reasserted its commitment to states rights and its corollary slavery was an issue that the constitution had left for the individual states to decide.
the whig platform avoided mentioning slavery.
instead it focused on the merits of the whig candidate zachary taylor who was presented as a war hero and a man who put the nation ahead of sectional interests.
the congress has no power under the constitution to interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several states that such states are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs not prohibited by the constitution that all efforts of the abolitionists or others made to induce congress to interfere with questions of slavery are calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences.
that we look on general taylors administration of the government as one conducive to peace prosperity and union we have a candidate whose very position as a southwestern man reared on the banks of the great stream whose tributaries natural and artificial embrace the whole union renders the protection of the interests of the whole country his first trust.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 in 1800 republican thomas jefferson won the presidential election against his federalist opponent john adams.
after nearly a decade in opposition republicans celebrated their presidential triumph with toasts and songs about jefferson and liberty federalists however feared that the new president whom they had denounced as an atheist a tool of the french and a supporter of thomas paines radical democratic ideas would undo all their work of the previous decade.
in this federalist political cartoon from 1800 mad tom in a rage jeffersons ally thomas paine and the devil tear down the federal edifice created by washington and adams.
the federalist fears captured in the cartoon were not only unfounded but president jefferson turned out to be a very different person from vice president jefferson the leader of the republican opposition during the adams administration.
rather than mount a full scale attack on federalist policy jefferson adopted a less confrontational approach.
in his presidential inaugural he struck a conciliatory tone and reminded americans we are all republicans we are all federalists jefferson also promised the nation a wise and frugal government implementing this however proved difficult as he took over the reigns of power in his first term.
the opportunity to purchase the louisiana territory and double the size of the new nation led him to cast aside constitutional strict construction which restricted the powers of the federal government to those explicitly delegated by the constitution.
by the end of jeffersons second term in 1809 some americans believed that the jeffersonian republicans had become indistinguishable from their federalist opponents.
jeffersons anointed successor james madison made additional compromises that some of his supporters believed betrayed the ideas he had championed as a member of the republican opposition in the 1790s.
foreign affairs proved especially vexing for both jefferson and madison.
each man had tried to prevent american entanglement in the war between britain and france.
despite their efforts however america was dragged into the european conflict eventually going to war against britain in 1812.
although the war was fought against the british the conspicuous losers in the conflict were the indian tribes in the northwest and southwest who lost a valuable ally in britain and suffered defeats by american troops.
the demands of fighting the war also forced republicans to reconsider the necessity of much of hamiltonian economic policy.
by the end of the presidency of james monroe in 1825 the fourth virginian to become president the old political labels of republican and federalist had become nearly meaningless and were soon to be supplanted by two new political parties.
the revolution of 1800 was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form not effected indeed by the sword as that but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform the suffrage of the people thomas jefferson to judge spenser roane 1819 chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 politics in jeffersonian america jeffersons presidential triumph in 1800 ushered in a new era in american political life.
after a decade of federalist rule and despite the courts remaining bastions of federalist power republicans now controlled the presidency and congress.
despite jeffersons efforts to avoid the bitter partisanship that had characterized politics during the previous decade american politics remained deeply divisive.
in an age when gentlemen lived by a code of honor political insults could easily turn into personal affronts and might result in tragic results.
before the end of his presidency jeffersons vice president aaron burr would slay jeffersons longtime opponent alexander hamilton in a duel and burr would become a fugitive from justice.
former president john adams sarcastically observed that his fellow citizens had made great strides in the arts of lying and libeling and the other arts which grow out of them such as wielding the cudgel and pistol liberty and small government jefferson set out his views of government in his inaugural address on march 4 1801.
although he invoked shared values including faith in representative government and the rule of law jefferson also made clear how his idea of government differed from that of his opponents.
throughout the 1790s federalists had worked to endow the new government of the united states with sufficient power to become a great nation modeled on britains commercial and military might.
following hamiltons lead federalists had increased the size of the central government and military and had also used their expansive view of federal power to crush political opposition.
by contrast jefferson hoped to reduce the size of the federal government.
jefferson invoked the ideal of liberty not power.
he described the state governments as the proper defenders of liberty.
in contrast to federalists who supported a national bank and enacted a host of taxes including the unpopular whiskey tax jefferson sought to reduce the burdens government placed on the people.
rather than favor commerce he emphasized the encouragement of agriculture with commerce as its handmaid to achieve economy in public expense he would scale back the size of government.
an alert citizenry a vigorous militia and strong state governments were the foundation upon which to build americas future.
finally opposing laws such as the sedition act jefferson praised freedom of the press reminding americans that political conflict was a testimony to the vitality of american life not a sign of weakness.
what does monticello reveal about jeffersons values.
the jeffersonian style jeffersons inaugural not only set out his philosophical differences with federalists but also gave him the occasion to dramatize them.
jeffersons vision had always melded democratic ideals to aristocratic tastes.
he labored to create a different presidential style from those who came before him.
jefferson loathed the pomp and ceremony that washington and adams had used to exalt the presidency.
rather than ride to his inaugural in an elegant coach jefferson walked behind a small band of maryland militia.
instead of delivering his annual address to congress from a monarch like throne as his predecessors had done he had a clerk read them.
jefferson also rejected the elegant balls that federalists had staged during the washington and adams presidencies as smacking too much of european style monarchy.
abandoning the pomp and aristocratic style of his predecessors and replacing it with a more democratic style defined the public face of jeffersons presidency.
yet jefferson remained a rich virginian slaveholder whose tastes were anything but common.
although jefferson dispensed with much of the formality of his predecessors his presidency still reflected his aristocratic tastes.
dinner with jefferson involved an unusual mix of informality and aristocratic style.
he dressed informally when he entertained guests wearing a pair of worn leather slippers which shocked those used to the formality of washington and adams.
yet those invited to monticello the home jefferson designed himself in the mountains of western virginia 7 1 found themselves in an architectural masterpiece that confidently proclaimed its owners wealth and exquisite read the document jeffersons first inaugural address politics in jeffersonian america taste.
the food and wine served at these dinners were equally impressive.
jefferson regaled his dinner guests with the sensual delights of his table and the dazzling brilliance of his conversation which ranged over everything from philosophy to agriculture.
a connoisseur of fine wines jeffersons annual wine bill for his first term in office came to 2 400 almost ten times the yearly income of a typical artisan.
political slurs and the politics of honor literate and urbane thomas jefferson was deeply influenced by the enlightenment particularly its emphasis on reason and science.
one of his many interests was fossils.
jefferson wrote about mammoths in his book notes on virginia.
four months after his inauguration his friend the artist charles wilson peale set out to exhume the remains of a mastodon in upstate new york.
president jefferson enthusiastically supporting peale even authorized the use of u s military equipment to aid in the dig.
the expedition proved to be a monumental undertaking as reflected in peales painting of the event 7 2.
the disinterment of the giant fossil testified to american ingenuity.
to jefferson the expedition was a symbol of the new nations commitment to the values of the enlightenment.
his interest in fossils and mastodon bones however provided an easy target for his enemies who mocked him as the mammoth philosopher or the mammoth of democracy in response his supporters attempted to turn jeffersons passionate interest in 7 1 jeffersons monticello jeffersons design for monticello borrowed elements from english architecture including the classical columns and the latest parisian styles such as the domed roof that caps the building.
mastodons to his advantage.
the president was presented with a mammoth cheese weighing more than 1 200 pounds.
the delivery of the cheese to the president became a sensation and filled newspaper columns for months.
mammoth jokes however were among the milder partisan attacks leveled at jefferson.
his lavish home at monticello also prompted sarcastic comments.
federalists pointed out the obvious contradiction between the presidents support for democracy and his own aristocratic tastes in architecture food and wine.
his enemies also highlighted the contradiction between jeffersons impassioned defense of liberty and his life as a slaveholder.
monticello was a large working plantation and was therefore home to a sizable african american slave community.
indeed as the chart and illustration in envisioning evidence the world of slavery at monticello show slaves vastly outnumbered monticellos free white population which included jeffersons family and white laborers on the mountaintop.
7 2 exhuming the first american mastodon charles wilson peales painting of the exhumation of the mammoth is a tribute to american ingenuity and the enlightenment values esteemed by jefferson.
the centerpiece of the painting is not the fossils but a machine to remove water from the dig a visual tribute to american science and engineering.
what does monticello reveal about thomas jeffersons ideas and values.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 envisioning evidence the world of slavery at monticello as the pictogram below illustrates at monticello thomas jefferson and his family were surrounded by a large community of african american slaves who worked in the kitchens and gardens and served as skilled craftsmen.
jefferson owned as many as 150 slaves and he employed them in a variety of occupations at monticello and on the other lands he owned.
slaves worked the fields built furniture manufactured nails cooked jeffersons meals and worked in a variety of other occupations that made it possible for him to maintain his aristocratic lifestyle.
compared to the splendor of the main house at monticello the typical dwelling of a slave was extremely humble.
who lived at monticello.
thomas jefferson and his family lived at monticello with enslaved african americans and free european and american craftsmen.
this chart represents the population of this busy plantation in the late 1790s.
thomas jefferson planter statesman maria jefferson eppes jeffersons daughter martha jefferson randolph jeffersons daughter ann cary randolph child thomas jefferson randolph child john wayles eppes planter marias husband thomas mann randolph planter marthas husband ellen wayles randolph child cornelia jefferson randolph child free european and american craftsmen enslaved african americans what role did slavery play in life at monticello.
politics in jeffersonian america jeffersons slaves were housed in cramped and primitive dwellings.
the contrast between these humble slave shacks and the mansion inhabited by jefferson and his family provided a striking visual contrast to anyone who visited monticello.
attacks on the president became intensely personal.
one of jeffersons former supporters the disgruntled newspaper editor james callender accused jefferson of taking sally hemings a monticello slave as his concubine this political cartoon 7 3 portrays jefferson as a cock courting the hen sally hemings.
the press charged that the president had a slave mistress and tales of jeffersons monticellan sally appeared in newspapers.
although jefferson ignored these accusations the sally hemings scandal persisted long after he left the presidency.
among the descendents of monticellos slaves the belief that jefferson had fathered children with sally hemings became part of a family oral tradition that persisted for more than two centuries.
many descendents of jefferson and modern scholars doubted the truth of these rumors until modern forensic dna testing provided strong evidence that a male in jeffersons blood line was the likely father of at least one child by sally hemings.
although not everyone has been persuaded many scholars now believe that jefferson did have a sexual relationship with hemings.
federalist attacks on jefferson went well beyond slurs on his character.
his most vocal critics charged that had white southerners not been entitled to count three fifths of their slaves in apportioning electoral votes in 1800 part of the compromise worked out in the constitutional convention see chapter 5 jefferson would have lost to adams.
however the charge that jefferson was a negro president was not entirely true since he won clear majorities in the north and mid atlantic and his margin in the electoral college would have been even greater if presidential electors from those regions had more accurately reflected the popular vote in the states that supported jefferson.
jefferson was not the only politician whose reputation was dragged through the mud.
attacks on character were frequent and in a culture in which honor played a central role they demanded an appropriate response.
if an apology or retraction were not forthcoming a man might demand satisfaction on the field of honor resulting in a duel.
leading politicians participated in duels and gentlemen typically owned dueling pistols.
often friends intervened and prevented a duel from reaching its deadly conclusion.
efforts to avert tragedy read the document memoirs of a monticello slave of all the damsels on the green on mountain or in valley a lass so luscious neer was seen as monticellan sally boston gazette 1802 failed in the most famous duel of the era no one stopped the face off between vice president aaron burr and his longtime rival in new york politics alexander hamilton.
burrs candidacy for governor of new york in 1804 was undermined by hamiltons attacks.
a newspaper reported that hamilton had described the vice president as a dangerous man and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government hamilton also insulted burrs personal integrity and honor.
burr demanded an apology.
when hamilton refused burr challenged him to a duel.
on july 11 1804 the two men met across the river from new york city in weehawken new jersey and burr fatally shot hamilton.
authorities in both new york and new jersey immediately charged burr with murder and he fled to philadelphia where he remained a fugitive.
news of the duel spread through the country.
in baltimore angry citizens burned the vice president in effigy.
eventually the charges against burr were dropped although dueling was still illegal in most states duelers were rarely prosecuted.
7 3 jefferson and sally hemings jeffersons enemies spread rumors about his illicit sexual relationship with his slave sally hemings.
this caricature of jefferson as a cock and sally hemings as a hen presents the scandal in comic terms.
what role did honor play in the political culture of jeffersonian america.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 an expanding empire of liberty many of jeffersons supporters hoped that the new president would radically restructure the balance of power between the states and the federal government.
mandan w they would be disappointed.
rather than a wholesale assault on the hamiltonian cheyenne sioux system jefferson opted for a more modest less confrontational approach.
the exception was the judiciary.
the federalists had expanded and seeded it with opponents of jefferson presenting him with a major challenge.
still jefferson believed that his election had ushered in a revolutionary change that altered the course of americas future.
jeffersons vision for the future depended on preserving his ideal of a yeoman republic.
perhaps his greatest challenge was posed by the unexpected opportunity to purchase the entire louisiana territory from the french emperor napoleon.
to justify this purchase which required an enormous and unprecedented exercise of federal power jefferson would need to accept a hamiltonian view of the constitution.
jeffersons vision of an expanding empire of liberty peopled by independent yeoman farmers came into conflict with his vision of limited government.
ouri r mandan villages winter quarters 1804 05 dismantling the federalist program jeffersons approach to change in government was moderate and conciliatory.
instead of purging all federalists he dismissed only those who were corrupt inept or who posed serious obstacles to his agenda.
similarly although jefferson had contemplated declaring the sedition act unconstitutional he simply refused to bring forward any new indictments pardoning individuals prosecuted by federalists and allowing the law to expire.
jefferson remained committed to the ideal of a republican system in which the states not the federal government retained most authority.
the powers of the federal government pertained to the external and mutual relations only of these states the states were responsible for the principal care of our persons our property with states rights in mind jefferson reduced the size of the federal government.
he directed secretary of the treasury albert gallatin to eradicate the national debt created by the federalists.
gallatin severed the connection between the bank of the united states and the federal government using the sale of the governments interest in the bank to lower the national debt.
to make up for the loss of income from the repeal of unpopular taxes jefferson relied on the sale of western lands and tariffs on imports.
convinced that the militia could protect americas peacetime interests he slashed the budget of the navy and the army sharply reducing the size of both.
this decision would create problems for jefferson in his second term.
without a powerful navy to protect american merchant ships france and britain could threaten the new nations commerce.
they have retired into the the courts the last bastion judiciary as a stronghold.
there of federalist power the remains of federalism are to early in his first term jefferson told a supporter be preserved and fed from the that the federalists have retired into the juditreasury and from that battery ciary as a stronghold one of the last acts of john federalist administration had been the all the works of republicanism adamss passage of the judiciary act of 1801 which created new circuit and district court judges and are to be beaten down other legal offices such as clerks federal marshals and erased justices of the peace and attorneys.
with new thomas jefferson to john dickinson december 19 1801 was jeffersons election in 1800 a real revolution.
appointments adams had hoped to solidify the federalists control of the judiciary.
the judiciary act also reduced the number of supreme court hear the audio file jefferson and liberty an expanding empire of liberty justices from six to five.
the reduction would take effect upon the death or retirement of one of the sitting justices.
by reducing the number of supreme court justices federalists hoped to minimize the likelihood that jefferson would appoint a justice during his tenure.
jefferson instructed secretary of state james madison to withhold any of the new appointments that arrived after he was to be sworn in as president.
a disappointed office seeker william marbury sued madison seeking a court order to compel jefferson to turn over his commission.
in what became a landmark in american constitutional law marbury v madison 1803 strengthened the powers of the federal judiciary fixing the doctrine of judicial review as a cornerstone of american constitutional law.
see choices and consequences john marshalls predicament on page 196.
the louisiana purchase in his first inaugural address jefferson described america as a chosen country with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation to remain a republic of virtuous yeoman farmers and keep alive the ideal of an empire of liberty the nation he argued would have to expand westward.
jeffersons vision of an expanding empire of liberty however had little room for african americans and demanded that indians either assimilate or perish.
the first test of the limits of the presidents vision especially his concept of liberty became apparent in his response to news of gabriels rebellion the slave uprising in virginia in 1800 see chapter 6.
the uprising prompted soulsearching by white virginians including a proposal to emancipate slaves and settle them on western lands.
virginias governor james monroe took this proposal seriously and sought the presidents advice.
jefferson opposed the plan however because he viewed such lands as vital to americas future.
he did not wish to see land that could go to whites and help preserve his vision of a yeoman republic set aside for blacks.
the west was essential to jeffersons vision of the nation.
when he took office more than 500 000 americans lived west of the appalachian mountains access to the mississippi river had become crucial to their prosperity.
agricultural produce destined for new orleans traveled on large flat boats down the mississippi.
pinckneys treaty 1795 with spain provided navigation rights to this vital economic corridor.
when the spanish ceded louisiana to france in 1800 they also turned over control of the mississippi to napoleon bonaparte frances ambitious military ruler.
napoleons decision to close new orleans to american shipping alarmed many in congress.
some americans advocated seizing the city.
preferring a negotiated settlement jefferson sent a delegation to france to purchase the port from napoleon.
when they arrived in paris the envoys were astounded to learn that napoleon was willing to sell all of louisiana to the united states.
acquisition of louisiana would double the size of the united states but the constitution did not authorize the president to purchase new territory.
to fulfill his dream of securing enough land for the nation to remain a yeoman republic jefferson had to abandon his constitutional philosophy of strict construction which limited the powers of the federal government to those expressly delegated by the constitution.
although jefferson contemplated amending the constitution to enable such a purchase he feared that napoleon might withdraw his offer before an amendment could be ratified.
so jefferson abandoned his constitutional ideals to achieve his political objective.
with the louisiana purchase the united states acquired the louisiana territory from france in 1803 thereby securing control of the mississippi river and virtually doubling the size of the new nation 7 4 on page 197.
there is on the globe one single spot the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy.
it is new orleans through which the produce of three eighths of our territory must pass to market and from its fertility it will ere long yield more than half of our whole produce and contain more than half our inhabitants read the document thomas jefferson to john c breckinridge constitutionality of the louisiana purchase 1803 thomas jefferson 1802 was the louisiana purchase consistent with jeffersons ideals.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 choices and consequences john marshalls predicament the case of marbury v madison pitted president jefferson against the new federalist chief justice of the supreme court john marshall.
jefferson a champion of states rights resented the federalist controlled judiciary and in particular marshall an ardent nationalist who supported a strong central government and a powerful judiciary.
marbury v madison presented marshall with a tremendous opportunity to enhance the power of the court but it also set up the possibility of a serious conflict between the court and the executive branch.
could marshall compel jefferson to deliver the commission against his will.
what if jefferson refused the court order.
although marshall sought to strengthen the power of the court a direct confrontation with jefferson might have the opposite effect if marshall ruled against the president and jefferson ignored the courts ruling.
marshall had three possible options.
choices give marbury his commission.
continuing controversies what role should judicial review play in a democracy.
the power of unelected judges to overturn acts of the legislature struck many americans in jeffersons day as undemocratic and inconsistent with representative government.
modern critics still argue that judicial review is undemocratic.
supporters of judicial review argue that the courts serve a necessary countermajoritarian role.
by protecting minorities against overbearing majorities a strong judiciary with the power of judicial review safeguards individual liberty.
the controversy that began with marbury v madison continues to this day.
how did john marshall avoid a showdown with jefferson in marbury v madison.
deny marbury the commission.
acknowledge the legitimacy of marburys claim while somehow avoiding a showdown between the court and the executive branch.
decision marshall stated emphatically that marbury was entitled to the commission.
but he asserted just as strongly that he could not order madison to deliver the commission because the supreme court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.
thus marshall used a technical legal issue to avoid a showdown between the executive and the judiciary.
to arrive at this result marshall declared part of an earlier law the judiciary act of 1789 unconstitutional.
john marshall consequences legal scholars usually regard marbury v madison as one of the most important and brilliant opinions in supreme court history.
marshall gave all the parties in the case a partial victory.
by affirming that marbury was entitled to the commission marshall gave him a moral victory while also handing jefferson a practical political victory.
his ruling strengthened the concept of judicial review the notion that courts might overturn acts of the legislature when they conflicted with the constitution thus giving the biggest victory to the supreme court whose power was enhanced.

one of the primary goals of the lewis and clark expedition was to map this region.
lewis and clark in january 1803 six months before news of the purchase of louisiana jefferson had requested funds from congress for an expedition to explore and map the western parts of the continent.
meriwether lewis jeffersons private secretary headed the expedition.
lewis invited captain william clark an army officer with experience in mapmaking to join him in commanding a corps of volunteers for north western discovery beginning their heroic trek westward in the frontier town of st louis the intrepid explorers set out on keelboats long narrow boats that could carry ten tons of supplies.
the expedition traveled up the missouri river.
progress was slow and the explorers sometimes had to wade along the bank to pull the boats forward by ropes.
still if all went well they could travel 14 miles on a good day.
the purchase of louisiana added a new element to the mission.
in addition to gathering information about native plants animals and geography lewis was charged with negotiating commercial treaties with indian tribes and informing the european and american traders inhabiting the louisiana territory that they were now subject to the laws of the united states.
the small band of explorers included a french interpreter toussaint charbonneau and his shoshone wife sacagawea who served the corps ably as a translator.
her presence also signaled the indians that lewis and clarks intentions were peaceful.
an armed group of men might have easily been viewed as a war party.
the inclusion of what role did sacagawea play in the lewis and clark expedition.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 7 5 jeffersons indian hall at monticello jeffersons main entrance hall contained many indian artifacts including a mandan buffalo hide robe which hung from the balcony far right.
the images painted on these robes often depicted heroic exploits of the warriors who wore them.
sacagawea and her young child neither could be perceived as a warrior helped the corps of discovery avoid conflict.
clark stressed the importance of this when he wrote in his journal a woman with a party of men is a token of peace enduring incredible hardship including temperatures as low as 45 below zero the corps of discovery traversed almost 4 000 miles.
the trek took more than two years.
the map 7 4 shows the path of lewis and clark.
the corps provided invaluable information about the geography biology and peoples of the west.
jefferson had instructed lewis and clark to obtain information about the indigenous cultures they encountered including their languages traditions and occupations.
although gathering intelligence would prove invaluable for future diplomatic negotiations and trade with these peoples jeffersons instructions also reflected his lifelong interest in indian cultures.
many items that lewis what were the main goals of the lewis and clark expedition.
and clark collected were displayed in jeffersons indian hall at monticello.
many indian artifacts were on view in this space including an impressive mandan buffalo robe which hangs above the entrance to the room 7 5.
indian responses to jeffersonian expansionism assimilation or revivalism jeffersons interest in the indians was motivated by a paternalistic regard for indians and indian cultures.
he believed that indian societies although inferior to western culture had a primitive nobility worthy of respect.
in choosing to view indians this way jefferson carried forward a much older notion of noble savagery that had warped european views of indians since their first encounters more than 300 years earlier.
watch the video video lecture lewis and clark what were they trying to accomplish.
an expanding empire of liberty a student of the enlightenment jefferson also believed that environment shaped culture.
taken together these two beliefs led him to be cautiously optimistic in his view of the future of americanindian relations a noticeable contrast with his deeply pessimistic view of future relations between enslaved african americans and white americans.
indians simply needed to abandon their traditional ways and adopt western agriculture and cultural values.
once they shed their traditions indians could then freely intermarry with whites.
assimilation and absorption would solve americas indian problem.
once indians were amalgamated into american society their lands could be made available for settlement which would help sustain the ideal of a yeoman republic and thereby ensure the viability of jeffersons political vision for america.
jefferson supported trade with indians including granting them generous terms of credit which would encourage indebtedness and force indians to sell their lands to pay off their debts.
jefferson also hoped to teach indians western agricultural practices and to promote western style gender roles in the division of labor.
the goal was to have indian women abandon work in the fields and take up tasks more typical of western women including spinning.
in 1803 he encouraged georgia indian agent benjamin hawkins to help the creeks pursue agriculture and household manufacture although some tribes followed the path of assimilation others rejected western ways entirely.
in the 1790s a cultural revival occurred among the iroquois in western new york and the shawnee creeks and cherokees on the trans appalachian frontier.
the revival aimed at revitalizing indian religious beliefs and cultural practices.
the revivalists also attacked the european and american practices that had been incorporated into indian cultures.
one leader in the indian revival movement was handsome lake who led a revitalization movement among the seneca of new york beginning in 1799.
among the values he championed was abstinence from alcohol.
traders during the colonial period had introduced alcohol among indian peoples creating a serious problem for many indigenous communities.
handsome lake had himself battled with his own alcohol addiction.
a key turning point in his life occurred when he experienced religious visions that led him to revive aspects of the iroquois great law of peace.
this ideal was central to the great iroquoian confederacy and enjoined members of the confederacy to seek diplomatic not military solutions to conflicts.
in 1801 handsome lake traveled to washington d c to meet with president jefferson to defend the land claims of his people against encroachment from settlers.
another effort at religious and cultural revival took place among the shawnee and other tribes of the great lakes region.
the leader of this movement the prophet tenskwatawa also battled with alcohol addiction.
his plan for a revival of traditional culture also came to him in religious visions.
the prophet instructed his people to reject western influences and return to traditional indian ways.
in contrast to handsome lakes evocation of peace tenskwatawa adopted a more militant stance.
he joined his brother the military leader tecumseh in organizing rival indian nations to work together to resist american expansion into indian lands.
this pan indian resistance movement united six tribes to repel white encroachments in ohio and indiana.
rather than seek peaceful accommodation with the united states this movement resolved to defend indian lands by force.
to promote this disposition to exchange lands.
we shall push our trading uses and be glad to see the good and influential individuals among them run in debt because we observe that when these debts get beyond what the individuals can pay they becoming willing to lop them off by a cession of lands.
in this way our settlements will gradually circumscribe and approach the indians thomas jefferson to william henry harrison 1803 read the document jeffersons confidential message to congress 1803 what were the central beliefs of handsome lakes religious revival.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 dissension at home in 1804 jefferson easily defeated his opponent the federalist charles pinckney by 162 electoral votes to 14 to start a second term as president.
the margin of victory was a tribute to the achievements of his first administration during which he had overseen a peaceful relatively smooth transition from federalist to republican rule.
jefferson had dismantled parts of the government bureaucracy overseen a robust economy and preserved the ideal of a nation of yeoman farmers by acquiring the vast new territory of louisiana.
in contrast to the successes of his first term however challenges at home and abroad marred his second four years in office.
divisions within the republican movement plagued jeffersons second term.
meanwhile his effort to avoid entanglement in european conflicts would lead him to institute an embargo against foreign trade that proved extremely unpopular in new england and seaport towns and cities dependent on foreign trade.
jeffersons attack on the federalist judiciary 7 6 portrait of aaron burr artist john vanderlyn a protg of burr painted this striking portrait of the controversial politician during burrs tenure as vice president.
the final element in the republican strategy to rein in the federalist judiciary involved using the constitutional power of impeachment to remove two of the most controversial federalist judges.
toward the end of his first term jefferson scored a victory by removing judge john pickering of new hampshire a notorious drunk.
although he had clearly been unqualified to hold office many of jeffersons supporters were worried about using impeachment as a partisan tool.
some republicans doubted that pickerings deplorable behavior qualified as high crimes and misdemeanors the constitutions criteria for removal from office.
still jefferson managed to persuade enough members of the senate to convict pickering.
buoyed by his victory in the election of 1804 jefferson next turned his attention to samuel chase a federal judge who had used the bench as a pulpit to denounce jefferson and his ideas by delivering long winded speeches to juries.
few republicans would have disputed the charge that chase was partisan and obnoxious but neither of these was an impeachable offense if one construed the constitution according to jeffersons rule of strict construction.
ardent republicans argued that impeachment was the only tool to check the excesses of unelected judges.
more moderate republicans and federalists insisted that an impeachable offense had to be a criminal act stridency and partisanship were simply not impeachable offenses.
the senate failed to convict chase and the episode drove a wedge between the radical and moderate wings of jeffersons coalition.
the controversial mr burr the duel between hamilton and burr ended the latters public political career but not his political scheming.
burr was soon charged with conspiracy and treason.
the exact details of his plot are sketchy but he appears to have planned to raise a private army to conquer mexico.
the evidence that he intended to invade american territory is less compelling.
in any case burr was certainly one of the more flamboyant personalities of the early republic a quality his friend and protg painter john vanderlyn captured in this portrait 7 6.
jefferson pushed hard to prosecute burr for treason.
chief justice john marshall refused to construe the treason clause in more broad terms forcing the government to produce two witnesses who could testify that burr had waged war against the united states.
under this more precise definition of treason the prosecution was unable to convict burr.
marshalls decision to read the treason clause in such narrow terms infuriated jefferson who on this occasion seemed to embrace a theory of constitutional interpretation at odds with his own preferred theory of strict construction.
in essence when it came to burr jefferson argued that one ought to construe the constitutions definition of treason in hamiltonian terms.
having avoided the charge of treason burr went into exile in europe after the trial but eventually returned to new york to start a lucrative law practice.
why did jefferson target the federal judiciary and seek to limit its power.
america confronts a world at war america confronts a world at war in 1803 within two weeks of its sale of louisiana france was again at war with britain.
although napoleons armies dominated the european continent britains navy commanded the seas and defeated the french fleet at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.
during the early phases of the european conflict american merchants reaped enormous profits by trading with both the french and the british.
however both britain and france eager to exert economic pressure on their enemies set out to blockade the ports of their adversaries.
the united states argued that neutral nations had a right to carry on nonmilitary trade with both sides in the conflict but neither britain nor france honored this idea.
the british navy boarded and searched american ships and seized cargoes without providing compensation.
even more galling to americans was the british practice of impressment forcing merchant seamen to serve in the british navy.
many american sailors had once served in the british navy but now claimed american citizenship.
the british refused to recognize these claims arguing that the men were deserters still subject to british law.
between 1803 and 1812 the british navy abducted and impressed 6 000 americans.
the tense environment on the high seas reached a crisis in 1807 when the british warship the leopard fired at an american navy ship the chesapeake.
three americans were killed and 18 wounded.
the british abducted four american sailors whom they charged were deserters from the royal navy.
people in americas seaports clamored for revenge for the chesapeake affair.
citizens of norfolk virginia were particularly outraged because the chesapeake had been built in the towns shipyards.
norfolk passed a resolution denouncing this outrageous assault on american liberty and honor.
one british diplomat noted that the lowest order of the americans are much irritated and inclined for violent measures mobs took to the streets to protest in many of the nations ports.
president jefferson instructed the governors of the states to be prepared to call up 100 000 militia men.
the failure of peaceable coercion hoping to avoid war with the british and french jefferson proposed a policy of peaceable coercion our commerce jefferson wrote is so valuable to them that they will be glad to purchase it when the only price we ask is to do us justice the embargo act of 1807 became the cornerstone of peaceable coercion by keeping americas ships out of harms way and depriving britain and france of the economic benefits of american trade jefferson hoped to pressure both sides to respect the rights of neutrals on the high seas.
smugglers flouted the ban and it proved unpopular in new england and seaports where it hit the shipping business hard.
american exports fell from 108 million in 1807 to 22 million in 1808.
to enforce the embargo along the canadian border jefferson had to send troops a policy he had decried during the whiskey rebellion a decade earlier.
federalists in new england whose political fortunes had been flagging now regained their voice rallying against jefferson and his dambargo as this cartoon 7 7 lampooning jeffersons efforts to avoid foreign conflict suggests the embargo did not intimidate britain or france but it weakened the american economy.
madisons travails diplomatic blunders abroad and tensions on the frontier the presidential election of 1808 marked the first time that republicans split over who should lead them.
james madison who had been jeffersons closest advisor during the turbulent 1790s was jeffersons choice.
quiet almost scholarly in temperament madison had impressive accomplishments.
he had been an architect of the constitution had drafted the bill of rights and had served as jeffersons secretary of state.
other choices were former anti federalists george clinton and james monroe.
what was peaceable coercion.
chapter 7 7 7 intercourse or impartial dealings jefferson stands helpless caught between king george iii and napoleon.
jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 clintons candidacy fizzled but monroe gained support.
borrowing from a practice begun in 1800 congressmen met in a caucus to decide on a presidential and vice presidential candidate.
the republican caucus decided that madison would carry forward jeffersons mantle.
jeffersons embargo act not only divided republicans but also strengthened the fortunes of the federalists in places such as new england where the economic impact of the embargo hit hardest.
the federalist candidate charles pinckney received three times as many votes as he had in 1804 doing particularly well in new england.
despite the strong federalist showing in new england and new york madison defeated pinckney by 122 to 47 electoral votes to become the fourth president of the united states.
unfortunately for madison he had inherited a major foreign policy crisis from jefferson.
the embargo had not forced britain and france to change their policy.
the main casualties from this policy had been southern agriculture and new england commerce.
madisons faith in a peaceful solution received a boost when britains ambassador opened talks about ending the embargo.
britain even accepted madisons insistence that it pay reparations for the chesapeake incident and offered to stop view the image british impressment searching and seizing american vessels in neutral waters.
however the british government repudiated the generous terms negotiated by the british ambassador dashing hopes for peace.
frustrated by the diplomatic impasse congress sought another solution to the problem.
a house select committee headed by nathaniel macon proposed to provide muchneeded customs revenue by allowing british and french goods back into american harbors if they were transported on american ships.
although the measure failed a second proposal macons bill no.
2 did pass.
the most important provision of macons bill no.
2 stipulated that when either britain or france repealed its restrictions on neutral trade america would reinstate sanctions against the other nation.
seizing on this law napoleon promised that france would honor the rights of neutrals.
napoleon who had little intention of keeping his word thus used macons bill to drive a wedge between the united states and britain.
the british pointed out that napoleons promise was hardly sufficient proof to meet the terms set by macon bill no.
2 to lift commercial sanctions.
britain complained that americas new posture toward france and continuing hostility to britain were not justified.
rather than provide a means to normalize relations with both france and britain american policy heightened tensions with britain.
the repeated violation of their neutrality was not the only american grievance against britain.
as american settlers streamed into the new state of ohio 1803 and the indiana territory many of them blamed the british for instigating indians to attack them.
britains lucrative trade with these indians included the sale of firearms and these weapons proved especially useful to tecumseh whose pan indian resistance movement was gathering followers as indians faced further encroachments on their land.
although tecumsehs brother the prophet exhorted his followers to reject all aspects of white civilization european military technology proved too useful to abandon.
tecumseh worked to convince various tribes to unite to oppose further american expansion.
indigenous peoples resolve to resist western expansion intensified after a series of treaties how did british relations with indians in the northwest exacerbate political tensions with america.
america confronts a world at war signed at fort wayne 1809 in which the united states wrested three million acres of land from the delaware and potawatomi in indiana.
to squash resistance william henry harrison led a military expedition against tecumseh and his supporters in 1811.
harrisons expedition burned to the ground the village of tippecanoe the center of tecumsehs pan indian movement.
after this attack tecumseh entered into a formal alliance with the british who supplied further arms to the indians.
confident that their alliance with the british would help defeat american forces tecumseh and his allies stepped up attacks on american settlements along the frontier.
the war of 1812 frustrated by the inability of peaceable coercion to force britain to respect american rights on the high seas and angered by british support for tecumseh madison began preparations for war.
he called congress into an early session in fall 1811.
republicans dominated congress but were divided over war against britain.
many republicans from the mid atlantic especially new york were reluctant to take on the most powerful navy in the world.
old republicans the more radical states rights wing of the jeffersonian coalition who were particularly strong in madisons home state of virginia feared that war would lead to the creation of a large military establishment and new taxes.
madison drew his strongest support from a group of war hawks young republican congressmen from the south and west who were intensely nationalistic resented british attacks on american rights and favored an aggressive policy of expansion into indian occupied territory and the annexation of canada.
the two leading war hawks were henry clay a first term congressmen from kentucky and john c calhoun an up country south carolinian educated at yale.
the house voted to declare war by 79 to 49.
the margin in the senate was 19 to 13.
no single pattern accounts for all the votes but enthusiasm for the war ran high in many parts of america.
regional economic and party identities shaped the final vote.
british involvement with western native american tribes particularly in the supply of guns angered westerners.
northeastern republicans who favored war were motivated by anger against this latest threat to american freedom from british tyranny.
they saw a struggle that had begun during the revolution and would not end until america was truly free of british power.
federalists viewed the vote as another example of the republicans distorted vision of the world.
for federalists france not britain was the true enemy.
federalists were unanimously opposed to the war a sentiment which intensified when they learned that the british had been prepared to yield on some points of contention.
anger over federalist opposition to war led to violence.
one baltimore federalist newspaper editor who criticized the war was targeted by a mob of angry republicans who attacked his office and destroyed his printing press.
his attempt to resume printing after the incident triggered a full scale riot that plunged the city into chaos and was put down only when the militia was called out.
the resulting destruction of property and loss of life were the worst instance of public unrest in the young nations short history and earned baltimore the nickname mob town the war pitted the united states against britain for the second time in less than a half century.
as this political cartoon shows 7 8 the primary justification for the war of 1812 was britains violation of american neutrality and seizure of american sailors.
in the cartoon columbia the symbol of america reminds france and britain that they must respect free trade and seamens rights or face retribution.
the other issue british support for indian attacks on frontier settlements also galvanized popular support for the war effort particularly in the west.

who were the war hawks.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 competing visions war hawks and their critics americans were deeply divided over the war of 1812.
in the southwest support for the war was motivated by concern over britains indian policy.
representative felix grundy a prominent war hawk from tennessee charged that the british had instigated indian violence against americans.
indians killed three of grundys brothers in the conflict along the frontier.
by contrast the sharp tongued virginian conservative john randolph a prominent old republican became a vocal critic of the war.
fiercely independent randolph dismissed grundys suggestion of an indian british conspiracy instead putting the blame for western conflicts squarely on the settlers who violated indian land claims.
how did grundys experiences as a westerner color his decision to support war.
was randolphs response likely to attract political support why or why not.
why would randolph opt to frame his opposition in these terms.
in this impassioned speech felix grundy accused the british of arming and inciting american indians to take up arms against americans.
it cannot be believed by any man who will reflect that the savage tribes uninfluenced by other powers would think of making war on the united states.
they understand too well their own weakness and our strength.
they have already felt the weight of our arms they know they hold the very soil on which they live as tenants in sufferance.
how then sir are we to account for their late conduct.
in one way only some powerful nation must have intrigued with them and turned their peaceful dispositions towards us into hostilities.
great britain alone has intercourse with those northern tribes john randolphs response to grundy dismissed the notion of a conspiracy.
the source of conflict along americas frontier randolph argued was the greed of westerners who encroached on indian lands.
session after session their table had been piled up with indian treaties for which the appropriations has been voted as a matter of course without examination.
advantage had been taken of the spirit of the indians broken by the war which ended in the treaty of greenville 1795.
under the ascendancy then acquired over them they had been pent up by subsequent treaties into nooks straightened in their quarters by a blind cupidity seeking to extinguish their title to immense wilderness for which possessing as we do already more land than we can sell or use we shall not have occasion for half a century to come.
it was our own thirst for territory our own want of moderation that had driven these sons of nature to desperation a scene on the frontiers as practiced by the humane british and their worthy allies read the document pennsylvania gazette indian hostilities 1812 why did westerners believe that the british were encouraging indian violence against americans.

attacking the british in canada appealed to the war hawks.
canada was poorly defended and americans mistakenly believed that quebecs large french speaking population would eagerly join americans to expel the british from canada.
seizing canada would also deprive tecumseh of his primary source of arms.
given the power of the british empire particularly its naval superiority the focus on conquering canada or at least holding it hostage to force britain to respect neutral rights on the high seas seemed a promising strategy.
american efforts to wrest canada from britain however failed miserably as british troops beat back incursions into canada along the u s border.
the british also harassed americas coastal settlements and blockaded its ports.

while diplomatic efforts to end the war intensified the british suffered a crushing defeat when they assaulted new orleans in january 1815.
andrew jackson the american commander at new orleans led a mixture of regular troops militia free blacks and a few indians.
jackson even accepted help from french pirates.

newspapers proclaimed the victory a symbol of the rising glory of the american republic neither side in this battle knew that the two nations had already signed a peace treaty.
it took two weeks for word of peace to reach louisiana 7 9 major battles of the war of 1812 americas effort to seize canada failed but some of the fiercest fighting occurred along this northern frontier.
what were the main military consequences of the war of 1812.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 nothing was adjusted nothing was settled nothing in substance but an indefinite suspension of hostilities was agreed to john quincy adams describing the treaty of ghent 1815 arriving after the battle was over.
the treaty of ghent in 1814 named for the belgian city where the negotiations were conducted ended the fighting but failed to settle the long standing issues between the two nations.
indeed if judged by the terms of the peace treaty the war of 1812 accomplished little.
the issues at stake at the beginning of the war including the impressment of american sailors and the rights of neutral trade remained unresolved.
in private some americans including john quincy adams who negotiated the treaty felt it did little more than end hostilities.
the american public generally regarded the war as a victory calling it the second war for independence.
at least america had defended its honor forcing the most powerful nation in the world to treat the new republic with respect a perception reflected in this painting celebrating the treaty 7 10 america represented by columbia reaches out the hand of friendship to britannia.
while the british and americans had fought to a draw the most conspicuous losers in the war were the indians living along the frontier who lost an important ally when the british withdrew and were forced to make major land concessions to americans.
pan indian nationalists such as tecumseh suffered a severe setback at the hands of william henry harrison and andrew jackson whose military successes secured the transappalachian frontier the western territory beyond the appalachian mountains for settlement.

england federalists had denounced the radical states rights ideas that jeffersonians had espoused in response to the alien and sedition crisis in 1798 they now echoed many of those ideas.
the convention delegates proposed constitutional amendments that would strengthen new englands influence in the union.
in particular they sought to require a two thirds majority for commercial regulations declarations of war and the admission of new states.
to weaken the souths influence in congress the hartford convention also called for a repeal of the three fifths compromise which allowed southerners to count a percentage of their slaves for the purposes of determining a states representation in the house.
the hartford conventions proposals were publicized at the same time as news of the treaty of ghent and the victory at new orleans were fueling a new sense of national pride.
in this political cartoon ridiculing the hartford convention 7 11 leading new england federalists appear ready to leap off a cliff into the welcoming arms of britains king.
federalists narrow sectionalism appeared out of step with the publics new patriotic fervor.
even in their new england stronghold federalists saw themselves irreparably damaged as a movement.
the war of 1812 facilitated the demise of the federalists as a viable political organization.
how are the actions of new england states represented in the political cartoon on the hartford convention above.
chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 the republic reborn consequences of the war of 1812 the war of 1812 transformed america its politics economy society and relations with other nations.
the postwar era inaugurated a period of nationalism that was evidenced in diplomacy economic policy and law.
there was broad popular support for a stronger central government one capable of dealing with foreign challenges and spurring domestic economic growth.
thus the partisan squabbling of the jeffersonian era gave way to the necessities of fighting a war.
these realities forced leading politicians to unite the best aspects of jeffersonian politics with hamiltonian economics.
john quincy adams secretary of state under james monroe proved to be an effective diplomat skillfully negotiating important treaties for the united states.
the demands of the wartime economy not only spurred economic and technological innovation but also increased demand for manufactured goods such as firearms and textiles for uniforms.
the new nationalist ethos and a more sympathetic attitude toward economic development were evidenced in the decisions of the supreme court after the war.
the national republican vision of james monroe a view of the presidents house in the city of washington after the conflagration of the 24th of august 1814 repairs to the damaged executive mansion included a new coat of white paint.
the residence became known as the white house the war radically transformed republican political and constitutional ideas.
in his annual message to congress in 1815 the first after the treaty of ghent madison suggested that the nation expand the size of its military and reaffirmed his support for a national bank and for protective tariffs for american industry.
seeking to push beyond this nationalist agenda madison floated the idea of chartering a national university and even considered amending the constitution to give the federal government the power to promote internal improvements such as roads and canals.
madison clung to one traditional republican idea.
he believed that to exercise such powers required a constitutional amendment.
although on this one point of constitutional theory madison reasserted the traditional republican view of the limited scope of federal power as a practical matter he had aligned himself with much of the old hamiltonian agenda.
indeed john quincy adams son of the former president and a staunch federalist believed that madison and the republicans had out federalized federalism the collapse of federalists after the war of 1812 led to a shift away from the rancor that had characterized politics during the jeffersonian era.
following madison as president james monroe sought to unite the political ideals of jeffersonianism with aspects of hamiltonian economic theory.
for a brief period he managed to create an administration free of the partisan divisions that had characterized american politics since washingtons second term.
as a gesture toward nonpartisan politics the republican monroe named the brilliant federalist john quincy adams as his secretary of state and appointed men from different regions to heal old sectional tensions.
he also took a lesson from washington the other president who seemed most successful at rising above party and embarked on a goodwill tour of the nation.
monroe began his tour in boston a city with strong federalist sympathies.
praising the gesture a boston newspaper proclaimed an era of good feelings to describe the absence of bitter partisan conflict during monroes presidency.
monroe also restored luster to the presidency.
he became noted for his stylish entertaining in the executive mansion.
to repair the smoke damage to the executive mansion 7 12 a result of the british why was monroes presidency described as an era of good feelings.
the republic reborn consequences of the war of 1812 attack on washington during the war of 1812 monroe had its exterior painted a brilliant white.
the official residence of the president of the united states has been known as the white house ever since.
monroe not only sought to reconcile federalist and jeffersonian ideals.
he also served as a bridge between the political cultures of two different centuries the eighteenth and nineteenth.
monroe was the last president with ties to the generation that fought the revolution and wrote the constitution.
his roots in the eighteenth century appear in the clothes he wore at his inauguration.
most men had abandoned their wigs and replaced breeches and silk stockings with trousers.
but monroe retained the ideals and dress of eighteenth century gentility.
in this portrait he wears breeches and silk stockings 7 13.
if monroes personal style and values harked back to the eighteenth century many of his policies as president reflected newer ideas including the idea that it was vital to encourage the expansion of the nations domestic market encouraging an active intercourse between the extremes and throughout every portion of our union one aging federalist remarked that the party in power seems disposed to do all that federal men ever wished diplomatic triumphs after the war secretary of state john quincy adams resolved outstanding border disputes with britain.
in the rush bagot treaty of 1817 the united states and britain limited naval armaments on the great lakes.
an accord reached the following year set the new boundary between the louisiana territory and canada at the 49th parallel.
the british also recognized american fishing rights off labrador and newfoundland and america and britain agreed to continue to occupy jointly the oregon territory in the pacific northwest.
these diplomatic successes effectively normalized u s canadian relations and created a peaceful border between the two countries that has persisted for more than 200 years.
adams was now free to address the southern boundary disputes with spain.
america had long been eager to wrest florida from spain.
in march 1818 andrew jackson led a raid into spanish florida to attack the seminoles.
under the pretext of protecting american settlements against indian attack he captured two spanish forts thereby further weakening spains bargaining position.
rather than risk war spain ceded all claims to florida and recognized u s sovereignty in louisiana in the adams onis treaty of 1819.
spains empire in the americas had been crumbling for two decades.
in 1811 paraguay and venezuela declared independence from spain.
in 1818 chile declared its independence and peru followed suit in 1821.
building on the goodwill generated by the resolution of the northern boundary issue between the united states and canada britains foreign minister suggested in 1823 that the united states and britain issue a declaration that neither intended to annex the newly liberated states in spanish america.
although monroe was tempted to accept the british offer adams advised against it and monroe followed his advice.
in his annual message to congress in 1823 he presented a general policy for spanish america.
this statement the monroe doctrine reiterated the policy outlined in washingtons farewell address that america would not meddle in european affairs.
it also warned european powers that the united states would view intervention in the affairs of the newly independent states of spanish americas as a threat to its security.
7 13 portrait of president james monroe this image captures monroes role as a transitional figure between the eighteenth century world of the founders and a new era in american politics.
he appears without the wigs favored by eighteenth century gentlemen but his silk stockings and knee breeches reflected the fashions of the founding generation.

chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 economic and technological innovation 7 14 slater mill the earliest factories were not imposing structures belching forth smoke but small water powered mills.
slaters first water powered mill resembled the clapboard wooden structures that had been used to grind grain or saw logs and that easily blended into their rural settings.
the war of 1812 not only led to a renewed political commitment to economic development but also spurred a remarkable period of technological development.
americas embargo against foreign goods and the demands of the wartime economy provided incentives for economic innovation.
firearms production was improved steam engines powered new modes of transportation and new agricultural technology led to a boom in cotton production.
artist and inventor samuel morse captured the ages search for political consensus and fascination with technology in his painting of the house of representatives.
see images as history samuel morses house of representatives and the national republican vision.
not surprisingly the war spurred innovation in the production of firearms.
the federal arsenals at springfield massachusetts and harpers ferry virginia played a pivotal role in advancing these developments.
indeed by the mid 1820s harpers ferry had pioneered a mass production technique for manufacturing firearms.
in place of older artisan methods in which master craftsmen handcrafted items for production the system used new power machinery to cut and shape standardized parts.
by 1820 john h hall had perfected the manufacturing techniques for fabricating arms exactly alike and with economy by the hands of common workmen hall began producing a new breech loading rifle an improvement over the traditional muzzle loading muskets.

the cotton gin an invention by eli whitney an industrious connecticut yankee working as a tutor on a southern plantation easily removed the seeds that adhered tenaciously to short staple cotton a hearty plant well suited to southern climate and soil.
whitneys cotton gin revolutionized cotton agriculture.
before his invention an adult slave needed a whole day to clean a single pound of cotton.
whitneys cotton gin allowed a single slave to clean 50 pounds of cotton a day.
in 1790 the south produced 3 000 bales of cotton.
by 1810 the cotton gin facilitated the production of 178 000 bales.
each bale weighed approximately 480 pounds.
immediately after the war of 1812 cotton production almost doubled again to 334 000 bales.
cotton would provide huge new economic incentives for slave based agriculture by making it much cheaper to produce cotton for market.
although cotton exports to britain consumed much of this new cash crop some of the cotton was purchased for domestic textile manufacturing.
in 1793 samuel slater established a mechanized spinning factory in pawtucket rhode island.
his mill was a relatively modest structure whose size and architectural style fit the scale of a small new england village.
the first mills depended on water power and took advantage of natural waterfalls to power water wheels 7 14.
slater pioneered the mill village model of what was the economic significance of whitneys cotton gin.
the republic reborn consequences of the war of 1812 images as history samuel morses house of representatives and the national republican vision in 1819 samuel morse began his ambitious painting of the house of representatives.
the painting not only reflected the political ideas of the era of good feelings it projected a nationalist vision of americas bright future.
how did morses emphasis on architectural grandeur convey the values of monroe and nationalist republican belief.
although the crowded chamber bustles with activity morse presented a scene of cordiality and harmony.
the painting captures the time before formal political business began a decision that allowed morse to create a scene free of conflict or tension.
morse chose a rare evening session of the house to illustrate.
this decision allowed him to further shift the focus away from the actions of politicians.
occupying the dramatic center of the painting is the house of representatives doorkeeper who is lighting a large chandelier to illuminate the evenings activities.
the painting thus pays tribute to americas technological progress.
it links americas political institutions symbolically to light and progress.
benjamin henry latrobe the architect responsible for rebuilding the capitol after the war of 1812 chose multicolored stones for the columns supporting the roof of the house.
this particular architectural element became a visual symbol of the idea of federalism in which the different states represented by the stones blended together in a single harmonious republican structure a classical column.
a number of distinguished guests are in the house chamber including the entire supreme court and a number of guests occupy the gallery.
the inclusion of the pawnee chief petalesharo signifies americas inevitable subjection of indians.
morses painting idealizes a brief moment in american politics that was already on the wane by the time his painting was displayed.
monroes vision of a national republican consensus and the era of good feelings was being supplanted by rising sectional tensions over slavery and a new era of partisan conflict.
morse highlighted the multicolored stone columns which symbolized the ideal of federalism.
the indian figure in the gallery symbolized monroes diplomatic achievements and the inevitable subjugation of americas indigenous population.
why did morse highlight architecture and minimize the people in his painting.
morse focused on the act of lighting the houses impressive chandelier a symbol of american progress.

the present moment is every way favorable to the establishment of a great national policy and of great national institutions in respect to the army the navy the judicial and the commercial interests of the country justice joseph story 1816 judicial nationalism no figure captured the new nationalist spirit more fully than the young supreme court justice joseph story.
a brilliant lawyer story was only 32 when james madison appointed him to the court.
madison hoped that story an anti embargo republican from massachusetts would check the nationalism of chief justice john marshall.
madison would not be the last president to be shocked and disappointed by one of his supreme court appointments.
story proved to be as nationalistic as marshall.
storys decisions on the court supported the power of the federal judiciary and limited that of the states.
in landmark decisions marshall and story helped strengthen the federal government and the courts and paved the way for economic growth.
the most famous case dealing with federalism was mcculloch v maryland.
the case arose when the state of maryland levied a tax on the baltimore branch of the second bank of the united states.
most republicans had made their peace with the idea of a bank but some continued to resent this highly visible symbol of hamiltonian federalism.
marshall declared the maryland state tax unconstitutional and affirmed an essentially hamiltonian view of the powers of the federal government.
according to marshall the federal government enjoyed broad powers under the necessary and proper clauses of the constitution which allowed it to charter a bank.
marshall further argued that the power to tax was also the power to destroy and allowing the state to tax a federally chartered institution would have allowed maryland to undermine an act of the federal government.
while marshall conceded that the powers of the federal government were not unlimited he affirmed that within its sphere of authority it enjoyed enormous latitude to accomplish any legitimate constitutional objective.
in contrast to many republicans who accepted the jeffersonian idea that individual states could judge the constitutionality of federal acts the marshall court insisted that only the supreme court could determine when the federal government had exceeded its authority.
no other decision rendered by the court generated so much controversy as that of mcculloch v maryland.
for radical opponents of the marshall court mcculloch seemed to realize the anti federalists most dire predictions.
anger over mcculloch led many republicans particularly in the south to develop a more aggressive version of states rights.
they challenged the authority of the supreme court to decide arguments between the states and the federal government.
for nationalists such as marshall and story however the creation of a more powerful central government was essential to the survival of the united states.
the marshall court also decided cases dealing with the law and the economy.
one of the most important cases dealing with economic development also expanded the scope of federal power over commerce.
in gibbons v ogden 1824 a case involving steamboats the court grappled with the scope of federal powers over interstate commerce.
in that case marshall construed the word commerce broadly to encompass every species of commercial intercourse the court also held that federal power over interstate commerce did not end at the borders of each state but extended within states when that commerce was intermingled with economic activity that crossed state lines.
although in the nineteenth century the federal government did not exploit its power over interstate commerce to the fullest the power to regulate interstate commerce is currently one of the most far reaching possessed by the federal government.
which marshall court decisions best illustrate the courts nationalism.
crises and the collapse of the national republican consensus crises and the collapse of the national republican consensus the patriotic sentiments stirred by the war of 1812 and the emergence of a new consensus around a hamiltonian economic vision contributed to a period of prosperity and optimism.
the new consensus however proved fragile and a severe depression soon followed the postwar economic boom.
slavery also vaulted to national attention when missouri sought admission to the union as a slave state.
the hope that monroes creative synthesis of the jeffersonian and hamiltonian visions might usher in a new era of good feelings proved short lived as economic and political crises again divided the nation.
the panic of 1819 economic expansion in part driven by the demand for cotton led to a growth in the financial sector of the american economy.
states chartered new banks so that the number of banks doubled between 1815 and 1818 from just over 200 to more than 400.
in 1816 congress chartered a second bank of the united states which further fueled economic expansion and land speculation.
between 1815 and 1818 land sales more than tripled.
however the price of cotton and other agricultural products exported by america dropped in 1819 leading to a severe economic downturn that affected nearly every aspect of the american economy.
since much of the expansion in credit by american banks was tied to agricultural production the crisis spread to financial institutions.
the value of land purchased on credit dropped sharply and when these loans came due speculators were unable to repay the banks that had loaned them the money to buy these properties.
the american economy now heavily dependent on cotton sank into depression.
as speculators defaulted on their obligations banks collapsed.
nearly every region of the country was affected.
the panic of 1819 the economic crisis triggered by the drop in agricultural prices and bank failures produced unprecedented economic hardship.
while the sudden downturn in the economy hurt western land speculators and cotton producers in the deep south it also devastated the growing urban centers of the northeast.
in philadelphia three out of four workers lost their jobs.
in new york the number of people classified as paupers increased from 8 000 to 13 000 in a year.
the missouri crisis the economic downturn was soon overshadowed by another crisis.
in 1819 missouri applied for admission to the union as a slave state.
congressman john tallmadge from new york demanded that missouri ban further imports of slaves and agree to eliminate slavery before joining.
public meetings across the northeast protested missouris proposed admission as a slave state.
slavery now came to the center of american politics.
agricultural languishes farmers cannot find profit in hiring labourers mechanics are in want of employment james flint comments on the panic of 1819 in letters from america 1822 the growth of cotton agriculture and the prospect of large swathes of territory in the west entering the union as slave states prompted a political crisis.

to avert a constitutional crisis congress worked out a compromise.
henry clay one of the most influential figures in congress was a key player in negotiating this solution.

thomas jefferson wrote to a friend that the crisis struck him as a fire bell in the night being awakened from a sound sleep by a fire alarm the metaphor chosen by jefferson evoked the magnitude of the missouri crisis.
for jefferson the missouri crisis had etched the issue of slavery onto the map of the united states and would make any resolution of it in the future impossible.
the debate over missouri prompted john quincy adams to write in his diary that slavery is the great and foul stain upon the north american union for the moment however most politicians seemed unwilling to contemplate erasing the great stain.
denmark veseys rebellion the problem of slavery resurfaced in summer 1822.
newspapers from charleston to boston and as far west as the illinois territory carried the sensational story of denmark vesey a free african american artisan from charleston south carolina who had been arrested tried and executed for so the charges went leading a slave insurrection.
a talented and charismatic man vesey had won a lottery jackpot in 1799 and used his earnings to purchase his freedom and set up a small carpentry shop.
a natural leader he became a prominent member of an african american church that became an important meeting place for free blacks and slaves.
rumors of a slave revolt led authorities to arrest him and charge him with plotting an insurrection the so called denmark vesey uprising said to have been aimed to free slaves in charleston by violence.
modern historians differ over how to interpret the evidence that was used to convict vesey and his alleged followers.
some historians deny that vesey was a revolutionary figure bent on leading an uprising and see him instead as an unfortunate victim a vocal free black leader who became a scapegoat for paranoid charleston whites ever fearful of slave insurrection.
others believe that there was a plot although its scope remains uncertain.
whether the proposed insurrection was real or imagined the evidence gathered to convict vesey provides a window into the way whites perceived slave culture in the charleston region.
according to the trial records urban slaves and free blacks conspired with the many slaves who worked on the plantations surrounding charleston.
the rebels the records suggest were poised to take advantage of the mobility enjoyed by african americans in this region an area in which travel was less restricted than in other parts of the south.
charlestons slaves were often hired out by their masters and often traveled without direct supervision.
the task system employed by carolina plantation owners also provided slaves with considerable autonomy and mobility.
after finishing their days tasks slaves could work their own small plots of land hunt or fish.
slaves not only used this surplus food to supplement their i went up to the capitol and heard mr king in the senate upon what is called the missouri question.
he laid down the position of the natural liberty of man and its incompatibility with slavery in any shape.
he also questioned the constitutional right of the president and senate to make the louisiana treaty.
later we attended an evening party at mr calhouns and heard of nothing but the missouri question and mr kings speeches.

chapter 7 jeffersonian america an expanding empire of liberty 1800 1824 meager rations but also often sold it in charlestons markets.
the ease of travel facilitated communication between slaves and freedmen.
free black churches provided places for african americans both slaves and free blacks to discuss ideas including perhaps revolution.
the prosecution claimed that vesey an active member of charlestons african methodist episcopal church had used the church as a place to recruit others to his cause.
the alleged insurrection was planned for the summer when many whites left the city for cooler climates.
if veseys plan was real and not invented by his prosecutors his conception was a bold one.
after seizing the city arsenal vesey and his followers allegedly planned to burn the city and sail to haiti.
in 1804 saint domingue became the independent country of haiti.
the caribbean islands own revolutionary experience might have inspired vesey who saw the haitian uprising as a model for toppling slavery in america.
when south carolinas governor heard about the plot he ordered out the militia.
the authorities arrested vesey and others alleged to have been engaged in his conspiracy.
the trial record portrays vesey as an articulate man well aware of the recent debates over the missouri compromise including the speeches of antislavery congressmen from new england.
the rise of abolitionist sentiment in the north was a sign that the time for revolution was ripe.
the plot that emerges from the evidence presented at the trial also demonstrates the persistence of african religious and cultural traditions among both free blacks and slaves.
one of veseys chief co conspirators for example a slave named gullah jack had a reputation as a conjurer who would provide veseys followers with magical charms to protect them from harm.
there is also evidence that african american culture had developed its own distinctive approach to christianity.
african christianity highlighted themes taken from the 7 16 list of people executed as listed in published trial record why did white residents of charleston blame northerners for the vesey insurrection.
view the map interactive map missouri compromise 1820 1821 crises and the collapse of the national republican consensus plight of the ancient israelites.
thus vesey was said to have reminded his followers that god had delivered the children of israel out of bondage in egypt and would surely deliver slaves to freedom now.
as this page from the published trial records shows 7 16 charlestons authorities sent 34 blacks including vesey to the gallows.
for the charleston white elite who prosecuted vesey one lesson of the trial was that the indiscreet zeal in favor of universal liberty expressed by many of our fellow citizens in the states north and east of maryland aided by the black population of those states threatened the institution of slavery.
the sectional tensions caused by slavery and the growing animosity between northern abolitionists black and white and southern defenders of slavery would only turn more bitter.
jeffersonian america and the politics of compromise jeffersons election in 1800 ushered in a new era in american politics.
although jefferson did not usher in a revolution he did scale back the size of government.
by shrinking the government jefferson effectively eliminated the threat posed by hamiltons fiscal and military programs but without having to repudiate all the accomplishments of the two previous administrations.
indeed jefferson discovered that he could put a powerful federal government to good republican use.
the purchase of louisiana was difficult to reconcile with jeffersons own theory of strict construction but jefferson put his constitutional scruples aside to make the purchase.
by the time james madison became president leading republicans had adopted much of the hamiltonian economic agenda.
americas difficult experiences during the war of 1812 seemed to underscore the wisdom of many of hamiltons proposals.
the next president james monroe took these lessons to heart his administration sought a nonpartisan synthesis of jeffersonian and hamiltonian values.
the press hailed monroes presidency as an era of good feelings a time in which partisan rancor gave way to consensus and a new wave of nationalism.
this brief respite from partisanship proved short lived however.
within a decade partisan divisions resurfaced and laid the foundation of a new two party system.
if there were conspicuous losers in the jeffersonian era it was american indians and slaves.
the former faced a more powerful and well organized american government eager to expand westward.
the war of 1812 had a disastrous impact on western tribes who lost an important ally britain in their struggles against the united states.
finally the cotton boom and introduction of land well suited to cotton agriculture meant that the institution of slavery became stronger.
the issue of slavery particularly its expansion would play an increasingly important role in american public life.
the missouri compromise demonstrated the potentially divisive nature of the issue of slavery.
for the moment american politics had resolved this crisis but rather than diffuse this problem slavery would remain a potentially explosive issue in american politics.
the cession of that kind of property slaves would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected.
but as it is we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go.

as this scene reveals democracy did not yet embrace all americans it excluded women african americans and indians.
the crowd bingham depicts is overwhelmingly male and apart from a lone african american in the background all white.
although the white men participate in the political life of the nation the lone black figure labors on a wagon selling refreshments to the crowd.
no figure better personified this new age than andrew jackson the countrys leading democrat.
jacksons 1828 election changed american politics forcing his opponents to make more effective use of the tools of democratic politics and the symbols of democracy in their campaigns.
eventually adopting the name whig by 1840 they outdid the democrats portraying their candidate william henry harrison as a simple man born in a log cabin who drank hard cider like an ordinary farmer.
although the whigs may have learned valuable political lessons from the democrats about how to campaign their party steadfastly opposed jacksonian policies on every major issue of the day.
from economic issues to american indian rights the two parties offered the american people competing visions and clear choices.
political participation in this period rose as americans responded to the messages of the two parties and voted in unprecedented numbers.
american society is essentially and radically a democracy.
in the united states the democratic spirit is infused into all national habits and all the customs of society french traveler michael chevalier society manners and politics in the united states 1839 chapter 8 democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 democracy in america between thomas jeffersons election in 1800 and andrew jacksons victory in his presidential bid in 1828 american culture and politics were transformed.
travelers to america during this period consistently remarked about the democratic character of its society.
democracy appeared to suffuse every aspect of culture and politics.
whereas in 1800 most states had some type of property requirement for voting within three decades most of these restrictions had been swept aside.
many of the new western states that entered the union in the intervening years adopted constitutions with no property requirements.
as population shifted westward the nations center of political gravity also shifted.
many of the politicians who dominated the national scene came from western states such as tennessee and kentucky not the older settled regions such as virginia and massachusetts.
democratic culture in 1835 a young french nobleman count alexis de tocqueville published an account of his recent trip to america.
no novelty in the united states struck me more vividly during my stay there he wrote than the equality of conditions.
it was easy to see the immense influence of this basic fact on the whole course of society democracy in america 1835 tocquevilles analysis of the influence of democracy on american life remains one of the most important books ever written about american society.
the young french aristocrat was hardly the only foreign visitor drawn to america.
in the 1820s and 1830s america attracted the interest of many other foreigners who were impressed by the democratic character of american life.
the term democrat which elsewhere would fill even republicans with terror michael chevalier another french visitor noted is here greeted with acclamations frances trollope an english observer was shocked to see americans talking to complete strangers on terms of perfect equality democracy nurtured a more egalitarian culture that astonished europeans.
in colonial america a bow or doffed hat and lowered head were all signs of deference to ones social betters.
many of these customs persisted in europe.
americans however had abandoned most of them by the 1830s preferring to shake hands a far more egalitarian form of greeting.
one english commentator complained that in america he had to go on shaking hands here there and everywhere and with everybody another englishman confessed his astonishment that travel in america meant mixing with men and women of different classes there is but one conveyance it may be said for every class of people the coach railroad or steamboat as well how did the frontier nurture the growth of democracy.
as most of the hotels being open to all the consequence is that the society is very much mixed a significant political consequence of the growth of democracy was the expansion of suffrage to include virtually all white men.
as the maps 8 1 show most of the new western states that entered the union after the war of 1812 adopted democratic constitutions that rejected property qualifications for suffrage.
their constitutions generally embraced this ideal from the beginning.
when older states such as new york revised their constitutions in the 1820s the question of suffrage became one of the most contentious.

davy crockett and the frontier myth tocqueville commented that in the western settlements we may behold democracy arrived at its utmost limits he may well have been thinking of figures like the legendary frontiersman and politician davy crockett 1786 1836 when he made that statement.
no figure in american public life did more to associate the west with democracy than davy crockett.
born in tennessee crockett served under andrew jackson during the creek wars 1813 1814 where he distinguished himself as a soldier.
his home state voters elected him to the tennessee state legislature and to congress where he supported his former commander andrew jackson another symbol of frontier democracy.

by 1828 most states had eliminated such requirements.
a growing audience of readers eager to learn of his daring exploits.
as one contemporary english magazine noted democracy and the far west made crockett he is a product of forests freedom universal suffrage and bear hunts in his own colorful account crockett becomes a politician almost by accident.
when coming to town to sell his pelts and furs he exchanges a few words with local politicians who immediately recognize him as a natural leader and draft him for the state legislature.
crocketts career in congress was brief but his fame grew as literary treatments recounted stories about his exploits.
crocketts almanac for example a cheap magazine like publication vividly described the frontiersman politician whose honesty as a stump speaker and legendary adventures wrestling alligators hunting bears and fighting indians captivated audiences.
for crockett delivering a stump speech meant literally standing on the nearest tree stump as shown in this illustration from the a narrative of the life of david crockett 8 2.
although crockett was a big hit on the stump and celebrated in popular literature the most important political figure to make use of the association of the west with democracy was andrew jackson.
the tennessee born jackson earned a reputation as a fierce indian fighter during the creek wars and distinguished himself as the victor of the battle of new orleans.
he also served as both a united states representative and senator from tennessee.
a supporter of jackson described his political style as typical of the western united states where democratic values and egalitarian ideals flourished in europe custom decreed that kings shall rule and the people submit.
in this wilderness as if by magic a new and different order of things has appeared jacksons effort to link his western origins with his democratic values became a key component of his political message for the rest of his career in public life.

chapter 8 democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 competing visions should white men without property have the vote.
in 1821 new yorkers gathered to revise their states 1777 constitution.
the issue of property requirements for elections proved to be one of the most heated in the convention.
james kent a conservative lawyer and judge who began his career as a federalist defended property requirements.
his vision of politics was deeply hierarchical which led him to oppose an expansion of suffrage.
kent was opposed by a group of younger politicians.
nathan sanford a man who entered politics fully a decade later than kent began his career as a jeffersonian democrat.
jeffersons election to the presidency in 1800 had not ushered in the reign of terror that his federalist enemies predicted and sanford embraced the growing enthusiasm for democracy that marked politics in the early nineteenth century.
which man has a more optimistic view of human nature.
which theory of politics seems closer in spirit to the ideas behind the federal constitution.
the most eloquent champion of retaining property requirements was james kent a former state supreme court judge and chancellor of the state of new york an english style judicial office that no longer exists.
kent warned that an unchecked democracy in which the property less and working classes enjoyed the same power as the propertied would threaten political stability and the rights of private property.
the tendency of universal suffrage is to jeopardize the rights of property and the principles of liberty.
there is a constant tendency in human society and the history of every age proves it there is a tendency in the poor to covet and to share the plunder of the rich in the debtor to relax or avoid the obligation of contract there is a tendency in ambitious and wicked men to inflame these combustible materials.
the notion that every man that works a day on the road or serves an idle hour in the militia is entitled as of right to an equal participation in the whole power of government is most unreasonable and has no foundation in justice.
society is an association for the protection of property as well as life and the individual who contributes only one cent to the common stock ought not to have the same power and influence in directing the property and concerns of the partnership as he who contributes his thousands.
nathan sanford was a lawyer from long island who entered politics as a jeffersonian holding various state offices before being elected as a u s senator from new york.
rather than focus on the need to protect property sanford argued that those who bore the burdens of government had earned a right to have a say in it.
the question before us is the right of suffrage who shall or who shall not have the right to vote the principle of the scheme now proposed is that those who bear the burthens of the state paid taxes served in the militia or consented to volunteer to work on public works projects such as roads should choose those that rule it.
to me and the majority of the committee it appeared the only reasonable scheme that those who are to be affected by the acts of the government should be annually entitled to vote for those who administer it.
fourth of july in center square by john lewis krimmel 1819 why did james kent oppose eliminating property requirements.
andrew jackson and his age andrew jackson and his age the new democratic spirit of american politics helped elevate andrew jacksons political career and he in turn did everything in his power to promote his vision of democracy.
jacksons democratic ideas stopped well short of the most radical egalitarian ideas of his day.
indeed jacksons vision of democracy had no room for blacks indians or women.
still his invocation of the will of the people marked a turning point in american political development.
after jackson politicians from across the political spectrum would outdo each other in affirming their commitment to democracy and praising the wisdom of the people.
jacksons long road to the presidency began with his narrow defeat in 1824 which led to his decisive victory in 1828.
unlike earlier presidents who were drawn from the nations elite jackson was a self made man.
an orphan who became a rich planter and influential political figure in his home state of tennessee jackson became a symbol for american democracy.
indeed one of his supporters characterized the presidential election of 1828 in which jackson squared off against john quincy adams for the second time as a struggle in which the aristocracy and democracy of the country are arrayed against each other others viewed jacksons democratic leanings in a less positive light however seeing his election as the start of the reign of king mob jacksons presidency was marred by deep divisions within his own administration and challenges from outside.
in particular south carolinas decision to respond to federal tariff policy by calling a convention to nullify federal law forced a showdown between jackson and a new radical version of the theory of states rights.
the election of 1824 and the corrupt bargain james monroe the fourth virginian to occupy the presidency since the adoption of the constitution 1817 1825 anointed no political figure to be his successor and carry forward his policies and ideas.
following washingtons model monroe had sought out a talented but diverse collection of men for his cabinet who represented a broad spectrum of political and economic views.
three of these cabinet ministers sought the presidency in 1824 william crawford secretary of the treasury john quincy adams secretary of state and john c calhoun secretary of war.
a fourth candidate was henry clay speaker of the house of representatives.
andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans also joined the race.
jackson had served in congress as a judge in tennessee and as the appointed governor of the florida territory.
crawford born in virginia but raised in georgia was heir to the old jeffersonian republican vision of politics with its emphasis on states rights and strict construction of the constitution.
crawford opposed monroes national republican synthesis view the image 1824 election cartoon of jeffersonian politics with hamiltonian economics see chapter 7.
in contrast to the other candidates in the crowded field crawford opposed using federal power for economic development.
public expenditures for internal improvements such as roads and canals and charters for banks were government functions that the constitution crawford argued had wisely left to the individual states.
john quincy adams the son of president john adams was a new englander who had been a professor at harvard and spent considerable time in europe as a diplomat serving in holland prussia part of modern germany great britain and russia.
as secretary of state he had not only negotiated the treaty of ghent that ended the war of 1812 but also was largely responsible for formulating the monroe doctrine see chapter 7.
a short balding intellectual figure adams was neither charismatic nor politically astute he even admitted that he could seem dogmatic and pedantic.
before entering the race for president his primary experience had been in foreign not domestic politics.
john c calhoun the other southerner in the race had been a prominent war hawk during the war of 1812.
an astute politician calhoun what were the strengths of john quincy adams as a presidential candidate.
chapter 8 8 3 our country home industry this election broadside links john quincy adams with clays american system.
the images at the top the loom ship and plough symbolize the way the american system would help manufacturing commerce and agriculture.
democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 decided to withdraw from the crowded race and soon emerged as the strongest candidate for vicepresident.
calhoun expected to bide his time until the moment was more auspicious to mount another try for the presidency.
henry clay the vivacious speaker of the house from kentucky began his career as a war hawk during the war of 1812.
on economic issues clay had the most clearly developed vision of americas future.
clay built on monroes neohamiltonian policies pushing them in a more nationalistic direction.
as a matter of policy monroe favored federal support for internal improvements such as roads and canals but he maintained some of the same constitutional reservations about such policies that his predecessors jefferson and madison had articulated.
clay was an unapologetic champion of aggressive federal involvement in economic development.
the american system clays plan for using the power of the federal government to encourage american industry included tariffs to what role did clays american system play in the election of john qunicy adams.
help protect american industry by keeping cheap foreign goods from undermining american producers continuing support for a national bank and an ambitious program of federal funding for internal improvements.
clays theory sought a harmonious interplay among agriculture industry and commerce.
adams endorsed the essence of clays american system.
this election broadside 8 3 reflects his support for clays economic policies.
the central image of a ship symbolizes commerce while the two smaller figures depict a farmer at the plow and a worker at a loom.
the name of the ship john quincy adams symbolizes adamss claim to be a proven leader who could pilot the nation to a prosperous future.
of the major candidates for the presidency in 1824 andrew jacksons agenda was the least defined.
clay and adams sought to portray jackson as an opponent of the american system and jackson tried to finesse the issue by stressing that he wished to support commerce agriculture and industry.
his campaign focused less on issues and more on character and underlying political values.
jackson fashioned himself as a frontier democrat whose honesty and courage were his primary credentials for the presidency.
in the divided field jackson won 44 percent of the popular vote and the most electoral votes but he fell short of the majority in the electoral college necessary to win the election 8 4.
under such circumstances the constitution directed that the house of representatives choose from among the top five candidates.
clay had only come in fourth but as speaker of the house he was a key player in determining the outcome.
given the choice among crawford an old style jeffersonian who opposed clays vision for americas future jackson whose support for a more nationalist economic program was lukewarm at best and adams who was sympathetic to clays american system the choice was easy for clay.
with clays support adams won.
having secured the presidency adams then chose clay to be his secretary of state which in this era functioned as the stepping stone for aspiring future presidential candidates.
since world war ii the vice presidency has sometimes served the same function.
jackson and his supporters charged that clay had traded his support for the office of secretary of state in a corrupt bargain that deprived read the document michel chevalier society manners and politics in the u s andrew jackson and his age adams appointed men on the basis of merit with little concern for their political loyalties or even their commitment to his agenda or 8 4 to him personally.
adams proudly proclaimed his intention to discard every element of rancor and yield to talents and virtue one exasperated supporter complained that the friends of the administration have to contend not only against their enemies but against the administration itself which leaves its power in the hands of its own enemies adams sought to move beyond partisanship at a time when america was becoming more politically polarized.
electoral vote by state electoral vote popular vote adams made another tactical error 84 32 108 740 31 john quincy adams when he chastised congress for refusing democratic republican to embrace his economic agenda.
he ac153 544 44 99 38 andrew jackson cused legislators of being hampered by democratic republican the will of their constituents seen in william h crawford 41 16 40 856 12 light of his republican belief in the need democratic republican for virtuous leadership adams was invithenry clay 37 14 47 531 14 ing congress to lead rather than follow democratic republican the nation.
for his opponents however states that split the remark smacked of condescension and elitelectoral votes ism.
his comments were out of step with the rising tide of democratic sentiment that had swept over 8 4 electoral and popular votes 1824 american society.
for those who supported this although jackson won the most votes no candidate new more democratic ethos adams had maligned gained a majority in the electoral college.
after the house of representatives decided the outcome jackson claimed that the people.
jackson and his supporters used adadams and clay had struck a corrupt bargain to deprive him amss gaffe to highlight their own commitment to of the presidency.
jackson extolled the voice of the people and attacked adams for his apparent haughty contempt for the popular will.
jackson of the presidency and gave the election to adams.
adams embraced clays american system.
in addition to supporting clays plan for public expenditures on internal improvements including new roads and canals adams hoped to create a nathe election of 1828 which saw andrew jackson tional university and an astronomical observatory.
squaring off with john quincy adams for a secyet while he embraced the forward looking nationond try at the presidency was a pivotal moment in alist vision of economic development associated american politics.
jackson trumpeted his humble with clays american system adams was an eighorigins military career and support for democratic teenth century politician when it came to thinking values.
his supporters applauded their candidates about the role of the president as a virtuous leader commitment to democracy and lambasted adamss who stood above partisan bickering.
he believed aristocratic pretensions.
adamss supporters dethat monroes goal of rising above party was not fended his traditional republican ideals and support only laudable but achievable.
rather than use his for the american system and warned voters that patronage powers as president to reward his political jackson was a demagogue who would undermine friends and consolidate his administrations power americas constitutional system.
the election of 1828 old hickorys triumph why did jackson view the election of 1824 as a corrupt bargain.
chapter 8 8 5 some account of the bloody deeds of general jackson this pro adams broadside dubbed the coffin handbill features the images of coffins prominently.
it casts jackson as a brutal despot whose military record demonstrated that he was unfit to be president.
the coffins symbolized militiamen jackson executed for desertion during the creek wars 1813 1814.
democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 at a more fundamental level jackson rejected the antiparty sentiments of monroe and adams.
jackson set out to win the presidency in 1828 forming an alliance with crawford and calhoun to defeat adams and clay.
new yorks martin van buren formulated the strategy for this new alliance.
van buren was an influential republican who had served both as a state senator and a u s senator.
his supporters were nicknamed bucktails because they wore deer tails on their hats instead of feathers.
van buren embraced the idea of party with a passion.
his goal was to re create the old jeffersonian coalition which united the planters of the south and the plain republicans of the north how did the coffin handbill attempt to discredit andrew jackson.
jackson felt personally aggrieved by the result of the election of 1824.
charges that adams had stolen that election colored the rhetoric of the 1828 campaign which marked a new low in the use of personal attacks and negative campaigning.
jacksons campaign portrayed adams as an aristocrat of dubious morality pointing out that adams had installed a billiard table in the white house.
although now considered a popular recreation originally billiards was an aristocratic pastime.
perhaps the most sensational claim the jackson campaign made was that during adamss time as a diplomat in russia he had made use of a beautiful girl to seduce the passions of the emperor the jacksonians charged that adams was a licentious aristocrat with perverse sexual values.
the attack on adamss character was more than matched by the ferocious assaults on jacksons morality.
the smear campaign also charged jackson with sexual immorality challenging the legality of his marriage.
supporters of adams claimed that jackson had seduced a married woman and lived with her in open and notorious lewdness before she had divorced her first husband.
jackson they claimed was a violent brawling frontiersman who could not be trusted with the nations highest office.
the adams campaign even attacked jacksons military record.
philadelphia printer john binns coffin handbill 8 5 detailed the bloody deeds of general jackson who had in fact executed six militiamen during the wars against the creek indians.
binn warned americans against putting at the head of our government a man who was never known to govern himself in jacksons defense his supporters cast the general as old hickory a rough and tumble democrat and latter day george washington whose plain frontier code of ethics contrasted with adamss elitist eastern values.
to call attention to jacksons reputation as the hero of the battle of new orleans his supporters gathered on the anniversary of the victory to plant hickory trees and raise liberty poles made of hickory wood.
they ridiculed adamss bookish temperament chanting adams can write but jackson can fight adamss supporters answered the smears by praising his long and varied public services his great experience his talent his learning to get out their message jacksons supporters developed a sophisticated campaign apparatus.
a central committee in nashville directed local and state jackson committees who in turn worked with andrew jackson and his age local hickory clubs in addition to these innovations in campaign organization jacksons supporters created a network of pro jackson newspapers to get out the word about their candidate.
eighteen new pro jackson newspapers sprouted up in ohio alone.
the jacksonians also pioneered new fundraising tactics to pay for their campaign including public banquets and other ticketed events in which supporters celebrated the achievements of their candidate.
they developed an astonishing range of campaign knick knacks and mementos including badges plates sewing boxes and ceramics.
jacksonians also used rallies and parades to spark enthusiasm for their candidate.
the tactics of jackson and his supporters galvanized the electorate.
in 1824 only about one fourth of the eligible voters had participated in 1828 more than half of the electorate turned out to vote.
in the end jackson garnered more than twice as many electoral votes as adams.
the reign of king mob andrew jacksons inaugural in 1829 captured the new democratic spirit of the age.
his supporters poured into washington for the event shown in this contemporary print of the crowds who thronged the white house 8 6.
margaret bayard smith a washington socialite described the scene in detail thousands and thousands of people without distinction of rank collected in an immense mass around the capitol she was shocked not only by the composition of the crowd but also by its rowdiness.
the boisterous attendees she recounted broke glass and bone china to the amount of several thousand dollars smith was clearly ambivalent about the inauguration of the peoples president she was impressed by the majesty of the people assembled at the swearing in ceremony but disturbed by the rude and disorderly behavior of jacksons supporters at the reception that followed at the white house.
this print of the inaugural confirms smiths impressions that jacksons inaugural was a popular affair drawing a much more diverse crowd than previous inaugurals.
not everyone was as impressed by the peoples majesty.
supreme court justice joseph story complained that jacksons inaugural had ushered in the the reign of king mob in contrast to adams who refused to use his powers of appointment to reward his political supporters jackson was unabashed in appointing his supporters to office.
in his first inaugural jackson defended the need for rotation in government offices.
jackson rejected the traditional republican notion advanced by john quincy adams that government offices were best reserved for a small elite typically drawn from the ranks of the wealthy and well educated.
the duties of all public officers jackson maintained were plain and simple one jackson supporter proudly proclaimed that he saw nothing wrong in the rule that to the victor belong the spoils of the enemy opponents mocked jacksons appointments as men of narrow minds who were hardly gentlemen and attacked jacksons system of replacing government officeholders with those loyal to him as the spoils system.
8 6 presidents levee or all creation going to the white house this image of the boisterous crowd in front of the white house during jacksons inaugural reception or levee captures the fear that his presidency would usher in the reign of king mob read the document john adams a corrupt bargain or politics as usual how did the spoils system promote jacksons democratic agenda.

this cartoon 8 7 shows jackson dangling the spoils of victory before eager office seekers.
jacksons practices however were less radical than his rhetoric.
only 20 percent of federal officeholders lost their jobs because of his new policy.
apart from his appointment of martin van buren as secretary of state jacksons cabinet comprised undistinguished men selected for their loyalty to him.
shortly after jackson had assembled his cabinet a sexual scandal engulfed his administration.
the controversy swirled around his new secretary of war john eaton a close friend of the president.
washington society prone to gossip began spreading rumors that eatons wife peggy the daughter of a washington tavern keeper was a promiscuous woman who had engaged in a clandestine affair with eaton before their marriage.
that peggys first husband had allegedly committed suicide further besmirched her reputation.
still angry over the attacks on the legitimacy of his own marriage his wife died before jackson took office the president defended peggy eatons reputation and ordered his cabinet members to do likewise.
the eaton scandal which some contemporaries described as eaton malaria consumed jacksons presidency for months preventing him what was the theory of states rights.
from focusing on pressing public matters.
because floride calhoun the wife of the vice president had been one of the most prominent women to snub peggy eaton the eaton affair also strained the already tense relations between jackson and vice president john c calhoun.
the disruption forced the president to ask most of his cabinet to resign in 1831.
states rights and the nullification crisis even if jackson and calhoun had not fallen out over the eaton affair the two men were on a collision course.
the rift between them widened as the politics of states rights divided the nation.
calhouns home state of south carolina became a hotbed of radical states rights doctrine and calhoun had to embrace the doctrine or retire from public life.
choosing to take up the cause calhoun became one of its leading spokesmen.
the issue that vexed south carolina was federal tariffs on imported goods.
in 1828 congress enacted high import duties on a variety of goods including textiles.
the south objected to the tariff believing that britain would retaliate by raising tariffs on imported cotton which would hurt southern read the document south carolina refuses the tariff andrew jackson and his age agriculture.
the objections of the south carolina legislature were outlined in a protest and the underlying political and constitutional theory was elaborately described anonymously by calhoun in his manifesto the exposition.
calhoun took the theory of states rights to a new level defending south carolinas right to nullify or make legally void the 1828 tariff.
his manifesto developed ideas first articulated by jefferson and madison in the virginia and kentucky resolutions into a radical theory of states rights see chapter 6.
according to calhoun the union was a sovereign compact among the people of the states.
when the states and the national government disagreed over the constitutionality of a federal law he asserted the states were entitled to judge the constitutionality of federal laws.
this position challenged both the supremacy of the federal government and the power of the federal courts to be the final arbiter on the constitutionality of federal laws.
asserting that a state could call special conventions to nullify federal laws calhouns doctrine of nullification went further than either jefferson or madisons earlier defenses of states rights.
the issue of states rights resurfaced in 1830 when congress debated a proposal to limit sales of western lands.
samuel foot a senator from connecticut proposed to slow western expansion by cutting back on the public sale of western lands a decision that would have also robbed the government of revenues and made it even more dependent on tariffs.
prompting foots resolution was a report from the land office that 72 million acres of land already surveyed remained unsold.
senators thomas hart benton of missouri and robert hayne of south carolina denounced foots resolution.
benton and hayne saw an opportunity to forge a southern and western alliance against new englands commercial interests.
benton saw foots proposal as a means for new englands industrialists to maintain their supply of cheap labor by making it harder for laborers to settle on western lands.
hayne took a different tactic framing the issue in terms of south carolinas theory of states rights he moved beyond the specifics of foots proposal to suggest that federal control over western lands was itself a source of danger since it encouraged the growth of federal power.
senator daniel webster of massachusetts attacked the south carolinians theory of states rights.
the ensuing debate between hayne and webster was a brilliant display of oratory.
one observer every seat every inch of ground even the steps were compactly filled and yet not space enough for the ladies the senators were obliged to relinquish their chairs of the state to the fair auditors who literally sat in the senate margaret smiths recollections of the senate chamber during websters reply to hayne recalled it was a day never to be forgotten by those who witnessed the scene in the senate chamber and a day destined to be forever memorable in the annals of the senate in a riveting speech webster denounced the theory of states rights and asserted the supremacy of the union over the individual states liberty and union now and forever one and inseparable building on ideas developed by hamilton and john marshall see chapters 6 and 7 websters constitutional nationalism denied that the states could judge the constitutionality of federal laws and rejected the theory of nullification.
websters speech was widely reprinted and became an instant classic schoolchildren would recite it throughout the northeast for generations.
this meticulous historical painting by george healy 8 8 immortalized the debate.
webster 8 8 websters reply to hayne george healys painting of websters famous speech is reminiscent of binghams stump speaking.
calhoun is presented as a wiry character while webster stands tall a model of virtue.
how did websters theory of the union contrast with calhouns theory of states rights.
chapter 8 8 9 despotism in this anti nullification cartoon calhoun ascends a platform that leads from nullification to despotism.
democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 pausing for a moments reflection stands in a hushed senate chamber.
onlookers crowd the galleries transfixed by his oratory.
although senators had given up their seats in the chamber to accommodate the many women who attended to hear the speech healey placed all the women in the senate gallery a decision likely motivated by his belief that viewers would have been shocked to see women on the floor of the senate.
with the webster hayne debate fresh in everyones memory supporters of states rights gathered in washington to honor the memory of thomas jefferson.
hayne and calhoun both attended this dinner as did president jackson.
when hayne concluded a long defense of states rights attention turned to jackson who was expected to propose a toast to haynes pro states rights sentiments.
having always been a moderate supporter of states rights jackson would surely support hayne the crowd thought.
they were shocked however when he lifted his glass and proclaimed our federal union.
it must be preserved rather than support hayne the president appeared to echo webster.
vice president calhoun who had become an outspoken defender of states rights responded with his own toast the union next to our liberties the most dear realizing that he could not effectively defend south carolina and promulgate the cause of states rights from the vice presidency calhoun how does the political cartoonist represent calhouns nullification theory in the cartoon despotism.
south carolina promptly elected him to the senate.
the issue of states rights and nullification moved to the center of american political life as the controversy over tariffs heated up again.
congress intended the tariff act of 1832 which president jackson signed to be a conciliatory gesture to south carolina.
although the new act lowered import duties south carolinians continued to view tariffs as an effort by one section of the nation to wage economic war against another.
south carolina called a convention and issued a declaration nullifying the tariff.
jackson denounced these actions as subversive of the constitution privately he warned that if south carolina spilled a drop of blood in defiance of the laws of the united states he would hang the first man of them i can get my hands on to the first tree i can find missouri senator thomas hart benton warned that when president jackson begins to talk about hanging they can begin to look out for ropes this contemporary cartoon attacking nullification 8 9 highlights jacksons tough stance.
the president restraining one of calhouns supporters declares stop you have gone too far.
or by the eternal i will hang you all congress passed a force bill that gave the president the power to use military force to collect revenues including tariffs.
while jackson was adopting a public tough stance henry clay was working behind the scenes to avert a confrontation.
on the same day that congress passed the force bill it also scaled back tariffs.
in response to this conciliatory gesture south carolina rescinded its act of nullification but not before nullifying the force act.
clays compromise had narrowly averted a constitutional crisis in which the states and the federal government had nearly come to blows.
for the moment the conflict between states rights and a more nationalist vision of the constitution had been settled in favor of the latter.
although jackson adopted a hard line with south carolina he would prove to be far more flexible when federal and state power collided over other issues notably indian rights.
jacksons democratic nationalism had little room for anyone but white men.
its narrowness would become increasingly clear during his two terms as president.
read the document andrew jackson the force bill white mans democracy white mans democracy the democratic ideas that swept andrew jackson into the presidency were premised on a vision of society that was not truly inclusive it excluded blacks and indians and showed little interest in womens rights.
the new state constitutions drafted in the jacksonian era expanded rights for nonproperty owning white men but stripped voting rights from propertyowning african americans.
the plight of american indians also became a major issue during jacksons presidency.
jackson and his supporters sought to restrict indians rights and expropriate their lands.
although the revised state constitutions systematically stripped away rights from free blacks african americans created a network of thriving communities in the free states of the north and the old northwest the modern states of ohio indiana michigan and illinois.
however harassment of african americans in the nations cities also increased during the jacksonian era.
indeed the struggles of african americans to achieve economic and social respectability prompted vicious attacks in the popular press and might even lead to violence.
pressure to find more land for white settlers also intensified which increased tensions with american indians who were eager to defend their lands against further encroachments.
jackson and his supporters showed little regard for the rights of indian peoples.
the cherokee fought a valiant effort to defend their rights within the rules established by the constitution and learned that the rule of law provided scant protection against racism and a rapacious desire for indian land.
race and politics in the jacksonian era while many states were expanding the suffrage for white men other states were imposing new restrictions on black men.
the 1821 new york state constitutional convention that had abolished property requirements for white men adopted a high property requirement for african americans that effectively disenfranchised most blacks.
thus while the states african american population numbered some 30 000 in 1825 fewer than 300 black men were eligible to vote.
new yorks actions were part of a broader pattern of racial exclusion that limited the rights of african americans throughout the north and west.
african americans lost the right to vote in rhode island in 1822 and pennsylvania in 1838.
most of the new states that entered the union after 1819 denied suffrage to african americans.
many states also regulated the conduct of free african americans.
in 1831 indiana required that negroes and mulattoes emigrating in the state be required to post a bond much like prisoners awaiting trial or be deported.
illinois not only barred blacks from voting but prohibited them from testifying in court or bringing civil suits.
ohio barred african americans from access to the courts in any controversy where either party to the sale is a white person and declared that african americans have no constitutional right to present their petitions to the general assembly for any purpose whatsoever gradual emancipation schemes increased the number of free blacks in the north and west.
in part the intensification of racism reflected concern over economic competition from the growing number of free blacks.
yet despite the legal barriers placed in the way of african americans economic progress vibrant communities grew in the north.
the most obvious measure of the success of these communities was the rise of a rich array of african american cultural and economic institutions including churches fraternal organizations and benefit societies.
african americans published their first newspaper freedoms journal in new york in 1827.
the efforts of free blacks in the north and west to improve their conditions became a subject of widespread comment in the press.
typically the press lampooned the efforts of african americans to attain cultural and economic respectability.

as was typical in this era the artist has exaggerated the physical appearances of african americans and caricatured their speech suggesting that blacks could only speak a distorted form of english.
jacksons vision of white mans democracy had tragic consequences for american indians.
his dealings with indian peoples during his presidency were also consistent with his view that they were culturally inferior to whites and that their civilization was on the path toward extinction.
in jacksons political calculus white settlers need for land was paramount and the rights of indians carried little if any weight.
these beliefs shaped his response to the conflict between the state of georgia and the cherokees.
the presidents views of indians had been formed during his early military career in which he was well known as an indian fighter.
at the conclusion of the creek wars 1812 1813 he had seized 23 million acres of creek land more than half of present day alabama and part of georgia.
jackson treated the indians as conquered subjects not as a sovereign people.
rather than continuing to mount violent resistance a number of indian tribes adopted american ways.
the cherokee were among the indian peoples who white americans described as the five civilized tribes cherokees choctaws seminoles creeks and chickasaws.
these five tribes had to varying degrees chosen the path of cultural assimilation rather than resistance to americas expansionist policies.
these tribes together numbered some 75 000 people spread out over the carolinas georgia alabama mississippi and tennessee.
adopting the agricultural practices of their white neighbors and converting to christianity were two major efforts the tribes made to accommodate to american culture.
no tribe was more committed to accommodation than the cherokee.
they converted to christianity established schools and practiced american style agriculture a few prosperous cherokees even kept slaves to work on their cotton plantations mimicking their white neighbors in georgia.
they also abandoned their traditional tribal governance declared themselves an independent republic and adopted a constitution modeled on the federal constitution.
as a sovereign nation they claimed to enjoy all the legal privileges that all nations enjoyed and were therefore not subject to the laws of the state of georgia.
however the cherokee effort to become an independent nation within the territorial confines of georgia did not sit well with the government of the state.
when georgians discovered gold on cherokee land in 1828 a horde of white prospectors tried to stake out claims on indian lands a clear violation of tribal authority and law.
declaring tribal law null and void georgia passed a law that stripped the tribe of any legal authority over their lands.
henceforth georgia law not cherokee law would govern the cherokee.
the state also created a special police force the georgia guard to patrol indian territory.
the tribe lobbied sympathetic opponents of jackson and turned to the federal courts for protection arguing that georgias actions violated treaties between the cherokee and the united states.
while the cherokee awaited their day in court jackson turned up the pressure on them.
the president refused the cherokees plea for federal troops to protect them.
because indians could not testify in georgia courts the cherokee were left without any legal means of defending their rights under the laws of georgia.
jackson seized the opportunity provided by the crisis to advance a plan to remove the cherokee from georgia and relocate them beyond the mississippi river.
he cast himself as benevolent father intervening to rescue the cherokee from extinction.
his program would not force indians to leave but it made it very unattractive for anyone to remain what does indian policy reveal about the limits of jacksonian democracy.
white mans democracy behind.
indians who refused to relocate were relegated to the status of free blacks who had only minimal legal rights under georgia law.
jackson presented the cherokee with two equally disastrous choices accept the legal destruction of their tribal identity and live as second class citizens in georgia or relocate to a distant territory far from their ancestral homes.
jacksons opponents in congress many of whom had close ties to protestant churches and missionary societies that had helped convert the cherokees to christianity attacked his proposals.
new jerseys senator theodore frelinghuysen wondered if it is one of the prerogatives of the white man that he may disregard the dictates of moral principles when an indian shall be concerned others attacked the presidents proposal as a sham that offered indians no legal protections if they stayed and allocated few resources to allow them to make a safe journey west.
in this cartoon critical of jacksons indian policy 8 11 the president leads a parade that includes the devil and caged indians.
the protestant clergymen who led the opposition to jacksons policy and who opposed removal were not great champions of indian culture.
indeed the religious defense of indian rights shared many of the racist assumptions about indians and their cultures that jackson and others eager to dispossess them espoused.
yet these supporters of indians rights believed that the supposed inferiority of indian culture did not sanction unjust treatment or the violation of indian rights.
womens reformers also rallied to the cause of indian rights.
womens groups touted themselves as disinterested guardians of public morality who were not subject to the blinding influence of party spirit jacksons aggressive removal policy threatened the ongoing effort to christianize and civilize the indians.
building on a tradition that extended back to the revolutionary era see chapters 4 and 5 women invoked their moral authority as the guardians of the republics values and opposed jacksons policies as an affront to church school and the family.
such appeals were so effective that martin van buren jacksons chief lieutenant was shocked that his own niece opposed jacksons policy and hoped that the president would lose his bid for reelection in 1832.
the jacksonians passed their removal bill by a narrow margin.
the indian removal act of 1830 gave president jackson the authority to exchange indians lands within the borders of the existing states for land west of the mississippi.
federal officials put substantial pressure on indian tribes to accept this offer and stressed that the federal government would not be able to protect indian rights against state action if indians did not agree to relocate.
in essence the federal government view the map interactive map native american removal 8 11 the grand national caravan moving east in this attack on jacksons indian policy the president leads a parade that includes the devil playing a fiddle and caged indians.
how does the grand caravan represent jacksons indian policy.
chapter 8 democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 we wish to remain on the land of our fathers.
we have a perfect and original right to remain without interruption or molestation address of a council of the cherokee nation to the people of the united states written in july of 1830 informed indians that if they chose to remain the government would tacitly allow the states to run roughshod over indian rights.
although some tribes reluctantly accepted the inevitability of relocation others resisted.
the cherokee eloquently protested against their forced relocation.
their leaders stated their desire to remain on the land of their ancestors and reminded americans that their existing treaties with the united states guaranteed them this right.
rather than concede to the unfavorable terms presented by the federal government or accede to the pressure from state governments the cherokee decided to seek a legal remedy in federal court.
when georgia violated cherokee rights the tribe sued and the case ended up in the supreme court.
the cherokee cases the struggle between georgia and the cherokee raised important constitutional questions.
the cherokee claimed to be a sovereign nation not subject to the laws of the state of georgia.
as was true of any sovereign nation they claimed the right to govern themselves by rules that their own legislature enacted and to deal with the united states as a sovereign power.
georgia argued that indians were subjects of the united states and that the idea of an independent indian state within georgia was an absurdity.
the status of indian nations in american constitutional law came before the supreme court in two separate cases related to the claims of the cherokee nation.
in the cherokee cases cherokee nation v georgia 1830 and worcester v georgia 1832 the supreme court determined that indian tribes retained certain rights traditionally associated with sovereign nations including the right to govern themselves by their own laws but lacked other rights such as the ability to sue the state of georgia.
the latter case came to the supreme what do the cherokee cases reveal about the limits of judicial power.
court because georgia had imprisoned two protestant missionaries samuel worcester and elizur butler charging them with residing on indian land without obtaining a license from the state.
as both men were citizens of the united states clearly they were entitled to sue in federal courts.
writing for the court chief justice john marshall found that the missionaries had been wrongly imprisoned and were entitled to protection by the federal courts.
moreover marshall gave the cherokee an important victory when he held that the laws of georgia can have no force on cherokee territory.
although the cherokee did not enjoy all the privileges accorded foreign nations by u s law they did retain the right to make laws within their own lands.
one cherokee leader elias boudinot greeted marshalls ruling in worcester enthusiastically.
andrew jackson was dismissive and wrote a supporter that the decision was unenforceable.
georgia refused to accept the courts ruling and did not release the imprisoned missionaries.
president jackson was unwilling to antagonize georgia and was ill disposed to indians rights so he refused to enforce marshalls decision.
the case might have precipitated a major constitutional crisis a president refusing to follow a court decision would have undermined the legitimacy of the entire federal judiciary.
to avoid such a showdown jackson persuaded the governor of georgia to simply pardon worcester and butler.
once the men were freed the legal issue vanished and jackson and marshall were no longer pitted against one another.
resistance and removal the release of the two missionaries eliminated any legal issues and cleared the way for the jackson administration to pursue its policy of removal.
the cherokee now faced the painful choice of accepting the inevitability of removal or continuing to resist jackson and the state of georgia.
see choices and consequences acquiesce or resist.
the cherokee dilemma.
in 1835 a minority of the cherokee leadership signed a treaty agreeing to relocate west of the mississippi.
many cherokee denounced the treaty and hoped that their leaders could avert relocation.
in 1838 federal troops began rounding up cherokee and placing them in stockades to await deportation.
the squalid conditions in the stockades took a heavy toll and many of the most outspoken cherokee white mans democracy choices and consequences acquiesce or resist.
the cherokee dilemma should the cherokee have resisted jacksons removal policy.
the cherokee nation faced a difficult decision regarding how to deal with the increasing pressure to abandon their land and relocate to what is now oklahoma.
the tribal leadership was divided.
most cherokee supported principal chief john ross who believed that there was enough support among jacksons political opponents to block relocation.
a minority within the tribe supported elias boudinot who argued that it was better to relocate than oppose the inevitable.
choices agree to the treaty and relocate seek the best possible terms from the u s government to facilitate the removal process.
reject the treaty and resist removal by force if necessary.
decision a small but vocal minority of the cherokee including elias boudinot believed that continued residence in georgia would only result in further harassment.
they reasoned that it would be more prudent to try to obtain the best deal from the united states and relocate west.
however most cherokee supported john ross who believed that it was still possible to rally support among boycott the vote on the treaty and continue to rally support and lobby congress to protect indian rights against georgia.
religious groups and other whites sympathetic to indian rights.
ross also recognized that senators daniel webster and henry clay two of the most powerful figures in the senate opposed jackson and were eager to use the plight of indians to attack him.
most cherokees refused to participate in the referendum held on the treaty.
supporters of the treaty accepting relocation won but the treaty was not widely accepted by most cherokee who had boycotted the vote.
consequences bolstered by popular opposition to the treaty among the cherokee john ross lobbied the senate hard to reject it and came within one vote of defeating it.
having won a narrow victory jackson signed the treaty and the cherokee were given two years to leave their homes or face military deportation.
after relocation prominent indian supporters of the treaty including elias boudinot were assassinated.
continuing controversies john ross elias boudinot was it realistic for the cherokees to think that they might win support for their cause.
most scholars agree that jacksons indian policy was racist and unethical particularly the violation of existing treaties.
there is however disagreement over how to make sense of the cherokee response to the dilemma jacksons policy created.
supporters of john ross note that he was a savvy politician whose calculation that opposition to jackson and sympathy for the plight of indians made continued resistance a reasonable strategy.
opponents of ross argue that boudinot and others who voted in favor of the treaty were more realistic in their assessment of the political situation.
was resistance to removal a viable strategy for the cherokee.

opponents of removal recognized that further resistance was futile.
indian leaders who had continued to protest were joined by a broad coalition that included clergymen women reformers and constitutional nationalists such as henry clay and daniel webster who were horrified at jacksons behavior toward the cherokee.
the two men were particularly outraged by jacksons disregard for treaty obligations and his disrespect for the authority of the federal courts.
opposition to indian removal provided a rallying point for a diverse collection what was the trail of tears of opponents who believed jackson had become a tyrant who showed little regard for justice or the rule of law.
during the long and arduous march westward to what is now oklahoma 8 12 thousands of cherokee men women and children died.
harsh weather a shortage of supplies and poor sanitation contributed to a staggering death toll.
estimates vary but as many as 4 000 of the 12 000 cherokee who were relocated perished in the trip.
for the cherokee and their descendants the move west became known as the path where they cried or the trail of tears read the document the cherokee treaty of 1817 democrats whigs and the second party system democrats whigs and the second party system unlike previous partisan movements jacksons democratic party operated as an efficient and nationally integrated political organization.
the new party organization called for a new party name.
in the election of 1828 jacksons supporters had described themselves as democratic republicans whereas adamss supporters opted for the name national republicans.
these two labels testify to the transitional nature of the election.
both names harked back to political labels that were associated with the partisan struggles of jeffersons and monroes administrations.
by the election of 1832 jackson supporters were simply calling themselves democrats.
by contrast jacksons opposition was still defining itself.
a third political party the antimasonic party organized in response to the undue influence of the masonic order a fraternal organization whose members included many of the nations most prominent politicians capturing the imagination of voters briefly but then disbanded.
during jacksons second term a new political party the whigs rose out of the ashes of the old national republicans stressing the need for a talented virtuous elite to shape the nations future.
evoking the name of the seventeenth century english opponents of absolute monarchy and the patriot leaders who had opposed george iii during the american revolution the whigs saw themselves as defenders of the constitution against executive despotism.
opposition to jacksons indian policy provided a common issue around which many disaffected groups had rallied early in jacksons presidency.
economic policy as defined by clays american system which included support for the national bank and a general opposition to the new vision of executive power personified by jackson particularly his bank veto helped define the core issues of the new whig party.
once voters aligned with one of the two main parties they tended to remain loyal to it during their lifetimes.
this intensified the divisions between the two new parties.
third party challenges anti masonic and workingmens parties in the election of 1832 andrew jackson aiming at a second term as president faced henry clay who still saw himself as the heir to james monroe and john quincy adamss national republicans.
another candidate william wirt a talented lawyer who had argued the cherokee cases before the supreme court entered the fray as the choice of the anti masonic party.
the presence of a third party worked against clay splitting the anti jackson vote.
the anti masons emerged in new york state as a reaction against the power of the masonic order a secret fraternal organization that included many of the nations most powerful figures including jackson and clay.
freemasonry had a long history in america.
many members of americas founding generation had been freemasons including george washington and benjamin franklin.
the freemasons championed enlightenment ideals but they also drew some of their rituals and symbols from mystical traditions.
the best known masonic symbol an eye suspended over an unfinished pyramid appears on the reverse side of the great seal of the united states and also on the modern dollar bill.
several characteristics of the freemasons made them a target of popular suspicion.
secret handshakes rituals passwords and other masonic practices aroused unease.
that so many prominent politicians were masons encouraged conspiracy theories about the organization.
freemasonrys support for the enlightenment also angered why was masonry a cause for concern among some americans.

democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 religious groups especially evangelicals who believed that masons were anti christian.
these suspicions and resentments provided the backdrop to a sensational crime involving the freemasons.
in 1826 a disgruntled ex freemason william morgan threatened to expose the orders secret rituals.
when morgan was kidnapped and disappeared a clamor arose against the order.
the anti masonic party capitalized on this sensational crime.
meanwhile the freemasons did not remain silent.
in this image emblazoned on an apron the anti masons are cast as the mythical monster the hydra.
the image also links anti masons with a host of vices.
freemasons by contrast are associated with enlightenment values such as science and equality.
the apron also makes use of a pyramid a common masonic symbol 8 13.
the anti masons proved to be innovative politicians building an effective popular political movement.
although short lived their party the first third party movement in american history helped pioneer new political techniques that mainstream parties soon adopted.

among the political reforms they achieved was the abolition of imprisonment for debt.
in this pro workie cartoon 8 14 an honest working man exercises the ballot freely while a corrupt tool of the moneyed interest serves the devil.
the most radical voice of working class radicalism was that of the artisan thomas skidmore who advocated a comprehensive program to use inheritance taxes to equalize wealth.
in his book the rights of man to property.
1829 skidmore tackled the problem of economic inequality head on by proposing that wealth be subject to a huge inheritance tax.
although citizens would be free to accumulate as much wealth as they could during their lifetime they would not be able to pass it on to their children.
the goal was to prevent the creation of a monied aristocracy.
revenue from this inheritance tax would be used by the government to provide each new generation of citizens with a basic economic stake so that each citizen would start life with the same economic advantages.
this radical proposal to redistribute wealth went nowhere.

but although the workies were unable to create a national labor party some of their proposals were popular enough to be picked up by mainstream democrats.
in particular the workies attack on banking resonated with jackson and his followers.
the class conscious rhetoric of the workies would affect how democrats framed their message for the american people.
the bank war and the rise of the whigs jacksons growing opposition to clays american system including a visceral hatred for the bank of the united states emerged as a defining feature of his presidency.
the political war that arose over the bank helped jacksons opponents to define their identity and create a new political party the whigs.
henry clay and daniel webster two influential figures within the anti jackson national republican party believed that the presidents hatred for the bank could be used to defeat him in the election of 1832.
clay reasoned that jacksons opposition to the bank would alienate most voters because they would recognize the importance of a national bank.
clay approached nicholas biddle the head of the bank of hear the audio van buren the united states to petition congress for an early renewal of the banks charter in 1832.
clay knew that jackson was opposed to the bank and might veto the new charter which clay believed would turn the public against the president.
jackson confided to martin van buren his intention to destroy the bank.
the bank mr van buren is trying to kill me but i will kill it when congress renewed the banks charter in 1832 jackson vetoed it and clay lacked the votes to override the veto.
the bank then became the central issue of the presidential campaign of 1832.
although the bank had many supporters including some in jacksons administration the veto turned out to be popular.
jackson had managed to convert opposition to the bank into support for democracy itself.
in his bank veto speech jackson not only explained why he opposed re chartering the bank of the united states but also laid out his own vision of american democracy and constitutional government.
jackson attacked the rich and powerful who too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes his speech appealed to the humble members of society the farmers mechanics and laborers jackson portrayed the bank as a tool of the rich and powerful who had obtained a charter by corrupting congress.
thus while the bank veto speech sounded how did jackson use democratic rhetoric to rally support for his bank veto.
chapter 8 democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 the bank veto falsely and wickedly alleges that the rich and powerful throughout the country are waging a war of oppression against the poor and the weak boston daily atlas editorial 1832 democratic themes it avoided the most combative class conscious rhetoric radicals in the workingmens movement had employed.
jackson did not attack wealth or the wealthy but only those who used their wealth and influence to gain unfair advantages.
democratic newspapers echoed jacksons view of the bank the jackson cause is the cause of democracy and the people against a corrupt and abandoned aristocracy jackson also used the veto speech to defend his view that federal courts were not the final judges of what the constitution meant.
in his view each branch of the federal government had an obligation to interpret the constitution for itself.
opponents attacked the veto as an assault on the constitution.
the press charged that jackson had become a dictator his veto one newspaper claimed was the act of a tyrant who had contempt for congress.
rather than a victory for democracy jacksons recklessness was a sign of his corruption.
for his opponents jackson became the embodiment of tyranny.
jacksons war against the bank of the united states inspired a rich assortment of political cartoons both critical and supportive of his policies.
democratic cartoonists cast jackson as the champion of the common man while supporters of the bank depicted him as a reckless tyrant.
these images are explored in images as history king andrew and the downfall of mother bank see pages 244 245.
andrew jackson the whigs and the bank war in the election of 1832 jackson defeated clay by 200 000 votes and by a roughly 4 to 1 margin in the electoral college.
clays strategy of making the bank the central issue in the campaign had backfired and jacksons attack on it had increased his popularity.
still the bank war helped jacksons opponents define their political identity and create a new political party the whigs.
having defeated its supporters jackson might have opted to let the bank die a natural death by simply allowing its charter to expire.
however fearing that his enemies would try to revive the bank during the next how did whigs interpret the bank veto.
congressional session and vote it a new charter he decided to withdraw all federal funds from the bank a move that would have made its revival financially impossible.
jackson ordered his secretary of the treasury to remove the governments deposits but even his own secretary thought such a move rash and damaging to the economy.
the president had to fire two men before he could find one willing to become secretary of the treasury and follow his orders.
jackson justified this unusual step by noting that his reelection had given him a popular mandate to destroy the bank.
no previous president had ever cast his election in such terms.
even some congressional democrats believed that jackson had risked the economic well being of the country to satisfy his personal vendetta against the bank.
jacksons enemies in congress condemned his actions as additional proof that he was a tyrant who sought a total change of the pure republican character of the government and the concentration of all powers in the hands one man for the whigs jackson was little better than george iii whom americas own whig patriots had opposed more than 50 years before.
economic crisis and the presidency of martin van buren jacksons decision to remove funds from the bank and deposit them in state banks damaged the economy.
state banks were far less cautious than the bank of the united states in loaning money particularly for speculative land ventures.
the resulting expansion of credit led to a speculative frenzy.
by 1836 land sales mushroomed increasing almost tenfold in five years to 25 million.
to slow down the overheated economy jackson adopted a hard money policy the specie circular which required that land purchased from the government be paid for with specie hard currency before this policy individuals had purchased land with bank notes that were not guaranteed by gold or silver.
democrats whigs and the second party system martin van buren had become the most influential figure in jacksons inner circle and was the democrats candidate for president in 1836.
in most respects van buren was nearly the opposite of andrew jackson.
political caricaturists made much of the physical and personality differences between the two.
jackson was tall thin impulsive and headstrong whereas van buren was short stout cautious and compromising.
the nicknames of the two underscored the differences.
jackson was the hero of new orleans or old hickory whereas van buren was the little magician or the slippery elm van buren won by a narrow margin in 1836 garnering 50 2 percent of the popular vote.
he also inherited a weak economy.
within a year of taking office he was forced to deal with the panic of 1837 an economic crisis that plunged the nation into economic depression.
unemployment rose dramatically as did the number of farm foreclosures and business failures.
wages dropped by as much as 50 percent and a third of the workforce was out of work in hardhit areas such as philadelphia.
the cartoon the times illustrates the hardships associated with the panic of 1837 and links them with jacksons economic policies 8 15.
the images of idle workers staggering drunk while a respectable looking woman and child beg for coins show the plight of the working class.
although whigs blamed jacksons war against the bank the economic causes of the panic were largely foreign.
in 1837 the bank of england decided to raise its interest rates and restrict the flow of credit to british banks investing in america.
this constriction of credit forced american banks to restrict their loans and call in many outstanding debts.
without access to additional credit many businesses and farms defaulted on their loans.
when these loans went bad many banks caught short had to close.
these bank failures led to a further constriction of credit which then triggered another round of foreclosures and business failures.
to make matters worse the price of cotton on the world market plummeted in 1837 leaving many speculators without the funds to cover their loans and causing more bankruptcies.
critics of the president gave him a new nickname martin van ruin 8 15 panic of 1837 this political cartoon highlights the hardships caused by the panic of 1837.

what are the signs of economic distress in this political cartoon on the panic of 1837.
chapter 8 democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 images as history king andrew and the downfall of mother bank as proof that the president had become a corrupt tyrant.
reaching back more than a half century to the colonists struggle against king george iii jacksons opponents sought to shift attention away from the bank and focus it on his abuse of executive power.
by portraying him as a corrupt monarch andrew jacksons war on the second bank of the united states provided political cartoonists with an excellent subject for satire.
jacksons enemies seized on his veto of the bill renewing the banks charter and his decision to withdraw federal funds from the bank and deposit them in state banks jackson wears a royal crown and holds a scepter the president holds a copy of the bank veto in his other hand jackson crushes the constitution beneath his feet.
why is jackson portrayed as a monarch in this political cartoon.
democrats whigs and the second party system who had trampled on the constitution and recklessly distributed government funds to political cronies the presidents opponents found a potent rhetorical theme that was easily translated into powerful visual images.
the whig view of jackson is beautifully illustrated in king andrew the first in this cartoon he not only sports a crown and scepter two obvious symbols of monarchy but is adorned in rich robes fit for a king.
jackson holds a copy of the bank veto in one hand and tramples on the constitution.
jacksons supporters also found fertile subject for visual treatment.
in this cartoon the downfall of mother bank jackson and a popular cartoon character major jack downing a forerunner of the character uncle sam bring down the pillars of the bank by announcing the withdrawal of government funds.
the banks president rendered with a demonic head flees the scene.

chapter 8 democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 playing the democrats game whigs in the election of 1840 largely because the whigs split their vote among different regional candidates in 1836 they lost the election to van buren.
however the failure of the whigs also reflected their problem communicating their message to the american people.
millard fillmore a young whig from upstate new york who would later become president lamented the heterogeneous mass of the whig party which included old national republicans and jackson men in revolt masons and anti masons abolitionists and pro slavery men fillmore hoped that his party could find some crucible to melt them down into one mass of pure whigs of undoubted good metal in 1840 the whigs did unite and learned how to frame their message to appeal to the american people.
drafting a popular military figure william henry harrison the whigs reshaped their campaign using the tools and rhetoric that had made the democrats so successful especially their direct appeals to the people.
in brief they learned to play the democrats game.
the whigs also pioneered new techniques for mobilizing voters and made an unprecedented effort to involve women in their cause.
the log cabin campaign democrat martin van burens supporters derided the whig candidate in 1840 general william henry harrison as old granny or old tippecanoe the nicknames alluded to the generals age he was almost 70 and to his victory over shawnee indians at the battle of tippecanoe in 1811.
one democratic editor in baltimore suggested that given his advanced age it might be best to give him a barrel of hard cider and let him sit out the remainder of his days in his log cabin the effort to ridicule harrison backfired however the whigs seized on the twin images of hard cider and log cabins as the symbols for their campaign.
the new campaign message transformed harrisons public persona almost overnight he was no longer the well educated son of a wealthy virginia planter his real background but was instead a simple farmer born into a log cabin who enjoyed a glass of hard alcoholic cider like all common folk.
eager to take advantage of the democratic mistake the whigs plastered log cabins and barrels of hard cider onto an astonishing array of items badges banners buttons belt bucklers hair brushes pewter spoons lithographed prints quilts and song sheets.
the whigs also used miniature wooden log cabins as floats transforming what had been marches into festive parades.
what political innovations helped the whigs out democrat the democrats.
whig slogans became two of the most successful campaign slogans in u s history tippecanoe and tyler too to support harrison and van van is a used up man to taunt their opponent martin van buren.
the democratic review capturing the irony of the election of 1840 noted that we have taught them how to conquer us whigs not only adapted the democrats campaign techniques for mobilizing the popular vote but also developed their own innovative campaign style.
with parades and campaign music such as general harrisons log cabin march quick step one of several popular campaign songs the whigs orchestrated a brilliant campaign and trounced their opponents 8 16.
one democratic paper complained we could meet the whigs on the field of argument and beat them but how were democrats to respond when the whigs lay down the weapons of argument and attack us with musical notes.
while whigs cast harrison and his running mate john tyler as men of the people they made van buren out to be a dissipated aristocrat who gorged himself on expensive french cuisine and champagne while americans suffered economic hardship.

to highlight harrisons military accomplishments the artist shows him greeting a disabled veteran.
see chapter 7 the smears of the jacksonian era sunk even lower.
eager to discredit him the whigs spread rumors that van buren was a sexual pervert who had instructed the groundskeeper at the white house to create a mound in the shape of a breast.
gender and social class the whig appeal another innovative aspect of the whigs electoral strategy was their mobilization of women.
although women could not vote the whigs hoped to get them to deliver their husbands votes.
the whig appeal to women relied on two elements a defense of morality against corruption and an appeal to economic interest.
whig newspaper editor horace greeleys description of the choice americans faced in the 1840 election captures the appeal of the whigs to many women.
greeley characterized the whigs as supporters of the family and christian morality and accused the democrats of being atheists and sexual perverts wherever you find a bitter blasphemous atheist and enemy of marriage morality and social order there you may be certain of one vote for van buren although such appeals to traditional family values and morality motivated some women to support the whig cause other women were inspired by economic arguments that whigs directed at male voters.
the ladies they flockd to their windows in numbers i say not a few and held out their starspangled banners all to the honor of tippecanoe.
harrison campaign lyric 1840 why were women drawn to the whig message.
chapter 8 democrats and whigs democracy and american culture 1820 1840 democratic policies had left the american economy in shambles and whig policies promised to bring back prosperity.
whigs sponsored all female rallies in support of harrison including a meeting in ohio in which whig women raised cups of tea in toasts to old tippecanoe democrats complained about the whigs making politicians of their women which was something new under the sun whigs also attacked democrats for fanning class resentments.
thus one whig chided the democrats for their incessant and unrelenting assaults that tore asunder the good feelings which bind men to each other rather than highlight the struggle between democracy and aristocracy a favorite rhetorical theme of democrats whigs stressed the essential harmony of all economic classes.
an observer at a whig rally proudly noted that all classes had rediscovered that their interests were the same calvin colton a leading whig evoked the notion that this is a country of self made men whig policies would promote prosperity for all hard working americans.
the election clearly energized the voters who turned out in record numbers nearly four fifths of eligible voters casting a vote.
harrison defeated van buren by 150 000 votes and a 4 to 1 margin in the electoral college.
president harrisons inaugural speech was the longest in american history 105 minutes long.
his term in office however was the shortest.
within a month of becoming president he contracted pneumonia and died.
vice president john tyler then became the tenth president of the united states.
some dubbed him his accidency because he inherited his position after harrisons death.
democrats and whigs two visions of government and society the whigs and democrats represented opposing political visions.
the whigs favored a strong central government encouragement for industry and defense of indians rights in the north and parts of the midwest they aligned themselves against slavery.
rejecting the views of old style conservatives such as chancellor james kent an heir to the federalist vision of politics the whigs adopted the more popular style of politics pioneered by the anti masonic party using it to reach out to voters.
whigs embraced clays american system arguing that would help all americans so that the rich and poor would each see their fortunes rise.
whigs what were the most important differences between whigs and democrats on economic issues.
emphasized the harmonious interaction of different elements of the economy and attacked democrats for preaching an ideology that fostered class conflict.
the whig version of democracy was not egalitarian.
it recognized the need for a talented and virtuous elite to guide the nation.
the whigs frank acceptance of inequality allowed them to find a place in their ranks for african americans indians women and any other group who needed guidance or protection by an enlightened elite.
although slightly paternalistic in outlook the whigs believed they had a duty to protect these groups.
thus whigs championed the rights of indians against the efforts of jackson and other democrats to forcibly remove them from their lands.
although southern whigs supported slavery whigs outside the south often supported its abolition.
finally whigs actively cultivated womens involvement in their campaign efforts.
the whig party drew from the old national republican party of john quincy adams adding to their ranks democrats who opposed jacksons bank war.
anti masons and the more commercial southern planters were also drawn to the whig message.
whiggery also had a significant ethnic and religious basis.
individuals of english origin were also more likely than others to be whig in sympathy and mainstream protestant denominations such as the congregationalists presbyterians and episcopalians were more likely to vote whig.
democrats vision of white mens democracy was more egalitarian than that of the whigs but it was also more exclusive.
although democrats often couched their appeals in egalitarian terms this rhetoric was not inclusive when it came to racial equality.
instead democrats reached out to workers small farmers and the planter class.
democrats attracted voters who were suspicious of the burgeoning market economy including those who blamed banks especially the bank of the united states for their economic problems.
they asserted their support for the sanctity of private property and for the doctrine of states rights meaning that they were the party best suited to protect the interests of southern slaveholders.
obtaining more land for white farmers including southern planters was the primary goal of democrats.
promoting this old jeffersonian ideal of an expanding nation of yeoman farmers meant having to sacrifice the rights of indians.
from jeffersonianism jacksonian democrats inherited a fear of centralized government and large concentrations of financial power.
thus democrats opposed clays american view the image mattys dream playing the democrats game whigs in the election of 1840 democrats whigs oppose tariffs favor tariffs oppose federal support for internal improvements favor federal support for internal improvements oppose bank of the united states support the bank of the united states favor indian removal oppose indian removal states rights support strong central government 8 17 democrats and whigs major beliefs system and the whigs emphasis on a powerful federal government involved in economic development.
although not opposed to economic growth democrats believed that the individual states not the federal government ought to guide economic development.
rural farmers and urban workers flocked to the ranks of the democrats.
religious affiliation also dictated democratic affiliation.
democrats were more popular among the less affluent evangelical protestant sects such as the baptists and methodists who found jacksons egalitarian message appealing.
democrats also attracted free thinkers and catholics who feared that the whigs were trying to impose protestant morality on them.
for a summary of the ideas of the democrats and whigs see the chart 8 17.
democrats hailed the majesty of the people and attacked aristocracy particularly artificial privilege and monopolies.
whigs embraced a more measured view of democracy.
they warned americans of the threat posed by demagogues tyrants who flattered the people but who willingly sacrificed the common good the rule of law and the rights of the individual as they pursed their own quest for power and glory.
the expansion of democracy in america was accompanied by profound changes in the economy.
the whigs and the democrats each grappled with these changes in different ways.
developments in technology the growth of the factory system and the burgeoning market would produce changes no less profound than the democratization of politics.
taken together these interrelated changes helped usher in an economic and cultural transformation historians describe as the market revolution the whigs would become the great champions of the market revolution believing that government including the national government could help expand the market economy and promote american prosperity.
democrats accepted the necessity of the market but were more wary of its changes and were particularly concerned that government not manipulate the market economy to further the interests of a wealthy elite.
they were especially suspicious of the national government and believed that the states could better promote growth.
whigs and democrats would also come to view the geographical expansion of the united states in radically different ways.
for democrats more land meant the fulfillment of the old jeffersonian dream of creating a nation of independent farmers.
whigs worried about the political side effects of expansion.
they sought to improve america not expand it.
economic development and reform not geographical expansion would become the key to the whigs very different vision of the american future.
the aristocracy of our country continually contrive to change their party name.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 the united states experienced extraordinary economic growth and change in the first half of the nineteenth century.
but the economies of the northern and southern regions of the nation evolved along different paths.
the north developed a free labor economy marked by industrialization urbanization and immigration.
economic growth was spurred by new technologies that made agriculture more productive and factories more efficient as well as by improvements in transportation and communication that spurred consumer demand for the latest goods.
by contrast while the south experienced some industrialization and urban growth most of its expansion and development focused on raising cash crops with slave labor.
the huge profits generated by cotton cultivation prompted the expansion of plantations into the so called black belt that stretched from alabama west to east texas.
by mid century northerners and southerners became increasingly self conscious about the distinctiveness of the labor system in their own region and more critical of that employed in the other half of the nation.
this image the tree of liberty 1846 illustrates the radical differences between the vision of liberty defended by northern proponents of free labor and that of southern defenders of slavery.
on the right side of the tree a slaveholder reclining in a chair while fanned by a slave announces surrounded by slaves basking at ease by their labor we can have a clearer conception of the value of liberty on the other side of the tree the artist has placed two industrious farmers conversing and young mill women in front of their factory.
a group of gentlemen chat and one praises the norths expanding population composed of industrious immigrants from almost every nation although north and south had developed different labor systems each was tied to the expanding market economy that henry clay praised in 1824.
the expansion of the market economy transformed the countryside in both the north and south and fueled urban growth.
the greatest want of civilized society is a market for the sale and exchange of the surplus of the produce of the labor of its members.
if we cannot sell we cannot buy henry clay 1824 chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 the market revolution in 1800 most rural households produced only a small surplus that was traded locally often through a system of barter that did not require cash transactions.
most manufactured goods were produced by artisans whose workshops were usually in their homes.
during the nineteenth century the american economy became more commercially oriented.
farmers began producing cash crops for sale in distant markets and a wider range of consumer goods many of them made in factories became available.
the market revolution the term used by historians to describe this transformation encompassed interrelated developments that revolutionized agriculture industry technology transportation and communications.
this market revolution would radically change both north and south in the antebellum period.
improved technology such as iron plows and steam powered cotton gins enabled farmers to produce more crops while cheaper more efficient forms of transportation including the railroad allowed them to deliver these goods to markets.
new communication technology notably the telegraph and steam powered printing press increased the speed and volume of news and information available to americans.
agricultural changes and consequences before 1815 most farmers in the south and the north labored to achieve a competence which meant enough food to feed their family and a small surplus to trade locally or barter for goods such as tools that could not be produced at home.
but in the early nineteenth century american farmers began raising crops for an expanding commercial market to earn profits and accumulate wealth.
periodicals geared to farmers promoted this new emphasis on commercial farming touted the latest agricultural theories and advertised the most up to date labor saving devices.
publications such as the new england farmer warned that the cultivator who does not keep pace with his neighbors as regards agricultural improvements and information will soon find himself the poorer consequence of the prosperity that surrounds him in 1819 jethro wood introduced one of the earliest and most important of these improvements an iron plow that could double a farmers efficiency.
within a decade john deere had improved woods design creating a plow that seemed to move through soil so easily that it was dubbed the singing plow in the wheat growing midwest farmers adapted horse driven machines to tasks such as threshing and raking.
crank powered churns transformed arduous womens tasks such as making butter by hand.
the cotton gin see chapter 7 transformed southern agriculture.
in 1839 the farmers almanac proclaimed that scarcely a tool.
has not been altered for the better in some way or other the new scientific methods of agriculture helped increase the productivity of the soil.
the creation of a market economy encouraged farmers to concentrate on crops that they could sell for cash in the marketplace a trend that caused changes in farming patterns that varied by region.
the south concentrated on staples for export such as cotton while farmers in the midwest produced grain particularly wheat.
eastern farmers shifted their efforts to livestock production dairy goods fruits and vegetables.
market oriented farming with its emphasis on efficiency and profit also transformed social values and communal patterns of life.
the new more commercial approach to farming challenged traditional ideas of neighborliness and community that had been central to rural life.
increasingly farmers began to see harvest parties husking bees communal celebrations in which corn was husked dances and other ritual communal occasions in which work and leisure were combined as inefficient and wasteful.
the farmers almanac in 1833 advised that if you love fun frolic and waste and slovenliness more than economy and profit then make a husking in this humorous image of a corn husking 9 1 a man finds a lucky ear of red corn that entitles him to a kiss but his advance is met by a girl holding a corn how did technology change agriculture in the era of the market revolution.
watch the video coming of age in 1833 the market revolution smut a weathered ear of corn that gave her the right to refuse her suitor.
upcountry southern farmers continued to concentrate on producing food for personal consumption and devoted a relatively small percentage of their land to commercial crops.
while other regions of the country sought to improve every parcel of land for commercial agriculture parts of the south remained committed to practices that encouraged a more self sufficient style of agriculture geared to personal use.
unlike in the north for example where extensive land was enclosed behind fences many southern states enacted laws against fencing in lands not used for agricultural production so that livestock could roam freely.
a nation on the move roads canals steamboats and trains central to the development of commercial market oriented farming were improvements in transportation.
these changes allowed those previously unable to deliver farm products to the growing cities of the northeast and midwest to enter the market.
for those already in the market the costs of business were dramatically lowered.
these changes also spread information including almanacs books describing the latest agricultural techniques and advertisements for the latest goods.
the first major development in transportation was the building of a network of roads and turnpikes that by the 1820s helped knit together the major urban areas along the eastern seaboard.
new york state embarked on the most ambitious program of road building adding 4 000 miles of improved road and turnpikes by 1820.
the national road the first federally funded road in u s history stretched from cumberland maryland to wheeling in what is now west virginia.
by the 1830s this road would take travelers as far west as columbus ohio.
pennsylvania built the lancaster turnpike which eventually was extended to connect philadelphia and pittsburgh making transportation cheaper and more reliable.
by the 1820s 30 000 tons of freight moved by wagon across this route annually.

workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 the new road network dramatically cut travel times a coach journey from new york to boston that had taken four days in 1800 took half that time in 1824.
even more dramatic was the invention of the steamboat.
navigable rivers such as the mississippi ohio missouri and hudson had long served as vital arteries for moving agricultural products from the interior to market.
this water highway system moved almost exclusively in one direction.
traveling upriver from new orleans to louisville in kentucky for example was expensive and slow as long as three to four months.
as a result few manufactured goods reached the interior of the nation.
the arrival of the steamboat would revolutionize upriver travel reducing the same new orleans to louisville journey to just over a week by 1826.
the steamboat proved an economic boon to river cities such as st louis new orleans pittsburgh cincinnati and louisville.
hannah stockton stiles the daughter of a prosperous merchant stitched this elaborate needlework quilt capturing the hustle and bustle of philadelphias waterfront.
stiles included a steam boat with smoke billowing from its smoke stack 9 2.
canals provided another means of moving goods more cheaply and faster than by road.
since what impact did the erie canal have on new yorks economy.
the 1780s private companies had built small canals usually less than 20 miles long.
in 1817 america had about 100 miles of canals with no single canal longer than 30 miles.
in that same year however new yorks governor de witt clinton persuaded the legislature to fund a canal linking buffalo on lake erie to albany on the hudson river.
the erie canal as it was called was over 300 miles long and was an unprecedented undertaking both in terms of engineering and state investment the new york legislature approved the huge sum of 7 million in bonds to fund the project roughly a quarter of all the money spent by all the states on internal improvements in the 1820s.
although opponents mocked it as clintons ditch the erie canal was a stupendous success.
before the canal opened wheat from western new york state took 20 days to reach albany by wagon and cost almost 100 per ton to transport.
after the canal was built the same ton of wheat could be transported all the way to new york city in ten days at a cost of 5.
much as the steamboat fueled the growth of river towns the erie canal fueled the development of new cities such as rochester buffalo and syracuse.
the canals success sparked canal fever across the country and more than 3 300 miles of canals were completed by 1840 at a cost of about 125 million.
in 1825 the same year that the erie canal was completed the first commercial railway began operating in england.
in 1830 the baltimore and ohio railroad successfully tested a steam powered train.
americans soon developed their own railroads and by 1840 railroad mileage surpassed canals.
railroads further increased the speed at which goods and people moved from one part of the country to another.
by 1840 the trip between boston and new york by rail took a mere half day.
americans greeted with amazement each innovation of the transportation revolution but the railroad evoked the most powerful responses.
what an object of wonder wrote one american in response to his first sight of a railroad in 1835.
charles caldwell the founder of the university of louisville praised the railroad as an agent of civilization that would help spread morality and education by linking people together more effectively.
not everyone shared this view of railroads.
critics of the railroad raised concerns about safety noise and some expressed fears about the destruction of the landscape.
images as history nature technology and the railroad george innesss lackawanna valley 1855 explores how artists struggled to represent this marvel.
hear the audio file erie canal the market revolution images as history nature technology and the railroad george innesss the lackawanna valley 1855 the president of the delaware lackawanna and western railroad commissioned george inness to paint the companys new roundhouse a facility to house and repair trains.
but inness soon found that his artistic vision conflicted with that of the railroad.
for the railroad artistic considerations were less important than advertising its achievements.
the main disagreement between inness and his patrons was over the representation of the roundhouse.
the artist wished to render the facility accurately which would have diminished its importance in the painting.
ultimately inness agreed to make the roundhouse appear larger than it would have had he rendered the scene in actual perspective.
he sacrificed artistic truth to the necessities of the marketplace.
innesss painting applies many of the conventions used to represent nature to a scene in which nature and technology coexist in a complex relationship.
thus he includes a reclining youth a figure often used in landscape paintings.
here the boy calmly gazes toward the oncoming train.
rather than disrupting the serenity of nature the train appears to blend harmoniously into it.
although inness portrays the railroad in a positive light he also suggests the cost of technological progress a field of tree stumps reminds viewers that economic development has taken a toll on the landscape.
which aspects of the painting present a positive view of progress.
which aspects suggest a negative view.
george inness the lackawanna valley the figure of the boy reclining in the field evokes serenity and harmony with nature.
although the distant roundhouse should have appeared much smaller inness increased its size to please his patrons.
the prominence of so many tree stumps suggests that the artist was aware that technological progress came at a cost the defilement of nature.

spreading the news improvements in roads canals and railroads facilitated the spread of communication.
the near doubling of the number of post offices and miles of improved postal roads between 1810 and 1820 increased the number of letters delivered annually from not quite four million to nearly nine million.
it had taken ten days for news to travel from richmond virginia to new york city in jeffersons day.
by the 1810s it only took five days.
the advent of the railroad as the figure 9 3 shows accelerated this trend dramatically cutting the time for news to travel.
for example in 1817 it took 19 days for news to travel from new york to cincinnati by 1841 it only took seven days.
the telegraph which used electricity to send coded messages over wires revolutionized communication.
in 1844 samuel morse a painter turned inventor who had patented the device in 1837 transmitted a message taken from a bible verse what hath god wrought along a telegraph line from washington d c to baltimore.
the message was in code the morse code that he also developed.
observers predicted correctly that the how did the telegraph transform communication.
nearly instantaneous communication of telegraphy would usher in a new age of communications.
by the mid 1850s companies such the western union telegraph company had offices across the nation improving communication between cities as far apart as boston and new orleans.
improvements in print technology sharply reduced the cost of publishing leading to an enormous increase in the number of newspapers magazines and books.
in 1801 there were only 200 newspapers in america by 1835 there were 1 200.
the number of magazines also rose dramatically giving americans a far greater range of printed materials.
while most eighteenth century magazines and newspapers were directed at the general public many of these new publications were aimed at specific audiences.
the farmers almanac for example dispensed advice about agriculture while magazines such as godeys ladys book informed a large and growing group of middle class women readers about the latest ideas in fashion literature and family matters.
also on the rise by the 1830s american book publishing with an output of at least 1 000 titles a year nearly rivaled that of britain.

in 1834 nathaniel currier began producing colored lithographic images using a new process that was cheaper than traditional engraving techniques.
rather than aspire to provide high art currier set out to provide cheap and popular pictures of contemporary events historical figures and scenes of everyday life.
touted as printmakers to the people his firm eventually renamed currier and ives produced images costing as little as fifteen cents.
these were sold on city street corners and peddlers carried them to country stores across the nation.
currier and ives prints often featured patriotic themes displaying the nations wealth ingenuity and economic achievements.
technological progress was a favorite theme.
consumers could choose from an assortment of steamboats and trains.
although the firm often celebrated technological triumph they also exploited disaster.

beyond making it easier and faster to send messages and news the communications revolution also contributed to economic expansion of the market revolution by fueling the desire for new consumer goods and fashions.

chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 the spread of industrialization in the early nineteenth century the united states began a transition from a predominantly agricultural economy to an industrial one.
this process unfolded unevenly across different sectors of the american economy and followed different models depending on the industry and region.
driven by new manufacturing technology and techniques industrialization led to a vast increase in the number of goods everything from clothing and shoes to tools and toys available to the american consumer.
but for many workers especially skilled artisans the new industrial economy led to a devaluation of their skills and loss of social status.
for less skilled workers industrialization often meant exploitation long hours and low pay.
for others however the new manufacturing economy opened up opportunities for advancement.
from artisan to worker the group of workers most dramatically affected by the onset of industrialization was artisans or workers who used specialized skills to produce consumer goods from shoes to bread to candles.
in the colonial period skilled artisans worked in small shops attached to their homes using hand tools to produce goods for local consumption.
they also used an apprenticeship system training boys in their skills until about age 20 in exchange for their labor.
the relationship between artisan and apprentice was close.
typically an apprentice lived in his masters house receiving food clothing and education.
in the new factory system first pioneered by samuel slater in rhode island see chapter 7 the artisan system of small scale production was replaced with a new set of roles owners managers and wage workers.
the owner provided the money for the enterprise the manager supervised the workers and the laborers did the actual work which was usually less skilled than the traditional crafts practiced by skilled artisans.
some industries such as textiles shifted relatively rapidly to the use of power driven machinery.
shoe production by contrast continued to employ many manual laborers into the 1860s.
in both cases manufacturers undermined the old craft traditions of artisans by breaking down the productive process into simple steps that could be performed by workers with minimal training.
factory work forced laborers to give up many aspects of working class culture.
the work rhythm of artisans before the rise of the factory included periods of intense activity followed by slack periods how did the factory change work.
in which artisans might socialize with one another perhaps meeting in a tavern to drink and discuss politics.
under industrialization the clock ruled.
factory workers were required to follow a strict schedule and perform at a steady pace day in and day out.
beyond the rigid regulations of the workers day the factory robbed them of the pride of craft associated with handmade goods.
in contrast to artisan production where a skilled craftsman might create one of a kind pieces factory goods were designed to be identical.
in addition to creating a labor force of less skilled workers the new system also led to a sharp separation between home and workplace.
before 1800 most artisans in new york had workshops attached to their homes but by 1840 two thirds of them lived in one place and worked in another.
the factory system separated home and workplace.
the apprenticeship system also suffered.
by 1827 less than a quarter of apprentices lived with their employers.
if the factory system diminished the control that working people had over their time and work it increased the goods they could buy.
because factorymade goods cost less to produce families of modest means could now afford items once available only to the wealthy.
ordinary americans could now purchase furniture clocks dishes silverware and the latest fabrics.
women and work the factory system had a tremendous impact on the lifestyle and status of american women.
while mens work increasingly shifted to sites outside the home womens economic activity remained the spread of industrialization primarily within.
nevertheless some women participated more directly in the new manufacturing economy through outwork in this system skilled processes were broken down into simpler tasks that could be farmed out to women to perform in their homes.
manufacturers provided the materials to women with a specified completion date.
they saved money because they did not have to provide a workshop or factory and they paid women a fraction of the wages a skilled male artisan earned.
in new england during the 1830s 33 000 women took part in outwork production of palm leaf hats.
they also produced paper boxes hoopskirts artificial flowers and cloaks.
in urban areas many women depended on the meager earnings of outwork for their survival.
in rural areas such as parts of new england women might rely on outwork for supplemental income while continuing to do traditional agricultural work such as producing milk butter and cheese.
rural new england women would eventually provide the labor force for one of the most ambitious industrial experiments of the day the lowell mills.
the lowell experiment in 1814 a group of boston merchants decided to expand on samuel slaters mill village model see chapter 7 and create a large planned industrial town.
they built a textile factory in waltham massachusetts and developed the waltham system a mill town model that relied on centralized factories each one of which united all the distinctive steps of cloth production under one roof.
the system also came to depend on a large labor force housed in company owned dormitories.
in 1823 the same group of merchants led by francis lowell opened an even larger factory on a site in massachusetts adjacent to the merrimack river.
the lowell mill consolidated all aspects of cloth production.
cotton from the south arrived at the mills where it was cleaned carded spun and woven into a finished fabric.
within a decade the new mill town of lowell boasted 22 mills and grew to over 50 mills by 1850.
not surprisingly many competing mill towns cropped up all over new england and upstate new york.
the mill owners recruited young single women from rural new england to work at the factory towns.
to accommodate this workforce and appease concerned parents they built dormitories and libraries and provided boardinghouse matrons to supervise the morality of the workers.
each read the document a second peep at factory life boardinghouse with up to ten bedrooms per building housed between 20 and 40 women.
two women sometimes had to share a single bed.
the boardinghouses also contained a kitchen a dining room a parlor and separate quarters for the housekeepers who were generally older women.
compared to the remote new england villages from which most of the women came lowell offered many amenities.
lowell allowed women to earn significantly more money than did farm labor and domestic service the two most common occupations for single women.
the women operatives in the mills also made friends with their coworkers and enjoyed free time away from the factories to socialize and pursue cultural and educational opportunities not available in their small home towns.
as josephine l baker a mill worker noted there are lectures evening schools and libraries to which all may have access the mill women even produced their own literary magazine the lowell offering 9 5.
the magazine nominally independent of the mills echoed this rosy portrait.
indeed the cover of this 1845 issue shows a mill girl holding a book and adopting a contemplative pose.
she stands in a lush natural setting of flowers trees and vines.
in its early years the lowell experiment was touted as an example of american ingenuity a popular destination for european visitors eager to see the wonders of the new world.
british novelist charles dickens visited and later wrote with wonder that the mill women were not degraded by factory life but rather retained the manners and deportment of young women despite the upbeat image portrayed on the cover of the lowell offering life in the mills was hard.
the women worked 13 hour days six days a week.
furthermore the noise of the machines the dust and lint generated by the manufacturing processes and the long hours demanded by the mill owners often 9 5 lowell offering the lowell mill women produced this title page of the final issue of the magazine lowell offering presenting an image of industrial harmony.

what was the lowell system.
chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 overwhelmed women accustomed to working out of their homes.
as one young vermont mill woman noted in a letter to her family it is very hard indeed and sometimes i think i shall not be able to endure it.
i never worked so hard in my life for a decade the lowell mill owners enjoyed high profits and peaceful labor relations.
but increased competition with other textile producers led them in 1834 to announce a wage cut.
furious the lowell mill women went on strike or turned out critics of the strike saw it as a radical assault on the rights of the mill owners economic freedom and a display of unseemly behavior for women.
the mill women defended their actions as an assertion of their rights as american citizens and an example of the ideals of independence and liberty that had inspired the american revolution see competing visions the lowell strike of 1834.
the strike failed to block the wage cut but it was a milestone in the history of both womens rights and labor organization.
in the 1840s a new organization the lowell female labor reform association would join a national struggle for a ten hour working day for all workers.

using everything from skilled handwork similar to artisan production to steam powered machinery run by low skilled factory operatives.
the factories produced an enormous range of goods under this system including chemicals paints and varnishes musical instruments clothing and hats tools machines furniture and books.
new york emerged as the nations leading fashion and clothing center during this period.
initially the city led in the production of cheap negro cottons coarse garments assembled for sale in the south to clothe its slaves.
by the 1830s elegant tailoring houses such as the venerable firm of brooks brothers were offering well tailored clothes to the upper classes and the more prosperous members of the middle class who sought to emulate them.
the industrial economy that emerged in antebellum america created jobs and opportunity for many workers and a vast array of consumer products.
but not everyone benefited equally.
to protect themselves skilled workers built a large labor movement twenty labor newspapers emerged in this period to champion the workers cause.
in 1835 20 000 philadelphia workers from a dozen trades walked off their jobs to protest working conditions and demand a ten hour workday.
the strike was the most successful labor action in the nations short history and made the ten hour workday the new standard.
by 1836 labor councils or federations a precursor of modern labor unions had been founded in 13 manufacturing centers across the nation from boston to cincinnati.
in the largest cities such as new york and philadelphia more than 50 separate trades joined to form the general councils.
the movement collapsed during a severe economic depression that began in 1837.
hard times produced high unemployment and intense competition undermining labors ability to bargain for higher pay and better working conditions.
worker unrest stemmed in part from the awareness that a small group of americans were benefiting more than others from the new economic order.
the distribution of wealth became less equal.
although the wealth of the average citizen grew the proportion of wealth concentrated in the hands of the nations wealthiest citizens also increased.
one of the most revealing measures of changes in the standard of living of americans is provided by statistics about the average height of men serving in the military 9 6.
in the period between 1800 and 1860 the average height of americans decreased by almost an inch.
given that the overall wealth of the nation increased during this period this evidence suggests that not all americans shared in this growing prosperity.

why did the protestors at lowell seek to wrap their cause in the banner of the american revolution and its ideals.
the lowell mill women cast themselves as the heirs to the patriots who fought the american revolution.
their appeal for public support focused on issues of rights and independence themes that echoed the language of the american revolution.

we learn that extraordinary excitement was occasioned at lowell last week by an announcement that the wages paid in some of the departments would be reduced 15 percent on the 1st of march.
the reduction principally affected the female operatives and they held several meetings or caucuses at which a young woman presided who took an active part in persuading her associates to give notice that they should quit the mills.
the number soon increased to nearly 800.

chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 the changing urban landscape industrialization accelerated the growth and changed the nature of american cities.
while before 1820 less than ten percent of the nations population resided in cities areas of more than 2 500 people by 1860 that number had grown to 20 percent.
older cities such as new york philadelphia boston and baltimore grew and new cities in the west such as pittsburgh cincinnati st louis and chicago emerged.
the population growth in these cities was fueled by migration from the american countryside and foreign immigration especially from ireland and germany.
immigration fostered cultural diversity in cities but it also led to tensions and violence along ethnic racial and religious lines.
hostility between protestants and catholics and between whites and blacks increased urban violence.
policing became a far more complex problem in these growing cities.

with nineteenth century industrialization and population growth major changes occurred in american cities.
new kinds of neighborhoods developed that reflected the class and ethnicity of their inhabitants.
distinctive working class neighborhoods including the first urban slums formed.
this trend reflected the drop in the number of artisans who owned their homes and the rise of multiple family dwellings as well as the number of boardinghouses taking in lodgers.
new yorks five points neighborhood illustrates the profound changes in the urban landscape caused by rapid economic development.
to its working class inhabitants five points was a poor but thriving multiethnic and racially mixed community.
to what was the five points neighborhood and why did it become so well known.
the changing urban landscape outsiders however its shabby housing and reputation for crime especially prostitution made it a symbol of urban decline.
thus while its inhabitants saw the neighborhood as a vibrant and diverse community new yorks elite viewed it as a notorious slum to be avoided.
this contemporary image 9 7 captures the multiracial character of the neighborhood but it also reflects the fears of many new yorkers that five points was crime ridden and dangerous.
middle and upper class families eager to escape contact with working people immigrants and free blacks segregated themselves in new more exclusive neighborhoods.
new yorks gramercy park for example was created in 1831 as a private park surrounded by elegant houses.
ringed by a tall gated fence the park was and still is accessible only to the adjacent homeowners who received special keys.
this image of a similar exclusive enclave 9 8 st johns park in new york shows a park with a fence that segregates the rich residents from individuals such as the african americans lampooned in this image for attempting to dress and act above their station in life.
the african american figures are caricatures whose physical features are exaggerated to conform to the racist stereotypes of the day.
in 1800 even americas largest urban centers were walking cities a person could easily walk around all of new york philadelphia or boston in a few hours.
by 1820 however these cities had grown to contain more than half the urban population of the new nation and by mid century these once compact walking cities had become sprawling metropolises.
some of this growth came from annexation.
philadelphia in 1854 annexed several of its suburbs increasing its size from two square miles to 129.
much of the growth was driven by advances in mass transportation that allowed city dwellers to live farther and farther away from where they worked shopped and went for entertainment.
the first of these modes of transportation which arrived in 1827 was the omnibus an urban stagecoach that carried up to 12 passengers over fixed routes for a flat fee.
expensive slow and uncomfortable it gave way by the 1850s to the horse car a 20 passenger coach pulled on rails by horses.
faster cheaper and more comfortable than the omnibus horse cars or street railway lines spread to virtually every large city by 1860.
philadelphia alone boasted 155 miles of track.
steam powered locomotives had also begun to carry commuters or people who traveled over a significant distance from home to work to and from outlying areas.
issues of sanitation and the problem of providing fresh drinking water for these expanding cities led cities such as new york and philadelphia to undertake view the closer look images as history fairmont waterworks sculptures ambitious construction projects such as philadelphias fairmount waterworks.
by 1810 new york had surpassed philadelphia to become the nations largest city.
central to this development was new york harbor the largest on the east coast and one ideally suited to become a major port.
the erie canal ensured new yorks economic supremacy by connecting the city to the midwest.
it increased dramatically the flow of finished goods from europe and the rest of the united states into the american heartland and the flow of foodstuffs produced by midwestern farmers into domestic and foreign markets.
inland cities such as pittsburgh cincinnati st louis and chicago were among the fastest growing urban areas in the nation.
situated on rivers or lakes and soon connected by railroads inland cities became manufacturing centers and transportation hubs.
between 1800 and 1840 these new cities saw their populations quadruple.
if any city in america fit the modern stereotype of a soot covered industrial town it was pittsburgh.

the firm of procter gamble was founded in the city in 1837.
immigrants and the city the sharp rise in urban populations in the nineteenth century stemmed from two sources the migration of americans from rural areas and immigration from europe.
the latter soared from 23 000 in 1830 to 428 000 in 1854.
immigrants left their homelands for the united states for many reasons including poverty poor harvests warfare and political and religious persecution.
the most dramatic exodus in this period was triggered in 1845 when irelands potato crop failed.
the disaster killed more than one million people and spurred more than a million others mostly poor peasants to cross the atlantic to america.
poor harvests and political turmoil boosted german immigration to the united states.
besides the irish and germans the other large groups of immigrants came from other parts of britain notably scotland and wales and from scandinavia 9 9.
the irish and german immigrants changed americas ethnic composition.
for the first time many non protestants entered american society.
irish immigrants were almost entirely catholic whereas germans included both catholics and protestants.
ethnic enclaves with names like kleindeutchland little germany and little ireland with their own churches mutual aid societies theaters newspapers restaurants and social clubs developed in many cities.
irish immigrants generally came from the poorest segments of society they arrived with english 18 northern europe 11 other 1 german 27 irish 43 9 9 sources of european immigration immigrants from germany and ireland changed the population mix in much of the nation.
the influx of catholics in particular resulted in tensions with protestants.
how did immigration patterns change in the early nineteenth century.
little money and few skills needed in an urban economy.
they often ended up in slum neighborhoods like five points and came to dominate low skilled jobs such as laborer and domestic servant.
nonetheless many irish immigrants entered the skilled trades and became successful entrepreneurs.
german immigrants were more diverse.
as with the irish many german immigrants were poor peasants forced off the land but many others were skilled artisans.
liberal intellectuals also fled germany after the political upheavals of 1848 that swept over much of continental europe.
germans were more likely than the irish to become farmers shopkeepers or skilled tradesmen.
they also ventured further inland settling places such as cincinnati and st louis.
more skilled on average than their irish counterparts germans transformed a number of fields.
adolph busch a skilled brewmaster brought german style beer to america and musical instrument makers helped launch such venerable firms as steinway and sons piano makers.
free black communities in the north urban centers in the north and midwest were home to some of the largest free african american communities in the nation.
free blacks in enclaves such as bostons new guinea or cincinnatis little africa were probably the most urbanized subgroup in america.
racial segregation was more pronounced in the urban north than in the cities of the south where urban slaves were likely to live in their masters homes.
thus an african american in boston was almost twice as likely to live in a segregated neighborhood as an african american in new orleans.
african american communities developed thriving institutions such as churches schools and self help societies.
still life for free african americans was hindered by racial prejudice and discrimination.
in the north and parts of the midwest exclusion from many of the skilled trades often forced african americans into the most menial types of labor.
this situation worsened in the 1840s and 1850s as immigrants especially the irish took over occupations traditionally dominated by african americans such as barbers and cart men.
in the cities of the north and west hostility to african americans competing for jobs with read the document petition of the catholics of new york 1840 the changing urban landscape whites intensified.
a drawing from the period 9 10 exploits white fears of african american laborers.
the racist message of the image is clear free blacks will steal the jobs of white workingmen.
through persistence talent and good fortune some african americans could still surmount the obstacles they faced in the labor market and achieve financial security or even prosper.
henry boyd of cincinnati is an example of one such life.
trained as a carpenter while still a slave boyd managed to obtain his freedom and began to ply his trade in cincinnati.
although boyd found some work many employers refused to hire him.
yet in 1836 he accumulated enough money to establish his own furniture making business and by 1842 his downtown factory was using the latest steam powered equipment to make furniture.
by the 1850s boyd was employing a mixedrace workforce of some 50 people.
nine years later however fire destroyed boyds factory.
without insurance he could not rebuild his factory leaving him as he had begun a struggling artisan.
riot unrest and crime urbanization in the first half of the nineteenth century was accompanied by a rise in crime and disorder.
during the 1830s there were 115 incidents of mob violence a steep rise from previous decades.
one newspaper reported that a spirit of riot had taken over the nations cities.
violence increased as growing cities became more divided racially economically and ethnically.
anti catholic sentiment spurred much of the intensified violence.
in 1834 a mob attacked and burned a catholic convent just outside boston.
ten years later in philadelphia the bible riots 9 10 the results of abolitionism this poster warns white laborers that their jobs might be taken by free african americans.
courtesy library company of philadelphia left 20 dead and two catholic churches in ashes.
philadelphias growing catholic community opposed the citys policy of using the protestant version of the bible for instruction in public schools.
after appeals from the citys catholic community were rejected protestors took to the streets.
crowds of catholics and protestants attacked one another in the streets of the city of brotherly love the city was plunged in to three days of rioting and mayhem.
racial animosity also inspired urban unrest.
cincinnatis african american community faced the ire of white mobs in 1829 1836 and 1841.
a three day riot in providence rhode island in 1831 destroyed most of the african american part of the city.
a riot in new york in 1834 destroyed an african american church school and a dozen houses.
adding to the tensions and occasionally why did urban violence increase in the early nineteenth century.
chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 sparking violence were political battles between democrats and whigs antagonisms between supporters and opponents of slavery and conflicts over regulating or eliminating behaviors such as gambling and drinking.
contributing to the rise in urban violence was the steady increase in the number of single men living outside traditional family units a trend that arose from industrialization and immigration.
in the 1840s and 1850s at least 30 percent of male urban dwellers lived outside family units usually in boardinghouses.
free from the traditional guidance and restraint of adults and relatives young men developed a masculine subculture in which alcohol and fighting played a central role.
many young women also streamed into the city looking to improve their economic conditions.
the combination of an aggressive masculine sub culture and a large pool of poor young women led to a significant rise in prostitution a situation that alarmed many officials.
the reverend lyman beecher decried the fact that so many young people were thrown out upon the open bosom of our city where they were easily corrupted by sensuality beechers fears were well founded.
at mid century prostitution ranked as the second biggest industry in new york city.

theaters encouraged prostitutes to attend their performances to boost ticket sales a practice so common that the cheap seats they occupied were dubbed the guilty third tier the expanding news media found salacious tales about the citys seamier side of life a great way to raise circulation.
tales of crime including the sensational murder of the prostitute helen jewett in new york city in 1836 fueled the growth of the press.
rival newspapers competed to be the first to publish the latest revelation about the case and the story dominated headlines for months.
the crime even produced colorful images such as this showing the alleged murderer skulking away 9 11.
reflecting the low regard in which prostitutes were held the lowly clerk accused of killing jewett was acquitted despite considerable evidence suggesting his guilt.
most urban crime did not involve sensational tales of murder but rather petty crimes against property or person.
the informal policing mechanisms that cities had relied on in the eighteenth century including the use of night watchmen and sheriffs who had to rely on community support to quell unrest proved woefully inadequate to policing a major metropolitan area in the nineteenth century.
in 1839 the mayor of new york pushed to create a professional police force fearing that without strong intervention new york would attain the character of a riotous city in 1845 new york created the first modern professional police force in america modeled on londons metropolitan police force.
new york employed 800 men organized in a military structure they carried clubs but not firearms and were deployed to keep the peace and apprehend criminals.

for example at nottoway in louisiana john hampden randolph built a magnificent mansion that contained 64 rooms 200 windows and 165 doors.
but the typical planter lived far more modestly in a simple two story wood framed house.
his home generally described as the big house because it was always the largest domestic dwelling on a plantation was at the center of smaller outbuildings including a kitchen well dairy ice house smokehouse and laundry.
more substantial plantations included many other types of buildings such as barns stables sheds and storehouses.
georgia rice planter henry mcalpins hermitage plantation 9 12 resembled a small town with multiple residences a hospital and other buildings.
indeed the slave quarters constituted an even smaller village within this self contained community.
most what do plantation architecture and the arrangement of buildings tell us about slavery.
legend mansion kitchen smoke house stables coach house 6 lot sunken garden 8 overseers house 9 hospital 10 slave huts 9 12 schematic map of hermitage plantation large plantations were like small towns.
this plantation included a separate overseers house hospital and slave huts.
southern society plantations were far more modest.
most slave owners owned between one and nine slaves.
less than one percent owned 100 or more slaves.
the typical slaveholder worked a small family farm of about 100 acres with fewer than ten slaves.
planters created something akin to englishstyle landed aristocracy.
thomas dabney who had migrated to mississippi from virginia in 1835 to establish a large cotton plantation aspired to this aristocratic lifestyle.
he emulated the life of an english country gentleman taking tea in the afternoon and treating his less affluent neighbors as social inferiors.
while industrialization in the north created a sharp divide between work and home physically separating the two realms southern plantations fused them together.
a large body of advice literature geared toward plantation management that appeared in southern magazines urged planters to act so that the negro should feel that his master is his lawgiver and judge and yet his protector and friend an 1842 book reminded planters that because slaves were placed under our control masters had to care for and instruct them so that they could receive moral and religious uplift in theory masters sought to govern absolutely plantation government a georgia planter wrote should be eminently patriarchal the planter was not only the head of the family but also should in one sense be the father of the whole concern negroes and all planters wives or widows or the eldest daughters in families without a matriarch often helped manage plantation life.
the plantation mistress as she was called supervised slaves who might work in the kitchen nursery laundry stable or garden.
whereas husbands often relied on overseers to assist them and frequently left the plantation to attend to business or public affairs the planters wife was often left to her own devices to run a home that was more like a small village.
southern men claimed that slavery had helped elevate the status of the white woman and liberated her from the drudgery of domestic life making her no longer the slave but the equal and idol of man hospitality was a central part of southern plantation culture and the plantation mistress played a key role in the rituals associated with it.
although lavish entertainment was one part of this reality the evidence found in the surviving diaries and letters of many mistresses suggest that the typical plantation mistress was more apt to feel isolated than the center of a vivacious social life.
mary kendall for example wrote in her diary about her loneliness for about three weeks i did not have the pleasure of seeing one white female face kendalls sense of isolation lent her description of plantation life a melancholy quality.
yeomen and tenant farmers most southern whites were not planters but yeoman farmers independent landowners who worked their own small farms.
in 1860 more than three quarters of southerners owned no slaves.
as a result yeomen farmers depended on neighborliness and communal cooperation to complete tasks such as planting harvesting or building.
lacking the urban centers and cheap transportation that allowed many small farmers in the north to enter fully into the market economy many southern yeomen did not produce large surpluses for market.
instead they devoted most of their resources to producing food for their own families and generally allocated only a small portion of their lands for cash crops that could be sold to purchase seeds sugar and the occasional manufactured good.
since they could not afford the cost of transporting their surpluses to market yeoman farmers depended on planters to market their small surpluses.
they also depended on planters for the use of the plantation mill to grind corn into meal.
in much of the south where planters and yeomen resided side by side a complex web of economic political and social ties bound these two classes together.
but many yeomen in the upcountry regions of the south were fiercely independent and resented the more affluent planters who dominated their states militia legislatures and courts.
indeed most southern state legislators judges and militia officers were drawn from the planter class.
but the yeomanry formed the core of the militia system that tried to catch runaway slaves and guard against slave insurrection.
in this antislavery woodcut the slave patrol is terrorizing a slave 9 13 traveling without the pass needed to leave the plantation.
passes were written by owners and traveling slaves had to have them.
many southerners owned no land and worked as tenant farmers.
in parts of the south estimates by historians vary but between 30 50 percent of the white population fell into this category.
although some landless southerners were young men waiting to inherit land from their fathers many others rarely entered the ranks of the solid yeomanry.
in parts of the deep south with many african american slaves poor whites fraternized with slaves smuggling liquor into the slave quarters helping runaways or forming sexual liaisons and permanent relationships with slaves.
more often however a white supremacist ideology overcame class solidarity across racial lines.

workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 free black communities although most african americans in the south were enslaved by 1860 six percent of black southerners lived as free people of color.
most free blacks resided in the upper south with large communities in border states such as delaware and maryland.
a third of the free blacks resided in southern cities baltimore richmond new orleans charleston memphis mobile and natchez had the biggest communities.
the souths slave codes were even more restrictive than the black codes enacted in the north see chapter 8.
free southern blacks had to carry identification to prove that they were not slaves.
they could not hold office and in some areas even testify in court against whites.
although life for free blacks in the south was difficult the shortage of skilled artisans in many southern cities enabled them to enter trades such how did the experience of free blacks in the south compare with those in the north.
as cabinet making.
southern cities were also less spatially segregated than northern cities and southern african americans played a prominent role as domestics and in some fields and trades such as tailoring and hair cutting.
the free black community in new orleans was one of the most affluent in the south.
it published its own newspapers and its elite members held lavish balls each year.
religious institutions were also important for the free african american community.
in addition to tending to the spiritual needs of their congregations ministers were often community leaders.
southern black churches had much larger memberships than similar institutions in the north.
thus the largest african american congregation in the north new yorks abyssinian baptist church had a membership of 440 at mid century whereas the first african church of richmond counted 3 160 members.

aristocratic affectations even led some to sponsor medieval tournaments that included jousting.
southerners took pride in their resorts along the gulf coast gracious vacation spots characterized by a quiet ease new orleans gradually replaced new york as the horse racing capital of the nation.
blood sports such as cock fighting also remained popular particularly among less affluent southerners.
reputation and honor were central values in the male oriented southern culture.
an unsullied reputation one observer noted was all that a man required to be on a social level with his fellows a scottish traveler remarked that southern men consider themselves men of honor and more frequently resent any indignity shown them even at the expense of their life or that of those who venture to insult them when a social inferior insulted a gentleman the appropriate response was to cane or horsewhip the offender.
dueling was reserved for settling matters of honor among gentlemen.
in 1838 john wilson a former governor of south carolina published the code of honor or the rules for the government of principals and seconds in duelling which explained such things as the role of seconds and the choice of weapons.
the centrality of honor to southern culture was the chief reason dueling endured in this region long after it had been outlawed in the north.
many of the souths leading politicians including andrew jackson and henry clay had fought duels during their careers.
this contemporary drawing by a northern opponent of slavery 9 14 portrays the south as a culture dominated by dueling brawling and mobbing.
for some northerners especially those opposed to slavery the dueling and other violence they associated with the south were a result of the brutality inherent in slavery.
the connection between slavery and southern violence figures prominently in the image which shows a cruel master whipping a helpless slave child.

chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 life and labor under slavery slavery was a complex institution that took many forms in the south.
some slaves lived on large plantations and worked in gangs under an overseer whereas others toiled beside their master on small farms.
still others lived in cities where if they possessed skills they were often hired out.
but the law treated all slaves as property leaving them entirely at the mercy of their master who had the power to impose punishment and sell slaves away from their families.
to protect themselves slaves developed various traditions and strategies.
many turned to religion to provide spiritual comfort and cultural resources to resist the domination of their masters.
slaves also developed subtle forms of resistance such as feigned illness work slow downs and destruction of tools and other property.
occasionally slaves took more overt measures like running away either to seek a temporary respite from the harsh labor regime or to escape north to freedom.
the most radical and the rarest form of resistance was insurrection rising up against the established authorities.
varied systems of slave labor slave labor produced a variety of agricultural products tobacco hemp sugar and rice.
but the leading product was cotton an enterprise in which more than half of all slaves toiled.
by 1840 cotton accounted for more than half the nations exports with most of it heading for european especially british textile mills.
the remainder was sent north to mills in places like lowell massachusetts.
yet even in those regions of the south in which cotton was not the primary crop the cotton economy influenced economic life.
many farmers who did not produce cotton produced foodstuffs and supplies for consumption on cotton plantations.
for instance hemp was turned into rope to bind cotton bales for shipment.
the antebellum south was divided economically into the lower south and the upper south.
the warm climate of the lower south was ideal for cotton cultivation as was the dark rich soil of the region stretching from alabama to texas known as the black belt.
after 1820 cotton cultivation spread rapidly westward propelled by two factors.
first the great wealth produced by cotton provided huge economic incentives for bringing new lands under cultivation.
second because cotton exhausted soil of its nutrients growers constantly sought new lands to bring under cultivation.
to grow and harvest this cotton planters relied on a labor force that was 90 percent enslaved.
where was the black belt.
the upper south included eight slave states but it lacked the fertile land and long growing season necessary for cotton agriculture.
as a result it embraced agricultural diversification including grain and livestock.
of the agricultural staples produced in this region corn rye and hemp were particularly important.
with each passing decade slavery became less and less viable in this region and many masters sold their slaves to the lower south where demand for their labor was high.
although the constitution had outlawed the international slave trade a vibrant internal slave trade existed.
sales from the upper south to the lower south were central to this trade.
most slaves worked as field hands toiling from sun up to sun down most of the year.
on most large plantations slaves worked in the fields in gangs which gave their masters more control over their labor.
men and women generally worked together often supervised by a hired white overseer.
masters sometimes employed slaves to act as drivers or supervisors a role that required them to discipline other slaves or face punishment themselves.
but a clever driver might find a way to protect other slaves from more severe punishment by an overseer.
larger plantations also employed many slave craftsmen as carpenters blacksmiths weavers coopers people who repaired wooden casks and other occupations.
household slaves worked as cooks coachmen nannies or maids.
planters used a system of rewards and punishments to enforce slave discipline.
as rewards some life and labor under slavery planters allowed slaves to maintain a small garden or even sell produce at market.
ultimately however labor discipline was enforced by violence.
a popular management book that many planters consulted argued that after reason and persuasion have been exhausted without producing the desired effect punishment of some sort must be resorted to as an english observer noted absence from work or neglect of duty was punished with stinted allowances imprisonment and flogging northern abolitionist literature made the image of the whip one of their most prominent metaphors of life in the south as this broadside from an antislavery almanac reveals 9 15.
southern masters also controlled their slaves by threatening to sell them.
slaves in the upper south feared being sold down river to a cotton or sugar plantation because it meant separation from family and probably a harsher existence.
sales tore slave families apart.
sales may have dissolved as many as one third of all slave marriages and separated almost half of the children living in the older parts of the south from a parent.
the british artist eyre crowe painted a scene in a richmond slave market in which men women and children wait their turn on the auction block 9 16.
scenes such as this were common throughout virginia and the carolinas.
in 1859 the georgia 9 15 broadside with image of slave whipping to portray the horror of slavery abolitionists used the image of slave owners whipping their slaves.
planter pierce butler sold 450 slaves in a single auction lasting days.
a reporter from the new york tribune described the misery of the slaves whose brothers and sisters were to be scattered through the cotton fields of alabama the expressions of heavy grief the reporter noted reflected their horror at being torn from their homes and separated from their loved ones.

chapter 9 workers farmers and slaves the transformation of the american economy 1815 1848 although most of the souths slaves toiled as agricultural laborers many others worked in some type of industrial enterprise primarily in the upper south.
while the south lagged far behind the north in industrial development it still exceeded all but the top five or six industrial nations in production of textiles and iron flour and timber milling sugar refining and leather tanning.
most of these upper south industries relied on slave labor and by 1850 at least five percent of the souths slaves between 150 000 and 200 000 persons worked in industry.
employers owned 80 percent of the slaves who worked in industry with the rest hired out on yearly or short term leases.
enslaved blacks and free whites sometimes worked side by side.
richmonds tredegar iron works employed such a mixed labor force until 1847 when a strike by whites prompted the owners to rely exclusively on enslaved black labor apart from a few white supervisors.
slaves also worked in nonagricultural enterprises in cities such as richmond mobile charleston and new orleans.
slaves worked as domestics artisans carriage drivers gardeners couriers and nurses.
southern cities also employed slaves for public works projects including sanitation road building and bridge maintenance.
savannah and charleston even used slaves as firefighters.
life in the slave quarters compared to brazil where living conditions for slaves were among the worst in the americas conditions for american slaves were less harsh.
this contributed to a significant natural increase in the slave population in the united states the population increased nearly fivefold between 1790 and 1850.
still american slave owners often treated their slaves brutally and provided inadequate food shelter clothing and medical care.
as a result infant mortality rates for slave children were twice those of white children.
life expectancy for whites in the south was between 40 and 43 years which was lower than that in other parts of the country but the average slave lived ten years less even than that.
fanny kemble the wife of planter pierce butler described the slave quarters on her husbands plantation in stark terms these cabins consist of one room about twelve feet by thirteen.
two families together numbering sometimes eight or ten reside in one of these huts which are mere wooden frames wealthier planters sometimes built sturdier framed houses with wooden floors or even brick houses for their slaves.
the oppressive nature of slavery also shaped family life.
although southern law did not recognize the legality of slave marriages many slave men and why did so many slaves marry slaves living on other plantations.
women sought to form stable family relationships.
slaves developed their own marriage rituals to seal their unions.
the most common was jumping the broom which derived from traditional african marriage practices.
relatives or close friends of the bride and groom held opposite ends of a broom about a foot off the ground and the couple would jump together over it as a symbol of their union.
planters encouraged slaves to marry because married slaves were less likely to run away.
the offspring of slave marriages also provided planters with additional laborers.
on larger plantations a slave family might reside together.
on smaller plantations and farms husbands and wives might reside on neighboring plantations.
such abroad marriages were common.
visiting a spouse under these circumstances required permission and husbands might see their families only once a week.
the slave family included extended kin such as uncles aunts and most important grandparents all of whom helped rear children.
slave religion and music during the 1830s southern churches launched a major effort to convert slaves to christianity.
in proselytizing slaves white ministers stressed the conservative elements of christian theology often forbidding slaves from dancing during religious services and reminding them of the passages in the bible that demanded slaves obey their masters.
a popular catechism for colored persons for example instructed slaves to count their masters worthy of all honour as those whom god has placed over them in the world but efforts to use religion to instill docility in slaves largely failed.
rather than accept their masters vision of christianity african americans recast it to suit their own needs as slaves and articulate their hopes.
the biblical story of the exodus which told of the flight of the israelites from slavery in egypt was particularly popular.
god was working for their deliverance a georgia slave commented and would deliver them from bondage as sure as the children of israel were delivered from egyptian bondage african americans created covert churches called brush arbors or hush arbors to practice their version of the faith.
slaves also borrowed elements from african religions creating a distinctive african american religious culture.
white observers were perplexed by the ring shout an ecstatic form of worship that mixed african religious practice with christian beliefs describing its chanting as weird or droning and its dance as wild and barbaric yet to the enslaved the ring hear the audio file go down moses life and labor under slavery shouts rhythmic circle dance involving joined hands counterclockwise movement to a steady beat hand clapping and free form upper body movements became an important religious ritual.
funeral practices also reflected this fusion of african and christian rituals.
slaves often scattered broken ceramics over a grave a practice carried over from african burial practices.
a maryland observer of a funeral noted that the body was interred with a miniature canoe and paddle.
the slaves explained that this would allow the spirit to cross the ocean and return to africa.
because slaves toiled in the fields during the day their funerals typically took place at night.
torchlight processions to gravesites accompanied by drumming and other african inflected music and chants unsettled white observers.
still some whites as this painting of a slave preacher leading a funeral service 9 17 shows overcame their cultural bias and appreciated the beauty of slave burials.
barely discernible between the two trees in the bottom corner of the painting are the plantation master and mistress.
they are a visual reminder that slaves were never completely free from the watchful eye of their masters.
spirituals a distinctive musical art form created by slaves drew heavily on biblical themes.
the figure of moses and the plight of the ancient hebrews who were delivered from slavery were two common themes.
slave spirituals also featured images of crossing over the river jordan to freedom in this life or redemption in the next.
music was also important in other aspects of slave culture.
slaves used song to preserve african traditions help relieve the monotony of work entertain or even communicate cryptic messages to other slaves.
when slaves went around singing steal away to jesus a former slave recalled it not only affirmed the hope of redemption but often signaled others that there would be a religious meeting that night virtually every major form of modern popular music jazz gospel blues rock and roll and hiphop derive in part from musical traditions rooted in the experience of american or new world slavery.
resistance and revolt slaves developed a complex range of behaviors to resist the harsh discipline forced on them.
many used subtle tactics to thwart their owners because they minimized the chances for punishment.
slaves feigned illness broke tools and slowed their pace of work to fight back against their economic exploitation.
another means of resistance was flight.
typically runaways left only for short periods seeking a respite from servitude or to visit kin and spouses on neighboring plantations.
less frequently slaves sought to gain their freedom by fleeing to free territory in the north or in canada.
in the deep south some slaves fled to indian territory or to swamps to escape detection.
in a few celebrated cases slaves devised daring methods of escape.
the most extreme form of resistance was insurrection.
in 1831 nat turner led the largest slave uprising in american history.
a lay preacher turner had a vision of a battle between white spirits and blacks spirits that would commence when the sun was darkened he believed that the solar eclipse in 1831 was a divine sign that the time for insurrection was ripe.
nat turners rebellion lasted two days and attracted between 60 and 80 slaves before authorities subdued the rebels.
before the carnage ended 55 whites were killed and as many african americans.
this woodcut from a contemporary account of the rebellion written by a supporter of slavery depicts the rebels unsympathetically about to attack defenseless women and children and the efforts of whites to defend their loved ones as 9 17 plantation burial while a slave preacher leads a funeral service the plantation master and mistress are visible in the woods between the two trees in the lower right corner of the painting.
why did biblical themes from the story of the exodus figure so prominently in slave spirituals.

although laws varied from state to spiritual steal away to jesus heroic 9 18.
the bottom of the image shows the militia riding to rescue these helpless victims.
many northerners however viewed nat turner as a righteous and heroic warrior against the evil of slavery.
after the rebellion southern states enacted more repressive laws to prevent another revolt.
these laws prevented african americans from preaching and limited the access of free blacks to firearms.
states also strengthened their militias and made assaults by slaves against whites capital offenses.
on the other hand the virginia legislature debated abolishing slavery before voting 73 to 58 against a proposal to end it.
state slave codes generally accorded slaves minimal rights.
these laws curtailed the movements of slaves forbidding them to travel without written permission from their masters.
laws also proscribed teaching slaves to read or write.
slaves had no right to testify in court and planters served as both judge and jury on their plantations meting out punishment.
on rare occasions a slave did obtain a day in court as when a south carolina court ruled that a slave could not be tried for the same crime twice an application of the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy that was a bedrock of american law.
despite such modest protections however slaves still enjoyed only the slimmest legal protection and remained at the mercy of their masters see choices and consequences conscience or duty.

life and labor under slavery choices and consequences conscience or duty.
justice ruffins quandary in 1829 chief justice thomas ruffin of the north carolina supreme court issued his opinion in state v mann a case involving an assault on a slave named lydia by john mann.
lydias owner elizabeth jones instigated the case against mann slaves had no legal standing to bring charges for wounding her slave.
mann had rented lydia from jones and the law recognized that as a temporary owner he did not have the same long term interests in protecting his property.
thus although mann was legally entitled to discipline lydia his power over her was more limited than that of her legal owner.
when mann tried to discipline lydia she ran off.
mann then shot and wounded her.
rather than try to recover monetary damages in a civil trial an option precluded because mann was too poor to pay damages lydias owner pursued criminal charges.
a lower court convicted mann of an assault and battery on lydia and mann then appealed the case to the state supreme court.
state v mann explored legal questions at the heart of slavery.
in deciding how to handle the case justice ruffin faced difficult choices.
choices uphold manns conviction and affirm that the doctrine that a temporary masters power to discipline was limited overrule the lower court and assert that mann had the same legal authority as lydias owner including the right to punish disobedience and affirm that a masters power over slaves was unlimited decide the case on the narrowest grounds possible.
affirm the lower court ruling and avoid sweeping statements about the nature of the masters powers by focusing squarely on the facts the excessive use of force by a disreputable person with a history of violence.
decision ruffin chose to overrule the lower court.
although tempted to sympathize with the plight of slaves and offer them legal protections he argued that the law denied them such protections the power of the master must be absolute to render the submission of the slave perfect to bestow on slaves basic rights would undermine slavery itself.
consequences woodcut image of master shooting slave within five years in state v will ruffins fellow justices partially repudiated his decision.
the case did not dispute ruffins major premise that a slave must be totally submissive but it rejected his claim that the only means to accomplish this goal was to give the master total power.
the court accepted that the masters power was limited and the use of excessive or lethal force to discipline a slave was not protected by the law of slavery.
continuing controversies what role did ideas of justice play in justice ruffins understanding of the rule of law.
most modern scholars agree that the decision in state v mann reflects the fundamental immorality of slavery.
but the controversy over the decision focuses on a more basic question about law itself.
does law simply reflect the dominant power relations of society.
or can the law embody ideals of justice or fairness that are not simply a mask to disguise the naked exercise of power.
ruffins decision reinforced the power of the planter class and many view it as vindicating those who believe that the law is a tool that enables the powerful the masters to dominate the weak the slaves.
however ruffins anguish and the later ruling in state v will might be seen as proof that the rule of law does impose constraints on the powerful.
does the law of slavery support the claim that the law is a tool of the powerful or a constraint on them.
