296 chapter 11 before but only about 2 percent of the value of the raw cotton exported that year.
to the degree that the south developed a nonfarm commercial sector it was largely to serve the needs of the plantation economy.
particularly important were the brokers or factors who marketed the planters crops.
these merchants tended to live in such towns as new orleans charleston mobile and savannah where they worked to find buyers for cotton and other crops and where they purchased goods for the planters they served.
the south had only a very rudimentary financial system and the factors often also served the planters as bankers providing them with credit.
planters frequently accumulated substantial debts particularly during periods when cotton prices were in decline and the southern merchant bankers thus became figures of considerable influence and importance in the region.
there were also substantial groups of professional 1820 areas of cotton production slave distribution one dot approximates 200 slaves slavery and cotton in the south 1820 and 1860 these two maps show the remarkable spread of cotton cultivation in the south in the decades before the civil war.
both maps show the areas of cotton cultivation the green colored areas as well as areas with large slave populations the brown dotted areas.
note how in the top map which represents 1820 cotton production is concentrated largely in the east with a few areas scattered among alabama mississippi louisiana and tennessee.
slavery is most concentrated along the georgia and south carolina coast areas in which long staple cotton was grown with only a few other areas of highly dense slave populations.
by 1860 the south had changed dramatically.
cotton production had spread throughout the lower south from texas to northern florida and slavery had moved with it.
slavery was also much denser in the tobacco growing regions of virginia and north carolina which had also grown.

in most parts of the region however they too were closely tied to and dependent on the plantation economy.
however important manufacturers merchants and professionals might have been to southern society they were relatively unimportant in comparison with the manufacturers merchants and professionals of the north on whom southerners were coming more and more and increasingly unhappily to depend.
the primitive character of the regions banking system matched a lack of development in other basic services and structures necessary for industrial development.
perhaps most notable was the souths inadequate transportation system.
in the north in the antebellum period enormous sums were invested in roads canals and above all railroads to knit the region together into an integrated market.
in the south there were no such investments.
canals were almost nonexistent most roads were crude and unsuitable for heavy transport and railroads although they expanded substantially in the 1840s and 1850s inadequate regional transportation system failed to tie the region together effectively.
such towns as charleston atlanta savannah and norfolk had direct connections with memphis and thus with the northwest and richmond was connected via the virginia central with the memphis and charleston railroad.
in addition several independent lines furnished a continuous connection between the ohio river and new orleans.
most of the south however remained unconnected to the national railroad system.
most lines in the region were short and local.
the principal means of transportation was water.
planters generally shipped their crops to market along rivers or by sea most manufacturing was in or near port towns.
perceptive southerners recognized the economic subordination of their region to the north.
from the rattle with which the nurse tickles the ear of the child born in the south to the shroud that covers the cold form of the dead everything comes to us from the north the arkansas journalist albert pike lamented.
perhaps the most prominent advocate of southern economic independence was james b d de bow a resident of new orleans.
he published a magazine advocating j t iph view of plantation lands along a stretch of the mississippi river between new orleans and baton rouge louisiana.

298 chapter 11 de bows review southern commercial and agricultural expansion de bows review which survived from its founding in 1846 until 1880.
de bow made his journal into a tireless advocate of southern economic independence from the north warning constantly of the dangers of the colonial relationship between the sections.
one writer noted in the pages of his magazine i think it would be safe to estimate the amount which is lost to us annually by our vassalage to the north at 100 000 000.
great god yet de bows review was itself evidence of the dependency of the south on the north.
it was printed in new york because no new orleans printer had facilities adequate for the task it was filled with advertisements from northern manufacturing firms and its circulation was always modest in comparison with those of northern publications.
in charleston for example it sold an average of 173 copies per issue harpers magazine of new york in contrast regularly sold 1 500 copies to south carolinians.
reasons for colonial dependency sources of southern difference despite this growing concern about the region s colonial dependency the south made few serious efforts to build an economy that might challenge its dependency.
an important question about antebellum southern history therefore is why the region did so little to develop a larger industrial and commercial economy of its own.
why did it remain so different from the north.
part of the reason was the great profitability of the south s agricultural system particularly of cotton production.
in the northeast many people had turned to manufacturing as the agricultural economy of the region declined.
in the south the agricultural economy was booming and ambitious people eager to profit from the emerging capitalist economy had little incentive to look beyond it.
another reason was that wealthy southerners had so much capital invested in their land and particularly their slaves they had little left for other investments.
some historians have suggested that the southern climate with its long hot steamy summers was less suitable for industrial development than the climate of the north.
still others have claimed that southern work habits perhaps a reflection of the debilitating effects of the climate impeded industrialization some white southerners appeared at least to many northern observers not to work very hard to lack the strong work ethic that fueled northern economic development.
but the southern failure to create a flourishing commercial or industrial economy was also in part the result of a set of values distinctive to the south that discouraged the growth of cities and industry.
many white southerners liked to think of them the cavalier selves as representatives of a special way of image based on traditional values of chivalry leisure and elegance.
white southerners were they argued cavaliers people happily free from the base acquisitive instincts of the yankees to their north.
southern white people were they believed more concerned with a refined and gracious way of life than with rapid growth and development.
appealing as the cavalier image was to southern whites however it conformed to the reality of southern society in very limited ways.
white society in the south only a small minority of southern whites owned slaves.
in 1850 when the total white population of the south was over 6 million the number of slaveholders was only 347 525.
in 1860 when the white population was just above 8 million the number of slaveholders had risen to only 383 637.
these figures are somewhat misleading since each slaveholder was normally the head of a family averaging five members.
but even with all members of slaveowning families included in the figures those owning slaves still amounted to perhaps no more than one quarter of the white population.
and of the minority of whites holding slaves only a small proportion owned them in substantial numbers.
the planter class planter aristocracy how then did the south come to be seen both by the outside world and by many southerners themselves as a society dominated by great plantations and wealthy landowning planters.
in large part it was because the planter aristocracy the cotton magnates the sugar rice and tobacco nabobs the whites who owned at least forty or fifty slaves and 800 or more acres exercised power and influence far in excess of their numbers.
they stood at the apex of society determining the political economic and even social life of their region.
enriched by vast annual incomes dwelling in palatial homes surrounded by broad acres and many black servants they became a class to which all other southerners deferred.
the wealthiest planters also maintained homes in towns or cities and spent several months of the year there engaged in a glittering social life.
others traveled widely especially to europe as an antidote to the isolation of plantation life.
and many used their plantations to host opulent social events.
white southerners liked to compare their planter class to the old upper classes of england and europe true aristocracies long entrenched.
in fact however the southern upper class was in most cases not at all similar to the landed aristocracies of the old world.
in some areas of the upper south the tidewater region of virginia for example some of the great aristocrats were indeed people whose families had occupied positions of wealth and power for generations.
in most of the south however a long standing landed aristocracy although central to the cavalier image was largely a myth.
even the most important planters in the cotton growing areas of the south were typically new to their wealth and power.
as late as cotton slavery and the old south 299 the 1850s many of the great landowners in the lower south were still first generation settlers who had arrived with only modest resources struggled for years to clear land and develop a plantation in what was at first a rugged wilderness and only recently had started to live in the comfort and luxury for which they became famous.
large areas of the old south as americans later called the south of the pre civil war era had been settled and cultivated for less than two decades at the time of the civil war.
nor was the world of the planter nearly as leisured and genteel as the cavalier myth would suggest.
growing staple crops was a business that was in its own way just as competitive and just as risky as the industrial enterprises of the north.
plantation planters had to supervise their operations management carefully if they hoped to make a profit.
they were in many respects just as much competitive capitalists as the industrialists of the north whose lifestyles they claimed to hold in contempt.
even many affluent planters lived modestly their wealth so heavily invested in land and slaves that there was little left for personal comfort.
and white planters even some substantial ones tended to move frequently as new and presumably more productive areas opened up to cultivation.
indeed it may have been the very newness and precariousness of the plantation way of life and the differences between the reality of that life and the image of it that made many southern planters determined to portray themselves as genteel aristocrats.
having struggled so hard to reach and maintain their positions they were all the more determined to defend them.
perhaps that was why the defense of slavery and of the south s tights was stronger in the new booming regions of the lower south and weaker in the more established and less flourishing areas of the tidewater.
wealthy southern whites sustained their image of themselves as aristocrats in many ways.

n arby whym bi slaves be unha but s 300 chapter 11 for men raised in a culture in which medieval knights as portrayed in the novels of walter scott were a powerful and popular image.
the aristocratic ideal also found reflection in the definition of a special role for southern white women.
honor above all perhaps white males adopted an elaborate code of chivalry which obligated them to defend their honor often through dueling which survived in the south long after it had largely vanished in the north.
southern white males placed enormous stock in conventional forms of courtesy and respect in their dealings with one another perhaps to distance themselves from the cruelty and disrespect that were so fundamental to the slave system they controlled.
violations of such forms often brought what seemed to outsiders a disproportionately heated and even violent response.
the idea of honor in the south was only partly connected to the idea of ethical behavior and bravery.
it was also tied to the importance among white males of the public appearance of dignity and authority of saving face in the presence of others.
anything that seemed to challenge the dignity social station or manhood of a white southern male might be the occasion for a challenge to duel or at least for a stern public rebuke when the south carolina congressman preston brooks strode into the chamber of the united states senate and savagely beat senator charles sumner of massachusetts with a cane to retaliate for what he considered an insult to a relative he was acting wholly in accord with the idea of southern honor.
in the north he was reviled as a savage.
in the south he became a popular hero.
but brooks was only the most public example of a code of behavior that many white southern men fol cult of honor lowed.
avenging insults was a social necessity in many parts of southern society and avenging insults to white southern women was perhaps the most important obligation of a white southern gentleman the southern lady in some respects affluent white women in the south occupied roles very similar to those of middle class white women in the north.
their lives generally centered in the home where they served as companions to and hostesses for their husbands and as nurturing mothers for their children.
even less frequently than in the north did genteel southern white women engage in public activities or find income producing employment.

the artist represents the self consciously elegant life of cotton slavery and the old south 301 but the life of the southern lady was also in many ways very different from that of her northern counterpart.
for one thing the cult of honor in the region meant in theory that southern white men gave particular importance to the defense subordinate w0ln in police this generally meant status of w lte men were even more dominant women an white women even more subordinate in southern culture than they were in the north.
george fitzhugh one of the souths most important social theorists wrote in the 1850s women like children have but one right and that is the right to protection.
the right to protection involves the obligation to obey more important in determining the role of southern white women however were the social and economic realities in which they lived.
the vast majority of females in the region lived on farms isolated from people outside their own families with virtually no access to the public world and thus few opportunities to look beyond their roles as wives and mothers.
because the family was the principal economic unit on most farms the dominance of husbands and fathers over wives and children was even greater than in those northern families in which income producing activities had moved out of the home and into the factory or office.
for many white women living on farms of modest size meant a fuller engagement in the economic life of the family than was becoming typical for middle class women in the north.
these women engaged in spinning weaving and other production they participated in agricultural tasks they helped supervise the slave workforce.
on some of the larger plantations however even these limited roles were sometimes considered unsuitable for white women and the plantation mistress became in some cases more an ornament for her husband than an active part of the economy or the society.

nothing in this picture suggests anything like the k ease and luxury often associated with plantation life in popular mythology at the time since the life and adventures of jonathan jefferson whitlaw by frances trollope 1836 southern white women also had less access to education than their northern counterparts.
nearly a quarter of all white women over twenty were completely illiterate relatively few women had more than a rudimentary exposure to schooling.
even wealthy planters were not interested in extensive schooling for their daughters.
the few female academies in the south trained women primarily to be suitable wives.
southern white women had other special burdens as well.
the southern white birth rate remained nearly 20 percent higher than that of the nation as a whole and burdens infant mortality in the region remained higher than elsewhere nearly half the children born in the south in 1860 died before they reached five years of age.
the slave labor system had a mixed impact on white women.
it helped spare many of them from certain kinds of arduous labor but it also threatened their relationships with their husbands.
male slaveowners had frequent sexual relationships with the female slaves on their plantations the children of those unions became part of the plantation labor force and served as a constant reminder to white women of their husbands infidelity.
black women and men were obviously the most important victims of such practices.
but white women suffered too.
a few southern white women rebelled against their roles and against the prevailing assumptions of their region.
some became outspoken abolitionists and joined northerners in the crusade to abolish slavery.
some agitated for other reforms within the south itself.
most white women however found few outlets for whatever discontent they may have felt with their lives.
instead they generally convinced themselves of the benefits of their position and even more fervently than southern white men defended the special virtues of the southern way of life.
upper class white women in the south were particularly energetic in defending the class lines that separated them from poorer whites.
the plain folk the typical white southerner was not a great planter and slaveholder but a modest yeoman farmer.
some of these plain folk as they have become known owned a few slaves with whom they worked and lived far more closely than did the larger planters.
most in fact three quarters of all white families owned no slaves.
some plain folk most of whom owned their own land devoted themselves largely to subsistence farming others grew cotton or other crops for the market but usually could not produce enough to allow them to expand their operations or even get out of debt.
during the 1850s the number of nonslaveholding landowners increased much faster than the number of slaveholding landowners.
while there were occasional examples of poor farmers moving into the ranks of the planter class such cases were rare.
most yeomen knew that they had little prospect of substantially bettering their lot.
one reason was the southern educational system which provided poor whites with few opportunities to learn and thus limited their chances of advancement.
for the sons of wealthy planters the region provided ample opportunities to gain an 302 chapter 11 education.
in 1860 there were 260 southern colleges and universities public and private with 25 000 students enrolled in them or more than half the total number of educational students in the united states.
but universi opportunities ties were within the reach of only the upper class.
the elementary and secondary schools of the south were not only fewer but also inferior to those of the northeast although not much worse than the crude schools of the northwest and a higher proportion of whites were illiterate than in other parts of the country.
that a majority of the souths white population consisted of modest farmers largely excluded from the dominant plantation society raises another important question about the antebellum south.
why did the plain folk have so little power in the public world of the old south.
why did they not oppose the aristocratic social system in which they shared so little.
why did they not resent the system of slavery from which they generally did not benefit.
some nonslaveowning whites did oppose the planter elite but for the most part in limited ways and in a relatively few isolated areas.
these were southern highlanders the hill hill people peop e w lived in the appalachian ranges east of the mississippi in the ozarks to the west of the river and in other hill country or backcountry areas cut off from the commercial world of the plantation system.
of all southern whites they were the most isolated from the mainstream of the regions life.
they practiced a simple form of subsistence agriculture owned practically no slaves and had a proud sense of seclusion.
they were in most respects unconnected to the new commercial economy that dominated the great cotton planting region of the south.
they produced almost no surplus for the market had little access to money and often bartered for the goods they could not grow themselves.
to such men and women slavery was unattractive for many of the same reasons it was unappealing to workers and small farmers in the north because it threatened their sense of their own independence.
hill country farmers lived in a society defined by individual personal freedom and unusual isolation from modern notions of property.
they also held to older political ideals which for many included the ideal of fervent loyalty to the nation.
such whites frequently expressed animosity toward the planter aristocracy of the other regions of the south.
the mountain region was the only part of the south to defy the trend toward sectional conformity and the only part to resist the movement toward secession when it finally developed.
even during the civil war many hill country southerners refused to support the confederacy some even fought for the union.
far greater in number however were the nonslaveowning whites who lived in the midst of the plantation system.
many perhaps most of them accepted that system because they were tied to it in important ways.
small farmers depended on the local plantation aristocracy for many things access to cotton gins markets for their modest crops and their livestock credit or other financial assistance.
in many areas there were also extensive kinship close relations with the plantation aristocracy networks linking lower and upper class whites.
the poorest resident of a county might be a cousin of the richest aristocrat.
together these mutual ties helped mute what might otherwise have been pronounced class tensions.
small farmers felt tied to the plantation society in other ways as well.
for white men at least the south was an unusually democratic society in that participation in politics both through voting and through attending campaign meetings and barbecues was even more widespread than in the north where participation was also high.
just as political participation gave workers in the north a sense of connection to the social order so it did for farmers in the south although officeholders in the south even more than in the north were almost always members of the regions elites.
in the 1850s moreover the boom in the cotton economy allowed many small farmers to improve their economic fortunes.
some bought more land became slaveowners and moved into at least the fringes of plantation society.
others simply felt more secure in their positions as independent yeomen and hence more likely to embrace the fierce regional loyalty that was spreading throughout the white south in these years.
small farmers even more than great planters were also committed to a traditional male dominated family structure.
their household centered economies required the participation of all family members and they believed a stable system commitment of gender relarions to ensure order and sta to bility.
men were the unquestioned masters paternalism of their homes women and children who were both family and workforce were firmly under the masters control.
as the northern attack on slavery increased in the 1840s and 1850s it was easy for such farmers to believe and easy for ministers politicians and other propagandists for slavery to persuade them that an assault on one hierarchical system slavery would open the way to an assault on another such system patriarchy.
there were other white southerners however who did not share in the plantation economy in even limited ways and yet continued to accept its premises.
these were the members of a particularly degraded class numbering perhaps a half million in 1850 known to other classes variously and demeaningly as crackers sand hillers or poor white trash a phrase used as a chapter title in harriet beecher stowes uncle tom s cabin.
occupying the infertile lands of the pine barrens the red hills and the swamps they lived in miserable cabins amid genuine destitution.
many owned no land or owned land on which nothing could be grown and supported themselves by foraging or hunting.
others worked as common laborers for their neighbors although the slave system limited their opportunities.
their degradation resulted partly from dietary deficiencies and disease.
some resorted at times to eating clay hence the tendency of affluent whites to refer to them disparagingly as clay eaters and they suffered from pellagra hookworm and malaria.
planters and small farmers alike held them in contempt they formed a true underclass.
in some material respects their plight was worse than that of the african american slaves who themselves often looked down on the poor whites.
cotton slavery and the old south 303 yet even among these southerners the true outcasts of white society in the region there was no real opposition to limited class plantatin system or slavery.
in part conflict undoubtedly this was because these men and women were so benumbed by poverty that they had little strength to protest.
but their relative passivity resulted also from perhaps the single greatest unifying factor among the southern white population the one force that was most responsible for reducing tensions among the various classes their perception of race.
however poor and miserable these white southerners were they could still consider themselves members of a ruling race they could still look down on the black population of the region and feel a bond with their fellow whites born of a determination to maintain their racial supremacy.
as frederick law olmsted a northerner who visited the south and chronicled southern society in the 1850s wrote from childhood the one thing in their condition which has made life valuable to the mass of whites has been that the niggers are yet their inferiors slavery the peculiar institution white southerners often referred to slavery as the peculiar institution by that they meant not that the institution was odd but that it was distinctive special.
the description was apt for american slavery was indeed distinctive.
the south in the mid nineteenth century was the only area in the western world except for brazil cuba and puerto rico where slavery still existed.
slavery more than any other single factor isolated the south from the rest of american society.
and as that isolation increased so did the commitment of southerners to defend the institution.
within the south itself the institution of slavery had paradoxical results.
on the one hand it isolated blacks from whites drawing a sharp and inviolable racial line dividing one group of southerners from another.
as a result african americans under slavery began to develop a society and culture of their own one unrelated to the white civilization around them.
on the other hand slavery created a unique bond between blacks and whites masters and slaves in the south.
the two groups may have maintained separate spheres but each sphere was deeply influenced by indeed dependent on the other.
varieties of slavery slavery was an institution established and regulated in detail by law.
the slave codes of the southern states forbade slaves to hold property to leave their masters premises without permission to be out after dark to congregate with other slaves except at church to carry firearms or to strike a white person even in self defense.
the codes of some states prohib ited whites from teaching slaves to read legal basis of or write and denied slaves the right to slavery testify in cqurc against white people.
the laws contained no provisions to legalize slave marriages or divorces.
if an owner killed a slave while punishing him the act was generally not considered a crime.
slaves however faced the death penalty for killing or even resisting a white person and for inciting revolt.
the codes also contained extraordinarily rigid provisions for defining a persons race.
anyone with even a trace of african ancestry was defined as black.
and anyone even rumored to possess any such trace was presumed to be black unless he or she could prove otherwise which was of course almost impossible to do.
these and dozens of other restrictions might seem to suggest that slaves lived under a uniformly harsh and dismal regime.
had the laws been rigidly enforced that might have been the case.
in fact however enforcement was spotty and uneven.
some slaves did acquire property did learn to read and write and did assemble with other slaves in spite of laws to the contrary.
although the major slave offenses generally fell under the jurisdiction of the courts and thus of the slave codes white owners handled most transgressions and in flicted widely varying punishments.
in reality of.
slavery other words despite the rigid provisions of law there was in reality considerable variety within the slave system.
some blacks lived in almost prisonlike conditions rigidly and harshly controlled by their masters.
many probably most others enjoyed some flexibility and at least in comparison to the regimen prescribed by law a significant degree of autonomy.
most masters possessed very few slaves and their experience with and image of slavery was a reflection of the special nature of slavery on the small farm.
white farmers with few slaves generally supervised their workers directly and often worked closely alongside them.
on such farms blacks and whites developed a form of intimacy unknown on larger plantations.
the paternal relationship between such masters and their slaves could like relationships between fathers and children be warm and affectionate.
it could also be tyrannical and cruel.
in either case it was a relationship based on the relative powerlessness of the slaves.
although the majority of slaveowners were small farmers the majority of slaves lived on plantations of medium or large size with sizable slave workforces.
substantial planters often hired overseers and even assistant overseers to represent them.
head drivers trusted and responsible slaves often assisted by several subdrivers acted under the overseer as foremen.
larger planters generally used one of two methods of assigning slave labor.
one was the task system most common in rice culture under which slaves were as task and.
r gang systems signed a particular task in the morning for example hoeing one acre after completing the job they were free for the rest of the day.
the other far more common was the gang system employed on the cotton sugar and tobacco plantations under which slaves were simply divided into groups each of them directed by a driver and compelled to work for as many hours as the overseer considered a reasonable workday.

archive photos getty images life under slavery slaves generally received at least enough necessities to enable them to live and work.
their masters usually furnished them with an adequate if mostly coarse diet consisting mainly of cornmeal salt pork molasses and on special occasions fresh meat or poultry.
many slaves cultivated gardens for their own use.
they received cheap clothing and shoes.
they lived in crude cabins called slave quarters usually clustered in a complex near the masters house.
the plantation mistress or a doctor retained by the owner provided some medical care but slave women themselves as healers and midwives or simply as mothers were the more important source.
slaves worked hard beginning with light tasks as children.
their workdays were longest at harvest time.
slave women worked particularly hard.
they generally labored in the fields with the men and they assumed as well the crucial chores traditionally reserved for women cooking special position of women cleaning and child rearing.
because slave families were often divided with husbands and fathers frequently living on neighboring plantations or at times sold to plantation owners far away black women often found themselves acting in effect as single parents.
within the slave family therefore women had special burdens but also a special authority.
slaves were as a group much less healthy than southern whites.
after 1808 when the international slave trade became high slave ihegal in america the proportion of blacks mortality t0 whites steadily declined.
in 1820 there rates was one african american to every four whites in 1840 one to every five.
the slower increase of the black population was a result of its comparatively high death rate.
slave mothers had large families but the enforced poverty in which virtually all african americans lived ensured that fewer of their children would survive to adulthood than the children of white parents.
even those who did survive typically died at a younger age than the average white person.
cotton slavery and the old south 305 even so according to some scholars the actual material conditions of slavery may have been better than those of some northern factory workers and better than those of both peasants and industrial workers in much of nineteenth century europe.
the conditions of american slaves were certainly less severe than those of slaves in the caribbean and south america crops which required more arduous labor.
sugar production in the caribbean islands in particular involved extraordinarily backbreaking work and a high risk of fatal tropical diseases.
caribbean and south american planters continued to use the african slave trade well into the nineteenth century to replenish their labor supply so they had less incentive than american planters who no longer had access to that trade to protect their existing laborers.
growing cotton the principal activity for most slaves in the united states was much less debilitating than growing sugar and planters had strong economic incentives to maintain a healthy slave population.
one result of this was that america became the only country where a slave population actually increased through natural reproduction although it grew much more slowly than the white population.
most masters did make some effort to preserve the health and thus the usefulness of their slaves.
one example was the frequent practice of protecting slave children from hard work until early adolescence.
masters believed that doing so would nursing the masters child this photograph shows a black slave woman caring for a white child.
the image was taken in arkansas in 1855.
black women typ y cared for white children on plantations sometimes with great affection and sometimes this photograph may suggest dutifully and without enthusiasm.
the library of co g lc uszc4 5251 make young slaves more loyal and would also ensure better health as adults.
another example was the use of hired labor when available for the most unhealthy or dangerous tasks.
a traveler in louisiana noted for example that irishmen were employed to clear malarial swamps and to handle cotton bales at the bottom of chutes extending from the river bluff down to a boat landing.
if an irish worker died of disease or in an accident a master could hire another for a dollar a day or less.
but a master would lose an investment of perhaps 1 000 or more if a prime field hand died.
still cruel masters might forget their pocketbooks in the heat of anger.
slaves were often left to the discipline of overseers who had less of an economic stake in their well being overseers were paid in proportion to the amount of work they could get out of the slaves they supervised.
household servants had a somewhat easier life physically at least than did field hands.
on a small plantation the same slaves might do both field work and housework.
but on a house slaves large estate there would generally be a sep arate domestic staff nursemaids housemaids cooks butlers coachmen.
these people lived close to the master and his family eating the leftovers from the family table and in some cases even sleeping in the big house between the blacks and whites of such households affectionate almost familial relationships might sometimes develop.
more often however house servants resented their isolation from their fellow slaves and the lack of privacy that came with living in such close proximity to the masters family.
among other things that proximity meant that their transgressions were more visible than those of field hands and so they received punishments more often than did other slaves.
when emancipation came after the civil war it was often the house servants who were the first to leave the plantations of their former owners.
female household servants were especially vulnerable to sexual abuse by their masters and white overseers who sometimes pressured them into supposedly consensual sexual relationships and sometimes raped them.
in addition to unwanted sexual attention from white men female slaves often received vindictive treatment from white women.
plantation mistresses naturally resented the sexual liaisons between their husbands and female slaves.
punishing their husbands was not usually possible so they often punished the slaves instead with arbitrary beatings increased workloads and various forms of psychological torment.
sexual abuse slavery in the cities the conditions of slavery in the cities differed significantly from those in the countryside.
on relatively isolated plantations slaves had little contact with free blacks and lower class whites and masters maintained direct and effective control a deep and seemingly unbridgeable chasm yawned between slavery and freedom.
in the city however a master often could not supervise his slaves closely and at the same time use them debating the past io the character of slavery kt a ssue n american history has produced a richer literature or a more spirited debate than jai u the nature of american slavery.
the debate began even before the civil war when abolitionists strove to expose slavery to the world as a brutal dehumanizing institution while southern defenders of slavery tried to depict it as a benevolent paternalistic system.
but by the late nineteenth century as historian david blight noted in race and reunion 2002 with white americans eager for sectional conciliation both northern and southern chroniclers of slavery began to accept a romanticized and unthreatening picture of the old south and its peculiar institution.
the first major scholarly examination of slavery was ulrich b phillips s american negro slavery 1918 which portrayed slavery as an essentially benign institution in which kindly masters looked after submissive childlike and generally contented african americans.
phillips s apologia for slavery remained the authoritative work on the subject for nearly thirty years.
challenges to phillips began to emerge in the 1940s as concern about racial injustice increasingly engaged the attention of white americans.
in 1941 melville j herskovits challenged phillips s contention that black americans retained little of their african cultural inheritance in 1943 herbert aptheker published a chronicle of slave revolts as a way of refuting phillips s claim that blacks were submissive and content.
a somewhat different challenge to phillips emerged in the 1950s from historians who emphasized the brutality of the institution.
kenneth stampp s the peculiar institution 1956 and stanley elkinss slavery 1959 described a labor system that did serious physical and psychological damage to its victims.
stampp and especially elkins portrayed slavery as something like a prison in which men and women had no space in which to develop their own social and cultural lives.
in the 1970s new scholarship on slavery focused on slaves striking success in building a culture of their own despite their enslavement.
john blassingame in 1973 argued that the most remarkable aspect of the whole process of enslavement is the extent to which the american born slaves were able to retain their ancestors culture.
herbert gutman in the black family in slavery and freedom 1976 challenged the prevailing belief that slavery had weakened and even destroyed the african american family.
on the contrary he argued the black family survived slavery with impressive strength eugene genovese s roll jordan fto 1974 and other works revealed how african americans manipulated the paternalist assumptions at the heart of slavery to build a large cultural space of their own within the system where they could develop their own family life social traditions and religious patterns.
that same year robert fogel and stanley engerman published their profitably.
even if they slept at night in carefully watched backyard barracks slaves moved about during the day alone performing errands of various kinds.
thus urban slaves gained numerous opportunities to mingle with free blacks and with whites.
in the cities the line between slavery and freedom became increasingly indistinct.
there was a considerable market in the south for common laborers particularly since unlike in the north there were few autonomy of european immigrants to perform menial urban slaves chores.
even the poorest whites tended to prefer working on farms to doing ordinary labor and so masters often hired out slaves for such tasks.
slaves on contract worked in mining and lumbering often far from cities but others worked on the docks and on construction sites drove wagons and performed other unskilled jobs in cities and towns.
slave women and children worked in the regions few textile mills.
particularly skilled workers such as blacksmiths or carpenters were also often hired out.
many white southerners considered slavery to be incom patible with city life and as southern cities grew the number of slaves in them declined relatively if not absolutely.
fearing conspiracies and insurrections many urban slaveowners sold off much of their male property to the countryside.
the remaining black women outnumbered black men.
the same cities also had more white men than women a situation that helped account for the birth of many mulattoes.
even while slavery in the cities was declining the forced segregation of urban blacks both free and slave from white society increased.
segregation was a means of social control intended to make up for the loosening of the discipline of slavery in urban areas.
free african americans there were about 250 000 free african americans in the slaveholding states by the start of the civil war more than half of them in virginia and maryland.
in some cases they were slaves who had somehow earned money with which they managed to buy their own and their families freedom usually by developing a skill they could market independently of their masters.
it was usually urban blacks with their greater freedom of movement and activity who could take that route.
one example was elizabeth keckley a slave woman who bought freedom for herself and her son with proceeds from sewing.
she later became a seamstress personal servant and companion to mary todd lincoln in the white house.
but few masters had any incentive or inclination to give up their slaves so this route was open to relatively few people.
306 the granger collection new york defined by their dual roles as members of the plantation workforce and anchors of the black family.
recent works by walter johnson and ira berlin mark at least a partial return to the damage thesis.
in soul by soul 2000 a study of the new orleans slave market johnson contends that for whites purchasing slaves was a way of fulfilling the middle class fantasy of success and independence but for the slaves themselves the trade was destructive and dehumanizing.
ira berlins many thousands gone 2000 generation of captivity 2003 and the making of african america 2010 similarly emphasize the dehumanizing character of the slave market and argue that slavery was less a social system than a commodification of human beings.
understand analyze and evaluate controversial time on the cross a highly quantitative study that supported some of the claims of gutman and genovese about black achievement but that went much further in portraying slavery as a successful and reasonably humane if ultimately immoral system.
slave workers they argued were better treated and lived in greater comfort than most northern industrial workers of the same era.
other scholarship on slavery has focused on the role of women within it.
elizabeth fox genovese s within the plantation household 1988 examined the lives of both white and black women on the plantation.
rejecting the claims of some feminist historians that black and white women shared a common female identity born of their shared subordination to men she portrayed slave women as 1.
why have scholarly studies of slavery interpreted the system so differently.
do the differing interpretations reflect general social attitudes of the period in which the studies were written.
why might the conclusions drawn by robert fogel and stanley engerman in time on the cross have provoked vehement criticism.
what might be some reasons for the resurgence of focus on the damage thesis of slavery as in the works by walter johnson and ira berlin.
tightened restrictions on free blacks some slaves were sometimes set free by a master who had moral qualms about slavery or by a master s will after his death for example the more than 400 slaves belonging to john randolph of roanoke freed in 1833.
from the 1830s on however state laws governing slavery became more rigid.
that was in part a response to the fears nat turners revolt see p 310 created among white southerners free blacks removed from close supervision by whites might generate more violence and rebellion than slaves.
it was also in part because the community of free blacks in southern cities was becoming larger and to whites more threatening a dangerous example to blacks still in slavery.
the rise of abolitionist agitation in the north and the fear that it would inspire slaves to rebel also persuaded southern whites to tighten their system.
the new laws made it more and more difficult and in some cases practically impossible for owners to set free or manumit their slaves all southern states forbade free african americans from entering.
arkansas even forced the freed slaves living there to leave.
a few free blacks generally those on the northern fringes of the slaveholding regions attained wealth and promi nence.
some owned slaves themselves usually relatives whom they had bought in order to ensure their ultimate emancipation.
in a few cities new orleans natchez charleston free black communities managed to flourish relatively unmolested by whites and with some economic stability.
most free blacks however lived in abject poverty under conditions worse than those of african americans in the north.
law or custom closed many occupations to them forbade them to assemble without white supervision and placed numerous other restraints on them.
they were only quasi free but they had all the burdens of freedom the necessity to support themselves to find housing to pay taxes.
yet great as were the hardships of freedom these blacks preferred them to slavery.
the slave trade the transfer of enslaved people from one part of the south to another was one of the most important and terrible consequences of slavery.
sometimes slaves moved to the new cotton slave lands in the company of their original own markets ers wh were mi8ratin8 themselves.
but more often the transfer occurred through the efforts of professional slave traders.
for shorter journeys slaves traveled on foot trudging in coffles of hundreds along dusty highways.
for transfers over longer distances the traders 307 308 chapter 11 i j the business of slavery the offices of slave dealers were familiar sights on the streets of pre civil war southern cities and towns.
they provide testimony to the way in which slavery was not just a social system but a business deeply woven into the fabric of southern economic life.
the library of congress conveyed slaves via river or ocean steamers.
central slave markets included natchez new orleans charleston and mobile.
in the 1840s and 1850s healthy young field hands could fetch between 500 and 1 700 depending on the fluctuations in the market.
the domestic slave trade essential to the growth and prosperity of the system was one of its most horrible aspects.
the trade dehumanized all who were involved in it.
it separated children from their parents and parents from each other.
even families who had long been together might be broken up by new owners in the division of the estate after an old master s death.
planters might deplore the trade but they eased their consciences by holding traders in contempt.
the foreign slave trade was usually badly conducted resulting in many people dying along the way.
although federal law had prohibited the importation of slaves from 1808 on some continued to be smuggled into the united states as late as the 1850s when the supply of slaves had become inadequate.
at the annual southern commercial conventions planters began to discuss the legal reopening of the trade.
if it is right to buy slaves in virginia and carry them to new orleans william l yancey of alabama asked his fellow delegates in 1858 why is it not right to buy them in cuba brazil or africa.
the convention that year voted to repeal all the laws against slave imports but the government never acted on its proposal.
the continued smuggling was not without resistance from the slaves themselves.
in 1839 a group of fifty three slaves in cuba took charge of the ship amistad that was transporting the foreign slave trade better to die than to be a white man s slave.
chicago history museum usa the bridgeman art library nven prec us h6 1396 received frm ur fathers res ed them to another part of cuba.
their goal was to sail back to their homeland in africa.
the slaves had no experience with sailing and they tried to compel the crew to steer them across the atlantic.
instead the ship sailed up the atlantic coast until it was captured by a ship of the united states revenue service.
many americans including president van buren thought the slaves should be returned to cuba.
but at the request of a group of abolitionists former president john quincy adams went before the supreme court to argue that they should be freed.
adams argued that the foreign slave trade was illegal and thus the amistad rebels could not be returned to slavery.
the court accepted his argument in 1841 and most of the former slaves were returned to africa with funding from american abolitionists.
two years later in 1841 another group of slaves revolted on board a ship and took control of it this time an american vessel bound from norfolk virginia to new orleans and steered it and its 135 slaves to the british bahamas where slavery was illegal and the slaves were given sanctuary.
such shipboard revolts were rare but they were symbols of the continued efforts by africans to resist slavery.
cotton slavery and the old south 309 slave resistance few issues have sparked as much debate among historians as the effects of slavery on the blacks themselves.
see debating the past pp.
slaveowners and many white americans after emancipation liked to argue that the slaves were generally content happy with their lot that may have been true in some cases.
but it is clear that the vast majority of southern blacks were not content with being slaves that they yearned for freedom even though most realized there was little they could do to secure it.
evidence for that conclusion can be found if nowhere else from the reaction of slaves when emancipation finally came.
virtually all reacted to freedom with joy and celebration few chose to remain in the service of the whites who had owned them before the civil war although most african americans remained for many years subservient to whites in one way or another.
rather than contented acceptance the dominant response of blacks to slavery was a complex one a combination of adaptation and resistance.
at the extremes slavery could produce two very different reactions each serving as the basis for a powerful stereotype in white society.
one extreme was.
r l i iaon was born into slavery in maryland.
in 1849 when her master died she escaped to philadelphia to avoid being tubman w th escaped slaves harriet tubman 1820 913 was b other slaves y old out of state.
over the next ten years she assisted first members n y o pho os getty mages iternately as a nurse and as a spy for union forces in south carolina on the slaves music o african americans living as slaves on southern plantations there was little leisure t j i time and little opportunity for the kinds of cultural activities that were beginning to appeal to other groups of americans but slaves managed nevertheless to create a culture of their own.
and among its most distinctive and pervasive features was music indeed to white observers at least nothing was more striking about slave life than the role music played within it.
african americans sang frequently sometimes alone more often in groups.
they sang while they worked together in the fields as they shucked corn slaughtered hogs or repaired fences.
they sang whenever they had social gatherings on sundays or on the rare other holidays from work.
they sang when they gathered for chores in the evenings.
they sang during their religious services.
and they sang with a passion at times even an ecstasy that was completely unfamiliar to whites and sometimes troubling to them.
their songs were rarely written down and often seemed entirely spontaneous but much slave music was really derived from african and caribbean traditions passed on through generations and from snatches of other songs the performers had heard before and from which they improvised variations.
in its emotionalism its pulsing rhythms and its lack of conventional formal structure it resembled nothing its white listeners had ever heard before.
slaves sang whether or not there were any musical instruments to accompany them but they often created instruments for themselves out of whatever materials were at hand.
us take pieces of sheep s rib or cow s jaw or a piece of iron with an old kettle or a hollow gourd and some horsehair to make the drum one former slave recalled years later.
they d take the buffalo horn and scrape it out to make the flute.
when they could they would build banjos an instrument that had originated in africa.
their masters sometimes gave them violins and guitars when the setting permitted it african americans danced to their music dances very different from and much more spontaneous than the formal steps that nineteenth century whites generally learned.
they also used music to accompany one of their other important cultural traditions storytelling.
black music on the plantations took a number of forms.
the most common was religious songs the precursors of modern gospel music which expressed in terms that their white masters who usually did not listen to the words very carefully found acceptable a faith in their eventual freedom and salvation and often spoke of africans as a chosen people waiting for redemption.
at other times the songs would express a bitterness toward white slaveholders.
the great black abolitionist frederick douglass remembered one we raise de wheat dey gib us de corn we bake de bread dey gib us de crust we sif the meal dey gib us de huss we peel de meat dey gib us de skin and dats de way dey take us in we skim de pot dey gib us de liquor what became known as the sambo the shuffling grinning head scratching deferential slave who acted out the role that he recognized the white world expected of him.
more often than not the sambo pattern of behavior was a charade a facade assumed in the presence of whites.
the other extreme was the slave rebel the african american who could not bring himself or herself to either acceptance or accommodation but remained forever rebellious.
actual slave revolts were extremely rare but the knowledge that they were possible struck terror into the hearts of white southerners everywhere.
in 1800 gabriel prosser gathered 1 000 rebellious slaves outside richmond but two africans gave the plot away and the virginia militia stymied the uprising before it could begin.
prosser and thirty five others were executed.
in 1822 the charleston free black denmark vesey and his followers ru mored to total 9 000 made preparations for revolt but again word leaked out and suppression and retribution followed.
in 1831 nat turner a slave preacher led a band of african americans who armed themselves with guns and axes and on a summer night went from house to house in southampton county virginia.
they killed sixty white men women and children before being overpowered prosser and turner rebellions by state and federal troops.
more than a hundred blacks were executed in the aftermath.
nat turners was the only large scale slave insurrection in the nineteenth century south but fear of slave conspiracies and renewed violence pervaded the section as long as slavery lasted.
for the most part however resistance to slavery took less drastic forms such as running away.
a small number of slaves managed to escape to the north or to canada especially after sympathetic whites began organizing the so called underground railroad to assist them in flight.
but the odds against a successful escape particularly from the deep south were almost impossibly high.
the hazards of distance and the slaves ignorance of geography were serious obstacles.
so were the white slave patrols which stopped wandering blacks on sight throughout the south demanding to see travel permits.
without such a permit slaves were presumed to be runaways and were taken captive.
slave patrols often employed bloodhounds to track african americans who attempted to escape through the woods.
despite all the obstacles to success however blacks continued to run away from their masters in large numbers.
some did so repeatedly undeterred by the whippings and other penalties inflicted on them when captured.
310 slave music this folk painting illustrates the importance of music to slaves and at times also to their masters.
the banjo in the hands of the man in the center was an instrument that originated in africa.
private collection peter newark american pictures bridgeman art library international to it and because the more intelligent understood that without this means of emotional and spiritual release active resistance to slavery might be more frequent.
the powerful music that emerged from slavery helped shape the lives of african americans on the plantations.
it also helped lay the foundations for music that almost all americans later embraced gospel blues jazz rhythm and blues rock and rap.
anatvze and evaluate and say dats good enough for nigger.
your butter and the fat poor nigger you can t ever get that.
to african americans music was a treasured avenue of escape from the hardships of slavery.
it was also a vehicle through which they could express anger resentment and hope.
their masters generally tolerated their slaves music and even valued it both because they often enjoyed listening 1.
does the prominent place of music in slave culture support the thesis that slavery was essentially a benign institution.
the english dramatist william congreve in the mourning bride wrote music hath charms to soothe the savage breast to soften rocks or bend a knotted oak.
how might this quote apply to the place of music in african american slave culture.
what more recent musical forms continue the tradition of the slaves religious songs or spirituals.
in what way do these more recent forms serve purposes similar to the purpose of the slaves religious songs.
does music continue to shape a distinct african american culture.
but perhaps the most important method of resistance was simply a pattern of everyday behavior by which blacks defied their masters.
that whites so often considered blacks to be lazy and shiftless suggests one means of resistance refusal to work hard.
some slaves stole from their masters or from neighboring whites.
some performed isolated acts of sabotage losing or slave breaking tools southern planters gradually resistance began to buy unusually heavy hoes because so many of the lighter ones got broken or performing tasks improperly.
many african americans resisted by building into their normal patterns of behavior subtle methods of rebellion.
the culture of slavery resistance was only part of the slave response to slavery.
another was an elaborate process of adaptation.
the process did not imply contentment with bondage.
it represented a recognition that there was no realistic alternative.
one of the ways blacks adapted was by developing their own separate culture one that enabled them to sustain a sense of racial pride and unity.
language and music in many areas slaves retained a language of their own sometimes incorporating african speech patterns into english.
having arrived in america speaking many different african languages the first generations of slaves had as much difficulty communicating with one another as they did with white people.
to overcome these barriers they learned a simple com pidgin mon lanuae known to linguists as pidgin.
it retained some african words but it drew primarily if selectively from english.
and while slave language grew more sophisticated as blacks spent more time in america and as new generations grew up never having known african tongues some features of this early pidgin survived in black speech for many generations.
music was especially important in slave society.
in some ways it was as important to african americans as language.
most important were voices and song.
field workers often used songs to pass the time in the fields since they sang them in the presence of whites they usually attached relatively innocuous words to them.
but african americans also created emotionally rich and politically challenging music importance of slave spirituals 311 312 chapter 11 in the relative privacy of their religious services.
it was there that the tradition of the spiritual emerged in the early nineteenth century.
african american religion a separate slave religion was not supposed to exist.
almost all african americans were christians by the early nineteenth century.
some had converted voluntarily and some were coerced by their masters and by the protestant missionaries who evangelized among them.
masters expected their slaves to worship under the supervision of white ministers.
indeed autonomous black churches were banned by law and many slaves became members of the same denominations as their owners usually baptist or methodist.
in the 1840s and 1850s as slavery expanded in the south missionary efforts increased.
vast numbers of african americans became members of protestant churches in those years.
nevertheless blacks throughout the south developed their own version of christianity at times incorporating into it such practices as voodoo or other polytheistic religious traditions of africa.
or they simply bent religion to the special circumstances of bondage.
natural leaders emerging within the slave community rose to the rank of preacher.
african american religion was often more emotional than that of its white counterparts and reflected the influence of african customs and practices.
slave prayer meetings routinely involved fervent chanting spontaneous exclamations from the congregation and ecstatic conversion experiences.
black religion was also more joyful and affirming than that of many white denominations.
and above all african american religion emphasized the dream of freedom and deliverance.
in their prayers and songs and sermons black christians talked and sang of the day when the lord would call us home deliver us to freedom take us to the promised land and while their white masters generally chose to interpret such language merely as the expression of hopes for life after death many african americans themselves used the im slave religion a8es christian salvation to express their own dream of freedom in the present world.
christian images and biblical injunctions were central to gabriel prosser denmark vesey nat turner and others who planned or engaged in open resistance to slavery.
in cities and towns in the south some african americans had their own churches where free blacks occasionally worshiped alongside slaves.
in the countryside however slaves usually attended the same churches as their masters sometimes a chapel on the plantation itself sometimes a church serving a larger farm community.
seating in such churches was usually segregated.
slaves sat in the rear or in balconies.
they held their own services later often in secret usually at night.
the slave family the slave family was the other crucial institution of black culture in the south.
like religion it suffered from certain legal restrictions most notably the lack of legal marriage.
nevertheless what we now call the nuclear family consistently emerged as the dominant kinship model among african americans.
such families did not always operate according to white customs.
black women generally began bearing children et younger ages than most white women often as early as age fourteen or fifteen.
slave communities did not condemn pre marital pregnancy in the way white society did and african american couples would often begin liv marriages ing t0sether before marrying.
it was cus tomary however for couples to marry in a ceremony involving formal vows soon after conceiving a child.
often marriages occurred between slaves living on neighboring plantations.
husbands and wives sometimes visited each other with the permission of their masters but often such visits had to be in secret at night.
family ties were no less strong than those of whites and many slave marriages lasted throughout the course of long lifetimes.
when marriages did not survive it was often because of circumstances over which blacks had no control.
up to a third of all black families were broken apart by the slave trade an average slave might expect during a lifetime to see ten or more relatives sold.
and that accounted for some of the other distinctive characteristics of the black family which adapted itself to the cruel realities of its own uncertain future.
extended kinship networks which grew to in importance elude not only spouses and their children of kinship but a so aunts uncles grandparents even networks distant cousins were strong and important and often helped compensate for the breakup of nuclear families.
a slave forced suddenly to move to a new area far from his or her family might create fictional kinship ties and become adopted by a family in the new community.
even so the impulse to maintain contact with a spouse and children remained strong long after the breakup of a family.
one of the most frequent causes of flight from the plantation was a slave s desire to find a husband wife or child who had been sent elsewhere.
it was not only by breaking up families through sale that whites intruded on black family life.
black women usually powerless to resist the sexual advances of their masters often bore the children of whites children whom the whites almost never recognized as their own and who were consigned to slavery from birth.
in addition to establishing social and cultural institutions of their own slaves adapted themselves to slavery by forming complex relationships with their masters.
however much blacks resented their lack of freedom they often found it difficult to maintain an entirely hostile attitude toward their owners.
not only were they dependent on whites for the ma paternal serial means of existence food clothing nature of and shelter they also often derived from slavery their masters a sense of security and protection.
there was in short a paternal relationship between slave and master sometimes harsh sometimes kindly but almost invariably important.
paternalism cotton slavery and the old south 313 in fact became even if not always consciously a vital instrument of white control.
by creating a sense of mutual dependence whites helped reduce resistance to an institution that in essence served only the interests of the ruling race.
significant events looking back while the north was creating a complex and rapidly developing commercial industrial economy the south was expanding its agrarian economy without making many fundamental changes in its character.
great migrations took many southern whites and even more african american slaves into new agricultural areas in the deep south where they created a booming cotton kingdom that raised crops for export around the world.
the cotton economy created many great fortunes and some modest ones.
it also entrenched the planter class as the dominant force within southern society both as owners of vast numbers of slaves and as patrons creditors landlords and marketers for the large number of poor whites who lived on the edge of the planter world.
the differences between the north and the south were a result of differences in natural resources social structure climate and culture.
above all they were the result of the existence within the south of an unfree labor system that prevented the kind of social fluidity that an industrializing society usually requires and that kept a large proportion of the southern population in debilitating bondage.

fe the granger collection new york setting the stage the united states in the mid nineteenth century was a rapidly changing y growing in size population and economic complexity.
many americans were excited by the new possibilities these changes produced.
others however were painfully aware of the challenges to traditional values and institutions the social instability the increasing inequality and the uncertainty about the future that accompanied change.
one result of these conflicting attitudes was the emergence of a broad array of movements intended to reform the nation.
these reform efforts generally reflected one of two basic impulses.
the first was an optimistic faith in human nature a belief that within every individual resided a spirit that was basically good and that society should attempt to unleash.
a second impulse was a desire for order and control.
with their traditional values and institutions under assault and often eroding many americans yearned above all for a restoration of stability and discipline to their nation.
often this impulse embodied a conservative nostalgia for better simpler times.
but it also inspired forward looking efforts to create new institutions of social control suited to the realities of the new age.
the reforms that flowed from these two impulses came in many guises and mobilized many different groups.
in the course of the 1840s however one issue slavery came to overshadow all others.
and one group of reformers the abolitionists became the most visible of all at that point the reform impulse which at first had been a force that tended to unify the sections became another wedge between the north and the south.
the romantic impulse national cultural aspirations in the four quarters of the globe wrote the english wit sydney smith in 1820 who reads an american book.
or goes to an american play.
or looks at an american picture or statue the answer he assumed was obvious no one.
american intellectuals were fully aware of the low regard in which europeans held their artistic and intellectual life.
in the middle decades of the nineteenth century they continued to work for both an elevation and a liberation of their nations culture for the creation of an american artistic world independent of europe one that would express their nations special virtues.
at the same time however some of the nations cultural leaders were beginning to strive for another kind of liberation one that would eventually overshadow their self conscious nationalism.
that impulse which was ironically largely an import from europe was the spirit of romanticism.
in literature philosophy art even in politics and economics american intellectuals were committing themselves to the liberation of the human spirit.
nationalism and romanticism in american painting when sydney smith asked in 1820 who looked at an american painting he was expressing the belief among european artists that they and they alone stood at the center of the world of art.
but in the united states many people were looking at american paintings in the antebellum era and they were doing so not because the paintings introduced them to the great traditions of europe but because they believed americans were creating important new artistic traditions.
the most important and popular american paintings of the first half of the nineteenth century set out to evoke the wonder of the nations landscape.
unlike their european counterparts american painters did not favor gentle scenes of carefully cultivated countrysides.
they sought instead to capture the undiluted power of nature by portraying some of the nations wildest and most spectacular areas to evoke what many nineteenth century people called the sublime the feeling of awe and wonderment and even fear of the grandeur of nature the first great school of american painters emerged in new york.

almost from the moment texas won its independence from mexico in 1836 it sought admission to the united states as a state.
controversies over the status of slavery in the territories prevented its admission until 1845 and so for nine years it was an independent republic.
the tattered banner pictured here was one of the republic s original flags.
the granger collection new york 342 chapter 13 americans in texas the united states had once claimed texas which until the 1830s was part of the republic of mexico as a part of the louisiana purchase but it had renounced the claim in 1819.
twice thereafter the united states had offered to buy texas only to meet with indignant mexican refusals.
but in the early 1820s the mexican government launched an ill advised experiment that would eventually cause it to lose its great northern province it encouraged american emigration to texas.
the mexicans hoped to strengthen the economy of the territory and increase their own tax revenues.
they also liked the idea of the americans sitting between mexican settlement and the large and sometimes militant indian tribes to the north.
they convinced themselves too that settlers in texas would serve as an effective buffer against united states expansion into the region the americans they thought would soon become loyal to the mexican government.
an 1824 colonization law designed to attract american settlers promised the newcomers cheap land and a four year exemption from taxes.
thousands of americans attracted by the rich soil in texas took advantage of mexicos welcome.
since much of the available land was suitable for growing cotton the great majority of the immigrants were southerners many of whom brought slaves with them.
by 1830 there were about 7 000 americans living in texas more than twice the number of mexicans there.
most of the settlers came to texas through the efforts of american intermediaries who received sizable land grants from mexico in return for promising to bring settlers into the region.
stephen the most successful of them was stephen f austin austin a young immigrant from missouri who had established the first legal american settlement in texas in 1822.
austin and other intermediaries were effective in recruiting american immigrants to texas but they also created centers of power in the region that competed with the mexican government.
in 1826 one of these american intermediaries led a revolt to establish texas as an independent nation which he proposed calling fredonia.
the mexicans quickly crushed the revolt and four years later passed new laws barring any further american immigration into the region.
they were too late.
americans kept flowing into the territory and in 1833 mexico dropped the futile immigration ban.
by 1835 more than 30 000 americans white and black had settled in texas.
tensions between the united states and mexico friction between the american settlers and the mexican government continued to grow.
it arose from the continuing ties of the immigrants to the united states and it arose too from their desire to legalize slavery which the mexican government had made illegal in texas in 1830.
but the americans were divided over how to address their unhappiness with mexican rule.
austin and his followers wanted to reach a peaceful settlement that would give texas more autonomy within the mexican republic.
other americans wanted to fight for independence.
in the mid 1830s instability in mexico drove general antonio lopez de santa anna to seize power as a dictator and impose a new more autocratic regime on the nation and its territories.
a new law increased the powers of the national government of mexico at the expense of the state governments a measure that texans from the united states assumed santa anna was aiming specifically at them.
the mexicans even imprisoned stephen austin in mexico city for a time claiming that he was encouraging revolts among his fellow americans in texas.
sporadic fighting between americans and mexicans in texas began in 1835 and escalated as the mexican government sent more troops into the territory.
in 1836 the american settlers defiantly proclaimed their independence from mexico.
santa anna led a large army into texas where the american settlers were having difficulties organizing an effective defense of their new nation several different factions claimed to be the legitimate government of texas and the rebels could not even agree on who their commanders were.
mexican forces annihilated an american garrison at the alamo mission in san antonio after a famous if futile defense by a group of texas patriots a group that included among others the renowned frontiersman and former tennessee congressman davy crockett.
another garrison at goliad suffered substantially the same fate when the mexicans executed most of the force after it had surrendered.
by march 1836 the rebellion appeared to have collapsed.
americans were fleeing east toward louisiana to escape santa annas army.
but general sam houston managed to keep a small force together.
and on april 23 1836 at the battle of san jacinto san jacinto near the present day city of houston he defeated the mexican army and took santa anna prisoner.
during the surrender american troops killed many of the mexican soldiers in retribution for the executions at goliad.
santa anna under pressure from his captors signed a treaty giving texas independence.
the mexican government repudiated the treaty and mexican troops briefly occupied san antonio in 1842 but were unable to win texas back.
a number of mexican residents of texas known as tejanos had fought with the americans in the revolution.
but soon after texas won its independence their positions grew difficult.
the americans did not trust the mexicans fearing that they were agents of the mexican government and in effect drove many of them out of the new republic.
most of those who stayed had to settle for a politically and economically subordinate status within the fledgling nation.
above all american texans hoped for annexation by the united states.
one of the first acts of the new president of texas sam houston was to send a delegation to washington with an offer to join the union.
there were supporters of expansion in the united states who welcomed these overtures indeed ex opposition to pansionists in the united states had been annexation supporting and encouraging the revolt against mexico for years.
but there was also opposition.
many american northerners opposed acquiring a large new slave territory and others opposed increasing the southern votes in congress and in the electoral college.
unfortunately for the texans one of the opponents was president the impending crisis 343 austin texas 1840 four years after texas declared its independence from mexico the new republics capital austin was still a small village most of whose buildings were rustic cabins as this hand colored lithograph from the time suggests.
the imposing house atop the hill at right was a notable exception.
it was the residence of president mirabeau lamar.
the granger collection new york jackson who feared annexation might cause a dangerous sectional controversy and even a war with mexico.
he therefore did not support annexation and even delayed recognizing the new republic until 1837.
presidents martin van buren and william henry harrison also refrained from pressing the issue during their terms of office.
spurned by the united states texas cast out on its own.
its leaders sought money and support from europe.
some of them dreamed of creating a vast southwestern nation stretching to the pacific that would rival the united states a dream that appealed to european nations eager to counter the growing power of america.
england and france quickly recognized and concluded trade treaties with texas.
in response president tyler persuaded texas to apply for statehood again in 1844.
but when secretary of state calhoun presented an annexation treaty to congress as if its only purpose were to extend slavery northern senators rebelled and defeated it.
rejection of the treaty only spurred advocates of manifest destiny to greater efforts toward their goal.
the texas question quickly became the central issue in the election of 1844.
oregon control of what was known as oregon country in the pacific northwest was another major political issue in the 1840s.
its half million square miles included the present states of oregon washington and idaho parts of montana and wyoming and half of british columbia.
both britain and the disputed united states claimed sovereignty in the claims region the british on the basis of explorations in the 1790s by george vancouver a naval officer the americans on the basis of simultaneous claims by robert gray a fur trader.
unable to resolve their conflicting claims diplomatically they agreed in an 1818 treaty to allow citizens of each country equal access to the territory.
this arrangement known as joint occupation con tinued for twenty years.
in fact by the time of the treaty neither britain nor the united states had established much of a presence in oregon country.
white settlement in the region consisted largely of american and canadian fur traders and the most significant white settlements were the fur trading post established by john jacob astors company at astoria and other posts built by the british hudsons bay company north of the columbia river where residents combined fur trading with farming and recruited indian labor to compensate for their small numbers.
but american interest in oregon grew substantially in the 1820s and 1830s.
missionaries considered the territory an attractive target for evangelical efforts especially after the strange appearance of four nez perce and flathead indians in st louis in 1831.
white americans never discovered what had brought the indians who spoke no english from oregon to missouri and all four died before they could find out.
but some missionaries considered the visit a divinely inspired invitation to extend their efforts westward.
they were also motivated by a desire to counter the catholic missionaries from canada whose presence in oregon many settlers believed threatened american hopes for annexation.
the missionaries had little luccess with the tribes they attempted to convert and some mbittered by indian resistance to their effortsbegan encour iging white emigration to the region arguing that by repudiating zhristianity the indians had abdicated their right to the land.
when a people refuse or neglect to fill the designs of provi ience they ought not to complain of the results said the mission iry marcus whitman who with his wife narcissa had established m important if largely unsuccessful mission among the cayuse indians east of the cascade mountains.
significant numbers of white americans began emigrating to oregon in the early 1840s and they soon substantially outnumbered the british settlers there.
they also devastated much of the indian population in part through a measles epidemic that spread through the zayuse.
the tribe blamed the whitman mission for the plague conflict between settlers and indians i 344.
chapter 13 and in 1847 they attacked it and killed thirteen whites including marcus and narcissa.
but such resistance did little to stem the white immigration.
by the mid 1840s american settlements had spread up and down the pacific coast and the new settlers along with advocates of manifest destiny in the east were urging the u s government to take possession of the disputed oregon country.
westward migration the migrations into texas and oregon were part of a larger movement that took hundreds of thousands of white and black americans into the far western regions of the continent between 1840 and 1860.
southerners flocked mainly to texas.
but the largest number of migrants came from the old northwest white men and women and a few african americans who undertook arduous journeys in search of new opportunities.
most traveled in family groups until the early 1850s when the great california gold rush attracted many single men see pp.
most were relatively prosperous young people.
poor people could not afford the expensive trip and those who wished to migrate usually had to do so by joining established families or groups as laborers men as farm or ranch hands women as domestic servants teachers or in some cases prostitutes.
the character of the migrations varied according to the destination of the migrants.
groups headed for areas where mining or lumbering was the principal economic activity consisted mostly of men.
those heading for farming regions traveled mainly as families.
all the migrants were in search of a new life but they harbored many different visions of what a new life would bring.
some particularly after the discovery of gold in california in 1848 hoped for quick riches.
others planned to take advantage of the vast public lands the federal government was selling at modest prices to acquire property for farming or speculation.
still others hoped to establish themselves as merchants and serve the new white communities developing in the west.
some among them the mormons were on religious missions or were attempting to escape the epidemic diseases plaguing many cities in the east.
but the vast majority of migrants were looking for economic opportunities.
they formed a vanguard for the expanding capitalist economy of the united states.
life on the trail most migrants about 300 000 between 1840 and 1860 traveled west along the great overland trails.
they generally gathered in one of several major depots in iowa and missouri independence st joseph or council bluffs joined a wagon train led by hired guides and set off with their belongings piled in covered wagons livestock trailing behind.
the major route west was the 2 000 mile oregon trail which stretched from independence across the great plains and through the south pass of the rocky mountains.
from there migrants moved north into oregon or south along oregon trail t le califrnia trail to the northern california coast.
other migrations moved westward ho.

however they traveled overland migrants faced consider able hardships although the death rate for travelers was only slightly higher than the rate for the american population as a whole.
the mountain and desert terrain in the later portions of the trip were particularly difficult.
most journeys lasted five or six months from may to november and there was always pressure to get through the rockies before the snows began not always an easy task given the very slow pace of most the impending crisis 345 wagon trains about fifteen miles a day.
and although some migrants were moving west at least in part to escape the epidemic diseases of eastern cities they were not immune from plagues.
thousands of people died on the trail of cholera during the great epidemic of the early 1850s.
in the years before the civil war fewer than 400 migrants about one tenth of 1 percent died in conflicts with the tribes.
in fact indians were usually more helpful than dangerous to the white migrants.
they often served as guides through difficult terrain or aided travelers in crossing streams or herding gulf of mexico ui f i a and establishing farms and businesses in the west major new trails began to facilitate travel and trade between the estern trails in 1860 as settlers began the long process o exp orin ow jew of them ej jnt0 any of the far northern regions of united states territory.

they maintained an extensive trade with the white travelers in horses clothing and fresh food.
but stories of the occasional conflicts between migrants and indians on the trail created widespread fear among white travelers even though more indians than white people and relatively few of either died in those conflicts.
life on the trail was obviously very different from life on a farm or in a town.
but the society of the trail re created many of the patterns of conventional american society.
families divided tasks along gender lines the men driving and when life on the necessary repairing the wagons or hunting trail game the women cooking washing clothes and caring for children.
almost everyone male or female walked the great majority of the time to lighten the load for the horses drawing the wagons and so the women many of whose chores came at the end of the day generally worked much harder than the men who usually rested when the caravan halted.
despite the traditional image of westward migrants as rugged individualists most travelers found the journey a highly collective experience.
that was partly because many expeditions consisted of groups of friends neighbors or relatives who had decided to pull up stakes and move west together.
and it was partly because of the intensity of the experience many weeks of difficult travel with no other human contacts except occasionally with indians.
indeed one of the most frequent causes of disaster for travelers was the breakdown of the necessarily communal character of the migratory companies.
it was a rare expedition in which there were not some internal conflicts before the trip was over.
expansion and war the growing number of white americans in the lands west of the mississippi put great pressure on the government in washington to annex texas oregon and other territory.
in the 1840s these expansionist pressures helped push the united states into a war that however dubious its origins became a triumph for the advocates of manifest destiny.
the democrats and expansion in preparing for the presidential election of 1844 the two leading candidates henry clay and former president martin van buren both tried to avoid taking a stand on the controversial issue of the annexation of texas.

for years america and britain had overlapping claims on the territory.
the british claimed land as far south as the present state of oregon while the americans claimed land extending well into what is now canada.
tensions over the oregon border at times rose to the point that many americans were demanding war some using the slogan 54 40 or fight referring to the latitude of the northernmost point of the american claim.
how did president james k polk defuse the crisis.
the impending crisis 347 james k polk sion was mild within the whig party and clay had no difficulty securing the nomination despite his noncommittal position.
but many southern democrats supported annexation and the party passed over van buren to nominate a strong supporter of annexation the previously unheralded james k polk.
polk was not as obscure as his whig critics claimed.
he had represented tennessee in the house of representatives for fourteen years four of them as speaker and had subsequently served as governor.
but by 1844 he had been out of public office and for the most part out of the public mind for three years.
what made his victory possible was his support for the position expressed in the democratic platform that the re occupation of oregon and the reannexation of texas at the earliest practicable period are great american measures by combining the oregon and texas questions the democrats hoped to appeal to both northern and southern expansionists.
polk carried the election by 170 electoral votes to 105 although his popular majority was less than 40 000.
polk entered office with a clear set of goals and with plans for attaining them.
john tyler accomplished the first of polks goals for him.
interpreting the election returns as a mandate for the annexation of texas the outgoing president won congressional approval for it in february 1845.
that december texas became a state.
polk himself resolved the oregon question.
the british minister in washington brusquely rejected a compromise compromise polk offered that would establish the over oregon united states canadian border at the 49th parallel he did not even refer the proposal to london.
incensed polk again asserted the american claim to all of oregon.
there was loose talk of war on both sides of the atlantic talk that in the united states often took the form of the bellicose slogan 54 40 or fight a reference to where the americans hoped to draw the northern boundary of their part of oregon.
but neither country really wanted war.
finally the british government accepted polks original proposal.
on june 15 1846 the senate approved a treaty that fixed the boundary at the 49th parallel where it remains today.
the southwest and california one of the reasons the senate and the president had agreed so readily to the british offer to settle the oregon question was that new tensions were emerging in the southwest tensions that ultimately led to a war with mexico.
as soon as the united states admitted texas to statehood in 1845 the mexican government broke diplomatic relations with washington.
mexican american relations grew still worse when a dispute developed over the boundary between texas and mexico.
texans claimed the rio grande as their western and southern border a claim that would have added much of what is now new mexico to texas.
mexico although still not conceding the loss of texas argued nevertheless that the border had always been the nueces river to the north of the rio grande.
polk accepted the texas claim and in the summer of 1845 he sent a small army under general zachary taylor to texas to protect it against a possible mexican invasion.
part of the area in dispute was new mexico whose spanish and indian residents lived in a multiracial society that by the 1840s had endured for nearly a century and a half.
in the 1820s the mexican government had invited american traders into the region just as it invited american settlers into texas hoping to speed development of the province.
and new mexico like texas began to become more american than mexican.
a flourishing commerce soon developed between santa fe and independence missouri.
americans were also increasing their interest in an even a more distant province of mexico california.
ijme rican k interests in 1r vasr regin lived members of several california western indian tribes and perhaps 7 000 mexicans mostly descendants of spanish colonists.
gradually however white americans began to arrive first maritime traders and captains of pacific whaling ships who stopped to barter goods or buy supplies then merchants who established stores imported merchandise and developed a profitable trade with the mexicans and indians and finally pioneering farmers who entered california from the east by land and settled in the sacramento valley.
some of these new settlers began to dream of bringing california into the united states.

this map shows the movement of mexican and american troops during the fighting which extended from the area around santa fe south to mexico city and west to the coast of california.
note the american use of its naval forces to facilitate a successful assault on mexico city and other attacks on the coast of california.
note too how unsuccessful the mexican forces were in their battles with the united states.
mexico won only one battle a minor one at san pasqual near san diego in the war.
how did president polk deal with the popular clamor for the united states to annex much of present day mexico.
president polk soon came to share their dream and committed himself to acquiring both new mexico and california for the united states.
at the same time that he dispatched troops to texas he sent secret instructions to the commander of the pacific naval squadron to seize the california ports if mexico declared war.
representatives of the president quietly informed americans in california that the united states would respond sympathetically to a revolt against mexican authority there.
the mexican war having appeared to prepare for war polk turned to diplomacy and dispatched a special minister john slidell to try to buy off the mexicans.
but mexican leaders rejected slidelps offer to purchase the disputed territories.
on january 13 1846 as soon as he heard the news polk ordered taylor s army in texas to move across tne ixueces failure of the slidell had been stationed to the rio grande.
for mission months the mexicans refused to fight.
but finally according to disputed american accounts some mexican troops crossed the rio grande and attacked a unit of american soldiers.
polk now told congress war exists by the act of mexico herself on may 13 1846 congress declared war by votes of 40 to 2 in the senate and 174 to 14 in the house.
the war had many opponents in the united states.
whig critics charged from the beginning and not without justification that polk had deliberately maneuvered the country into the conflict and had staged the border incident that had pre cipitated the declaration.
many other critics argued that the hostilities with mexico were draining resources and attention away from the more important issue of the pacific northwest even when the united states finally reached its agreerneni the impending crisis 349 opposition to with britain on the oregon question the war opponents claimed that polk had settled for less than he should have because he was preoccupied with mexico.
opposition intensified as the war continued and as the public became aware of the casual ties and expense.
to others the war was a moral crime.
ulysses grant then an officer in the mexican war called it one of the most unjust ever waged abraham lincoln criticized the war on the grounds that it gave the president too much power.
allow the president to invade a neighboring country whenever he shall deem it necessary.
he said and you allow him to make war at pleasure pacifists were particularly dismayed.
henry david thoreau was so horrified by the war that he refused to pay taxes which he said financed the conflict and spent time in jail.
american forces did well against the mexicans but victory did not come as quickly as polk had hoped.
the president ordered taylor to cross the rio grande seize parts of northeastern mexico beginning with the city of monterrey and then march on to mexico city itself.
taylor captured monterrey in september 1846 but he let the mexican garrison evacuate without pursuit.
polk now began to fear that taylor lacked the tactical skill for the planned advance against mexico city.
he also feared that if successful taylor would become a powerful political rival as in fact he did.
in the meantime polk ordered other offensives against new mexico and california.
in the summer of 1846 a small army under colonel stephen w kearny captured santa fe bear flag no pposition then kearny pro revolution ceeded to california where he joined a conflict already in progress that was being staged jointly by american settlers a well armed exploring party led by john c fremont and the united states navy the so called bear flag revolution.

the surre important step in the american victory in the mexican war.
historicus inc 350 chapter 13 by the autumn of 1846 he had completed the conquest of california.
the united states now controlled the two territories for which it had gone to war.
but mexico still refused to concede defeat.
at this point polk and general winfield scott the commanding general of the army and its finest soldier launched a bold new campaign.
scott assembled an army at tampico which the navy transported down the mexican coast to veracruz.
with an army that never numbered more than 14 000 scott advanced 260 miles along the mexican national highway toward mexico city kept american casualties low and never lost a battle before finally seizing the mexican capital.
a new mexican government took power and announced its willingness to negotiate a peace treaty.
president polk was now unclear about his objectives.
he continued to encourage those who demanded that the united states annex much of mexico itself.
at the same time concerned about the approaching presidential election he was growing anxious to finish the war quickly.
polk had sent a special presidential envoy nicholas trist to negotiate a treaty of settlement.
on february 2 1848 trist guadalupe reached agreement with the new mexican hidalgo government on the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo by which mexico agreed to cede california and new mexico to the united states and acknowledge the rio grande as the boundary of texas.
in return the united states promised to assume any financial claims its new citizens had against mexico and to pay the mexicans 15 million.
trist had obtained most of polks original demands but he had not satisfied the new more expansive dreams of acquiring additional territory in mexico itself.
polk angrily claimed that trist had violated his instructions but he soon realized that he had no choice but to accept the treaty to silence a bitter battle growing between ardent expansionists demanding the annexation of all mexico and antislavery leaders charging that the expansionists were conspiring to extend slavery to new realms.
the president submitted the trist treaty to the senate which approved it by a vote of 38 to 14.
the war was over and america had gained a vast new territory.
but it had also acquired a new set of troubling and divisive issues.

r i the sectional debate ames polk tried to be a president whose policies transcended sectional divisions.
but conciliating the sections was becoming an almost impossible task.
polk gradually earned the enmity of northerners and westerners alike who believed his policies particularly his enthusiasm for territorial expansion in the southwest favored the south at their expense.
slavery and the territories in august 1846 while the mexican war was still in progress polk asked congress to appropriate 2 million for purchasing peace with mexico.
representative david wilmot of pennsylvania an antislavery democrat introduced an amendment to the appropriation bill prohibiting slavery in any territory acquired from mexico.
the so called wilmot proviso wilmot passed the house but failed in the senate.
proviso it would be called up debated and voted on repeatedly for years.
southern militants in the meantime contended that all americans had equal rights in the new territories including the right to move their property slaves there.
as the sectional debate intensified president polk supported a proposal to extend the missouri compromise line through the new territories to the pacific coast banning slavery north of the line and permitting it south of the line.
other politicians supported a plan originally known as squatter sovereignty and later by the more dignified phrase popular sovereignty which would allow the people of each territory acting through their legislature to decide the status of slavery there.
the debate over these various proposals dragged on for many months and the issue remained unresolved when polk left office in 1849.
the presidential campaign of 1848 dampened the controversy for a time as both democrats and whigs tried to avoid the slavery question.
when polk in poor health declined to tun again the democrats nominated lewis cass of michigan a dull aging party regular.
the whigs nominated general zachary taylor of louisiana hero of the mexican war but a man with no political experience.
opponents of slavery found the choice of candidates unsatisfying and out of their discontent emerged the new free soil party which drew from the existing liberty party and the antislavery wings of the whig and democratic parties and which endorsed the wilmot proviso.
its candidate was former president martin van buren.
taylor won a narrow victory.
but while van buren failed to carry a single state he polled an impressive 291 000 votes 10 percent of the total and the free soilers elected ten members free soil t0 congress.
the emergence of the free soil party party as an important political force li e the emergence of the know nothing and liberty parties before it signaled the inability of the existing parties to contain the political passions slavery was creating.
competing plans the impending crisis 351 the california gold rush by the time taylor took office the pressure to resolve the question of slavery in the far western territories had become more urgent as a result of dramatic events in california.
in january 1848 james marshall a carpenter working on one of rancher john sutters sawmills found traces of gold in the foothills of the sierra nevada.
sutter tried to suppress the news fearing a gold rush would destroy his own substantial empire in the region.
but by may word of the discovery had reached san francisco by late summer it had reached the east coast of the united states and much of the rest of the world.
almost immediately hundreds of thousands of people from around the world began flocking to california in a frantic search for gold.
californias non indian population increased nearly twentyfold in four years from 14 000 in 1848 to over 220 000 in 1852.
the atmosphere in california at the peak of the gold rush was one of crazed excitement and greed.
for a short time san francisco was almost completely depopulated as residents raced to the mountains to search for gold the citys principal newspaper which had been criticizing the gold mania had to stop publication because it could no longer find either staff or readers.
nothing but the introduction of insane asylums can effect a cure one visitor remarked of the gold mania.
most pre gold rush migrants to the far west had prepared carefully before making the journey.
but the gold rush mi forty niners 8rants known as forty niners threw caution to the winds.
they abandoned farms jobs homes families they piled onto ships and flooded the overland trails many carrying only what they could pack on their backs.
the overwhelming majority of the forty niners perhaps 95 percent were men and the society they created on their arrival in california was unusually volatile because of the absence of women children and families.
the gold rush also attracted some of the first chinese migrants to the western united states.
news of the discoveries created great excitement in china particularly in impoverished areas where letters from chinese already in california and reports from americans visiting in china spread the word.
it was of course extremely difficult for a poor chinese peasant to get to america but many young adventurous people mostly men decided to go anyway believing that they could quickly become rich and then return to china.
emigration brokers loaned many migrants money for passage to california which the migrants would pay off out of their earnings there.
the migration was almost entirely voluntary unlike the forced movement of kidnapped coolies to such places as peru and cuba at about the same time.
the chinese in california were therefore free laborers and merchants looking for gold or more often hoping to profit from other economic opportunities the gold boom was creating.
the gold rush created a serious labor shortage in california as many male workers left their jobs and flocked to the gold fields.
this shortage created opportunities for many people who needed work including chinese immigrants.
it also led to an overt exploitation of indians that resembled slavery in all.
352 chapter 13 looking for gold finding gold in california was not for the most part a task for lone prospectors.
more common were teams of people who together built elaborate mining technologies this 1852 photograph shows the mining teams were often interracial.
the white miners on the left stand conspicuously apart from the chinese workers on the right but both groups were e of the enterprise.
the granger collection new york but name.
white vigilantes who called themselves indian hunters were already hunting down and killing thousands of indians before the gold rush contributing to the process by indian which the native american population of slavery california declined from 150 000 to 30 000 between the 1850s and 1870.
now a new state law permitted the arrest of loitering or orphaned indians and their assignment to a term of indentured labor.
the gold rush was of critical importance to the growth of california but not for the reasons most of the migrants hoped.
there was substantial gold in the hills of the sierra nevada and many people got rich from it.
but only a tiny fraction of the forty niners ever found gold or even managed to stake a claim to land on which they could look for gold.
some disappointed migrants returned home after a while.
but many stayed in california and swelled both the agricultural and urban populations of the territory.
by 1856 for example san francisco whose population had been 1 000 before the gold rush and at one point declined to about 100 as people left for the mines was the home of over 50 000 people.
by the early 1850s californias population which had always been diverse had become even more so.
the gold rush had attracted not just white americans but also europeans chinese south americans mexicans free blacks and slaves who accompanied southern migrants.
conflicts over gold intersected with racial and ethnic tensions to make the territory an unusually turbulent place.
as a result pressure grew to create a stable and effective government.
the gold rush therefore became another factor putting pressure on the united states to resolve the status not only of california but of all territories and of slavery within them as well.
the impending crisis 353 rising sectional tensions zachary taylor believed statehood could become the solution to the issue of slavery in the territories.
as long as the new lands remained territories the federal government was responsible for deciding the fate of slavery within them.
but once they became states he thought their own governments would be able to settle the slavery question.
at taylors urging california quickly adopted a constitution that prohibited slavery and in december 1849 taylor asked congress to admit california as a free state.
new mexico he added should also be granted statehood as soon as it was ready and should like california be permitted to decide for itself what it wanted to do about slavery.
congress balked in part because of several other controversies concerning slavery that were complicating the debate.
one was the effort of antislavery forces to abolish slavery in the district of columbia a movement bitterly resisted by southerners.
another was the emergence of personal liberty laws in northern states which barred courts and police officers from helping to return runaway slaves to their owners.
in response southerners demanded a stringent law that would require northern states to return fugitive slaves to their owners.
but the biggest obstacle to the presidents program was the white souths fear that two new free states would be added to the northern majority.
the number of free and slave states was equal in 1849 fifteen each.
but the admission of california would upset the balance and new mexico oregon and utah might upset it further leaving the south in a minority in the senate as it already was in the house.
tempers were now rising to dangerous levels.
even many otherwise moderate southern leaders were beginning to talk about secession from the union.
in the north every state legislature but one adopted a resolution demanding the prohibition of slavery in the territories.
the compromise of 1850 faced with this mounting crisis moderates and unionists spent the winter of 1849 1850 trying to frame a great compromise.
the aging henry clay who was spearheading the effort believed that no compromise could last unless it settled all the issues in dispute between the sections.
as a result he clays took several measures that had been pro proposed posed separately combined them into a solution single piece of legislation and presented it to the senate on january 29 1850.
among the bills provisions were the admission of california as a free state the formation of territorial governments in the rest of the lands acquired from mexico without restrictions on slav ery the abolition of the slave trade but not slavery itself in the district of columbia and a new more effective fugitive slave law.
these resolutions launched a debate that raged for seven monthsboth in congress and throughout the nation.
the debate occurred in two phases the differences between sectional conflict over slavery in the territories which revealed much about how american politics was changing in the 1850s.
in the first phase of the debate the dominant voices in congress were those of old men national leaders who still remembered jefferson adams and other founders who argued for or against the compromise on the basis of broad ideals.
clay himself seventy three years old in 1850 appealed to shared national sentiments of nationalism.
early in march another of the older leaders john c calhoun sixty eight years old and so ill that he had to sit grimly in his seat while a colleague read his speech for him joined the debate.
he insisted that the north grant the south equal rights in the territories that it agree to observe the laws concerning fugitive slaves that it cease attacking slavery and that it amend the constitution to create dual presidents one from the north and one from the south each with a veto.
calhoun was making radical demands that had no chance of passage.
but like clay he was offering what he considered a comprehensive permanent solution to the sectional problem that would he believed save the union.
after calhoun came the third of the elder statesmen sixty eight year old daniel webster one of the great orators of his time.
still nourishing presidential ambitions he delivered an eloquent address in the senate trying to rally northern moderates to support clays compromise.
but in july after six months of this impassioned nationalistic debate congress defeated the clay proposal.
and with that the controversy moved into its second phase in which a very different cast of characters predominated.
clay ill and tired left washington to spend the summer resting in the mountains.
calhoun had died even before the vote in july.
and webster accepted a new appointment as secretary of state thus removing himself from the senate and from the debate.
in place of these leaders a new younger group now emerged.
one spokesman was william h seward of new york new forty nine years old a wily political opera leadership tor who staunchly opposed the proposed compromise.
the ideals of union were to him less important than the issue of eliminating slavery.
another was jefferson davis of mississippi forty two years old a representative of the new cotton south.
to him the slavery issue was less one of principles and ideals than one of economic self interest.
most important of all there was stephen a douglas a thirty seven year old democratic senator from illinois.
a westerner from a rapidly growing state he was an open spokesman for the economic needs of his section especially for the construction of railroads.
his was a career devoted not to any broad national goals but to sectional gain and personal self promotion.
the new leaders of the senate were able as the old leaders had not been to produce a compromise.
one spur to the compromise was the disappearance of the most powerful obstacle to it the president.
zachary taylor had been adamant that only after california and possibly new mexico were admitted as states could other measures be discussed.
but on july 9 1850 taylor suddenly died the victim of a violent stomach disorder.
he was succeeded by millard fillmore of new york a dull handsome 354 chapter 13 me.

slave and free territories under the compromise of 1850 the acquisition of vast new western lands raised the question of the status of slavery in new territories organized for statehood by the united states.
tension between the north and the south on this question led in 1850 to a great compromise forged in congress to settle this dispute.
the compromise allowed california to join the union as a free state and introduced the concept of popular sovereignty for other new territories.
how well did the compromise of 1850 work.
dignified man who understood the political importance of flexibility.
he supported the compromise and used his powers of persuasion to swing northern whigs into line.
the new leaders also benefited from their own pragmatic tactics.
douglass first step after the departure of clay was to break up the omnibus bill that clay had envisioned as a great comprehensive solution to the sectional crisis and to introduce instead a series of separate measures to be voted on one temporary by one.
thus representatives of different compromise sections could support those elements of the compromise they liked and oppose those they did not.
douglas also gained support with complicated backroom deals linking the compromise to such nonideological matters as the sale of government bonds and the construction of railroads.
as a result of his efforts by mid september congress had enacted and the president had signed all the components of the compromise.
the compromise of 1850 unlike the missouri compromise thirty years before was not a product of widespread agree ment on common national ideals.
it was rather a victory of bargaining and self interest.
still members of congress hailed the measure as a triumph of statesmanship and millard fillmore signing it called it a just settlement of the sectional problem in its character final and irrevocable the crises of the 1850s for a few years after the compromise of 1850 the sectional conflict seemed briefly to have succeeded amid booming prosperity and growth.
but the tensions between north and south remained and the crisis continued to smolder until in 1854 it once more burst into the open.
the uneasy truce both major parties endorsed the compromise of 1850 in 1852 and both nominated presidential candidates unidentified with sectional passions.
the democrats chose the obscure new hampshire politician franklin pierce and the whigs the military hero general winfield scott a man of unknown political views.
but the sectional question was a divisive influence in the election the impending crisis 355 anyway and the whigs were the principal victims.
they suffered the massive defection of antislavery members angered by the partys evasiveness on the issue.
many of them flocked to the free soil party whose antislavery presidential candidate john p hale repudiated the compromise of 1850.
the divisions among the whigs helped produce a victory for the democrats in 1852.
franklin pierce a charming amiable man of no particular distinction attempted to maintain party and national harmony by avoiding divisive issues particularly by avoiding the issue of opposition to slavery but it was an unachievable goal.
the fugitive northern opposition to the fugitive slave slave act act intensified quickly after 1850 when southerners began appearing in northern states to pursue people they claimed were fugitives.
mobs formed in some northern cities to prevent enforcement of the law and several northern states also passed their own laws barring the deportation of fugitive slaves.
white southerners watched with growing anger and alarm as the one element of the compromise of 1850 that they had considered a victory seemed to become meaningless as a result of northern defiance.
young america one of the ways franklin pierce hoped to dampen sectional controversy was through his support of a movement in the democratic party known as young america its adherents saw the expansion of american democracy throughout the world as a way to divert attention from the controversies over slavery.
the great liberal and nationalist revolutions of 1848 in europe stirred them to dream of a republican europe with governments based on the model of the united states.
they dreamed as well of expanding american commerce in the pacific and acquiring new territories in the western hemisphere.
but efforts to extend the nations domain could not avoid becoming entangled with the sectional crisis.
pierce had been pursuing unsuccessful diplomatic attempts to buy cuba from spain efforts begun in 1848 by polk.
in 1854 however a group ostend envoys sent a private document manifesto horn ostend belgium making the case for seizing cuba by force.
when the ostend manifesto as it became known was leaked to the public it enraged many antislavery northerners who charged the administration with conspiring to bring a new slave state into the union.
the south for its part opposed all efforts to acquire new territory that would not support a slave system.
the kingdom of hawaii agreed to join the united states in 1854 but the treaty died in the senate because it contained a clause prohib iting slavery in the islands.
a powerful movement to annex canada to the united states a movement that had the sup port of many canadians eager for access to american markets similarly foundered at least in part because of slavery.
slavery railroads and the west what fully revived the sectional crisis was the same issue that had produced it in the first place slavery in the territories.
by the mid 1850s the line of substantial white settlement had moved beyond the boundaries of missouri iowa and what became minnesota into a great expanse of plains which many white americans had once believed was unfit for cultivation.
now it was becoming apparent that large sections of this region were in fact suitable for farming and ranching.
in the states of the old northwest therefore prospective settlers urged the government to open the area to them provide territorial governments and despite the solemn assurance the united states had earlier given the indians of the sanctity of their reservations dislodge the tribes located there to make room for white settlers.
there was relatively little opposition from any segment of white society to this proposed violation of indian rights.
but the interest in further settlement raised two divisive issues that gradually became entwined with each other railroads and slavery.
as the nation expanded westward the problem of communication between the older states and the areas west of the mississippi river became more and more critical.
as a result broad support began to emerge for railroad and building a transcontinental railroad.
slavery the problem was where to place it and in particular where to locate the railroads eastern terminus where the line could connect with the existing rail network east of the mississippi.
northerners favored chicago the rapidly growing capital of the free states of the northwest.
southerners supported st louis memphis or new orleans all located in slave states.
the transcontinental railroad in other words had become part of the struggle between the north and the south.
pierces secretary of war jefferson davis of mississippi removed one obstacle to a southern route.
surveys indicated that a railroad with a southern terminus would have to pass through an area in mexican territory.
but in 1853 davis sent james gadsden a southern railroad builder to mexico where he persuaded the mexican government to accept 10 million in exchange for a strip of land that today comprises part of arizona and new mexico and that would have facilitated a southern route for the transcontinental railroad.
the so called gadsden purchase only accentuated the sectional rivalry.
gadsden purchase the kansas nebraska controversy as a senator from illinois a resident of chicago and the acknowledged leader of northwestern democrats stephen a douglas naturally wanted the transcontinental railroad for his own city and section.
he also realized the strength of the principal argument against the northern route west of the mississippi that it would run mostly through country with a substantial indian population.
as a result he introduced a bill in january 1854 to organize and thus open to white settlement a huge new territory known as nebraska west of iowa and missouri.
douglas knew the south would oppose his bill because it would prepare the way for a new free state the proposed territory was in the area of the louisiana purchase north of the 356.
chapter 13 missouri compromise line 3630 and hence closed to slavery.
in an effort to make the measure acceptable to southerners douglas inserted a provision that the status of slavery in the territory would be determined by the territorial legislature that is according to popular sovereignty in theory the region could choose to open itself to slavery although few believed it actually would.
when southern democrats demanded kansas more douglas agreed to an additional nebraska act clause explicitly repealing the missouri compromise.
he also agreed to divide the area into two new territories nebraska and kansas instead of one.
the new second territory kansas was more likely to become a slave state.
in its final form the measure was known as the kansas nebraska act.
president pierce supported the bill and after a strenuous debate it became law in may 1854 with the unanimous support of the south and the partial sup port of northern democrats.
perhaps no piece of legislation in american history produced so many immediate sweeping and ominous consequences.
it divided and destroyed the whig party which nearly disappeared by 1856.
it divided the northern democrats many of whom were appalled at the repeal of the missouri compromise which they considered an almost sacred part of the fabric of the union and drove many of them from the party.
most important it spurred the creation of a new party that was frankly sectional in composition and creed.
people in birth of the majr parties w opposed douglas s republican bill began t0 call themselves anti nebraska party democrats and anti nebraska whigs.
in 1854 they formed a new organization and named it the republican party.
it instantly became a major force in american politics.
in the elections of that year the republicans won enough seats in congress to permit them in combination with allies among the know nothings to organize the house of representatives.
bleeding kansas events in kansas in the next two years increased the political turmoil in the north.
white settlers from both the north and the south began moving into the territory almost immediately after the passage of the kansas nebraska act.
in the spring of 1855 elections were held for a territorial legislature.
there were only about 1 500 legal voters in kansas by then but thousands of missourians some traveling in armed bands into kansas swelled the vote to over 6 000.
the result was that pro slavery forces elected a majority to the legislature which immediately legalized slavery.
outraged free staters elected their own delegates to a constitutional convention which met at topeka and adopted a constitution excluding slavery.
they then chose their own governor and legislature and petitioned congress for statehood.
president pierce denounced them as traitors and threw the full support of the federal government behind the pro slavery territorial legislature.
a few months later a pro slavery federal marshal assembled a large posse consisting mostly of missourians to arrest the free state leaders who had set up their headquarters in lawrence.
the posse sacked the town burned the governors house and destroyed several printing presses.
retribution came quickly.
among the most fervent abolitionists in kansas was john brown a fiercely committed foe of slavery who considered himself an instrument of gods will to destroy slavery.
he had moved to kansas with his sons so that they could fight to make it a free state.
after the events in lawrence he gathered potawatomie six followers including four of his sons massacre and in one night murdered five pro slavery settlers leaving their mutilated bodies to discourage other supporters of slavery from entering kansas.
this bloody episode known as the potawatomie massacre led to more civil strife in kansas irregular guerrilla warfare conducted by armed bands some of them more interested in kansas during the bitter battles over slavery in 1856 the slave state of missouri tried to prevent antislavery emigrants from passing through their territory en route to kansas.
free staters responded by organizing a large emigration through iowa circumventing missouri.
those who entered kansas by that route tended to arrive armed some of them with large cannons among them the one pictured here which free staters brought with them to topeka that year.
kansas state historical society the impending crisis 357 land claims or loot than in ideologies.
northerners and southerners alike came to believe that the events in kansas illustrated and were caused by the aggressive designs of the other section.
bleeding kansas became a symbol of the sectional controversy.
another symbol soon appeared in the united states senate.
in may 1856 charles sumner of massachusetts a militant and passionate opponent of slavery rose to give a speech titled the crime against kansas in it he gave particular attention to senator andrew p butler of south carolina an outspoken defender of slavery.
the south carolinian was sumner claimed the don quixote of slavery having chosen a mistress.
who though ugly to others is always lovely to him though polluted in the sight of the world is chaste in his sight.
the harlot slavery the pointedly sexual references and the viciousness of the speech enraged butlers nephew preston brooks a member of the house of representatives from south carolina.
several days after the speech brooks approached sumner at his desk in the senate chamber during a recess raised a heavy cane and began beating him repeatedly on the head and shoulders.
sumner trapped in his chair rose in agony with such strength that he tore the desk from the bolts holding it to the floor.
then he collapsed bleeding and unconscious.
so severe were his injuries that he was unable to return to the senate for four years.
throughout the north he became a hero a martyr to the barbarism of the south.
in the south preston brooks became a hero too.
censured by the house he resigned his seat returned to south carolina and stood successfully for reelection.
preston brooks and charles sumner the free soil ideology what had happened to produce such deep hostility between the two sections.
in part the tensions were reflections of the two sections differing economic and territorial interests.
but they were also reflections of a hardening of ideas in both north and south.
as the nation expanded and political power grew more dispersed each section became concerned with ensuring that its vision of americas future would be the dominant one.
in the north assumptions about the proper structure of society came to center on the belief in free soil and free labor although abolitionists generated some support for their argument that slavery was a moral evil and must be eliminated most white northerners came to believe that the exis free soil tence of slavery was dangerous not because ideology of what it did to blacks but because of what it threatened to do to whites.
at the heart of american democracy they argued was the right of all citizens to own property to control their own labor and to have access to opportunities for advancement.
according to this northern vision the south was the an slave power tithesis of democracy a closed static so conspiracy ciety in which slavery preserved an entrenched aristocracy and in which common whites had no opportunity to improve themselves.
while the north was growing and prospering the south was stagnating rejecting the values of individualism and progress.
the south was northern free laborites further maintained engaged in a conspiracy to extend slavery throughout the nation and thus to destroy the openness of northern capitalism and replace it with the closed aristocratic system of the south.
the only solution to this slave power conspiracy was to fight the spread of slavery and extend the nations democratic free labor ideals to all sec tions of the country.
this ideology which lay at the heart of the new republican party also strengthened the commitment of republicans to the union.
since the idea of continued growth and progress was central to the free labor vision the prospect of dismemberment of the nation a diminution of americas size and economic power was unthinkable.
i i i anti abolitionist violence this 1838 woodcut depicts the anti abolitionist riot in alton illinois in which elijah p lovejoy publisher of an abolitionist newspaper was slain on november 7 1837.
the death of lovejoy aroused the antislavery movement throughout the united states.
the library of congress i 358 chapter 13 the pro slavery argument the pro slavery argument in the south in the meantime a very different ideology entirety incompatible with the free labor ideology was emerging among southern whites on the issue of slavery.
it was a result of many things the nat turner uprising in 1831 which terrified southern whites and made them more determined than ever to make slavery secure the expansion of the cotton economy into the deep south which made slavery unprecedentedly lucrative and the growth of the garrisonian abolitionist movement with its strident attacks on southern society.
the popularity of harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin was perhaps the most glaring evidence of the success of those attacks but other abolitionist writings had been antagonizing white southerners for years.
in response to these pressures a number of white southerners produced a new intellectual defense of slavery.
professor thomas r dew of the college of william and mary helped begin that effort in 1832.
twenty years later supporters of slavery summarized their views in an anthology titled the pro slavery argument.
john c calhoun stated the essence of the case in 1837 southerners should stop apologizing for slavery as a nec essary evil and defend it as a good a positive good it was good for the slaves white southerners argued because they enjoyed better conditions than industrial workers in the north.
slavery was good for southern society as a whole because it was the only way the two races could live together in peace.
it was good for the entire country because the southern economy based on slavery was the key to the prosperity of the nation.
above all southern apologists argued slavery was good because it served as the basis for the southern way of life a way of life superior to any other in the united states perhaps in the world.
white southerners looking at the north saw a spirit of greed debauchery and instability.
the masses of the north are venal corrupt covetous mean and selfish wrote one southerner.
others wrote with horror of the factory system and the crowded pestilential cities filled with unruly immigrants.
the south by contrast was a stable orderly society operating at a slow and human pace.
it was free from the feuds between capital and labor plaguing the north.
it protected the welfare of its workers.
and it allowed the aristocracy to enjoy a refined and accomplished cultural life.
it was in short an ideal social order in which all elements of the population were secure and content.
the defense of slavery rested too on increasingly elaborate arguments about the biological inferiority of african americans who were many white southerners claimed inherently unfit to take care of themselves let alone exercise the rights of citizenship.
and just as abolitionist arguments drew strength from protestant theology in the north the pro slavery defense mobilized the protestant clergy in the south to give the institution a religious and biblical justification.
buchanan and depression in this unpromising climate the presidential campaign of 1856 began.
democratic party leaders wanted a candidate who election of unlike president pierce was not closely 1856 associated with the explosive question of bleeding kansas they chose janies buchanan of pennsylvania a reliable democratic stalwart who as minister to england had been safely out of the country during the recent controversies.
the republicans participating in their first presidential contest denounced the kansas nebraska act and the expansion of slavery but also endorsed a whiggish program of internal improvements thus combining the idealism of antislavery with the economic aspirations of the north.
as eager as the democrats to present a safe candidate the republicans nominated john c fremont who had made a national reputation as an explorer of the far west and who had no political record.
the native american or know nothing party was beginning to break apart but it nominated former president millard fillmore who also received the endorsement of a small remnant of the whig party.
after a heated even frenzied campaign buchanan won a narrow victory over fremont and fillmore.
a slight shift of votes in pennsylvania and illinois would have elected the republican candidate.
particularly significant was that fremont had attracted virtually no votes in the south while outpolling all other candidates in the north.
at the time of his inauguration buchanan was at age sixty five the oldest president except for william henry harrison ever to have taken office.
whether because of age and physical infirmities or because of a fundamental weakness of character he was a painfully timid and indecisive president at a critical moment in history.
in the year buchanan took office a financial panic struck the country followed by a depression that lasted several years.
in the north the depression strengthened the republican party because distressed manufacturers workers and farmers came to believe that the hard times were the result of the unsound policies of southern controlled democratic administrations.
they expressed their frustrations by moving into an alliance with antislavery elements and thus into the republican party.
the dred scott decision on march 6 1857 the supreme court of the united states projected itself into the sectional controversy with one of the most controversial and notorious decisions in its history its ruling in the case of dred scott v sandford handed down two days after buchanan was inaugurated.
dred scott was a missouri slave once owned by an army surgeon who had taken scott with him into illinois and wisconsin where slavery was forbidden.
in 1846 after the surgeon died scott sued his master s widow for freedom on the grounds that his residence in free territory had liberated him from slavery.
the claim was well grounded in missouri law and in 1850 the circuit court in which scott filed the suit declared him free.
by now john sanford the brother of the surgeons widow was claiming ownership of scott and he appealed the circuit court ruling to the state supreme court which reversed the earlier decision.
when scott appealed to the federal courts sanfords the impending crisis 359 taneys sweeping opinion attorneys claimed that scott had no standing to sue because he was not a citizen but private property.
the supreme court which misspelled sanfords name in its decision was so divided that it was unable to issue a single ruling on the case.
the thrust of the various rulings however was a stunning defeat for the antislavery movement.
chief justice roger taney who wrote one of the majority opinions declared that scott could not bring a suit in the federal courts because he was not a citizen.
african americans had no claim to citizenship taney argued and virtually no rights under the constitution.
slaves were property and the fifth amendment prohibited congress from taking property without due process of law consequently taney concluded congress possessed no authority to pass a law depriving persons of their slave property in the territories.
the missouri compromise therefore had always been unconstitutional.
the ruling did nothing to challenge the right of an individual state to prohibit slavery within its borders but the statement that the federal government was powerless to act on the issue was drastic and startling.
few judicial opinions have ever created as much controversy.
southern whites were elated the highest tribunal in the land had sanctioned some of the most extreme southern arguments.
in the north the decision produced widespread fury and dismay.
the decision the new york tribune wrote is entitled to just so much moral weight as would be the judgment of a majority of those congregated in any washington bar room republicans threatened that when they won control of the national government they would reverse the decision by packing the court with new members.
deadlock over kansas president buchanan timidly endorsed the dred scott decision.
at the same time he tried to resolve the controversy over kansas by supporting its admission to the union as a slave state.
in response the pro slavery territorial legislature called an election for delegates to a constitutional convention.
the free state residents refused to participate claiming that the legislature had discriminated against them in drawing district lines.
as a result the pro slavery forces won control of the convention which met in 1857 at lecompton framed a constitution legalizing slavery and refused to give voters a chance u reject it.
when an election for a new territorial legislature was called the antislavery groups turned out to vote and won 3 majority.
the new legislature promptly submitted the lecompton constitution to the voters who rejected it by more than 10 000 votes.
both sides had resorted to fraud and violence but it was clear nevertheless that a majority of the people of kansas opposed slavery.
buchanan however pressured congress to ad mit kansas under the lecompton constitution.
stephen a douglas and other western democrats refused to support the presidents proposal which died in the house of representatives.
finally in april 1858 congress approved a compromise.
lecompton constitution rejected the lecompton constitution would be submitted to the voters of kansas again.
if it was approved kansas would be admitted to the union if it was rejected statehood would be postponed.
again kansas voters decisively rejected the lecompton constitution.
not until the closing months of buchanans administration in early 1861 after several southern states had already withdrawn from the union did kansas enter the union as a free state.
the emergence of lincoln lincoln douglas debates given the gravity of the sectional crisis the congressional elections of 1858 took on a special importance.
of particular note was the united states senate election in illinois which pitted stephen a douglas the most prominent northern democrat against abraham lincoln who was largely unknown outside illinois but who quickly emerged as one of the most skillful politicians in the republican party.
lincoln was a successful lawyer who had long been involved in state politics.
he had served several terms in the illinois legislature and one undistinguished term in congress.
he was not a national figure like douglas so he tried to increase his visibility by engaging douglas in a series of debates.
the lincoln douglas debates attracted enor mous crowds and received wide attention in newspapers across the country.
by the time the debates ended lincolns increasingly eloquent and passionate attacks on slavery had made him nationally prominent.
at the heart of the debates was a basic difference on the issue of slavery.
douglas appeared to have no moral position on the issue.
one of the reserved rights of the states he said was the right to regulate the relations between master and servant on the slavery question but douglas went further endorsing what was still the dominant sentiment among whites both north and south of his time i am opposed to negro citizenship in any and every form.
i believe this government was made on the white basis.
i believe it was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever lincolns opposition to slavery was different.
if the nation could accept that african americans were not entitled to basic human rights he argued then it could accept that other groups immigrant laborers for example could be deprived of rights too.
and if slavery were to extend into the western territories he claimed opportunities for poor white laborers to better their lots in life would be lost.
the nations future he argued reflecting the central idea of the republican party rested on the spread of free labor.
lincoln believed slavery was morally wrong but he was not an abolitionist.
that was in part because he could not envision an easy alternative to slavery in the areas where it already existed.
he shared the prevailing view among northern whites that african americans were not prepared and lincoln s perhaps never would be to live on equal terms with whites.
but even while lincoln position 360 chapter 13 the harpers ferry arsenal john browns famous raid on harpers ferry in 1859 centered on this arsenal from which he and his followers tried in vain to foment slave rebellion throughout the south national park service harper s ferry u s department of the interior national archives and records administration accepted the inferiority of black people he continued to believe that they were entitled to basic rights.
1 have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races.
but i hold that.
there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man lincoln and his party wanted to arrest the further spread of slavery that is prevent its expansion into the territories but they would not directly challenge it where it already existed and would instead trust that the institution would gradually die there of its own accord.
douglass position satisfied his followers sufficiently to win him reelection to the senate in 1858 but it aroused little enthusiasm and did nothing to enhance his national political ambitions.
lincoln by contrast lost the election but emerged with a growing following both in and beyond the state.
and outside illinois the elections went heavily against the democrats who lost ground in almost every northern state.
the democratic party retained control of the senate but lost its majority in the house with the result that the congressional sessions of 1858 and 1859 were bitterly deadlocked.
john brown s raid the battles in congress however were overshadowed by a spectacular event that enraged and horrified the entire south and greatly hastened the rush toward disunion.
in the fall of john browns raid 1859 john brown the antislavery zealot whose bloody actions in kansas had inflamed the crisis there staged an even more dramatic episode this time in the south itself.
with private encouragement and financial aid from some prominent eastern abolitionists he made elaborate plans to seize a mountain fortress in virginia from which he believed he could foment a slave insurrection in the south.
on october 16 he and a group of eighteen followers attacked and seized control of a u s arsenal in harpers ferry virginia.
but the slave uprising brown hoped to inspire did not occur and he quickly found himself besieged by citizens local militia companies and before long u s troops under the command of robert e lee.
after ten of his men were killed brown surrendered.
he was promptly tried in a virginia court for treason against the state found guilty and sentenced to death.
he and six of his followers were hanged.
no other single event did more than the harpers ferry raid to convince white southerners that they could not live safely in the union.
john browns raid many southerners believed incorrectly had the support of the republican party and it suggested to them that the north was now committed to producing a slave insurrection.
the election of lincoln the presidential election of 1860 had the most momentous consequences of any in american history.
it was also among the most complex.
the impending crisis 361 candidate party electoral vote popular vote abraham lincoln 180 1 865 593 republican 39 9 j c breckinridge 72 848 356 southern democratic 18 1 john bell 39 592 906 constitutional union 12 6 stephen a douglas 12 1 382 713 northern democratic 29 4 nonvoting territories 81 2 of electorate voting the election of 1860 the stark sectional divisions that helped produce the civil war were clearly visible in the results of the 1860 presidential election.
abraham lincoln the antislavery republican candidate won almost all of the free states.
stephen douglas a northern democrat with no strong position on the issue of slavery won only one border and one free state and john bell a supporter of both slavery and union won three border states.
john breckinridge a strong pro slavery southern democrat carried the entire deep south.
lincoln won less than 40 percent of the popular vote but because of the four way division in the race managed to win a clear majority of the electoral vote.
what impact did the election of lincoln have on the sectional crisis.
the democratic party was torn apart by a battle between southerners who demanded a strong endorsement of slavery and westerners who supported the idea of popular sovereignty.
the party convention met in april in charleston south carolina.
divided when the convention endorsed popular sov democrats ereignty delegates from eight states in the lower south walked out.
the remaining delegates could not agree on a presidential candidate and finally adjourned after agreeing to meet again in baltimore in june.
the decimated convention at baltimore nominated stephen douglas for president.
in the meantime disenchanted southern democrats met in richmond and nominated john c breckinridge of kentucky.
later a group of conservative ex whigs met in baltimore to form the constitutional union party with john bell of tennessee as their presidential candidate.
they endorsed the union and remained silent on slavery.
the republican leaders in the meantime were trying to broaden their appeal so as to attract every major interest group in the north.
they warned that the south was blocking the norths economic aspirations.
the platform endorsed such traditional whig measures as a high tariff internal improvements a homestead bill and a pacific railroad to be built with federal financial assistance.
it supported the right of each state to decide the status of slavery within its borders.
but it also insisted that neither congress nor territorial legislatures could legalize slavery in the territories.
the republican convention chose abraham lincoln as the partys presidential nominee.
lincoln was appealing because of his growing reputation for eloquence because of his firm but moderate position on slavery and because his relative obscurity ensured that he would have none of the drawbacks of other more prominent and therefore more controversial republicans.
he was a representative of the west a considerable asset in a race against douglas.
in the november election lincoln won the presidency with a majority of the electoral votes but only about two fifths of the fragmented popular vote.
the republicans moreover failed to win a majority in congress.
even so the election of lincoln became the final signal to many white southerners that their position in the union was hopeless.
and within a few weeks of lincolns victory the process of disunion began a disunion process that would quickly lead to a prolonged and bloody war between two groups of americans each heir to more than a century of struggling toward nationhood each now convinced that it shared no common ground with the other.
looking back in the decades following the war of 1812 a vigorous sense of nationalism pervaded much of american life helping to smooth over the growing differences among the very different societies emerging in the regions of the united states.
by the 1850s however the forces that had worked to hold the nation together in the past were falling victim to new and much more divisive pressures that were working to split the nation apart.
driving the sectional tensions of the 1850s was a battle over national policy toward the western territories which were clamoring to become states of the union and over the place of slavery within them.
should slavery be permitted in the new states.
and who should decide whether to permit it or not.
there were strenuous efforts to craft compromises and solutions to this dilemma the compromise of 1850 the kansas nebraska act of 1854 and others.
but despite these efforts positions on slavery continued to harden in both the north and the south until ultimately each region came to consider the other its enemy.
bitter battles in the territory of kansas over whether to permit slavery there growing agitation by abolitionists in the north and pro slavery advocates in 362 chapter 13 the south the supreme court s controversial dred scott decision in 1857 the popularity of uncle toms cabin and the emergence of the new republican party openly and centrally opposed to slavery all worked to destroy the hopes for compromise and push the south toward secession.
in 1860 all pretense of common sentiment collapsed when no political party presented a presidential candidate capable of attracting national support.
the republicans nominated abraham lincoln of illinois a little known politician recognized for his eloquent condemnations of slavery in a senate race two years earlier.
the democratic party split apart with its northern and southern wings each nominating different candidates.
a third party devoted to the constitution and the union forlornly nominated a candidate of its own who found almost no constituency.
lincoln won the election easily but with less than 40 percent of the vote.
and almost immediately after his victory the states of the south began preparing to secede from the union.

i ifi fui l i ffj1 i j h by the end of 1860 the cords that had once bound the union together seemed to have snapped.
the romantic vision of america s great national destiny had ceased to be a unifying force north and south now defined that destiny in different and apparently irreconcilable terms.
the stable two party system could not dampen sectional conflict any longer that system had collapsed in the 1850s to be replaced by a new one that accentuated rather than muted regional controversy.
above all the federal government was no longer the remote unthreatening presence it once had been the need to resolve the status of the territories had made it necessary for washington to deal with sectional issues in a direct and forceful way.
the divisive forces that had always existed within the united states could no longer be counterbalanced by unifying forces.
the election of abraham lincoln in 1860 the result of a four way race in which no candidate achieved close to a majority of the popular vote was itself evidence of the growing divisions within the nation.
that the victor was a man who was clearly from the antislavery camp made his election a powerful factor in the movement toward war.
in the aftermath of lincoln s victory southern states began to proclaim their secession from the union and the new administration was faced with the fateful choice between letting the union dissolve or engaging in war.
the conflict that followed was one of the most savage in the history of warfare to that point.
at least 618 000 americans died in the civil war a level of casualties almost equal to the total number of american deaths in all the nation s other wars combined prior to vietnam.
but the war had many other effects on the character of the nation.
perhaps most important it led to the end of slavery in the united states.
yet the abolition of slavery did not lead to equality or justice for african americans.
it did however mark a major turning point in their and the nation s history.
the secession crisis almost as soon as the news of abraham lincoln s election reached the south the militant leaders southern rehin the champions of the new concept of southern nationalism men known both to their contemporaries and to history as the fire eaters began to demand an end to the union.

by the time lincoln took office six other states from the lower south mississippi january 9 1861 florida january 10 alabama january 11 georgia january 19 thtconfederacy louisiana january 26 and texas february l had seceded.
in february 1861 representatives of the seven seceded states met at montgomery alabama and announced the formation of a new nation the confederate states of america.
the response from the north was confused and indecisive.
president james buchanan told congress in december 1860 that no state had the right to secede from the union but suggested that the federal government had no authority to stop a state if it did.
the seceding states immediately seized the federal property forts arsenals government offices within their boundaries.

316 chapter 12 vistas of the rugged and still largely unsettled hudson valley.
hudson river emerson an thoreau whom many of school the painters read and admired they considered nature more than civilization the best source of wisdom and spiritual fulfillment.
in portraying the hudson valley they seemed to announce that in america unlike in europe wild nature still existed and that america therefore was a nation of greater promise than the played out lands of the old world.
yet there was also a sense of nostalgia in many of the hudson river paintings an effort to preserve and cherish a kind of nature that many americans feared was fast disappearing.
in later years some of the hudson river painters traveled farther west in search of more profound spiritual experiences.
they found an even more rugged and spectacular natural world.
their enormous canvases of great natural wonders the yosemite valley yellowstone the rocky mountains touched a passionate chord among the american public.
some of the most famous of their paintings particularly the works of albert bierstadt and thomas moran traveled around the country attracting enormous crowds.
literature and the quest for liberation american readers in the first decades of the nineteenth century were relatively indifferent to the work of their nations own writers.
the most popular novelist in america in these years was the british writer sir walter scott whose swashbuckling historical novels set in eighteenth century england and scotland won him an impassioned readership in both britain and america.
when americans read books written in their own country many were likely to turn to the large number of sentimental novels written mostly by and for women.
see patterns of popular culture pp.
but even during the heyday of scott in the 1820s the effort to create a distinctively american literature which washington irving and others had advanced in the first decades of the century made considerable progress with the emergence of the first great american novelist james fenimore cooper.
the author of more than thirty novels in the space of three decades cooper was known to his contemporaries as a master of adventure and cooperand suspense what most distinguished his the american work however v zas its evocation of the wilderness american wilderness.
cooper had grown up in central new york at a time when the edge of white settlement was not far away and he retained throughout his life a fascination with mans relationship to na ture and with the challenges and dangers of americas expansion westward.
his most important novels were known as the leatherstocking tales among them were the last of the mohicans 1826 and the deerslayer 1841 which explored the american frontiersmans experience with indians pioneers violence and the law.
coopers novels were a continuation of the early nineteenth century effort to produce a truly american literature.
but they also served as a link to the concerns of later intellectuals.
for in the leatherstocking tales could be seen not only a celebration of the american spirit and landscape but also an evocation through the central character of natty bumppo of the ideal of the independent individual with a natural inner goodness.
there was also evidence of another impulse that would motivate american reform the fear of disorder.
many of coopers less savory characters illustrated the vicious grasping nature of some of the nations western settlers and suggested a need for social discipline even in the wilderness.
walt whitman the self proclaimed poet of american democracy became one of the most important writers of his time.
he was born in 1819 on long island to quaker parents the second of nine children.

fit title page for whitmans leaves of grass for more than thirty years after the publication of the original leaves of grass in 1855 walt whitman constantly revised and expanded the collection of poems and issued numerous subsequent editions.
this sample title page with notations by whitman indicating changes and additions he wanted made is for the final such edition published in 1892 the year of whitmans death.
in a statement whitman wrote to announce publication he said that the book leaves of grass which he has been working on at great intervals and partially issued for the past thirty five or forty years is now completed.
faulty as it is he decides it is by far his special and entire self chosen poetic utterance the library of congress antebellum culture and reform 317 apprentice in newspapers.
at age sixteen he moved to new york city where he worked as a printer and later taught at several schools.
after his teaching attempts whitman went to huntington new york to found his own newspaper the long islander and served as its publisher editor pressman and distributor and even provided home delivery.
but he began to write poetry when he could and eventually left his newspaper.
in 1855 he hired a printer and published a first volume of work leaves of grass.
his poems were an unrestrained celebration of democracy of the liberation of the individual and of the pleasures of the flesh as well as of the spirit.
they also expressed whitmans personal yearning for emotional and physical release and personal fulfillment a yearning perhaps rooted in part in his own experience as a homosexual living in a society profoundly intolerant of unconventional sexuality.
in his large body of poems whitman not only helped liberate verse from traditional restrictive conventions but also helped express the soaring spirit of individualism that characterized his age.
the new literary concern with the unleashing of human herman emotions did not always produce such melville optimistic works as the work of herman melville suggests.
born in new york in 1819 melville ran away to sea as a youth and spent years sailing the world before returning home to become the greatest american novelist of his era.
the most important of his novels was moby dick published in 1851.
his portrayal of ahab the powerful driven captain of a whaling vessel was a story of courage and of the strength of individual will but it was also a tragedy of pride and revenge.
ahabs maniacal search for moby dick a great white whale that had maimed him suggested how the search for personal fulfillment and triumph could not only liberate but destroy as well.
the result of ahabs great quest was his own annihilation reflecting melvilles conviction that the human spirit was a troubled often selfdestructive force.
even more bleak were the works of one of the few southern writers of the time to embrace the search for the essence of the human spirit edgar allan poe.
in the course of his short and unhappy life he died in 1849 at the age of forty poe produced stories and poems that were primarily sad and macabre.
his first book tamerlane and other poems 1827 received little recognition.
but later works including his most famous poem the raven 1845 established him as a major if controversial literary figure.
poe evoked images of individuals rising above the narrow confines of intellect and exploring the deeper world of the spirit and the emotions.
yet that world he seemed to say contained much pain and horror.
other american writers were contemptuous of poes work and his message but he was ultimately to have a profound effect on european poets such as baudelaire.
literature in the antebellum south poe however was something of an exception in the world of southern literature.
like the north the south experienced a literary flowering in the mid nineteenth century and produced writers and artists who were concerned with defining the nature of american society and the american nation.
but white southerners produced very different images of what that society was and should be.
southern novelists of the 1830s among them beverly tucker william alexander caruthers and john pendleton southern kennedy some of them writers of great romanticism talent many of them residents of richmond produced historical romances or romantic eulogies of the plantation system of the upper south.
in the 1840s the southern literary capital moved to charleston home of the most distinguished of the regions men of letters william gilmore simms.
for a time simmss work expressed a broad nationalism that transcended his regional background but by the 1840s he too had become a strong defender of southern institutions especially slavery against the encroachments of the north.
there was he believed a unique quality to southern life that it was the duty of intellectuals to defend.
one group of southern writers however produced works that were more broadly american and less committed to a glorification of the peculiarities of southern life.
these were writers from the fringes of plantation society who depicted the world of the backwoods rural areas.
augustus b longstreet joseph g baldwin johnson j hooper and others focused not on aristocratic cavaliers but on ordinary people and poor whites.
instead of romanticizing their subjects they were deliberately and sometimes painfully realistic.
and they seasoned their sketches with a robust vulgar humor that was new to american literature.
these southern realists established a tradition of american regional humor that was ultimately to find its most powerful voice in mark twain.
the transcendentalists one of the outstanding expressions of the romantic impulse in america came from a group of new england writers and philosophers known as the transcendentalists.
borrowing heavily from german philosophers such as kant hegel and schelling and from the english writers coleridge and carlyle the transcendentalists embraced a theory of the individual that rested on a distinction first suggested by kant between what they called reason and understanding words they used in ways that seem unfamiliar even strange to modern ears.
reason as they defined it had little to do with rationality.
it was rather the individuals innate capacity to grasp beauty and truth through giving full expression to the instincts and emotions and as such it was the highest human faculty.
understanding the transcendentalists argued was the use of intellect in the narrow artificial ways imposed by society it involved the repression of instinct and the victory of externally imposed learning.
every persons goal therefore should be liberation from the confines of understanding and the cultivation of reason each individual should strive to transcend the limits of the intellect and allow 318 chapter 12 the emotions the soul to create an original relation to the universe transcendentalist philosophy emerged first among a small group of intellectuals centered in concord massachusetts.
their leader and most eloquent voice was ralph waldo emerson.
a unitarian minister in his youth e er5ond emerson left the church in 1832 to devote himself entirely to writing and teaching the elements of transcendentalism.
he was a dazzling figure to his contemporaries a lecturer whose public appearances drew rapturous crowds a conversationalist who drew intellectuals to his concord home almost daily.
he was the most important intellectual of his age.
emerson produced a significant body of poetry but he was most renowned for his essays and lectures.
in nature 1836 one of his best known essays emerson wrote that in the quest for self fulfillment individuals should work for a communion with the natural world in the woods we return to reason and faith.
standing on the bare ground my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space all mean egotism vanishes.
i am part and particle of god in other essays he was even more explicit.
nothing is at last sacred he wrote in self reliance 1841 perhaps his most famous essay but the integrity of your own mind the quest for self reliance he explained was really a search for communion with the unity of the universe the wholeness of god the great spiritual force that he described as the oversoul each persons innate capacity to become through his or her private efforts a part of this essence was perhaps the classic expression of the romantic belief in the divinity of the individual.
emerson was also a committed nationalist an ardent proponent of american cultural independence.
in a famous 1837 lecture the american scholar he boasted that our day of dependence our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands draws to a close his belief that truth and beauty could be derived as much from instinct as from learning suggested that americans lacking the rich cultural heritage of european nations could still aspire to artistic and literary greatness.
artistic and intellectual achievement need not rely on tradition and history it could come from the instinctive creative genius of individuals.
let the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts and there abide emerson once said and the huge world will come round to him almost as influential as emerson was another leading concord transcendentalist henry david thoreau.
thoreau went even further than his friend emerson in repudiating the repressive forces of society which produced he said lives of quiet desperation individuals should work for self realization by resisting pressures to conform to societys expectations and responding instead to their own instincts.
thoreaus own effort to free himself immortalized in his most famous book walden 1854 led him to build a small cabin in the concord woods on the edge of walden pond where he lived alone for two years as simply as he could.
i went to the woods he explained because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived living simply thoreau believed was a desirable alternative to the rapidly modernizing world around him a world he believed that the disruptive and intrusive railroad unhappily symbolized.
thoreaus rejection of what he considered the artificial constraints of society extended as well to his relationship with government.
in 1846 he went to jail briefly rather than agree to pay a poll tax.
he would not he insisted give financial support to a government that permitted the existence of slavery.
in his 1849 essay resistance to civil government thoreau explained his refusal by claiming that the individuals personal morality had the first claim on his or her actions that a government which required violation of that morality had no legitimate authority.
the proper response was civil disobedience or passive resistance a public refusal to nbpv lininsr laws thoreau and civil disobedience the defense of nature the transcendentalists and others feared the impact of the new capitalist enthusiasms on the integrity of the natural world.
the mountains and cataracts which were to have made poets and painters wrote the essayist oliver wendell holmes have been mined for anthracite and dammed for water power nature was not just a setting for economic activity as many farmers miners and others believed and it was not simply a body of data to be catalogued and studied as many scientists thought.
it was the source of human inspiration the vehicle through which individuals could best realize the truth within their own souls.
genuine spirituality they argued came not from formal religion but through communion with the natural world.
in wildness is the preservation of the world thoreau once wrote.
humans separated from nature he believed would lose a substantial part of their humanity.
in making such claims the transcendentalists were among the first americans to anticipate the environmental movement of the twentieth century.
they had no scientific basis for their defense of the wilderness no knowledge of modern ecology little sense of the twentieth century notion of the interconnectedness of species.
but they did believe in and articulate an essential unity between humanity and nature a spiritual unity they believed without which civilization would be impoverished.
they looked at nature they said with new eyes and with those eyes they saw that behind nature throughout nature spirit is present visions of utopia although transcendentalism was above all an individualistic philosophy it helped spawn the most famous of all nineteenth brook farm century experiments in communal living brook farm which the boston transcendentalist george ripley established as an experimental antebellum culture and reform 319 community in west roxbury massachusetts in 1841.
there according to ripley individuals would gather to create a new form of social organization all residents would share equally in the labor of the community so that all could share too in the leisure because leisure was the first necessity for cultivation of the self ripley was one of the first americans to attribute positive connotations to the idea of leisure most of his contemporaries equated it with laziness and sloth.
participation in manual labor served another purpose as well it helped individuals bridge the gap between the world of the intellect and learning and the world of instinct and nature.
the obvious tension between the ideal of individual freedom and the demands of a communal society took their toll on brook farm.
many residents became disenchanted and left when a fire destroyed the central building of the community in 1847 the experiment dissolved.
among the original residents of brook farm was the writer nathaniel hawthorne who expressed his disillusionment with the experiment and to some extent with transcendentalism in a series of notable novels.
in the blithedale romance 1852 he wrote scathingly of brook farm itself portraying the disastrous consequences of the experiment on the individuals who had submitted to it.
the failure of brook farm did not however prevent the formation of other experimental communities.
some borrowed as ripley had done from the ideas of the french philosopher charles fourier whose ideas of socialist communities organized as cooperative phalanxes received wide attention in america.
others drew from the ideas of the scottish industrialist and philanthropist robert owen.
owen himself founded an experimental community in indiana in 1825 which he named new harmony new harmony.
it was to be a village of cooperation in which every resident worked and lived in total equality.
the community was an economic failure but the vision that had inspired it continued to enchant americans.
dozens of other owenite experiments began in other locations in the following years.
redefining gender roles one of the principal concerns of many of the new utopian communities and of the new social philosophies on which they rested was the relationship between men and women.
transcendentalism and other movements of this period fostered expressions of a kind of feminism that would not gain a secure foothold in american society until the late twentieth century.
one of those most responsible for raising issues of gender was margaret fuller.
a leading transcendentalist and a close associate of emerson she suggested the important relationship between the discovery of the self that was so central to ante bellum reform and the questioning of gender roles.
many margaret fuller as a leading transcendentalist fuller argued for the important relationship between the discovery of the self and the questioning of the prevailing gender roles of her era.
in her famous feminist work women in the nineteenth century fuller wrote many women are considering within themselves what they need and what they have not.
she encouraged her readers especially women to set aside conventional thinking about the role of women in society i would have woman lay aside all thought such as she habitually cherishes of being taught and led by men.
fuller provided a strong voice in the redefinition of gender roles in the nineteenth century.
corbis women are considering within themselves what they need and what they have not she wrote in a famous feminist work woman in the nineteenth century 1844.
i would have woman lay aside all thought such as she habitually cherishes of being taught and led by men fuller herself before her premature death in a shipwreck in 1850 lived a life far different from the domestic ideal of her time.
she had intimate relationships with many men became a great admirer of european socialists and a great champion of the italian revolution of 1848 which she witnessed during travels there and established herself as an intellectual leader whose power came in part from her perspective as a woman.
a redefinition of gender roles was crucial to one of the most enduring utopian colonies of the nineteenth century the oneida community established in 1848 in upstate new york by john humphrey noyes.
the oneida perfectionists as residents of the community called themselves rejected traditional notions of family and marriage.
all residents noyes declared were married to all other residents there were no permanent conjugal ties.
but oneida was not as its horrified critics often claimed an experiment in free love it was a place where the community carefully monitored sexual behavior where women were to be protected from unwanted childbearing in which children were raised communally often seeing little of their own parents.
the oneidans took special pride in what they considered the liberation of their women from the demands of male lust and from the traditional bonds of family.
redefined gender roles at the oneida community 320 chapter 12 the shakers even more than the oneidans made a redefinition of traditional sexuality and gender roles central to their society.
founded by mother ann lee in the 1770s the society of the shakers survived throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth.
a tiny remnant survives today.
but the shakers attracted a particularly large following in the antebellum period and established more than twenty communities throughout the northeast and northwest in the 1840s.
they derived their name from a unique religious ritual a sort of ecstatic dance in which members of a congregation would shake themselves free of sin while performing a loud chant.
the most distinctive feature of shakerism however was its commitment to complete celibacy which meant of course that no one could be born to shakerism all shakers had to choose the faith voluntarily.
shaker communities attracted about 6 000 members in the 1840s more the shakers.
conditions in which contact between men and women was very limited.
shakers openly endorsed the idea of sexual equality they even embraced the idea of a god who was not clearly male or female.
within the shaker society as a whole it was women who exercised the most power.
mother ann lee was succeeded as leader of the movement by mother lucy wright.
shakerism one observer wrote in the 1840s was a refuge from the perversions of marriage and the gross abuses which drag it down the shakers were not however motivated only by a desire to escape the burdens of traditional gender roles.
they were trying as well to create a society separated and protected from the chaos and disorder that they believed had come to characterize american life as a whole.
less interested in personal freedom than in social discipline they were like some other dissenting religious sects and utopian communities of their time.
another example was the amana community founded by german immigrants in 1843 whose members settled in iowa in 1855 and attempted to realize christian ideals by creating an ordered socialist society.
the mormons among the most important efforts to create a new and more ordered society within the old was that of the church of jesus joseph smith christ of latter day saints the mormons.
mormonism began in upstate new york as a result of the efforts of joseph smith a young energetic but economically unsuccessful man who had spent most of his twenty four years moving restlessly through new england and the northeast.
then in 1830 he published a remarkable document the book of mormon named for the ancient prophet who he claimed had written it.
it was smith said a translation of a set of golden tablets he had found in the hills of new york revealed to him by an angel of god.
the book of mormon told the story of an ancient and successful civilization in america peopled by one of the lost tribes of israel who had found their way to the new world centuries before columbus.
its members waited patiently for the appearance of the messiah and they were rewarded when jesus came to america after his resurrection.
subsequent generations however strayed from the path of righteousness that jesus had laid out for them.
ultimately their civilization collapsed and god punished the sinful by making their skin dark.
these darkened people smith believed were the descendants of the american indians although the modern tribes had no memory of their origins.
but while the ancient hebrew kingdom in america had ultimately vanished smith believed its history as a righteous society could serve as a model for a new holy community in the united states.
in 1831 gathering a small group of believers around him smith began searching for a sanctuary for his new community of saints an effort that would continue unhappily for more than twenty years.
time and again the mormons attempted to establish their new jerusalem time and again they met with persecution from surrounding communities suspicious of their radical religious doctrines which included polygamy the right of men to take several wives a rigid form of social organization and particularly damaging to their image an intense secrecy which gave rise to wild rumors among their critics of conspiracy and depravity.
driven from their original settlements in independence missouri and kirtland ohio the mormons moved on to the new town of nauvoo illinois which by the early 1840s had become an imposing and economically successful community.
in 1844 however joseph smith was arrested charged with treason for allegedly conspiring against the government to win foreign support for a new mormon colony in the southwest and imprisoned in carthage illinois.
there an an establishment mob attacked the iail forced sraith of salt lake from is cefr an shot and killed him.
the city mormons now abandoned nauvoo and un der the leadership of smiths successor brigham young traveled across the desert a society of 12 000 people in one of the largest single group migrations in american history and established a new community in utah the present salt lake city.
there at last the mormons were able to create a lasting settlement.
like other experiments in social organization of the era mormonism reflected a belief in human perfectibility.
god had once been a man the church taught and thus every man or woman could aspire to become as joseph smith had become a saint.
but unlike other new communities such as the oneidans the mormons did not embrace the doctrine of individual liberty.
instead they created a highly organized centrally directed almost militarized social structure a refuge against the disorder and uncertainty of the secular world.
they placed particular emphasis on the structure of the family.
mormon religious rituals even included a process by which men and women went through baptism ceremonies in the name of deceased ancestors as a result they believed they would be reunited with those ancestors in heaven.
the intense mormon interest in genealogy which continues today is a reflection of antebellum culture and reform 321 mormons heading west this lithograph by william henry jackson 1843 1942 shows mormon handcart pioneers heading west to utah in 1850.
private collection peter newark american pictures the bridgeman art library this belief in the possibility of reuniting present generations with those of the past.
the original mormons were for the most part men and women who felt displaced in their rapidly changing society people left behind or troubled by the material growth and social progress of their era.
in the new religion they found genuine faith.
in the society mormonism created they found security and order.
remaking society the simultaneous efforts to liberate the individual and impose order on a changing world also helped create a wide range of new movements to remake society movements in which to a striking degree women formed the real rank and file and often the leadership as well.
by the 1830s such movements had taken the form of organized reform societies.
in no country in the world tocqueville had observed has the principle of association been more successfully used or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of different objects than in america.
the new organizations did indeed work on behalf of a wide range of issues temperance education peace the care new reform poor the handicapped and the movements mentally ill the treatment of criminals the rights of women and many more.
few eras in american history have witnessed as wide a range of reform efforts as emerged in the mid nineteenth century.
and few eras have exposed more clearly the simultaneous attraction of americans to the ideas of personal liberty and social order.
revivalism morality and order the philosophy of reform arose from several distinct sources.
one was the optimistic vision of those who like the tran scendentalists rejected calvinist doctrines and preached the divinity of the individual.
these included not only emerson thoreau and their followers but also a much larger group of americans who embraced the doctrines of unitarianism and universalism and absorbed european romanticism.
322 chapter 12 a second and in many respects more important source was protestant revivalism the movement that had begun with the second great awakening early in the century and had by the 1820s evolved into a powerful force for social reform.
although the new light revivalists were theologically far removed from the transcendentalists and unitarians they had come to share the optimistic belief that every individual was capable of salvation.
according to charles grandison finney an evangelistic presbyterian minister who became the most influential revival leader of the 1820s and 1830s traditional calvinist doctrines of predestination and individual human helplessness were both obsolete and destructive.
each person he preached contained within himself or herself the capacity to experience spiritual rebirth and achieve salvation.
a revival of faith need not depend on a miracle from god it could be created by individual effort.
finney enjoyed particular success in upstate new york where he helped launch a series of passionate revivals in towns along the erie canal a region so prone to religious awakenings that it was known as the burned over district it was no coincidence that the new revivalism should prove so powerful charles grandison finney evangelistic presbyterian minister charles grandison finney became the most influential revival leader of the 1820s and 1830s.
he argued that each person contained within herself or himself the capacity to experience spiritual rebirth and achieve salvation.
finneys views on revivalist faith contrasted with earlier calvinist doctrines of predestination and individual human helplessness.
bettmann corbis revivalism in the burned over district finney s doctrine of personal regeneration there for this region of new york was experiencing largely as a result of the construction of the canal a major economic transformation.
and with that transformation had come changes in the social fabric so profound that many men and women felt baffled and disoriented.
it was in roughly this same area of new york that joseph smith first organized the mormon church.
in rochester new york the site of his greatest success finney staged a series of emotionally wrenching religious meetings that aroused a large segment of the community.
he had particular success in mobilizing women on whom he tended to concentrate his efforts both because women found the liberating message of revivalism particularly appealing and because finney discovered they pro vided him with access to their male relatives.
gradually he developed a large following among the prosperous citizens of the region.
they were enjoying the economic benefits of the new commercial growth but they were also uneasy about some of the social changes accompanying it among them the introduction into their community of a new undisciplined pool of transient laborers.
for them revivalism became not only a means of personal salvation but also a mandate for the reform and control of their society.
finneys revivalism became a call for a crusade against personal immorality.
the church he maintained must take right ground on the subject of temperance the moral reform and all the subjects of practical morality which come up for decision from time to time the temperance crusade evangelical protestantism added major strength to one of the most influential reform movements of the era the crusade against drunkenness.
no social vice argued some reformers including many of finneys converts in cities such as rochester was more responsible for crime disorder and poverty than the excessive use of alcohol.
women who were particularly active in the temperance movement claimed that alcoholism placed a special burden on wives men spent money on alcohol that their families needed for basic necessities and drunken husbands often abused their wives and children.
in fact alcoholism was an even more serious problem in antebellum america than it has been in the twentieth and twenty first centuries.
the supply of alcohol was growing rapidly particularly in the west farmers there grew more grain than they could sell in the still limited markets in this prerailroad era so they distilled much of it into whiskey.
but in the east too commercial distilleries and private stills were widespread.
the appetite for alcohol was growing along with the supply in isolated western areas where drinking provided a social pastime in small towns and helped ease the loneliness and isolation on farms in pubs and saloons in eastern cities where drinking was the principal leisure activity for many workers.
the average male in the 1830s drank nearly three times as much alcohol as the average person does today.
and antebellum culture and reform 323 american society for the promotion of temperance as that figure suggests many people drank habitually and excessively with bitter consequences for themselves and others among the many supporters of the temperance movement were people who saw it as a way to overcome their own prob lems with alcoholism.
although advocates of temperance had been active since the late eighteenth century the new reformers gave the movement an energy and influence it had never previously known.
in 1826 the american society for the promotion of temperance emerged as a coordinating agency among various groups it attempted to use many of the techniques of revivalism in preaching abstinence.
then in 1840 six reformed alcoholics in baltimore organized the washington temperance society and began to draw large crowds in which workers many of them attempting to overcome their own alcoholism were heavily represented to hear their impassioned and intriguing confessions of past sins.
by then temperance advocates had grown dramatically in numbers more than a million people had signed a formal pledge to forgo hard liquor.
as the movement gained in strength it also became divided in purpose.
some temperance advocates now urged that abstinence include not only liquor but beer and wine as well.
not everyone agreed.
some began to demand state legislation to restrict the sale and consumption of alcohol maine passed cultural divisions over alcohol such a law in 1851 others insisted that temperance must rely on the conscience of the individual.
whatever their disagreements by promoting abstinence reformers were attempting to promote the moral self improvement of individuals.
they were also trying to impose discipline on society.
the search for social discipline was particularly clear in the battle over prohibition laws which pitted established protestants against new catholic immigrants to many of whom drinking was an important social ritual and an integral part of the life of their communities.
the arrival of the immigrants was profoundly disturbing to established residents of many communities and the restriction of alcohol seemed to them a way to curb the disorder they believed the new population was creating.
health fads and phrenology for some americans the search for individual and social perfection led to an interest in new theories of health and knowledge.
threats to public health were critical to the sense of insecurity that underlay many reform movements especially after the terrible cholera epidemics of the 1830s and 1840s.
cholera is a severe bacterial infection of the intestines usually a result of consuming contaminated food or water.
in the nineteenth century long before the discovery of antibiotics less.
hows what temperance advocates argued was the inevitable consequence of alcohol consumption.

dec ines to desperation and suicide while his abandoned wife and child grieve.
the library of congress innocent glass with a friend the young man rises step by step to the summit o run e 324 chapter 12 than half of those who contracted the disease survived.
thousands of people died of cholera during its occasional outbreaks and in certain cities new orleans in 1833 and st louis in 1849 the effects were truly catastrophic.
nearly a quarter of the population of new orleans died in the 1833 epidemic.
many municipalities pressured by reformers established city health boards to try to find solutions to the problems of epidemics.
but the medical profession of the time unaware of the nature of bacterial infections had no answers and the boards therefore found little to do.
instead many americans turned to nonscientific theories for improving health.
affluent men and especially women flocked to health spas for the celebrated water cure which purported to improve health through immersing people in hot or cold baths or wrapping them in wet sheets.
although the water cure delivered few of the benefits its promoters promised it did have some therapeutic value some forms of hydrotherapy are still in use today.
other people adopted new dietary theories.
sylvester graham a connecticut born presbyterian minister and committed reformer won many followers with his prescriptions for eating fruits vegetables and bread made from coarsely ground flour a prescription not unlike some dietary theories today instead of meat.
the graham cracker is made from a kind of flour named for him.
graham accompanied his dietary prescriptions with moral warnings about the evils of excess and luxury.
perhaps strangest of all to modern sensibilities was the widespread belief in the new science of phrenology which appeared first in germany and became popular in the united states beginning in the 1830s through the efforts of orson phrenology and lorenzo fowler publishers of the phrenology almanac.
phrenologists argued that the shape of an individuals skull was an important indicator of his or her character and intelligence.
they made elaborate measurements of bumps and indentations to calculate the size and they claimed the strength of different parts of the brain each of which they argued controlled a specific kind of intelligence or behavior.
for a time phrenology seemed to many americans an important vehicle for improving society.
it provided a way of measuring an individuals fitness for various positions in life and seemed to promise an end to the arbitrary process by which people matched their talents to occupations and responsibilities.
the theory is now universally believed to have no scientific value.
medical science in an age of rapid technological and scientific advances the science of medicine sometimes seemed to lag behind.
in part that was because of the greater difficulty of experimentation in medicine which required human subjects as compared to other areas of science and technology that relied on inanimate objects.
in part it was because of the character of the medical profession which in the absence of any significant regulation attracted many poorly educated people and many quacks in addition to trained physicians.
efforts to regulate the profession bath at warm springs among the many fads and theories about human health to gain currency in the 1830s and 1840s one of the most popular was the idea that bathing in warm sulphurous water was restorative.
visitors to warm springs all over the united states and europe took the baths drank the foul smelling water and sometimes stayed for weeks as part of a combination vacation and cure this 1837 drawing is by sophie dupont a visitor to a popular spa.
she wrote to a friend that the water notwithstanding its odour of half spoiled eggs and its warmth is not very nauseous to the taste courtesy of hagley museum and library were opposed in the 1830s and 1840s by those who considered the licensing of physicians to be a form of undemocratic monopoly.
the prestige of the profession therefore remained low and it was for many people a career of last resort.
the biggest problem facing american medicine however was the absence of basic knowledge about disease.
the great medical achievement of the eighteenth century the development of a vaccination against smallpox by the english physician edward jenner came from no broad theory of infection but from a brilliant adaptation of folk practices among country people.
the development of anesthetics came not from medical doctors at first but from a new england dentist william morton who was looking for ways to help his patients endure the extraction of teeth.
beginning in 1844 morton began experimenting with using sulphuric ether.
john warren a boston surgeon soon began using ether to sedate surgical patients.
even these advances met with stiff resistance from traditional physicians some of whom continued to believe that all medical knowledge derived from timeless truths and ancient scholars and who mistrusted innovation and experimentation.
others rejected scientific advances because of unorthodox and untested medical techniques popularized by entrepreneurs many of them charlatans.
in the absence of any broad acceptance of scientific methods and experimental practice in medicine it was very diffi cult for even the most talented doctors to succeed in treating disease.
even so halting progress toward the discovery of the germ theory did occur in antebellum america.
in 1843 the antebellum culture and reform 325 phrenology this lithograph illustrates some of the ideas of the popular science of phrenology in the 1830s.
drawing from the concepts of the german writer johann gaspar spurzheim american phrenologists promoted the belief that a person s character and talents could be understood by the formation of his or her skull that the brain was in fact a cluster of autonomous organs each controlling some aspect of human thought or behavior.
in this diagram the areas of the brain that supposedly control identity acquisitiveness secretiveness marvelousness and hope are clearly identified.
the theory has no scientific basis.
the library of congress boston essayist poet and physician oliver wendell holmes discovery of published his findings from a study of large contagion numbers of cases of puerperal fever septicemia in children and concluded that the disease could be transmitted from one person to another.
this discovery of contagion met with a storm of criticism but was later vindicated by the clinical success of the hungarian physician ignaz semmelweis who noticed that the infection seemed to be spread by medical students who had been work ing with corpses.
once he began requiring students to wash their hands and disinfect their instruments the infections vir tually disappeared.
reforming education one of the outstanding reform movements of the mid nineteenth century was the effort to produce a system of universal pub ic education.
as of 1830 no state yet had such a system although some states such as massachusetts had supported a limited version for many years.
in the 1830s however interest in public education grew rapidly.
it was a reflection of the new belief in the innate capacity of every person and of societys obligation to tap that capacity but it was a reflection too of the desire to expose students to stable social values as a way to resist instability.
the greatest educational reformer was horace mann the first secretary of the massachusetts board of education which was established in 1837.
to mann and his followers education was the only way to counterwork this tendency to the domination of capital and the servility of labor the only way to protect democracy mann believed was to create an educated electorate.
he reorganized the massachusetts school system lengthened the academic year to six months doubled teachers salaries although he did nothing to eliminate the large disparities between the salaries of male and female teachers enriched the curriculum and introduced new methods of professional training for teachers.
other states experienced similar expansion and development.
they built new schools created teachers rapid growth of public colleges and offered large new groups of education children access to education.
henry barnard helped produce a educational system in connecticut and rhode island.
pennsylvania passed a law in 1835 appropriating state funds for the support of universal education.
governor william seward of new york extended public support of schools throughout the state in the early 1840s.
by the 1850s the principle of tax supported elementary schools had been accepted in all the states and all were making at least a start toward putting the principle into practice.
yet the quality of the new education continued to vary widely.
in some places massachusetts for example where mann established the first american state supported teachers college in 1839 and where the first professional association of teachers was created in 1845 educators were usually capable men and women often highly trained and with an emerging sense of themselves as career professionals.
in other areas however teachers were often barely literate and limited funding for education restricted opportunities severely.
in the newly settled regions of the west where the white population was highly dispersed many children had no access to schools.
in the south the entire black population was barred from formal education although approximately 10 percent of the slaves achieved literacy anyway and only about a third of all white children of school age actually enrolled in schools in 1860.
in the north the percentage was 72 percent but even there many students attended classes only briefly and casually.
the interest in education was visible too in the growing movement to educate american indians in the antebellum period.
some reformers held racist assumptions about the un redeemability of nonwhite peoples but even many who accepted that idea about african americans continued to believe that indians could be civilized if only they could be taught the ways of the white world.
efforts to educate native 326 chapter 12 americans and encourage them to assimilate were particularly prominent in such areas of the far west as oregon.
substantial numbers of whites were beginning to settle there in the 1840s.
nevertheless the great majority of native americans remained outside the reach of educational reform either by choice or by circumstance or both.
despite limitations and inequities the achievements of a the school reformers were impressive by of edlcationae anv standard.
by the beginning of the reform civil war the united states had one of the highest literacy rates of any nation 94 percent of the population of the north and 83 percent of the white population of the south 58 percent of the total southern population.
the conflicting impulses underlying the movement for school reform were visible in some of the different educational institutions that emerged.
in new england for example the transcendentalist bronson alcott established a controversial experimental school in concord that reflected his strong belief in the importance of complete self realization.
he urged children to learn from their own inner wisdom not from the imposition of values by the larger society.
children were to teach themselves rather than rely on teachers.
a similar emphasis on the potential of the individual the sparked the creation of new institutions to benevolent help the handicapped institutions that empire formed part of a great network of charitable activities known as the benevolent empire.
among them was the perkins school for the blind in boston the first such school in america.
nothing better exemplified the romantic impulse of the era than the belief of those who founded perkins that even societys supposedly least favored members the blind and otherwise handicapped could be helped to discover inner strength and wisdom.
more typical of educational reform however were efforts to use schools to impose a set of social values on children the values that reformers believed were appropriate for their new industrializing society.
these values included thrift order discipline punctuality and respect for authority.
horace mann for example spoke frequently of the role of public schools in extending democracy and expanding individual opportunity.
but he spoke too of their role in creating social order.
the unrestrained passions of men are not only homicidal but suicidal he said suggesting a philosophy very different from that of alcott and other transcendentalists who emphasized instinct and emotion.
train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it rehabilitation similar impulses helped create another powerful movement of reform the creation of asylums as they now were called for criminals and for the mentally ill on the one hand in advocat the asylum in prison and hospital reform americans movement were reacting to one of societys most glaring ills.
criminals of all kinds debtors unable to pay their debts the mentally ill even senile paupers all were crowded together indiscriminately into prisons and jails which in some cases were holes in the ground one jail in connecticut was an abandoned mine shaft.
beginning in the 1820s numerous states replaced these antiquated facilities with new penitentiaries and mental institutions designed to provide a proper environment for inmates.
new york built the first penitentiary at auburn in 1821.
in massachusetts the social reformer dorothea dix began a national movement for new methods of treating the mentally ill.
imprisonment of debtors and paupers gradually disappeared as did such traditional practices as legal public hangings.
but the creation of asylums for social deviants was not prison simply an effort to curb the abuses of the reform old system.
it was also an attempt to re form and rehabilitate the inmates.
new forms of rigid prison discipline were designed to rid criminals of the laxness that had presumably led them astray.
solitary confinement and the imposition of silence on work crews both adopted in pennsylvania and new york in the 1820s were meant to give prisoners opportunities to meditate on their wrongdoings hence the term penitentiary a place for individuals to cultivate penitence.
some reformers argued that the discipline of the asylum could serve as a model for other potentially disordered environments for example factories and schools.
but penitentiaries and mental hospitals often fell victim to overcrowding and the original reform ideal gradually faded.
many prisons ultimately degenerated into little more than warehouses for criminals with scant emphasis on rehabilitation which was far from the original optimistic vision.
the asylum movement was not however restricted to criminals and people otherwise considered unfit the idea that a properly structured institution could prevent moral failure or rescue individuals from failure and despair helped spawn the creation of new orphanages designed as educational institutions.
such institutions reformers believed would provide an environment in which children who might otherwise be drawn into criminality could be trained to become useful citizens.
similar institutions emerged to provide homes for friendless women women without families or homes but otherwise respectable for whom the institutions might provide an opportunity to build a new life.
such homes were in part an effort to prevent such women from turning to prostitution.
there were also new facilities for the poor almshouses and workhouses which created closely supervised environments for those who had failed to work their way up in society.
such an environment reformers believed would train them to live more productive lives.
the indian reservation some of these same beliefs underlay the emergence in the 1840s and 1850s of a new reform approach to the problems of native americans the idea of the reservation.
for several decades the dominant thrust of u s policy toward the indians antebellum culture and reform 327 perkins school for the blind the perkins school in boston was the first school for the blind in the united states and was committed to the idea that the blind could be connected effectively to the world through the development of new skills such as reading through the relatively new technique of embossed writing systems.
this woodcut shows perkins s main building in the mid 1850s by which time the school was already over twenty years old.
it continues to educate the blind today.
courtesy of perkins school for the blind watertown massachusetts in areas of white settlement had been relocation.
the principal motive behind relocation had always been a simple one getting the tribes out of the way of white civilization.
but among some whites there had also been another if secondary intent to move the indians to a place where they would be protected from whites and allowed to develop to a point where assimilation might be possible.
even andrew jackson whose animus toward indians was legendary once described the removals as part of the nations moral duty to protect and if possible to preserve and perpetuate the scattered remnants of the indian race it was a small step from the idea of relocation to the idea of the reservation the idea of creating an enclosed region in which indians would live in isolation from white society.
the reservations served white economic purposes above allmoving native americans out of good lands that white settlers wanted.
but they were also supposed to serve a reform purpose.
just as prisons asylums and orphanages would provide society with an opportunity to train and uplift misfits and unfortunates within white society so the reservations might provide a way to undertake what one official called the great work of regenerating the indian race native americans on reservations reformers argued would learn the ways of civilization in a protected setting.
the emergence of feminism the reform ferment of the antebellum period had a particular meaning for american women.
they played central roles in a wide range of reform movements and a particularly important role in the movements on behalf of temperance and the aboli tion of slavery.
in the process they expressed their awareness of reform movements and the rise of feminism the problems that women themselves faced in a male dominated society.
the result was the creation of the first important american feminist movement one that laid the groundwork for more than a century of agitation for womens rights.
women in the 1830s and 1840s faced not only all the traditional restrictions imposed on members of their sex by society but also a new set of barriers that had emerged from the doctrine of separate spheres and the transformation of the family.
many women who began to involve themselves in reform movements in the 1820s and 1830s came to look on such restrictions with rising resentment.
some began to defy them.
sarah and angelina grimke sisters born in south carolina who had become active and outspoken abolitionists ignored attacks by men who claimed that their activities were inappropriate for their sex.
men and women were created equal they argued.
they are both moral and accountable beings and whatever is right for man to do is right for women to do other reformers catharine beecher harriet beecher stowe her sister lucretia mott elizabeth cady stanton and dorothea dix also chafing at the restrictions placed on them by men similarly pressed at the boundaries of acceptable female behavior.
finally in 1840 the patience of several women snapped.
a group of american female delegates arrived at a world antislavery convention in london only to be turned away by the men who controlled the proceedings.
angered at the rejection several of the delegates notably lucretia mott and elizabeth cady stanton became convinced that their first duty as reformers should now be to elevate the status of women.
over the next several years mott stanton susan b anthony and the rise of feminism in the 1840s a group of women who had started out as abolitionists began to advocate for the rights of women.
all men and women are created equal they declared.
they argued that women should have the same opportunities as men and should no longer be restricted to the domestic sphere.
this effort reached its peak at the 1848 convention in seneca falls new york where a declaration of sentiments was proclaimed.
just as the womens rights movement of the nineteenth century grew out of the abolitionist movement so the feminist movement of the twentieth century built upon the civil rights movement.
the modern feminist movement often marks its beginning with the publication of betty friedans the feminine mystique in 1963 and the formation of the national organization for women now in 1966.
despite the more than one hundred years separating the two documents that follow the basic sentiments of the seneca falls declaration bear many similarities to the ideas that have shaped feminist thinking of the twentieth and twenty first centuries.
seneca falls 1848 the declaration of sentiments seneca falls convention 1848 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied but one to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a course.
we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it and to insist upon the institution of a new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled.
the history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her.
now in view of this entire disfranchisement of one half the people of this country.
because women do feel themselves aggrieved oppressed and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of the united states.

national organization for women now 1966 the national organization for women s 1966 j statement of purpose j we men and women who hereby constitute ourselves as the national organization for women believe that the time has j come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in america and toward a fully equal partnership of the j sexes as part of the worldwide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.
the purpose of now is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of american society now exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
we believe the time has come to.
confront with concrete action the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of choice which is their right as individual americans and as human beings.
now is dedicated to the proposition that women first and foremost are human beings who like all other people in our society must have the chance to develop their fullest human potential.
we believe that women can achieve such equality only by accepting to the full the challenges and responsibilities they share with all other people in our society as part of the decision making mainstream of american political economic and social life.
we believe that the power of american law and the protection guaranteed by the u s constitution to the civil rights of all individuals must be effectively applied and enforced to isolate and remove patterns of sex discrimination to ensure equality of opportunity in employment and education and equality of civil and political rights and responsibilities on behalf of women as well as for negroes and other deprived groups.
we believe tl i at women will do most to create a new image of women by acting now and by speaking out in behalf of their own equality freedom and human dignity not in pleas for special privilege nor in enmity toward men who are also victims of the current half equality between the sexes but in an active self respecting partnership with men.
by so doing women will develop confidence in their own ability to determine actively in partnership with men the conditions of their life their choices their future and their society.

the library of congress others began drawing pointed parallels between the plight of women and the plight of slaves and in 1848 they organized a convention in seneca falls new york to discuss the question of womens rights.
out of the meeting emerged a dec laration of sentiments patterned on the 1776 declaration of independence which stated that all men and women are created equal that women no less than men have certain inalienable rights.
their most prominent demand was for the right to vote thus launching a movement for woman suffrage that would continue until 1920.
but the document was in many ways more important for its rejection of the whole notion that men and women should be assigned separate spheres in society.
it should not be surprising perhaps that many of the women involved in these feminist efforts were quakers.
quakerism had long embraced the ideal of sexual equality and had tolerated indeed encouraged the emergence of women as preachers and community leaders.
women taught to expect the absence of gender based restrictions in their own communities naturally resented the restrictions they encountered when they moved outside them.
quakers had also been among the leaders of the antislavery movement and quaker women played a leading role within those efforts.
of the women who drafted the declaration of sentiments all but elizabeth cady stanton were quakers.
progress toward feminist goals was limited in the antebellum years but individual women did manage to break the social barriers to advancement.

stone became a successful and influential lecturer on womens rights.
emma willard founder of the troy female seminary in 1821 and catharine beecher who founded the hartford female seminary in 1823 worked on behalf of womens education.
some women expressed their feminist sentiments even in their choice of costume by wearing a distinctive style of dress introduced in the 1850s that combined a short skirt with full length pantalettes an outfit that allowed freedom of movement without loss of modesty.
introduced by the famous actress fanny kemble it came to be called the bloomer costume after one of its advocates amelia bloomer.
it provoked so much controversy that feminists finally abandoned it convinced that the furor was drawing attention away from their more important demands.
there was an irony in this rise of interest in the rights of women.
feminists benefited greatly from their association with other reform movements most notably abolitionism but they also suffered from them.
for the demands of women were usually assigned even by some women themselves a secondary position to what many considered the far greater issue of the rights of slaves.
the crusade against slavery the antislavery movement was not new to the mid nineteenth century.
there had been efforts even before the revolution to limit and even eliminate the institution.
those efforts had helped remove slavery from most of the north by the end of the eighteenth century and had led to the legal prohibition of the international slave trade in 1808.
there were powerful antislavery movements in europe that cried out forcefully against human bondage perhaps most notably from britain where the great antislavery leader william wilberforce had led the effort to abolish the slave trade and later slavery itself from the british empire.
but american anti slavery sentiment remained relatively muted in the first decades after independence.
not until 1830 did it begin to gather the force that would ultimately enable it to overshadow virtually all other efforts at social reform.
early opposition to slavery in the early years of the nineteenth century those who opposed slavery were for the most part a calm and genteel lot expressing moral disapproval but engaging in few overt activities.
to the extent that there was an organized antislavery movement it centered on the concept of colonization the effort to encourage the resettlement of african americans in africa or the american caribbean.
in 1817 a group of prominent colonization white virginians organized the american society colonization society acs which worked carefully to challenge slavery without chaf lenging property rights or southern sensibilities.
the acs proposed antebellum culture and reform 331 a gradual manumission or freeing of slaves with masters receiving compensation through funds raised by private charity or appropriated by state legislatures.
the society would then transport liberated slaves out of the country and help them to establish a new society of their own elsewhere.
the acs was not without impact.
it received some funding from private donors some from congress some from the legislatures of virginia and maryland.
and it arranged the shipment of several groups of african americans out of the country some of them to the west coast of africa where in 1830 they established the nation of liberia which became an independent republic in 1846 its capital monrovia was named for the american president who had presided over the initial settlement.
but the acs was in the end a negligible force.
neither private nor public funding was nearly enough to carry out the vast projects its supporters envisioned.
in the space of a decade they failure of managed to colonize fewer slaves than colonization were born in the united states in a month.
no amount of funding in fact would have been enough there were far too many black men and women in america in the nineteenth century to be transported to africa by any conceivable program.
and in any case the acs met resistance from african americans themselves many of whom were now three or more generations removed from africa and had no wish to move to a land of which they knew almost nothing.
the massachusetts free black paul cuffe had met similar resistance from members of his own race in the early 1800s when he proposed a colonization scheme of his own.
by 1830 in other words the early antislavery movement was rapidly losing strength.
colonization was proving not to be a viable method of attacking the institution particularly since the cotton boom in the deep south was increasing the commitment of planters to their peculiar labor system.
those opposed to slavery had reached what appeared to be a dead end.
garrison and abolitionism ery newspaper garrison and the liberator v this crucial juncture with the antislavery movement seem ngly on the verge of collapse a new figure emerged to trans orm it into a dramatically different phenomenon.
he was azilliam lloyd garrison.
born in massachusetts in 1805 larrison was an assistant in the 1820s to the new jersey quaker benjamin lundy who published the leading antislav of the time the genius of universal emancipation in baltimore.
garrison shared lundys abhorrence of slavery but he soon grew impatient with his employers mod rate tone and mild proposals for reform.
in 1831 therefore ie returned to boston to found his own weekly newspaper he liberator.
garrisons simple philosophy was genuinely revolutionary.
opponents of slavery he said should view the institution rom the point of view of the black man not the white slaveowner.
they should not as earlier reformers had done talk about t e evil influence of slavery on white society instead they s ou talk about the damage the system did to africans.
an t y should therefore reject gradualism and demand the immediate unconditional universal abolition of slavery.
garrison spoke with particular scorn about the advocates of colonization.
they were not emancipationists he argued on the contrary their real aim was to strengthen slavery by ridding the country of those african americans who were already free.
the true aim of foes of slavery he insisted must be to extend to african americans all the rights of american citizenship.
as startling as the drastic nature of his proposals was the relentless uncompromising tone with which he promoted them.
i am aware he wrote in the first issue of the liberator that many object to the severity of my language but is there not cause for severity.
i will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.
i am in earnest i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard garrison soon attracted a large group of followers throughout the north enough to enable him to found the new england american anti slavery society in 1832 and a year anti slavery later after a convention in philadelphia the society american anti slavery society.
membership in the new organizations mushroomed.
by 1835 there were more than 400 chapters of the societies by 1838 there were 1 350 chapters with more than 250 000 members.
antislavery sentiment was developing a strength and assertiveness greater than at any other point in the nations past history.
black abolitionists abolitionism had a particular appeal to the free blacks of the north who in 1850 numbered about 250 000 mostly concentrated in cities.
they lived in conditions of poverty and oppression often worse than those of their slave counterparts in the south.
an english traveler who had visited both sections of the country wrote in 1854 that he was utterly at a loss to imagine the source of that prejudice which subsists against african americans in the northern states a prejudice unknown in the south where the relations between the africans and the european white american are so much more intimate this confirmed an earlier observation by the french observer alexis de tocqueville that the prejudice which repels the negroes seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated northern blacks were often victimized by mob violence they had virtually no access to education they could vote in only a few states and they were barred from all but the most menial of occupations.
most worked either as domestic servants or as sailors in the american merchant marine and their wages were such that they lived in squalor.
some were kidnapped by whites and forced back into slavery.
for all their problems however northern blacks were aware of and fiercely proud of their freedom.
and they remained acutely sensitive to the plight of those members of their race who remained in bondage aware that their own position in society would remain precarious as long as slavery existed.
many in the 1830s came to support garrison to subscribe to his newspaper and to sell subscriptions to it in their 332 chapter 12 fugitive slave law convention abolitionists gathered in cazenovia new york in august 1850 to consider how to respond to the law recently passed by congress requiring northern states to return fugitive slaves to their owners.
frederick douglass is seated just to the left of the table in this photograph of some of the participants.
the gathering was unusual among abolitionist gatherings in including substantial numbers of african americans.
from the collection of the madison county historical society oneida new york free blacks commitment to abolition own communities.
indeed the majority of the liberator s early subscribers were free african americans.
there were also important african american leaders who expressed the aspirations of their race.
one of the most militant was david walker a free black from boston who in 1829 published a harsh pamphlet walker s appeal to the colored citizens.
in it he declared america is more our country than it is the whites we have enriched it with our blood and tears he warned the whites want slaves and want us for their slaves but some of them will curse the day they ever saw us slaves should he declared cut their masters throats should kill or be killed most african american critics of slavery however were less violent in their rhetoric.
sojourner truth a freed black woman spent several years involved in a strange religious cult in upstate new york.
she emerged as a powerful and eloquent spokeswoman for the abolition of slavery.
the greatest african american abolitionist of all and one frederick most electrifying orators of his time douglass black or white was frederick douglass.
born a slave in maryland douglass escaped to massachusetts in 1838 became an outspoken leader of antislavery sentiment and spent two years lecturing in england where members of that countrys vigorous antislavery movement lionized him.
on his return to the united states in 1847 douglass purchased his freedom from his maryland owner and founded an antislavery newspaper the north star in rochester new york.
he achieved wide renown as well for his autobiography narrative of the life of frederick douglass 1845 in which he presented a damning picture of slavery.
douglass demanded for african americans not only freedom but full social and economic equality as well.
what to the american slave is your 4th of july douglass harshly asked in an independence day speech in rochester new york in 1854.
i answer a day that reveals to him more than all other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.
there is not a nation on earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these united states at this very hour black abolitionists had been active for years before douglass emerged as a leader of their cause they had held their first national convention in 1830.
but with douglasss leadership they became a more influential force and they began too to forge alliances with white antislavery leaders such as garrison.
anti abolitionism abolitionism was a powerful force but it provoked a powerful opposition as well.
almost all white southerners of course looked on the movement with fear and contempt.
but so too did many northern whites.
indeed even in the north aboli tionists were never more than a small dissenting minority.
to its critics the abolitionist crusade was a dangerous and frightening threat to the existing social system.
some whites correctly warned that it would produce a terrible war between the sections.
others feared also correctly that it might antebellum culture and reform 333 lead to a great influx of free blacks into the north.
the strident outspoken abolition movement seemed to many northern whites a sign of the disorienting social changes their society was experiencing yet another threat to stability and order.
to other northerners mostly men of business abolition was a threat to lucrative trade with the south.
the result was an escalating wave of violence directed against abolitionists in the 1830s.
when prudence crandall attempted to admit several african american girls to her private school in connecticut local citizens had her arrested violent threw filth into her well and forced her to reprisals close down the school.
a mob in philadelphia attacked the abolitionist headquarters the temple of liberty in 1834 burned it to the ground and began a bloody race riot.
another mob seized garrison on the streets of boston in 1835 and threatened to hang him.
authorities saved him from death only by locking him in jail.
elijah lovejoy the editor of an abolitionist newspaper in alton illinois was a repeated victim of mob violence.
william lloyd garrison garrison was the first member of the antislavery movement to call publicly for immediate and complete emancipation of slaves.
that was in 1831 and for the next three decades he remained a stern and uncompromising enemy of slavery.
after the civil war however garrison displayed little interest in the plight of the blacks he had tried to emancipate.
instead he turned to women s suffrage indian rights and the prohibition of alcohol.
fpg getty images three times angry whites invaded his offices and smashed his presses.
three times lovejoy installed new machines and began publishing again.
when a mob attacked his office a fourth time late in 1837 he tried to defend his press.
the attackers set fire to the building and as lovejoy fled shot and killed him.
that so many men and women continued to embrace abolitionism in the face of such vicious opposition from within their own communities suggests much about the nature of the movement.
abolitionists were not people who made their political commitments lightly or casually.
they were strong willed passionate crusaders displaying enormous courage and moral strength and displaying too at times a level of fervor that many of their contemporaries found disturbing.
abolitionists were widely denounced even by some who shared their aversion to slavery as wild eyed fanatics bent on social revolution.
the anti abolitionist mobs in other words were only the most violent expression of a sentiment that many other white americans shared.
abolitionism divided moderates versus extremists by the mid 1830s the abolitionist crusade had become impossible to ignore.
it had also begun to experience serious internal strains and divisions.
one reason was the violence of the anti abolitionists which persuaded some members of the movement that a more moderate approach was necessary.
another reason was the growing radicalism of william lloyd garrison who shocked even many of his own allies including frederick douglass by attacking not only slavery but the government itself.
the constitution he said was a covenant with death and an agreement with hell the nations churches he claimed were bulwarks of slavery.
in 1840 finally garrison precipitated a formal division within the american anti slavery society by insisting that women who had always been central to the organizations work be permitted to participate in the movement on terms of full equality.
he continued after 1840 to arouse controversy with new more radical stands an extreme pacifism that rejected even defensive wars opposition to all forms of coercion not just slavery but prisons and asylums as well and finally in 1843 a call for northern disunion from the south.
the nation could garrison suggested purge itself of the sin of slavery by expelling the slave states from the union.
from 1840 on therefore abolitionism moved in many channels and spoke with many different voices.
the garrisonians remained influential with their uncompromising moral stance.
others operated in moderate ways arguing that abolition could be accomplished only as the result of a long patient peaceful struggle hmmediate abolition gradually accomplished as they called it.
at first such moderates depended on moral suasion they would appeal to the conscience of the slaveholders and convince them that their institution was sinful.
when that produced no results they turned to political action seeking to induce the northern states and the federal government to aid the cause wherever the abolition of slavery ft1tt t.
thirteenth amendment to the constitution ratified in 1865 following the civil war abol 1 jli e ished slavery in the united states.
but the effort to abolish slavery did not begin or end in north america.
emancipation in the united states was part of a worldwide antislavery movement that had begun in the late eighteenth century and continued through the end of the nineteenth.
the movement to end slavery reflected the ideals of the enlightenment which inspired new concepts of individual freedom and political equality.
as enlightenment ideas spread throughout the western world in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries introducing human rights and individual liberty to the concept of civilization people on both sides of the atlantic began to ask whether slavery was compatible with these new ideas.
some enlightenment thinkers including some of the founders of the american republic anti slave message this sampler conveys a potent anti slave message thou god seest me originally from the bible genesis 16 13 this quote expresses the sentiment that the kneeling slave should be seen as a man rather than chattel.
wilberforce house hull city museums and art galleries uk the bridgeman art library believed that freedom was appropriate for white people but not for people of color.
but others came to believe that all human beings had an equal claim to liberty and their views became the basis for an escalating series of antislavery movements.
opponents of slavery first targeted the slave trade the vast commerce in human beings that had grown up in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and had come to involve large parts of europe africa the caribbean and north and south america.
in the aftermath of the revolutions in america france and haiti in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the attack on the slave trade gained momentum.
the english reformer william wilberforce spent years attacking britain s connection with the slave trade arguing against it on moral and religious grounds.
after the haitian revolution he argued as well that the continuation of slavery would create more slave revolts.
in 1807 he persuaded parliament to pass a law ending the slave trade within the entire british empire the british example combined with political economic and military pressure from london persuaded many other nations to make the international slave trade illegal the united states in 1808 france in 1814 holland in 1817 and spain in 1845.
trading in slaves continued within countries and colonies where slavery remained legal including the united states and some illegal slave trading continued throughout the atlantic world.
but the sale of slaves steadily declined after 1807.
the last known shipment of slaves across the atlantic from africa to cuba occurred in 1867.
ending the slave trade was a great deal easier than ending slavery itself.
but pressure to abolish slavery grew steadily throughout the nineteenth century with wilberforce once more helping lead the international outcry against the institution.
in haiti the slave revolts that began in 1791 eventually abolished not only slavery but also french rule.
in some parts of south america slavery came to an end with the overthrow of spanish rule in the possible.
they joined the garrisonians in helping runaway slaves find refuge in the north or in canada through the so called underground railroad although their efforts were never as highly organized as the term suggests.
they helped fund the legal battle over the spanish slave vessel amistad.
later after the supreme court in prigg v pennsylvania 1842 ruled that states need not aid in enforcing the 1793 law requiring the return of fugitive slaves to their owners abolitionists secured the passage of personal liberty laws in several northern states.
these laws forbade state officials to assist 334 in the capture and return of runaways.
above all the antislavery societies petitioned congress to abolish slavery in places where the federal government had jurisdiction in the territories and in the district of columbia and to prohibit the interstate slave trade.
but political abolitionism had severe limits.
few members of the movement believed that congress could constitutionally interfere with a domestic institution such as slavery within the individual states themselves.
the abolitionists never formed a political party.
antislavery sentiment underlay the formation in 1840 of the liberty party antebellum culture and reform 335 1820s.
simon bolivar the great leader of latin american independence considered abolishing slavery an important part of his mission.
he freed those slaves who joined his armies and he insisted on prohibitions of slavery in several of the constitutions he helped frame.
in 1833 the british parliament passed a law abolishing slavery throughout the british empire and compensated slaveowners for freeing their slaves.
france abolished slavery in its empire in 1848.
in the caribbean spain followed britain in slowly eliminating slavery from its colonies.
puerto rico abolished slavery in 1873 and cuba became the last colony in the caribbean to end slavery in 1886 in the face of increasing slave resistance and the declining profitability of slave based plantations.
brazil was the last nation in the americas to end the system in 1888.
the brazilian military began to turn against slavery after the valiant participation of slaves in brazil s war with paraguay in the late 1860s eventually educated brazilian civilians began to oppose the system too arguing that it obstructed economic and social progress.
in the united states the power of world opinion and the example of wilberforces movement in england became an important spur to the abolitionist movement as it gained strength in the 1820s and 1830s american abolitionism in turn helped reinforce the movements abroad.
frederick douglass the former slave turned abolitionist became a major figure in the international antislavery movement and was a much admired and much sought after speaker in england and europe in the 1840s and 1850s.
no other nation paid as terrible a price for abolishing slavery as did the united states during its civil war but american emancipation was nevertheless a part of a worldwide movement toward ending legalized human bondage.

but this party and its successors never campaigned for outright abolition an illustration of the important fact that antislavery and abolitionism were not always the same thing.
they stood instead for free soil for keeping slavery out of the territories.
some free soilers were concerned about the welfare of african americans others cared nothing about the slaves but simply wanted to keep the west a country for whites.
garrison dismissed free soilism as white manism but the free soil position would ultimately do harriet beecher stowe what abolitionism never could accomplish attract the support of large numbers even a majority of the white population of the north.
the frustrations of political abolitionism drove some critics of slavery to embrace more drastic measures.
a few began to advocate violence a group of prominent abolitionists in new england for example funneled money and arms to john brown to enable bloody uprisings in kansas and virginia see pp.
356 357 360.
others attempted to arouse widespread public anger through propaganda.
abolitionist descriptions of slavery for example theodore dwight weld and angelina grimkes american slavery as it is testimony of a thousand witnesses 1839 presented what the authors claimed were careful factual pictures of slavery but what were in fact highly polemical often wildly distorted images.
the most powerful document of abolitionist propaganda however was a work of fiction harriet beecher stowe s uncle toms cabin.
it appeared first in 1851 1852 as a serial in an antislavery weekly.
then in 1852 it was published as a book.
it rocked the nation selling more than 300 000 copies within a year of publication and was later issued again and again to become one of the most remarkable best sellers in american history.
stowes novel emerged not just out of abolitionist politics but also out of a popular tradition of sentimental novels written by and largely for women.
see patterns of popular culture pp.
336 337 stowe combined the emotional conventions of the sentimental novel with the political ideas of the abolition movement and to sensational effect.
her novel by embedding the antislavery message within a familiar and popular literary form succeeded in bringing the message of abolitionism to an enormous new audience not only those who read the book but also those who watched dramatizations of its story by countless theater companies throughout the nation.
the novels emotional portrayal of good kindly slaves victimized by a cruel system of the loyal trusting uncle tom of the vicious overseer simon legree described as a new englander so as to prevent the book from seeming to be an attack on southern whites of the escape of the beautiful eliza of the heartrending death of little eva all became a part of american popular legend.
reviled throughout the south stowe became a hero to many in the north.
and in both regions her novel helped to inflame sectional tensions to a new level of passion.
few books in american history have had so great an impact on the course of public events.
even divided therefore abolitionism remained a powerful influence on the life of the nation.
only a relatively small number of people before the civil war ever accepted the abolitionist position that slavery must be entirely eliminated in a single stroke.
but the crusade that garrison had launched and that thousands of committed men and women kept alive for three decades was a constant visible reminder of how deeply the institution of slavery was dividing america.
abolitionisms enduring influence sentimental novels i a s now whhy 9 ven over t a damned mob of scribbling women nathaniel hawthorne complained in 1855 and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash.
hawthorne one of the leading novelists of his time was complaining about the most popular form of fiction in mid nineteenth century america not his own dark and serious works but the sentimental novel a genre of literature written and read mostly by middle class women.
in an age when affluent women occupied primarily domestic roles and in which finding a favorable marriage was the most important thing many women could do to secure or improve their lots in life the sentimental novel gave voice to both female hopes and female anxieties.
the plots of sentimental novels were usually filled with character improving problems and domestic trials but most of them ended with the heroine securely and happily married.
they were phenomenally successful many of them selling more than 100 000 copies each far more than almost any other books of the time.
sentimental heroines were almost always beautiful and endowed with specifically female qualities all the virtues one novelist wrote that are founded in the sensibility of the heart pity the attribute of angels and friendship the balm of life delight to dwell in the female breast.
women were highly sensitive creatures the sentimental writers believed incapable of disguising their feelings and subject to fainting mysterious illnesses trances and of course tears things rarely expected of men.
but they were also capable of a kind of nurturing love and natural sincerity that was hard to find in the predominantly male public world.
in susan warner s the wide wide world 1850 for example the heroine a young girl named ellen montgomery finds herself suddenly thrust into the wide wide world of male competition after her father loses his fortune.
she is unable to adapt to this world but she is saved in the end when she is taken in by wealthy relatives who will undoubtedly prepare her for a successful marriage.
they restore to her the security and comfort to which she had been born and without which she seemed unable to thrive.
sentimental novels accepted uncritically the popular assumptions about women s special needs and desires and they offered stirring tales of how women satisfied them.
but sentimental novels were not limited to romanticized images of female fulfillment through protection and marriage.
they hinted as well at the increasing role of women in reform movements.
many such books portrayed women dealing with social and moral problems and using their highly developed female sensibilities to help other women escape from their troubles women were particularly suitable for such reform work the writers implied because they were specially gifted at helping and nurturing others.
looking back the rapidly changing society of antebellum america produced a remarkable upsurge of cultural nationalism and reform.
writers artists intellectuals and others drew heavily from new european notions of personal liberation a set of ideas often known as romanticism.
but they also strove to create a truly american culture unbeholden to european models.
the literary and artistic life of the nation expressed the rising interest in personal liberation in giving individuals the freedom to explore their own souls and to find in nature a full expression of their divinity.
it also called attention to some of the nations glaring social problems.
reformers too made use of the romantic belief in the divinity of the individual.
they flocked to religious revivals worked on behalf of such moral reforms as temperance supported education and stirred the beginnings of feminism.
above all in the north they rallied against slavery.
out of this growing antislavery movement emerged a new and powerful phenomenon abolitionism which rejected moderate reform and insisted on nothing less than immediate emancipation of the slaves.
the abolitionist crusade galvanized much of the north.
it also contributed greatly to the growing schism between north and south.

uncle toms cabin uncle tom s cabin did much to inflame public opinion in both the north and the south in the last years before the civil war.
when abraham lincoln was introduced to stowe once in the white house he reportedly said to her so you are the little lady that has brought this great war at the time however stowe was equally well known as one of the most successful american writers of sentimental novels.
7 corbis the most famous sentimental novelist of the nineteenth century was harriet beecher stowe.
most of her books the minister s wooing my wife and i we and our neighbors and others portrayed the travails and ultimate triumphs of women as they became wives mothers and hostesses.
but stowe was and remains best known for her 1852 antislavery novel uncle toms cabin one of the most influential books ever published in america.
as a story about slavery and about an aging black man uncle tom who is unfailingly submissive to his white masters it is in many ways very different from her other novels.
but uncle tom s cabin is a sentimental novel too.
stowe s critique of slavery is based on her belief in the importance of domestic values and family security.
slavery s violation of those values and its denial of that security is what made it so abhorrent to her.
the simple decent uncle tom faces many of the same dilemmas that the female heroines of other sentimental novels encounter in their struggles to find security and tranquillity in their lives.
another way in which women were emerging from their domestic sphere was in becoming consumers of the expanding products of america s industrializing economy.
the female characters in sentimental novels searched not just for love security and social justice they also searched for luxury and for the pleasure of buying some favored item.
susan warner illustrated this aspect of the culture of the sentimental novel and the desires of the women who read them in the wide wide world in her description of the young ellen montgomery in an elegant bookstore buying a bible such beautiful bibles she had never seen she pored in ecstasy over their varieties of type and binding and was very evidently in love with them all.

i hlhit aili n l i irteifnmvt.
n setting the stage until the 1840s the tensions between the north and the south remained relatively contained.
had no new sectional controversies arisen the united states might have avoided a civil war and the two sections might have resolved their differences peaceably over time.
but new controversies did arise all of them centered on slavery.
from the north came the powerful abolitionist movement which rejected compromise and conciliation and attempted with great success to make the elimination of slavery a moral issue that would not be open to compromise.
from the south came a belligerent defense of slavery.
slavery its proponents argued was not a necessary evil but a positive good the best possible system for white southerners who needed a labor force and the best possible system as well for black southerners whom the defenders of slavery insisted needed the paternalistic supervision of white masters.
the west brought these differences to a head most forcefully.
as the nation annexed extensive new lands texas the southwest territories california oregon country and others a single question arose again and again what would be the status of slavery in the territories.
two compromises one in 1850 and another in 1854 failed to contain the conflict.
the result was a dangerous and persistent crisis that produced such bitterness anger and despair on both sides that it could no longer be contained.
by the time abraham lincoln became president in 1860 the nation was beginning to break apart and the momentum toward civil war was becoming almost impossible to reverse.
looking westward the united states acquired more than a million square miles of new territory in the 1840s the greatest wave of expansion since the louisiana purchase nearly forty years before.
by the end of the decade the nation possessed all the territory of the present day united states except alaska hawaii and a few relatively small areas acquired later through border adjustments.
many factors accounted for this great new wave of expansion the most important of which were the hopes and ambitions of the many thousands of white americans who moved into or invested in these new territories.
advocates of expansion justified their goals with a carefully articulated set of ideas an ideology known as manifest destiny which became one of the factors driving white americans to look to the west.
manifest destiny manifest destiny reflected both the burgeoning pride that characterized american nationalism in the mid nineteenth century and the idealistic vision of social perfection that fueled so much of the reform energy of the time.
it rested on the idea that america was destined by god and by history to expand its boundaries over a vast area an area that included but was not necessarily restricted to the continent of north america.
american expansion was not selfish its advocates insisted it was an altruistic attempt to extend american liberty to new realms.
john l osullivan the influential democratic editor who gave the movement its name wrote in 1845 that the american claim to new territory is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federative self government entrusted to us.
mdimesi uestiny represented more tnan pride in the nations political system.
running throughout many of the arguments for expansion was an explicitly racial justification.
throughout the racial 1840s many americans defended the idea of westward expansion by citing the justification superiority of the american race white people of northern european origins.
the nonwhite peoples of the territories could not be absorbed into the republican system.
the indians the mexicans and others in the western regions were racially unfit to be part of an american community manifest destiny advocates insisted.
westward expansion the impending crisis 341 expanding settlement 1810 1850 this map shows the dramatic expansion of the territorial boundaries of the united states in the decades after the louisiana purchase.
by 1850 the nation had reached its present boundaries with the exception of alaska and hawaii which it acquired later.
much of this acquisition occurred in the 1840s.
it also shows the spread of white settlement within the territories and states.
what events contributed to the annexation of new land to the united states in those years.
was therefore a movement to spread both a political system and a racially defined society.
osullivan called racial purity or whiteness the key to the triumph of the nation.
by the 1840s the idea of manifest destiny had spread throughout the nation publicized by the new penny press inexpensive newspapers aimed at a mass audience and fanned by the rhetoric of nationalist politicians.
advocates of manifest destiny disagreed however about how far and by what means the nation should expand.
some had relatively limited territorial goals others envisioned a vast new empire of liberty that would include canada mexico caribbean and pacific islands and ultimately a few dreamed much of the rest of the world.
some believed america should use force to achieve its expansionist goals while others felt that the nation should expand peacefully or not at all.
not everyone embraced the idea of manifest destiny.
henry clay and other prominent politicians feared correctly as it turned out that territorial expansion opposition to would reopen the painful controversy over further s and threaten the stability of the expansion union bm their voices were barely audible over the clamor of enthusiasm for expansion in the 1840s which began with the issues of texas and oregon.

182 chapter 7 new educational opportunities for women the country.
many were frankly aristocratic in outlook training their students to become members of the nations elite.
there were a few schools open to the poor offering education that was clearly inferior to that provided at exclusive schools.
private secondary schools such as those in new england and even many public schools accepted only male students.
yet the early nineteenth century did see some important advances in female education.
in the eighteenth century women received very little education of any kind and the female illiteracy rate at the time of the revolution was very high at least 50 percent.
at the same time however americans had begun to place a new value on the contribution of the republican mother to the training of the new generation.
that raised an important question if mothers remained ignorant how could they raise their children to be enlightened.
beginning as early as the 1770s and accelerating thereafter such concerns led to the creation of a network of female academies throughout the nation usually for the daughters of affluent families.
in 1789 massachusetts required that its public schools serve females as well as males.
other states although not all soon followed.
most white men at least assumed that female education should serve only to make women better wives and mothers.
women therefore had no need for advanced or professional training there was no reason for colleges and universities to make space for female students.
some women however aspired to more.
in 1784 judith sargent murray published an essay defending womens rights to education a defense set in terms very different from those used by most men.
men and women were equal in intellect and potential murray argued.
women therefore should have precisely the same educational opportunities as men.
moreover they should have opportunities to earn their own living to establish a role for themselves in society apart from their husbands and families.
murrays ideas became an inspiration to later generations of women but during most of her own lifetime 1751 1820 they attracted little support.
reformers who believed in the power of education to reform and redeem ignorant and backward people spurred a growing interest in indian education.
because jefferson and his followers liked to think of native americans as noble savages uncivi indian lized but unlike their view of african education americans not necessarily innately infe rior they hoped that schooling the indians in white culture would tame and uplift the tribes.
although white governments did little to promote indian education mis sionaries and mission schools proliferated among the tribes.
almost no white people in the early nineteenth century believed that there was a need to educate african americans almost all of whom were still slaves.
in a few northern states a seminary for women educational opportunities for women were scarce in the early nineteenth century but by the 1820s a number of seminaries were created for young ladies mostly affluent students.
the watercolor on silk is by an unknown artist and portrays two women studying geography.
the granger collection new york some free black children attended segregated schools.
in the south slaveowners generally tried to prevent their black workers from learning to read or write fearful that knowledge would make them unhappy with their condition.
some african americans managed to acquire some education despite these obstacles by teaching themselves and their own children.
but the numbers of literate slaves remained very small.
higher education was much less widely available than education at lower levels despite republican hopes for a higher wide dispersion of advanced knowledge.
education jefferson founded the university of virginia to promote that ideal.
the number of colleges and universities in america grew from nine at the start of the revolution to twenty two by 1800 and continued to increase thereafter.
none of the new schools however was truly public.
even those established by state legislatures in georgia north carolina vermont ohio and south carolina for example relied on private contributions and on tuition fees.
scarcely more than one white man in a thousand and no women blacks or indians had access to college education and those few who did attend universities were almost without excep tion members of prosperous propertied families.
the education that the colleges provided was exceedingly limited narrow training in the classics and a few other areas and intensive work in theology.
indeed the clergy was the only profession for which college training was generally a prerequisite.
a few institutions attempted to provide their students advanced education in other fields.
the college of william and mary in virginia the university of pennsylvania and columbia college in new york all created law schools before 1800 but most lawyers continued to train for their profession simply by apprenticing themselves to practicing attorneys.
the jeffersonian era 183 medicine and science the university of pennsylvania created the first american medical school in the eighteenth century.
in the early nineteenth century however most doctors studied medicine by working with an established practitioner.
some american physicians believed in applying new scientific methods to medicine and struggled against age old prejudices and superstitions.
efforts to teach anatomy for example encountered strong public hostility because of the dissection of cadavers that the study required.
municipal authorities had no understanding of medical science and almost no idea of what to do in the face of the severe epidemics that so often swept their populations only slowly did they respond to the warnings of among others benjamin rush a pioneering philadelphia physician that lack of adequate sanitation programs was to blame for disease.
individual patients often had more to fear from their doctors than from their illnesses.
even the leading advocates of scientific medicine often embraced useless brushin ard dangerous treatments.
benjamin rush for example was an advocate of the new and supposedly scientific techniques of bleeding and purging and many of his patients died.
george washington s death in 1799 was probably less a result of the minor throat infection that had afflicted him than of his physicians efforts to cure him by bleeding and purging.
the medical profession also used its newfound commitment to the scientific method to justify expanding its own role to kinds of care that had traditionally been outside its domain.
most childbirths for example had been attended by female midwives.
in the early nineteenth century physicians began to handle deliveries themselves and to demand restrictions on the decline of role of midwives.
among the results of that midwifery change was a narrowing of opportunities for women midwifery was an important female occupation and a restriction of access to childbirth care for poor mothers who could have afforded midwives but who could not pay the higher physicians fees.
education and professional training in the early republic in medicine and in many other fields thus fell far short of the jeffersonian vision.
indeed efforts to promote education and increase professionalism often had the effect of strengthening existing elites rather than eroding them.
cultural aspirations in the new nation establishment of a national culture many americans in the jeffersonian era may have repudiated the federalist belief in political and economic centralization but most embraced another form of nationalism with great fervor.
having won political independence from europe they aspired now to a form of cultural indepen dence.
in the process they dreamed of an american literary and artistic life that would rival the greatest achievements of europe.
as a popular poem on the rising glory of america had predicted as early as 1772 americans believed that their happy land was destined to become the seat of empire and the final stage of civilization with glorious works of high invention and of wondrous art the united states another eighteenth century writer had proclaimed would serve as the last and greatest theatre for the improvement of mankind such nationalism found expression among other places in early american schoolbooks.
the massachusetts geographer the pennsylvania hospital the ideas of the enlightenment spread through american culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and strengthened the belief that every individual was a divine being and could be redeemed from even the most miserable condition.
hospitals and asylums such as this institution in pennsylvania began to emerge to provide settings for the redemption of the poor the ill and the deviant.

chapter 7 jedidiah morse author of geography made easy 1784 said the country must have its own textbooks to prevent the aristocratic ideas of england from infecting the people.
the connecticut schoolmaster and lawyer noah webster argued similarly that american students should be educated as patriots their minds filled with nationalistic american thoughts.
to encourage a distinctive american culture and help unify the new nation webster insisted on a simplified and americanized system of spelling honor instead of honour for example.
his american spelling book first published in 1783 and commonly known as the blue backed speller eventually sold over 100 million copies to become the noah webster best selling book except for the bible in the history of american publishing.
in addition his school dictionary issued in 1806 was republished in many editions and was eventually enlarged to become in 1828 an american dictionary of the english language.
his speller and his dictionary established a national standard of words and usages.
those americans who aspired to create a more elevated national literary life faced a number of obstacles.
there was a large potential audience for a national literature a substantial reading public created in part by the wide circulation of newspapers and political pamphlets during the revolution.
but there were few opportunities for would be american authors to get their work before the public.
printers preferred to publish popular works by english writers for which they had to pay no royalties magazine publishers filled their pages largely with items clipped from british periodicals.
only those american writers willing to pay the cost and bear the risk of publishing their own works could compete for public attention.
even so a growing number of american authors struggled to create a strong native literature so that as the poet joel barlow wrote true ideas of glory may be implanted in the minds of men here to take the place of the false and destructive ones that have degraded the species in other countries barlow himself one of a group of connecticut writers known as the hartford wits published an epic poem the columbiad in 1807 in an effort to convey the special character of american civilization.
the acclaim it received helped to encourage other native writers.
among the most ambitious was the philadelphian charles brockden brown.
like many americans he was attracted to the relatively new literary form of the novel which had become popular in england in the late eighteenth century and had been successfully imported to america.
but brown sought to do more than simply imitate the english forms he tried to use his novels to give voice to distinctively american themes to convey the soaring passions and intellectual energy of the new nation.
his obsession with originality led him to produce a body of work characterized by a fascination with horror and deviant behavior.
perhaps as a result his novels failed to develop a large popular following.
much more successful was washington irving a resident of new york state who won wide acclaim for his satirical histories of early american life and his powerful fables of society in the new world.
his popular washington folktales recounting the adventures of irving sucj1 american rustics as ichabod crane and rip van winkle made him the widely acknowledged leader of american literary life in his era and one of the few writers of that time whose works would continue to be read by later generations.
perhaps the most influential works by american authors in the early republic were not poems novels or stories but works of history that glorified the nations past.
mercy otis warren who had been an influential playwright and agitator during the 1770s continued her literary efforts with a three volume history of the revolution published in 1805 and emphasizing the heroism of the american struggle.
mason weems an anglican clergyman published a eulogistic life of washington in 1806 which became one of the best selling books of the era.
weems had little interest in historical accuracy.
he portrayed the aristocratic former president as a homespun man possessing simple republican virtues.
he also invented among other things the famous story of washington and the cherry tree.
history like literature was serving as a vehicle for instilling a sense of nationalism in the american people.
religious skepticism the american revolution weakened traditional forms of religious practice by detaching churches from government and by elevating ideas of individual liberty and reason.
by the 1790s only a small proportion of white americans perhaps as few as 10 percent were members of formal churches and ministers were complaining often about the decay of vital piety religious traditionalists were particularly alarmed about the emergence of new rational theologies that reflected modern scientific attitudes and de emphasized the role of god in the world.
some americans including jefferson and franklin embraced deism which had originated among enlightenment philosophers in france.
deists accepted the existence of god but considered god a remote being who after having created the universe had withdrawn from direct involvement with deism lhe human race and its sins.
books and arti cles attacking religious superstitions attracted wide readerships and provoked much discussion among them thomas paines the age of reason published in parts between 1794 and 1796.
paine once declared that christianity was the strangest religion ever set up for it committed a murder upon jesus in order to redeem mankind from the sin of eating an apple religious skepticism also produced the philosophies of universalism and unitarianism which emerged at first as dissenting views within the new england congregational church.
disciples of these new ideas rejected the calvinist behef in predestination arguing that salvation was available to all.
they rejected too the idea of the trinity.
jesus was the jeffersonian era 185 only a great religious teacher they claimed not the son of god.
so wide was the gulf between these dissenters and the congregationalist establishment that it finally became a permanent schism.
james murray who later married judith sargent murray founded the universalist church as a separate denomination in gloucester massachusetts in 1779 the unitarian church was established in boston three years later.
some americans believed that the spread of rationalism marked the end of traditional evangelistic religion in the new nation.
but quite the contrary was true.
in fact most americans continued to hold strong religious beliefs.
what had declined was their commitment to organized churches and denominations which many considered too formal and traditional for their own zealous religious faith.
deism universalism unitarianism and other rational religions seemed more powerful than they actually were because for a time traditional evangelicals were confused and disorganized.
but beginning in 1801 traditional religion staged a dramatic comeback in the form of a wave of revivalism known as the second great awakening.
the second great awakening the origins of the second great awakening lay in the efforts of conservative theologians of the 1790s to fight the spread of religious rationalism and to encourage church establishments to revitalize their organizations.
leaders of several different denominations participated in the evangelizing efforts that drove the revival.
presbyterians tried to arouse the faithful on the western fringe of white settlement and conservatives in the church denounced new light dissenters people who had altered their religious views to make them more compatible with the world of scientific rationalism.
methodism which john wesley had founded in england spread to america in the 1770s and became a formal denomination in 1784 under the leadership of francis asbury.
authoritarian and hierarchical in structure the methodist church sent itinerant preachers throughout the nation to win recruits it soon became the fastest growing denomination in america.
almost as successful were the baptists who were themselves relatively new to america they found an especially fervent following in the south.
by 1800 the revivalist energies of all these denominations were combining to create the greatest surge of evangelical fervor since the first great awakening ane ridge sixty years before beginning among presbyterians in several eastern colleges most notably at yale under the leadership of president timothy dwight the new awakening soon spread rapidly throughout the country reaching its greatest heights in the western regions.
in only a few years a large proportion of the american people were mobilized by the movement and membership in those churches embracing the revival most prominently the methodists the baptists and the presbyterians was mushrooming.
at cane ridge kentucky in the summer of 1801 a group of evangelical ministers presided over the nations first camp meeting an extraordinary revival that lasted several days and impressed all who saw it with its size some estimated that 25 000 people attended and its fervor.
such events became common in subsequent years as the methodists in particular came to rely on them as a way to harvest new members.
the methodist circuit riding preacher peter cartwright won national fame as he traveled from region to region exhorting his listeners to embrace the church.
even cartwright however was often unprepared for the results of his efforts a religious frenzy that at times produced convulsions fits rolling in the dirt and twitching holy jerks the message of the second great awakening was not entirely consistent but its basic thrust was clear individuals must readmit god and christ into their daily lives must embrace a fervent active piety and must reject the skeptical rationalism that threatened traditional beliefs.
even so the wave of revivalism did not serve to restore the religious ideas of the past.
few of the revivalist denominations any longer accepted the idea of predestination and the belief that a person could affect his or her own destiny added intensity to the individuals search for salvation.
the awakening in short combined a more active piety with a belief in god as an active force in the world whose grace could be attained through faith and good works.
the second great awakening also accelerated the growth of different sects and denominations.
it helped create a broad popular acceptance of the idea that men and women could belong to different protestant churches and still be committed to essentially the same christian faith.
finally the new evangelicalism by spreading religious fervor into every area of the nation provided a vehicle for establishing a sense of order and social stability in communities still searching for an identity.
one of the most striking features of the second great awakening was the preponderance of women particularly young women within it.
one reason for this was that women were more numerous in certain regions than men.
adventurous young men often struck out on their own and moved west women for the most part had no such options.
their marriage prospects thus diminished and their futures plagued with uncertainty some women discovered in religion a foundation on which to build their lives.
but even where there was no shortage of men women flocked to the revivals in enormous numbers which suggests that they were responding to their changing economic roles as well.
the movement of industrial work out of the home where women had often contributed to the family economy through spinning and weaving and into the factory a process making rapid strides in the early nineteenth century see pp.
192 193 deprived older women in particular of one of their most important social roles.
religious enthusiasm helped compensate for the losses and adjustments these transitions produced it also provided access to a new range of activities message of the second great awakening camp or revival meetings were popular among some evangelical christians religious revivals in america as early as 1800.
by the 1820s there were approximately 1 000 meetings a year most of them in the south and west.
estimated attendance at some of the larger meetings was as large as 25 000 people.
today there are many megachurches throughout the united states.
although opinions vary on what constitutes a megachurch the hartford institute on religious research lists these characteristics 1 2 000 or more persons in attendance at weekly worship 2 a charismatic authoritative senior minister 3 a very active seven day a week congregational community 4 a multitude of social and outreach ministries and 5 a complex differentiated organizational structure.
by this definition there are more than 1 200 megachurches in the united states most of them located in sunbelt states especially california texas georgia and florida.

chapter 7 african americans and the revivals associated with the churches charitable societies ministering to orphans and the poor missionary organizations and others in which women came to play important roles.
although revivalism was most widespread within white society it penetrated other cultures as well.
in some areas of the country revivals were open to people of all races and many african americans not only attended but eagerly embraced the new religious fervor as well.
out of these revivals in fact emerged a substan tial group of black preachers who became important figures within the slave community.
some of them translated the apparently egalitarian religious message of the second great awakening that salvation was available to all into a similarly egalitarian message for blacks in the present world.
out of black revival meetings in virginia arose an elaborate plan in 1800 devised by gabriel prosser the brother of an african american preacher for a slave rebellion and attack on richmond.
the plan was discovered and the rebellion forestalled by whites but revivalism continued to stir racial unrest in the south.
the spirit of revivalism was also particularly strong in these years among native americans although very different from revivalism in white or black society.
it drew heavily from earlier tribal experiences.
in the 1760s the delaware prophet neolin had sparked a widespread revival in the old northwest with a message combining christian and indian imagery and bringing to native american religion a vision of a personal god intimately involved in the affairs of man.
neolin had also called for indians to rise up in defense of their lands and had denounced the growth of trade and other relationships with white civilization.
his vehement statements had helped stimulate the indian military efforts of 1763 and beyond.
the dislocations and military defeats indians suffered in the aftermath of the american revolution created a sense of crisis among many of the eastern tribes in particular as a result the 1790s and early 1800s became another era of indian religious fervor and prophecy.
presbyterian and baptist missionaries were active among the south ern tribes and sparked a great wave of conversions.
the most important revivalism came from the efforts of another great prophet handsome lake a seneca whose seemingly miraculous rebirth after years of alcoholism helped give him a special stature within his tribe.
handsome lake like neolin before him called for a revival of traditional indian ways.
he claimed to have met jesus who instructed him to tell your people they will become lost when they follow the ways of the white man handsome lakes message spread through the scattered iroquois communities and inspired many indians to give up whiskey gambling and other destructive customs derived from white society.
but the revival did not in fact lead to a true restoration of traditional iroquois culture.
instead handsome lake encouraged christian missionaries to become active within the tribes indians and the second great awakening and he urged iroquois men to abandon their roles as hunters partly because so much of their hunting land had been seized by whites and become sedentary farmers instead.
iroquois women who had traditionally done the farming were to move into more domestic roles.
when some women resisted the change handsome lake denounced them as witches.
he demanded confessions from them and killed some of those who refused.
the second great awakening also had important effects on those americans who did not accept its teachings.
the rational freethinkers whose skeptical philosophies freethinkers helped produce the revivals were in many ways victims of the new religious fervor.
they did not disappear after 1800 but their influence rapidly declined and for many years they remained a small and defensive minority within american christianity.
instead the dominant religious characteristic of the new nation became a fervent evangelicalism which would survive into the mid nineteenth century and beyond.
stirrings of industrialism despite the hopes of jefferson and his followers that the united states would remain a simple agrarian republic the nation took its first tentative steps in these years toward its transformation into an urban industrial society.
technology in america americans imported some of these technological advances from england.
see america in the world pp.
the british government attempted to protect the nations manufacturing preeminence by preventing the export of textile machinery or the emigration of skilled mechanics.
despite such efforts immigrants arrived in the united states with advanced knowledge of english technology eager to introduce the new machines to america.
samuel slater for example used the knowledge he had acquired before leaving england to build a spinning mill for the quaker merchant moses brown in pawtucket rhode island in 1790.
it was the first modern factory in america.
america in the early nineteenth century also produced several important inventors of its own.
among them was oliver evans of delaware who devised a number of ingenious new machines an automated flour mill a card making machine and others.
he made several important improvements in the steam engine and in 1795 he published americas first textbook of mechanical engineering the young mill wrights and millers guide.
his own hour milt which began operations in 1787 required only two men to operate one of them emptying a bag of wheat into the ma c inery another putting the lid on the barrels of flour and rolling them away.
the jeffersonian era 189 the cotton gin eli whitneys cotton gin revolutionized the cotton economy of the south by making the processing of short staple cotton simple and economical.
with the device a single operator could clean as much cotton in a few hours as a group of workers had once needed a whole day to do.
private collection j t vintage the bridgeman art library even more influential for the future of the nation were the inventions of the massachusetts born yale educated eli whitney who revolutionized both cotton production and weapons manufacturing.
the growth of the textile industry in england had created an enormous demand for cotton a demand that planters in the american south were finding impossible to meet.
their greatest obstacle was separating the seeds from cotton fiber a difficult and time consuming process that was essential before cotton could be sold.
long staple or sea island cotton with its smooth black seeds and long fibers was easy to clean but it grew successfully only along the atlantic coast or on the offshore islands of georgia and south carolina.
there was not nearly enough of it to satisfy the demand.
short staple cotton by contrast could grow inland through vast areas of the south.
but its sticky green seeds were extremely difficult to remove.
a skilled worker could clean no more than a few pounds a day by hand.
then in 1793 whitney who was working at the time as a tutor on r the georgia plantation of general nathanael cotton gin greenes widow invented a machine that performed the arduous task quickly and efficiently.
it was dubbed the cotton gin cgin was an abbrevia tion for engine and it transformed the life of the south.
mechanically the gin was very simple.
a toothed roller caught the fibers of the cotton boll and pulled them between the wires of a grating.
the grating caught the seeds while a revolving brush removed the lint from the rollers teeth.
with the device a single operator could clean as much cotton in a few hours as a group of workers had once needed a whole day to do.
the results were profound.
soon cotton growing spread into the upland south and beyond and within a decade total crop production increased eightfold.
african american slavery which with the decline of tobacco production some had considered a dwindling institution the cotton gins impact on the north regained its importance expanded and became more firmly fixed upon the south.
the cotton gin not only changed the economy of the south it also helped transform the north.
the large supply of domestically produced fiber was a strong incentive to entrepreneurs in new england and elsewhere to develop an american textile industry.
few northern states could hope to thrive on the basis of agriculture alone by learning to turn cotton into yarn and thread plantation owners could become industrially prosperous instead.
the manufacturing preeminence of the north which emerged with the development of the textile industry in the 1820s and 1830s helped drive a wedge between the nations two most populous regions one becoming increasingly industrial the other more firmly bound to agriculture.
whitney also made a major contribution to the development of modern warfare and in the process made a contribution to other industrial techniques.
during the two years of undeclared war with france 1798 and 1799 americans were deeply troubled by their lack of sufficient armaments for the expected hostilities.
production of muskets each carefully handcrafted by a skilled gunsmith was discouragingly slow.
whitney devised a machine to make each part of a gun according to an exact pattern.
tasks could thus be divided among several workers and one laborer could quickly assemble a weapon out of parts made by several others.
before long manufacturers of sewing machines clocks and many other complicated products were using the same system.
the new technological advances were relatively isolated phenomena during the early years of the nineteenth century.
not until at least the 1840s did the nation begin to develop a true manufacturing economy.
but the inventions of this period were crucial in making the eventual transformation possible.
transportation innovations one of the prerequisites for industrialization is an efficient system for transporting raw materials to factories and finished goods to markets.
the united states had no such system in the early years of the republic.
but work was under way that would ultimately remove the transportation obstacle.
there were several ways to solve the problem of the small american market.
one was to look for customers overseas and american merchants continued their efforts to do that.
among the first acts of the new congress when it met in 1789 were two tariff bills giving preference to american ships in american ports helping to stimulate an expansion of domestic shipping.
more important indeed the principal reason for the growth of american trade in this period was the outbreak of war in europe in the 1790s allowing yankee merchant vessels to take over most of the carrying trade rapid growth of american between europe and the western shipping hemisphere.
as early as 1793 the young republic had a merchant marine and a 190 chapter 7 pawtucket bridge and falls one reason for the growth of the textile industry in new england in the early nineteenth century was that there were many sources of water power in the region to run the machinery in the factories.
that was certainly the case with slaters mill one of the first american textile factories.
it was located in pawtucket rhode island alongside a powerful waterfall demonstrating the critical importance of water power to early american industry.
bettmann corbis foreign trade larger than those of any country except england.
in proportion to its population the united states had more ships and international commerce than any other country.
between 1789 and 1810 the total tonnage of american vessels engaged in overseas traffic rose from less than 125 000 to nearly 1 million.
american ships had carried only 30 percent of the countrys exports in 1789 they were carrying over 90 percent in 1810.
the figures for american ships carrying imports increased even more dramatically from 17 5 percent to 90 percent in the same period.
another solution to the problem of limited markets was to develop new markets at home by improving transportation between the states and into the interior of the continent.
in river transportation a new era began with the development of the steamboat.
a number of inventors began experimenting with steam powered craft in the late eighteenth century john fitch exhibited a forty five foot vessel with paddles operated by steam to some of the delegates at the constitutional convention in 1787.
but the real breakthrough was oliver evanss development of a high pressure engine lighter and more efficient than james watts which made steam more feasible for powering boats and eventually locomotives as well as mill machinery.
the inventor robert fulton and the promoter robert r livingston were principally responsible for perfecting the steamboat and bringing it to the attention of the nation.
their clermont equipped with paddle wheels and an english built engine sailed up the hudson in the summer of 1807 demonstrating the practicability of steam navigation even though it took the ship thirty hours to go 150 miles.
in 1811 a partner of livingstons nicholas j roosevelt a remote ancestor of theodore roosevelt introduced the steamboat to the west by sending the new orleans from pittsburgh down the ohio and mississippi.
the next year this vessel began a profitable career of service between new orleans and natchez.
robert fultons steamboat meanwhile what was to become known as the turnpike the turnpike era had begun.
in 1792 a corporation era constructed a toll road running the sixty miles from philadelphia to lancaster pennsylvania with a hard packed surface of crushed rock.
this venture proved so successful that several other companies laid out similar turnpikes so named from the kind of tollgate frequently used from other cities to neighboring towns.
since the turnpikes had to produce profits for the companies that the jeffersonian era 191 american stage waggon this image of a stagecoach by j stoner shows how roads were beginning to link the disparate regions of early nineteenth century america.
corbisj built them construction costs had to be low enough and the prospective traffic heavy enough to ensure an early and ample return.
as a result these roads radiating from eastern cities ran comparatively short distances and through densely settled areas.
no private operators were willing to build similar highways over the mountains and into the less populated interior.
state governments and the federal government eventually had to finance them.
the rising cities despite all the changes and all the advances america in the early nineteenth century remained an overwhelmingly rura and agrarian nation.
only 3 percent of the non indian popu a tion lived in towns of more than 8 000 at the time of t e sec ond census in 1800.
ten percent lived west of the appa ac ian mountains far from what urban centers there were.
muc the country remained a wilderness.
even the nations argest cities could not begin to compare either in size or in cultural sophistication with such european capitals as london and paris.
yet here too there were signs of change.
the leading american cities might not yet have become world capitals but they were large and complex enough to rival the important secondary cities of europe.
philadelphia with 70 000 residents and new york with 60 000 were becoming major centers of commerce and learning.
the cities were aiso developing a distinctively urban culture.
so too were the next largest cities of the new nation baltimore 26 000 in 1800 boston 24 000 and charleston 20 000.

america in the world the global industrial revolution i tentative stirrings of industrial activity in the united states in the early nineteenth cen i tury were part of a vast movement that over the course of the century transformed much of the globe.
historians differ over precisely when the industrial revolution began but it is clear that by the end of the eighteenth century it was well under way in many parts of the world.
by the beginning of the twentieth century industrialization had transformed the societies of britain most of continental europe japan and the united states.
for americans the industrial revolution was largely a result of the rapid changes in great britain the nation with which they had the closest relations.
britain was the first nation to develop significant industrial capacity.
the factory system took root in england in the late eighteenth century revolutionizing the manufacture of cotton thread and cloth.
one invention followed another in quick succession.
improvements in weaving drove improvements in spinning and these changes created a demand for new devices for carding combing and straightening the fibers for the spinner.

among the most popular such facilities were canals among them the regents canal in london pictured here in the 1820s.
guildhall library corporation of london uk the bridgeman art library wind and animal power continued to be important in the textile industry but more important was the emergence of steam power which proliferated after the appearance of james watt s advanced steam engine patented in 1769.
england s textile industry quickly became the most profitable in the world and it helped encourage comparable advances in other fields of manufacturing as well.
despite the efforts of the british government to prevent the export of english industrial technology knowledge of the new machines reached other nations quickly usually through the emigration of people who had learned the technology in british factories.
america benefited the most from english technology because it received more immigrants from great britain than from any other country.
but english technology spread quickly to the nations of continental europe as well.
in japan the sudden intrusion of american and european traders helped cause the so called meiji reforms of the 1880s and 1890s which launched a period of rapid industrialization there.
industrialization changed not just the world s economies but also its societies.
first in england and then in europe america and japan social systems underwent wrenching changes.
hundreds of thousands and eventually millions of men and women moved from rural areas into cities to work in factories where they experienced both the benefits and the costs of industrialization many of those who moved from farm to factory experienced some improvement in nutrition and other material circumstances even in their health.
but there were psychological costs to being suddenly uprooted from one way of life and thrust into another fundamentally different one.
little in most workers prior experience had prepared them for the nature of industrial labor the routinized rigidly scheduled work of the urban factory contrasted sharply with the varying seasonal work pattern of the rural economy.
industrial workers experienced too a fundamental change in their relationship the wealthiest farmers.
they sought increasing elegance and refinement in their homes their grounds and their dress.
they also looked for diversions music theater dancing and for many people one of the most popular entertainments of all horse racing.

much remained to be done before this small and still half formed nation would become a complex modern society.
it was still possible in the early nineteenth century to believe that those changes might not ever occur.
but forces were already at work that in time would lastingly transform the united states.

unlike rural landlords and local aristocrats factory owners and managers the new class of industrial capitalists many of them accumulating unprecedented wealth were usually remote and inaccessible.
they dealt with their workers impersonally and the result was a growing schism between the two classes each lacking access to or understanding of the other.
working men and women throughout the globe began thinking of themselves as a distinct class with common goals and interests.
their efforts simultaneously to adjust to their new way of life and to resist its most damaging aspects sometimes created great social turbulence.
battles between workers and employers became a characteristic feature of industrial life throughout the world.
life in industrial nations changed at every level.
populations in industrial countries grew rapidly and people began to live longer.
at the same time industrial cities began to produce great increases in pollution crime and until modern sanitation systems emerged infectious disease.
around the industrial world middle classes expanded and came to dominate the economy although not always the culture or the politics of their nations.
not since the agricultural revolution thousands of years earlier when many humans had turned from hunting to farming for sustenance had there been an economic change of a magnitude comparable to that of the industrial revolution.

we are all republicans we are all federalists he said in his naugural address.
and during his eight years in office he did nuch to prove those words correct.
there was no complete epudiation of federalist policies no true revolution.
indeed it times jefferson seemed to outdo the federalists at their own work most notably in overseeing a remarkable expansion of he territory of the united states.
the federal city and the people s president the newly founded national capital was the city of washington.
the french architect pierre lenfant had designed the capital the n n a rand sca e with broad avenues radi capital city atlng out from the uncompleted capitol building set on one of the area s highest hills.
washington was many americans believed to become the paris of the united states.
in reality however throughout jeffersons presidency and indeed through most of the nineteenth century washington remained little more than a provincial village.
although the population increased steadily from the 3 200 counted in the 1800 census it never rivaled that of new york philadelphia or the other major cities of the nation.
the city remained a raw inhospitable community with few public buildings of any consequence.
members of congress viewed washington not as a home but as a place to visit briefly during sessions of the legislature and leave as quickly as possible.
most lived in a cluster of simple boardinghouses in the vicinity of the capitol.
it was not unusual for a member of congress to resign his seat in the midst of a session to return home if he had an opportunity to accept the more prestigious post of member of his state legislature.
jefferson set out as president to act in a spirit of democratic simplicity in keeping with the frontierlike character of the unfinished federal city.
he was a wealthy and aristocratic planter by background the owner of more than 100 slaves and a man of rare cultivation and sophistication but he conveyed to the public an image of plain almost crude disdain for pretension.
he walked like an ordinary citizen to and from his inauguration at the capitol.
in the presidential mansion which had not yet acquired the name white house he disregarded the courtly etiquette of his predecessors in part no doubt because as a widower he had no first lady to take charge of social affairs.
at state dinners he let his guests scramble pell mell for places at the table.
he did not always bother to dress up once prompting the fastidious british ambassador to complain of being received by the president in coat and pantaloons that were indicative of utter slovenliness and indifference to appearances yet jefferson managed nevertheless to impress most of those who knew him.
he was a brilliant conversationalist a gifted writer and one of the nations most intelligent and creative men with perhaps a wider range of interests and accomplishments than any public figure in american history.
in addition to politics and diplomacy he was an active architect educator inventor scientific farmer and philosopher scientist.
jefferson was above all a shrewd and practical politician.
on the one hand he went to great lengths to eliminate the aura of majesty surrounding the presi 7 politician dency that he believed his predecessors had created.
at the same time however jefferson worked hard to exert influence as the leader of his 194 chapter 7 few bern 1710 wilmington 1730 1 i i i charleston h i 1 savannah 1733 north america in 1800 this map illustrates how substantially the non indian settlement of british north america much of it by 1800 the united states had expanded since 1700.

although the republicans had objected strenuously to the efforts of their federalist predecessors to build a network of influence through patronage jefferson too used his powers of appointment as an effective political weapon.
by the end of his first term about half the government jobs and by the end of his second term practically all of them were in the hands of loyal republicans.
when jefferson ran for reelection in 1804 he won overwhelmingly.

tribute or war is the usual alternative of these barbary pirates he said.
why not build a navy and decide on war in 1801 the pasha leader of tripoli forced jeffersons hand.
unsatisfied by the american response to his extortionate demands he ordered the flagpole of the american consulate chopped down a symbolic declaration of war.
jefferson responded cautiously building up the american fleet in the region over the next several years.
finally in 1805 the united states reached an agreement with the pasha that ended american payments of tribute to tripoli but required the united states to pay a substantial and humiliating ransom of 60 000 for the release of american prisoners seized by barbary pirates.
dollars and ships conflict with the courts under washington and adams the republicans believed the government had been needlessly extravagant.
yearly federal expenditures had almost tripled between 1793 and 1800.
hamilton had as he had intended increased the public debt and created an extensive system of internal taxation including the hated whiskey excise tax.
the jefferson administration moved deliberately to reverse the trend.
in 1802 it persuaded congress to abolish all internal taxes leaving customs duties and the sale limiting the c r federal western lands as the only sources of rev government enue for the government.
meanwhile secretary of the treasury albert gallatin drastically reduced government spending cutting the already small staffs of the executive departments to minuscule levels.
although jefferson was unable to retire the entire national debt as he had hoped he did cut it almost in half from 83 million to 45 million during his presidency.
jefferson also scaled down the armed forces.
he reduced the army of 4 000 men to 2 500.
he cut the navy from twenty five ships to seven and reduced the number of officers and sailors accordingly.
anything but the smallest of standing armies he argued might menace civil liberties and civilian control of government.
and a large navy he feared might promote overseas commerce which jefferson believed should remain secondary to agriculture.
yet jefferson was not a pacifist.
at the same time that he was reducing the size of the army and navy he was helping to establish the united states military academy at west point founded in 1802.
and when trouble began brewing overseas he began again to build up the fleet.
such trouble appeared first in the mediterranean off the coast of northern africa.
for years the barbary states of north africa morocco algiers tunis and tripoli now part of libya had been demanding protection money from all na r tions whose ships sailed the mediterranean.
fxzv even great britain gave regular contribu pirates tions t0 the barbary pirates.
during the 1780s and 1790s the united states agreed having won control of the executive and legislative branches of government the republicans looked with suspicion on the judiciary which remained largely in the hands of federalist judges.
soon after jeffersons first inauguration his followers in congress launched an attack on this last preserve of the opposition.
their first step was the repeal of the judiciary act of 1801 thus eliminating the judgeships to which adams had made his midnight appointments the debate over the courts led to one of the most important judicial decisions in the history of the nation.
federalists had long maintained that the supreme review court had the authority to nullify acts of congress although the constitution said nothing specifically to support the claim and the court itself had actually exercised the power of judicial review in 1796 when it upheld the validity of a law passed by the legislature.
but the courts authority in this area would not be secure it was clear until it actually declared a congressio nal act unconstitutional.
in 1803 in the case of marbury v madison it did so.
william marbury one of adamss midnight appointments had been named a justice of the peace in the district of columbia.
but his commission although signed and madison sealed had not been delivered to him before adams left office.
once jefferson became president the new secretary of state james madison was responsible for transmitting appointments.
he had refused to hand over the commission to marbury.
marbury appealed to the supreme court for an order directing madison to perform his official duty.
in its historic ruling the court found that marbury had a right to his commission but that the court had no authority to order madison to deliver it.
on the surface therefore the decision was a victory for the administration.
but of much greater importance than the relatively insignificant matter of marburys commission was the courts reason ing in the decision.
the original judiciary act of 1789 had given the court the power to compel executive officials to act in such matters as horse racing in early america 1 r t it if it 1 horse racing began in north america almost as soon as j3 u o avi a jlji europeans settled the english colonies.
formal racing followed quickly.
the first race track in north america new market named for a popular race course in england was established in 1665 near the site of present day garden city on long island in new york.
tracks quickly developed wide appeal and soon horse racing had spread up and down the atlantic coast.

andrew jackson was a founder of the first racing track in nashville tennessee in the early nineteenth century.
kentucky whose native bluegrass was early recognized as ideal for grazing horses had eight tracks by 1800.
like almost everything else in the life of early america the world of horse racing was bounded by lines of class and race.
for many years it was considered the exclusive preserve of gentlemen so much so that in 1674 a court in virginia fined james bullocke a tailor for proposing a race it being contrary to law for a labourer to make a race being a sport only for gentlemen.
but while white aristocrats retained control of racing they were not the only people who participated in it.
southern aristocrats often trained young male slaves as jockeys for their horses just as northern horse owners employed the services of free blacks as riders.
in the north and the south african americans eventually emerged as some of the most talented and experienced trainers of racing horses.
and despite social and legal pressures free blacks and poor whites often staged their own informal races.
racing also began early to reflect the growing sectional rivalry between the north and the south.
in 1824 the union race course on long island established an astounding 24 000 purse for a race between two famous thoroughbreds american eclipse from the north the delivery of commissions and it was on that basis that marbury had filed his suit.
but the court ruled that congress had exceeded its authority in creating that statute that the constitution had defined the powers of the judiciary and that the legislature had no right to expand them.
the relevant section of the 1789 act was therefore void.
in seeming to deny its own authority the court was in fact radically enlarging it.
the justices had repudiated a relatively minor power the power to force the delivery of a commission by asserting a vastly greater one the power to nullify an act of congress.
the chief justice of the united states at the time of the ruling was john marshall one of the towering figures in the history of american law.
a leading federalist and prominent virginia lawyer he had served john adams as secretary of state.
it had been marshall ironically who had neglected to deliver marbury s commission in the closing hours of the administration.
in 1801 just before leaving office adams had appointed him chief justice and almost immediately marshall established himself as the dominant figure on the court john shaping all its most important rulings marshall including of course marbury v madison.
through a succession of republican administrations he established the judiciary as a branch of government coequal with the executive and the legislature a position that the founders of the republic had never clearly indicated it should occupy.
jefferson recognized the threat that an assertive judiciary could pose to his policies.
even while the marbury case was impeachment sti11 pendin8 he was preparing for a re of samuel newed assault on this last federalist strong chase hold.
he urged congress to impeach obstructive judges and congress attempted to oblige him.
the republicans successfully removed from office a district judge john pickering of new hampshire on the perhaps specious grounds that he was insane and thus unfit for office.
they later targeted a justice of the supreme court itself justice samuel chase a highly partisan federalist.
chase had certainly been injudicious he had for example delivered 16.

american eclipse won two of the three heats but a southern racehorse prevailed in another such celebrated contest in 1836.
these intersectional races which drew enormous crowds and created tremendous publicity continued into the 1850s until the north south rivalry began to take a deadly form.
horse racing remained popular after the civil war but two developments changed its character considerably.
one was the successful effort to drive african americans out of the sport.
at least until the 1890s black jockeys and trainers remained central to racing.
at the first kentucky derby in 1875 fourteen of the fifteen horses had african american riders.
one black man isaac murphy won a remarkable 44 percent of all races in which he rode including three kentucky derbys.
gradually however the same social dynamics that enforced racial segregation in so many other areas of american life penetrated racing as well.
by the beginning of the twentieth century white jockeys and organized jockey clubs had driven almost all black riders and many black trainers out of the sport the second change was the introduction of formalized betting to the sport.
in the late nineteenth century race tracks began creating betting systems to lure customers to the races.
at the same time that the breeding of racehorses was moving into the hands of enormously wealthy families the audience for racing was becoming increasingly working class and lower middle class.
the people who now came to tracks were mostly white men and some white women lured to the races not by a love of horses which were coming to play a less central role in their everyday lives but by the usually futile hope of quick and easy riches through gambling.

but he had committed no crime.
some republicans argued however that impeachment was not merely a criminal proceeding.
congress could properly impeach a judge for political reasons for obstructing the other branches of the government and disregarding the will of the people.
at jeffersons urging the house impeached chase and sent him to trial before the senate early in 1805.
but republican leaders were unable to get the necessary two thirds vote for conviction in the senate.
chases acquittal helped establish that impeachment would not become a routine political weapon that something more than partisan disagreement should have to underlie the process a precedent that congress only occasionally violated in future years.
marshall remained secure in his position as chief justice.
and the judiciary survived as a powerful force within the government more often than not ruling on behalf of the centralizing expansionary policies that the republicans had hoped to reverse.

but napoleon wanted to regain the lands west of the mississippi which now belonged to spain over which napoleon now exercised strong influence.
under the secret treaty of san udefonso of 1800 between the french and the spanish france regained title to louisiana which included almost the whole of the mississippi valley to the west of the river plus new orleans near its mouth.
the louisiana territory would napoleon hoped become the heart of a great french empire in america.
also part of napoleon s empire in the new world were the sugar rich and strategically valuable west indian islands that still belonged to france guadeloupe martinique and above all santo domingo.
but unrest among the caribbean slaves posed a threat to napoleons hopes for the islands.
africans in santo domingo inspired by the french revolution revolted and created a republic of their own under the re toussaint markable black leader toussaint louverture.
louverture taking advantage of a truce in his war with england napoleon sent an army to the west indies.
it temporarily crushed the insurrection and restored french authority but the incident was an early sign of the problems napoleon would have in realizing his ambitions in america.
jefferson was unaware at first of napoleons imperial ambitions in america and for a time he pursued a foreign policy that reflected his well known admiration for france.
he appointed as american minister to paris the ardently pro french robert r livingston.
he worked to secure ratification of the franco american settlement of 1800 and began observing the terms of the treaty even before it was ratified.
the adams administration had joined with the british in recognizing and supporting the rebel regime of toussaint louverture in santo domingo jefferson assured the french minister in washington that the american people especially those of the slaveholding states did not approve of the black revolutionary who they thought was setting a bad example for their own slaves.
he even implied that the united states might join with france in putting down the rebellion although nothing ever came of the suggestion.
jefferson began to reconsider his position toward france however when he heard rumors of the secret transfer of louisiana.
jefferson was even more alarmed when in the fall of 1802 he learned that the spanish intendant at new orleans who still governed the city since the french had not yet taken formal possession of the region had announced a disturbing new regulation.
american ships sailing the mississippi river had for many years been accustomed to depositing their cargoes in new orleans for transfer to oceangoing vessels.
the intendant now forbade the practice even though spain had guaranteed americans that right in the pinckney treaty of 1795 thus effectively closing the lower mississippi to american shippers.
westerners demanded that the federal government do something to reopen the river.
the president faced a dilemma.
if he yielded to the frontier clamor and tried to change the po icy by force he would run the risk of a major war the jeffersonian era 199 west point creating a professional military was an important task for the leaders of the early republic.
without an army they realized it would be diffi cult for the united states to win respect in the world.
the establishment in 1802 of the united states military academy at west point whose parade ground is pictured here was therefore an important event in the early history of the republic.
west point museum collections united states military academy with france.
if he ignored the westerners demands he might lose political support.
but jefferson saw another solution.
he instructed robert livingston the american ambassador in paris to negotiate the purchase of new orleans.
livingston on his own authority proposed that the french sell the united states the vast western part of louisiana as well.
in the meantime jefferson persuaded congress to appropriate funds for an expansion of the army and the construction of a river fleet and he deliberately gave the impression that american forces might soon descend on new orleans and that the united states might form an alliance with great britain if the problems napoleons rance were not reslved.
perhaps that offer was why napoleon suddenly decided to ac cept livingston s proposal and offer the united states the entire louisiana territory.
napoleon had good reasons for the decision.
his plans for an american empire had already gone seriously awry.
that was partly because a yellow fever epidemic had wiped out much of the french army in the new world.
but it was also because the expeditionary force napoleon sent to take possession of louisiana had been frozen into a dutch harbor through the winter of 1802 1803.
by the time the harbor thawed in the spring of 1803 napoleon was preparing for a renewed war in europe.
he would not he realized have the resources now to secure an american empire.
the louisiana purchase faced with napoleons startling proposal livingston and james monroe whom jefferson had sent to paris to assist in the negotiations had to decide first whether they should even consider making a treaty for the purchase of the entire louisiana territory since they had not been authorized by their government to do so.
but fearful that napoleon might withdraw the offer they decided to proceed without further instructions from home.
after some haggling over the price livingston and monroe signed the agreement on april 30 1803.
by the terms of the treaty the united states was to pay a total of 80 million francs 15 million to the french government.
the united states was also to grant certain exclusive commercial privileges to france in the port of new orleans and was to incorporate the residents of louisiana into the union with the same rights and privileges as other citizens.
the boundaries of the purchase were not clearly defined the treaty simply specified that louisiana would occupy the same extent as it had when france and spain had owned it.

note too how much of this enormous territory lay outside the orbit of even these ambitious explorations.
how did the american public react to the addition of these new territories.
in washington the president was both pleased and embarrassed when he received the treaty.
he was pleased with the terms of the bargain but uncertain whether the united states had authority to accept it since he had always insisted that the federal government could rightfully exercise only those powers explicitly assigned to it.
nowhere did the constitution say anything about the acquisition of new territory.
but jeffersons advisers persuaded him that his treaty making power under the constitution would justify the purchase of louisiana.
the president finally agreed trusting as he said that the good sense of our country will correct the evil of loose construction when it shall produce ill effects the republican congress promptly approved the treaty and appropriated jeffersons quandary money to implement its provisions.
finally late in 1803 the french assumed formal control of louisiana from spain just long enough to turn the territory over to general james wilkinson the commissioner of the united states.
the government organized the louisiana territory much as it had organized the northwest territory with the assumption that its various territories would eventually become states.
the first of these was admitted to the union as the state of louisiana in 1812.

the granger collection new york few of whom had ever ventured much beyond the mississippi river.
in 1803 even before napoleons offer to sell louisiana jefferson helped plan an expedition that was to cross the continent to the pacific ocean gather geographic facts and investigate prospects for trade with the indians.
he named as its leader his private secretary and virginia neighbor the thirty three year old meriwether lewis a veteran of indian wars skilled in the ways of the wilderness.
lewis chose as a colleague the twenty nine year old william clark who like george rogers clark his older brother was an experienced frontiersman and indian fighter.
in the spring of 1804 lewis and clark with a company of four dozen men started up the missouri river from st louis.
with a shoshone woman sacajawea as their guide they eventually crossed the rocky mountains descended the snake and columbia rivers and in the late autumn of 1805 camped on the pacific coast.
in september 1806 they were back in st louis with elaborate records of the geography and the indian civilizations they had observed along the way and a lengthy diary recounting their experiences.
while lewis and clark were still on their journey jefferson dispatched other explorers to other parts of the louisiana territory.

in the summer of 1806 he set out again up the valley of the arkansas river and into what later became colorado where he encountered but failed in his attempt to climb the peak that now bears his name.
his account of his western travels created an enduring and inaccurate impression among many americans in the east that the land between the missouri river and the rockies was an uninhabitable uncultivable desert.
the burr conspiracy jeffersons triumphant reelection in 1804 suggested that most of the nation approved the new territorial acquisition.
but some new england federalists raged against it.
they realized that the more the west grew and the more new the jeffersonian era 201 states joined the union the less power the federalists and essex junto r eir re ion woul retain.
in massachusetts a group of the most extreme federalists known as the essex junto concluded that the only recourse for new england was to secede from the union and form a separate northern confederacy if this confederacy was to have any hope for lasting success the federalists believed it would have to include new york and new jersey as well.
but the leading federalist in new york alexander hamilton refused to support the secessionist scheme.
dismemberment of our empire he wrote will be a clear sacrifice of great positive advantages without any counterbalancing good administering no relief to our real disease which is democracy federalists in new york then turned to hamiltons greatest political rival vice president aaron burr.
he was a politician without prospects in his own party.
jefferson had never for t given him for the 1800 election deadlock.
burr burr accepted a federalist proposal that he become their candidate for governor of new york in 1804 and there were rumors unsupported by any evidence that he had also agreed to support the federalist plans for secession.
hamilton accused burr of plotting treason and made numerous private remarks widely reported in the press about burrs despicable character.
when burr lost the new york election he blamed his defeat on hamiltons malevolence.
these things must have an end bun wrote.
he challenged hamilton to a duel.
dueling had by then already fallen into some disrepute in america but many people still considered it a legitimate institution for settling matters of honor hamilton feared that refusing burrs challenge would brand him a coward.
and so on a july morning in 1804 the two men met at weehawken new jersey.
hamilton was mortally wounded he died the next day.
the resourceful and charismatic burr was now a political outcast who had to flee new york to avoid an indictment for murder.
but he found new outlets for his ambitions in the west.
even before the duel he had begun corresponding with prominent white settlers in the southwest especially with general james wilkinson now governor of the louisiana territory.
burr and wilkinson hoped to lead an expedition that would capture mexico from the spanish.
mexico glitters in all our eyes burr wrote the word is all we wait for but there were also rumors that they wanted to separate the southwest from the united states and create a western empire that burr would rule.
there is little evidence to support them.
whether the rumors were true or not many of burrs opponents including ultimately jefferson himself chose to believe them.
when burr led a group of armed followers down the ohio river by boat in 1806 disturbing reports flowed into washington.
the most alarming was from wilkinson.
he had suddenly turned against burr and now informed the president that treason was afoot and that an attack on new orleans was imminent.
jefferson ordered burr and his men arrested as traitors.
burr was brought to richmond for trial.

chicago history museum usa the bridgeman art library case from washington.
but chief justice marshall presiding over the trial on circuit duty limited the evidence the government could present and defined the charge in such a way that the jury had little choice but to acquit burr.
the burr conspiracy was in part the story of a single mans soaring ambitions and flamboyant personality.
but it was also a symbol of the larger perils still facing the new nation.
with a central government that remained deliberately weak with vast tracts of land only nominally controlled by the united states with ambitious political leaders willing if necessary to circumvent normal channels in their search for power the legitimacy of the federal government and indeed the existence of the united states as a stable and united nation remained to be fully established.
expansion and war two very different conflicts were taking shape in the later years of thomas jeffersons presidency that would together draw the united states into a difficult and frustrating war.
one was the continuing tension in europe which in 1803 escalated the napoleonic wars once again into a full scale conflict the napoleonic wars.
as the fighting escalated both the british and the french took steps to prevent the united states from trading with and thus assisting the other.
the other conflict was in north america a result of the ceaseless westward expansion of white settlement which was now stretching to the mississippi river and beyond colliding again with native american populations committed to protecting their lands and their trade from intruders.
in both the north and the south the threatened tribes mobilized to resist white encroachments.
they began as well to forge connections with british forces in canada and spanish forces in florida.
the indian conflict on land therefore became intertwined with the european conflict on the seas and ultimately helped cause the war of 1812 an unpopular conflict with ambiguous results.
conflict on the seas the early nineteenth century saw a dramatic expansion of american shipping in the atlantic.
britain retained significant the jeffersonian era 203 naval superiority but the british merchant marine was preoccupied with commerce in europe and asia and devoted little energy to trade with america.
thus the united states stepped effectively into the void and developed one of the most important merchant marines in the world which soon controlled a large proportion of the trade between europe and the west indies.
in 1805 at the battle of trafalgar a british fleet virtually destroyed what was left of the french navy.
because france could no longer challenge the british at sea napoleon now chose to pressure england through economic rather than naval means.
he announced the creation of what he called the continental system it was designed to close the european continent to british trade.
the british government replied to napoleon s decrees by establishing through a series of orders in council a blockade of the european coast.
it required that any goods being shipped to napoleons europe be carried either in british vessels or in neutral vessels stopping at british ports precisely what napoleons policies forbade.
american ships were caught between napoleons decrees and britains orders in council.
if they sailed directly for the european continent they risked being captured by the british navy if they sailed by way of a british port they risked seizure by the french.
both of the warring powers were violating americas rights as a neutral nation.
but most americas americans considered the british with predicament their greater sea power the worse offender.
british ships pounced on yankee merchantmen all over the ocean.
particularly infuriating to americans british vessels stopped united states ships on the high seas and seized sailors off the decks making them victims of impressment impressment the british navy with its floggings low pay and terrible shipboard conditions was known as a floating hell to its sailors.
few volunteered.
most had to be impressed forced into the service.
at every opportunity they deserted.
by 1807 many of these deserters had joined the american merchant marine or the american navy.
to check this loss of vital manpower the british claimed the right to stop and search american merchant ships although at first not naval vessels and reimpress deserters.
they did not claim the right to take native born americans but they did claim the right to seize naturalized americans born on british soil.
in practice the british navy often made no such distinctions impressing british deserters and native born americans alike into service.
in the summer of 1807 the british went to more provocative extremes in an incident involving a vessel of the american navy.
sailing from norfolk with several alleged deserters from the british navy among the crew the american naval frigate chesapeake encountered the british ship leopard.
when the american commander james barron refused to allow the british to search the chesapeake the leopard opened fire.
chesapeake leopard incident important and luminous communication on the subject of the impressment of american and foreign sempejv and other persons.
it has become manifest to every attentive observer that the early and continued aggressions of great britain on our persons our property and our rights imperiously demand a firm stand an effectual though calm system of measures of ar restation.
for this purpose it is our duty to make ourselves completely masters of the great truths and arguments by which our rights have been elucidated supported and maintained.
on the 17th of january 1806 the president of the united states communicated to congress an extract from a dispatch of james madison esq.
our secretary of state to james monroe esq.
our minister in london which contains many facts highly important and observations and arguments perfectly satisfactory and conclusive againstu impressments of seamen and passengers whether foreign or american on board of our vessels the republication of that document at this crisis will at once display some of the reasons on which the government has probably declined to sanction the recent draught of a treaty with great britain and will elucidate the ground on which the question of the impressment of persons both native and alien has been rested by our administration.

great britain on the contrary asserts a right to search for and seize her own subjects and un resist1ng the impressment of sailors on january 5 1804 secretary of state james madison wrote this public letter to james monroe on the unlawful impressment of american sailors by the british royal navy.
the practice of boarding us ships and taking away sailors deemed by the british to be deserters from their navy came to a climax with the chesapeake leopard incident.
the granger collection new york barron had no choice but to surrender and a boarding party from the leopard dragged four men off the american frigate.
when news of the chesapeake leopard incident reached the united states there was great popular clamor for revenge.
if congress had been in session it might have declared war.
but jefferson and madison tried to maintain the peace.
jefferson expelled all british warships from american waters to lessen the likelihood of future incidents.
then he sent instructions to his minister in england james monroe to demand that the british government renounce impressment.
the british government disavowed the action of the officer responsible for the chesapeake leopard incident and recalled him it offered compensation for those killed and wounded in the incident 204 chapter 7 and it promised to return three of the captured sailors one of the original four had been hanged.
but the british refused to renounce impressment.
peaceable coercion in an effort to prevent future incidents that might bring the nation again to the brink of war congress enacted a drastic measure known as the embargo it became one of the most controversial political issues of its time.
the embargo prohib the embargo ited american ships horn leaving the united states for any foreign port anywhere in the world.
the law was widely evaded but it was effective enough to create a serious depression through most of the nation.
hardest hit were the merchants and shipowners of the northeast most of them federalists.
the election of 1808 came in the midst of the embargo 1807 induced depression.
james madison jeffersons secretary of state non intercourse act and political ally won the presidency.
but the embargo was clearly a growing political liability and jefferson decided to back down.
a few days before leaving office he approved a bill ending his experiment with what he called peaceable coercion to replace the embargo congress passed the non intercourse act just before madison took office.
the new law reopened trade with all nations but great britain and france.
a year later in 1810 congress allowed the non intercourse act to expire and replaced it with macons bill no.
2 which conditionally reopened free commercial relations with britain and france.
napoleon announced that france would no longer interfere with american shipping and madison announced that an embargo against great britain alone would automatically go into effect early in 1811 unless britain renounced its restrictions on american shipping.
the british government repealed its blockade of europe.
but the reneal came too late to orevent war.

is the the jeffersonian era 205 the indian problem and the british the 1807 war crisis following the chesapeake leopard incident revived the conflict between indians and white americans.
two important and very different leaders emerged to oppose one another in the conflict william henry harrison and tecumseh.
the virginia born harrison already a veteran indian fighter at age twenty six became a congressional delegate from the northwest territory in 1799.
he was a committed advocate of william henry harrison growth and development in the western lands and he was largely responsible for the passage in 1800 of the so called harrison land law which enabled white settlers to acquire farms from the public domain on much easier terms than before.
in 1801 jefferson appointed harrison governor of the indiana territory to administer the presidents proposed solution to the indian problem jefferson offered the native americans a choice they could convert themselves into settled farmers and jeffersons assimilate become a part of white society offer or r ey cou migrate to the west of the mississippi.
in either case they would have to give up their claims to tribal lands in the northwest.

following the battle of tippecanoe revival fell on eager ears.
it spread especially quickly northward along the shores of lake michigan ana wesi a n it tecumseh eclipsed the prophet as the major leader of indian resistance but his trips south to forge political alliance met with less success.
206 chapter 7 jefferson considered the assimilation policy a benign alternative to continuing conflict between indians and white settlers a conflict he assumed the tribes were destined to lose.
but to the tribes the new policy seemed far from benign especially given the bludgeonlike efficiency with which harrison set out to implement it.
he played one tribe against another and used threats bribes trickery and whatever other tactics he felt would help him conclude treaties.
in the first decade of the nineteenth century the number of western americans who had settled east of the appalachians had grown to more than 500 000 a population far larger than that of the native americans.
it was becoming almost inevitable as a result that the tribes would face ever growing pressure to move out of the way of the rapidly growing white settlements.
by 1807 the united states had extracted from reluctant tribal leaders treaty rights to eastern michigan southern indiana and most of illinois.
meanwhile in the southwest white americans were taking millions of acres from other tribes in georgia tennessee and mississippi.
the indians wanted to resist but the separate tribes were helpless by themselves against the power of the united states.
they might have accepted their fate passively but for the emergence of two new factors.
one factor was the policy of the british authorities in canada.
after the chesapeake leopard incident and the surge of anti british feeling throughout the united states the british colonial authorities began to expect an american invasion of canada and took measures for their own defense.
among those measures were efforts to renew friendship with the indians and provide them with increased supplies.
tecumseh and the prophet the second and more important factor intensifying the border conflict was the rise of two remarkable native american leaders who together helped create an age of religious fervor and prophecy.
one was tenskwatawa a charismatic religious leader and orator known as the prophet he had experienced a mystical awakening in the process of recovering from thmessage t s alcoholism.
having freed himself from what he considered the evil effects of white culture he began to speak to his people of the superior virtues of indian civilization and the sinfulness and corruption of the white world.
in the process he inspired a religious revival that spread through numerous tribes and helped unite them.
like neolin before him and like his contemporary to the east handsome lake tenskwatawa demonstrated the power of religious leaders to mobilize indians behind political and military objectives.
the prophets headquarters at the confluence of tippecanoe creek and the wabash river known as prophetstown became a sacred place for people of many tribes and attracted thousands of indians from throughout the midwest.
out of their common religious experiences they began to consider joint political and military efforts as well.
tenskwatawa advocated an indian society entirely separate from that of white americans and a culture rooted in tribal tradition.
the effort to trade with the anglos and to borrow from their culture would he argued lead to the death of indian ways.
tecumseh the chief of the shawnees called by his tribe the shooting star was in many ways even more militant than his brother.
where today are the pequot he thundered.
the other powerful tribes of our people.
they have vanished before the avarice and oppression of the white man and he warned of his tribe s extermination if they did not take ac tion against the white americans moving into their lands.
tecumseh understood as few other indian leaders had that only through united action could the tribes hope to resist the advance of white civilization.
beginning in 1809 after tribes in indiana had ceded vast lands to the united states he set out to tecumseh tecumsehs efforts to unite the tribes of the mississippi valley against further white encroachments on their lands led him ultimately into an alliance with the british after the battle of tippecanoe in 1811.
in the war of 1812 he was commissioned a brigadier general by the british and fought against the united states in the battle of the thames.
parks canada agency fort malden nhs the jeffersonian era 207 james and dolley madison james madison may have been the most brilliant of the early leaders of the republic but he was also one of the most serious and humorless as this grim portrait suggests.
his wife born dolley payne in north carolina and raised a quaker in virginia was twenty six when she married the forty three year old madison in 1794.
her charm and social grace made her one of her husband s greatest political assets.
she acted as hostess for thomas jefferson a widower while her husband was secretary of state.
and she presided over a lively social life during her eight years in the white house as first lady.
both collection of the new york historical society usa the bridgeman art library unite all the indians of the mississippi valley north and south.
tecumsehs together he promised they would halt strategy white expansion recover the whole northwest and make the ohio river the boundary between the united states and the indian country.
he maintained that harrison and others by negotiating treaties with individual tribes had obtained no real title to land.
the land belonged to all the tribes none of them could rightfully cede any of it without the consent of the others.
in 1811 tecumseh left prophetstown and traveled down the mississippi to visit the tribes of the south hoping to persuade them to join the alliance.
during his absence harrison camped near prophetstown with 1 000 soldiers.
on november 7 1811 he provoked a battle.
the white forces suffered losses as heavy as those of the natives but harrison drove off the indians and burned the town.
the battle of tippecanoe named for the creek near the fighting disillusioned many of the prophets followers who had believed that his magic would protect them.
tecumseh returned to find the confederacy in battle of tippecanoe disarray.
but there were still many warriors eager for combat and by the spring of 1812 they were raiding white settlements and terrifying white settlers.
the bloodshed along the western borders was largely a result of the indians own initiative but britains agents in canada had encouraged and helped supply the uprising.
to harrison and most white residents of the regions there seemed only one way to make the west safe for americans drive the british out of canada and annex that province to the united states.
florida and war fever while white frontiersmen in the north demanded the conquest of canada those in the south wanted the united states to acquire spanish florida a territory that included the present state of florida and the southern areas of what are now alabama mississippi and louisiana.
the territory was a continuing threat to whites in the southern united states.
slaves escaped across the florida border indians launched frequent raids north into white settlements from florida.
but white southerners also coveted florida because through it ran rivers that could provide residents of the southwest with access to valuable ports on the gulf of mexico.
in 1810 american settlers in west florida an area that is part of mississippi and louisiana today seized the spanish fort 208 chapter 7 at baton rouge and asked the federal government to annex the captured territory to the united states.
president madison happily agreed and then began planning to get the rest of florida too.
the desire for florida became yet another motivation for war with britain.
spain was britains ally and a war with britain might provide a pretext for taking spanish territory.
by 1812 war fever was growing on both the northern and southern borders of the united states.
in the congressional elections of 1810 voters from these regions elected a large number of representatives of both parties eager for war with britain.
they became known as the war hawks some of them were ardent nationalists fired by passion for territorial expansion among them two men who would play a great role war hawks in nationa politics for much of the next four decades henry clay of kentucky and john c calhoun of south carolina.
others were men impassioned in their defense of republican values.
together they formed a powerful coalition in favor of war.
clay became speaker of the house in 1811 and he filled committees with those who shared his eagerness for war.
he appointed calhoun to the crucial committee on foreign affairs and both men began agitating for the conquest of canada.
madison still hoped for peace.
but he shared the concerns of other republicans about the dangers to american trade and he was losing control of congress.
on june 18 1812 he gave in to the pressure and approved a declaration of war against britain.
the war of 1812 preoccupied with their struggle against napoleon in europe the british were not eager for a conflict with the united states.
even after the americans declared war britain largely ignored them for a time.
but in the fall of 1812 napoleon launched a catastrophic campaign against russia that left his army in disarray and his power in europe diminished.
by late 1813 with the french empire on its way to final defeat britain was able to turn its military attention to america.
battles with the tribes americans entered the war of 1812 with great enthusiasm but events on the battlefield soon cooled their ardor.
in the summer of 1812 american forces invaded canada through detroit.
they soon had to retreat back to detroit and in august surrendered the fort there.
other invasion efforts also failed.
in the meantime fort dearborn chicago fell before an indian attack.
things went only slightly better for the united states on the seas.
at first american frigates won some spectacular victories over british warships and american privateers destroyed or captured many british merchant ships occasionally early defeats braving the coastal waters of the british isles themselves and burning vessels within sight of the shore.
but by 1813 the british navy now less preoccupied with napoleon was counterattacking effectively driving the american frigates to cover and imposing a block ade on the united states.
the united states did however achieve significant early military successes on the great lakes.
first the americans took command of lake ontario which permitted them to raid and burn york now toronto the capital of canada.
american forces then seized control of lake erie mainly through the put in bay work of the youthful oliver hazard perry who engaged and dispersed a british fleet at put in bay on september 10 1813.
this made possible another invasion of canada by way of detroit which americans could now reach easily by water.
william henry harrison the american commander in the west pushed up the thames river into upper canada and on october 5 1813 won a victory notable for the death of tecumseh who was serving as a brigadier general in the british army.
the battle of the thames weakened and disheartened the native americans of the northwest and greatly diminished their ability to defend their claims to the region.
in the meantime another white military leader was striking an even harder blow at the tribes of the southwest.
the creeks whom tecumseh had aroused on a visit to the south and whom the spanish had supplied with weapons had been attacking white settlers near the florida border.
andrew jackson a wealthy tennessee planter and a general in the state militia temporarily abandoned plans for an invasion of florida and set off in pursuit of them.
on march 27 1814 in the battle of horseshoe bend jacksons men took terrible revenge on the indians slaughtering women and children along with warriors and broke the resistance of the creeks.
the tribe agreed to cede most of its lands to the united states and retreated westward farther into the interior.
the battle also won jackson a commission as a major general in the united states army.
in that capacity he led his men farther south into florida and on november 7 1814 seized the spanish fort at pensacola.
battles with the british the victories over the tribes were not enough for the united states to win the war.
after the surrender of napoleon in 1814 the british england prepared to invade the united invasion states.
a british armada sailed up the patuxent river from chesapeake bay and landed an army that marched a short distance overland to bladensburg on the outskirts of washington where it dispersed a poorly trained force of american militiamen.
on august 24 1814 the british troops entered washington and set fire to several public buildings including the white house in retaliation for the earlier american burning of the canadian capital at york.
this was the low point of american fortunes in the war.
leaving washington in partial ruins the british army proceeded up the bay toward baltimore.
but baltimore harbor guarded by fort mchenry was prepared.

what finally brought this inconclusive war to an end.
approaching fleet the american garrison had sunk several ships to clog the entry to the harbor thus forcing the british to bombard the fort from a distance.
through the night of september 13 francis scott key a washington lawyer who was on board one of the british ships trying to secure the release of an american prisoner watched the bombardment.
the next morning by the dawn s early light he could see the flag on the fort still flying he recorded his pride in the moment by scribbling a poem the star spangled banner on the back of an envelope.
the british withdrew from baltimore and keys words were soon set to the tune of an old english drinking song.
in 1931 the star spangled banner became the official national anthem.
meanwhile american forces repelled another british invasion in northern new york at the battle of plattsburgh on september 11 1814 which turned back a much larger british naval and land force and secured the northern border of the battle of united states.
in the south a formidable new orleans array f battle hardened british veterans fresh from the campaign against the french in spain landed below new orleans and prepared to advance north up the mississippi.
awaiting the british was andrew 210 chapter 7 jackson with a motley collection of tennesseans kentuckians creoles blacks pirates and regular army troops behind earthen fortifications.
on january 8 1815 the british advanced but their exposed forces were no match for jacksons well protected men.
after the americans had repulsed several waves of attackers the british finally retreated leaving behind 700 dead including their commander sir edward pakenham 1 400 wounded and 500 prisoners.
jacksons losses were 8 killed and 13 wounded.
only later did news reach north america that the united states and britain had signed a peace treaty several weeks before the battle of new orleans.
the revolt of new england with a few notable exceptions such as the battles of put in bay and new orleans the military operations of the united states between 1812 and 1815 consisted of a series of humiliating failures.
as a result the american government faced increasing popular opposition as the contest dragged on.
in new england opposition both to the war and to the republican government that was waging it was so extreme that some federalists celebrated british victories.
in congress in the meantime the republicans had persistent trouble with the federalist opposition led by a young congressman from new hampshire daniel webster who missed no opportunity to embarrass the administration.
by now the federalists were a minority in the country as a whole but they were still the majority party in new england.
some of them began to dream again of creating a separate nation in that region which they could dominate and in which they could escape what they saw as the tyranny of slaveholders and backwoodsmen.
talk of secession revived and reached a climax in the winter of 1814 1815 outnumbered by hartford convention on december 15 1814 delegates from the new england states met in hartford connecticut to discuss their grievances.
those who favored secession at the hartford convention were a comparatively moderate majority.
but while the conventions report only hinted at secession it reasserted the right of nullification and proposed seven amend ments to the constitution presumably as the condition of new englands remaining in the union amendments designed to protect new england from the growing influence of the south and the west.
because the war was going badly and the government was becoming desperate the new englanders assumed that the republicans would have to agree to their demands.
soon after the convention adjourned however the news of jacksons smashing victory at new orleans reached the cities of the northeast.
a day or two later reports arrived from abroad of a negotiated peace.
in the euphoria of this apparent triumph the hartford convention and the federalists came to seem futile irrelevant even treasonable.
the failure of the secession effort was a virtual death blow to the federalist party.
the peace settlement peace talks between the united states and britain had begun even before fighting in the war of 1812 began.
john quincy adams elenry clay and albert gallatin led the american delegation.
in the negotiations the americans gave up their demand for a british renunciation of impressment and for the cession of canada to the united states.
the british abandoned their call for treaty of ghent the bombardment of fort mchenry the british bombardment of fort mchenry in baltimore harbor in september 1814 was of modest importance to the outcome of the war of 1812.

celebrating the nation celebrations of independence day like this one in new york city became major festive events throughout the united states in the early nineteenth century a sign of rising american nationalism r north wind picture archives alamyj setting the stage like a fire bell in the night as thomas jefferson put it the issue of slavery arose after the war of 1812 to threaten the unity of the nation.
the debate began when the territory of missouri applied for admission to the union raising the question of whether it would be a free or a slaveholding state.
but the larger issue one that would arise again and again to plague the republic was whether the vast new western regions of the united states would ultimately move into the orbit of the north or the south.
the missouri crisis which congress settled by compromise in 1820 was significant at the time not only because it was a sign of the sectional crises to come but also because it stood in such sharp contrast to the rising american nationalism of the years following the war.
whatever forces might be working to pull the nation apart stronger ones were acting for the moment to draw it together.

on july 4 1826 the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the declaration of independence an event occurred that to many americans seemed to confirm that the united states was a nation specially chosen by god.

jeffersons last words those at his bedside reported were is it the fourth.
and adams comforted those around him moments before his death by saying thomas jefferson still survives.
building a national market the end of the war of 1812 allowed the united states to resume the economic growth and territorial expansion that had characterized the first decade of the nineteenth century.
a vigorous postwar boom led to a disastrous bust in 1819.
brief though it was the collapse was evidence that the united states continued to lack some of the basic institutions necessary to sustain long term growth.
in the years to follow there were strenuous efforts to introduce stability to the expanding economy.
banking currency ano protection the war of 1812 may have stimulated the growth of manufacturing by cutting off imports but it also produced chaos in shipping and banking and it exposed dramatically the inadequacy of the postwar existing transportation and financial systems.
the aftermath of the war there issues fore saw the emergence of a series of political issues connected with national economic development.
the wartime experience underlined the need for another national bank.
after the expiration of the first bank of the united statess charter in 1811 a large number of state banks had begun operations.
they issued vast quantities of bank notes but did not always retain enough reserves of gold or silver to redeem the notes on demand.
the notes passed from hand to hand more or less as money but their actual value depended on the reputation of the bank that issued them.
thus there was a wide variety of notes of widely differing value in circulation at the same time.
the result was a confusion that made honest business difficult and counterfeiting easy.
congress dealt with the currency problem by chartering a second bank of the united states in 1816 it was essentially the same institution hamilton had founded in 1791 except that it had more capital than its predecessor.
the national bank could not forbid state banks to issue currency but its size and power enabled it to dominate the state banks.
it could compel them to issue only sound notes or risk being forced out of business.
congress also acted to promote the already burgeoning manufacturing sector of the nations economy.
manufactured goods had been so scarce during the conflict that even with comparatively second bank of the united states 215.

the american textile industry experienced a particularly dramatic growth.
between 1807 and 1815 the total number of cotton spindles increased more than fifteenfold from 8 000 to 130 000.
until 1814 the textile factories most of them in new england produced only yarn and thread families operating hand looms at home did the actual weaving of cloth.
then the boston merchant francis cabot lowell after examining textile machinery in england developed a power loom that was better than its english counterpart.
in 1813 lowell organized the boston manufacturing company and at waltham massachusetts founded the first mill in america to carry on spinning and weaving under a single roof.
lowells company was an important step in revolutionizing american manufacturing and in shaping the character of the early industrial workforce.
but the end of the war suddenly dimmed the prospects for american industry.
british ships determined to recapture their lost markets swarmed into american ports and unloaded cargoes of manufactured goods many priced below cost.
as one english leader explained to parliament it was well worth while to incur a loss upon the first exportation in order by the glut to stifle in the cradle those rising manufactures in the united states the infant industries cried out for protection against these tactics arguing that they needed time to grow strong enough to withstand the foreign competition.
in 1816 protectionists in congress won passage of a tariff law that effectively limited competition from abroad on a wide range of items the most important of which was cotton cloth.
there were objections from agri a ptarw ive cultural interests who would have to pay higher prices for manufactured goods as a result.
but the nationalist dream of creating an important american industrial economy prevailed.
transportation the nations most pressing economic need in the aftermath of the war was for a better transportation system.
without one manufacturers would not have access to the raw materials they needed or to domestic markets.
so an old debate resumed should the federal government help to finance roads and other internal improvements.
the idea of using government funds to finance road building was not new.

from the governments sale of public lands should finance road construction.
in 1807 jeffersons secretary of the treasury albert gallatin proposed that revenues from the ohio land sales should help finance a national road from the potomac river to the ohio river.
both congress and the president approved.
after many delays construction of the national road finally began in 1811 at cumberland maryland on the potomac and by 1818 this highway with government a crushed stone surface and massive funded roads stone bridges ran as far as wheeling virginia on the ohio river.
meanwhile the state of pennsylvania gave 100 000 to a private company to extend the lancaster pike westward to pittsburgh.
over both of these roads a heavy traffic soon moved stagecoaches conestoga wagons private carriages and other vehicles as well as droves of cattle.
despite high tolls the roads made transportation costs across the mountains lower than ever before.
manufactures particularly textiles moved from the atlantic seaboard to the ohio valley in unprecedented quantities.
varieties of american nationalism 217 at the same time on the rivers and the great lakes steam powered shipping was expanding rapidly.
the development of steamboat lines was already well under way before the war of 1812 thanks to the technological advances introduced by robert fulton and others.
the war had retarded expansion for a time but by 1816 river steamers were beginning to journey steamboats up an own mississippi t0 ohio river and up the ohio as far as pittsburgh.
within a few years steamboats were carrying far more cargo on the mississippi than all the earlier forms of river transport flatboats barges and others combined.
they stimulated the agricultural economy of the west and the south by providing much readier access to markets at greatly reduced cost.
and they enabled eastern manufacturers to send their finished goods west.
despite the progress with steamboats and turnpikes there remained serious gaps in the nation s transportation network as the war of 1812 had shown.
once the british blockade cut off atlantic shipping the coastal roads became choked by the unaccustomed volume of north south traffic.
long lines of steamboats on the hudson inventor robert fulton developed powered vessels first built in 1807 were the first large and reliable enough to an engine that could propel a boat from manhattan to albany a distance of about 150 miles in thirty two hours.

in some areas there were serious shortages of goods that normally traveled by sea and prices rose to new heights.
rice cost three times as much in new york as in charleston flour three times as much in boston as in richmond all because of the difficulty of transportation.
there were military consequences too.
on the northern and western frontiers the absence of good roads had frustrated american campaigns.
in 1815 with this wartime experience in mind president madison called the attention of congress to the great importance of establishing throughout our country the roads and canals which can be best executed under the national authority and suggested that a constitutional amendment would resolve any doubts about congresss authority to provide for their construction.
representative john c calhoun promptly introduced a bill that would have used the funds owed the government by the bank of the united states to finance internal improvements.
let us then bind the republic together with a perfect system of roads and canals calhoun urged.
let us conquer space congress passed calhouns internal improvements bill but president madison on his last day in office march 3 1817 vetoed it.
he supported the purpose of the bill he explained but he still believed that congress lacked authority to fund the improvements without a constitutional amendment.
it remained for state govern ments and private enterprise to undertake the tremendous task of building the transportation network necessary for the growing american economy.
expanding westward one reason for the growing interest in internal improvements was the sudden and dramatic surge in westward expansion in the years following the war of 1812.
old america seems to be breaking up and moving westward wrote an english observer at the time.
by the time of the census of 1820 white settlers had pushed well beyond the mississippi river and the population of the western regions was increasing more rapidly than that of the nation as a whole.
almost one of every four white americans lived west of the appalachians in 1820 ten years before only one in seven had resided there.
the great migrations reasons for westward expansion the westward movement of the white american populatior was one of the most important developments of the nine teenth century.
it had a profound effect ot the nations economy bringing vast nev regions into the emerging capitalist sys tern.
it had great political ramifications which ultimately became a major factor in the coming of th civil war.
and like earlier movements west it thrust peoples of different cultures and traditions into intimate and often disastrous association with one another.
there were several important reasons for this expansion.
the pressures driving white americans out of the east came in part from the continued growth of the nation s population both through natural increase and through immigration.
between 1800 and 1820 the population nearly doubled from 5 3 million to 9 6 million.
the growth of cities absorbed some of that increase but most americans were still farmers.
the agricultural lands of the east were by now largely occupied and some of them were exhausted.
in the south the spread of the plantation system and of a slave labor force limited opportunities for new settlers.
at the same time the west itself was becoming increasingly attractive to white settlers.
the war of 1812 had helped diminish although it did not wholly eliminate one of the traditional deterrents to western expansion native american opposition.
and in the aftermath of the war the federal government continued its policy of pushing the remaining tribes farther and farther west.
a series of treaties in 1815 wrested more land from the indians.
in the meantime the government was erecting a chain of stockaded forts along the great lakes the factor an mississippi to protect the frontier.
system it a so created a factor system by which government factors or agents supplied the tribes with goods at cost.
this not only worked to drive canadian traders out of the region it also helped create a situation of dependency on the factors that made native americans easier to control.
now that fertile lands were secure for white settlement migrants from throughout the east flocked to the old northwest now called the midwest.
the ohio and monongahela rivers were the main routes westward until the completion of the erie canal in 1825.
once on the ohio the migrants floated downstream on flatboats bearing all their possessions then left the river often at cincinnati which was becoming one of the regions and the nations principal cities and pressed on overland with wagons handcarts packhorses cattle and hogs.
the plantation system in the southwest in the southwest the new agricultural economy emerged along different lines.
the principal attraction was cotton.
the cotton lands in the uplands of the old south had lost much of their fertility through overplanting and erosion.
but the market for cotton continued to grow so there was no lack of ambitious farmers seeking fresh soil in a climate suitable for the crop.
in the southwest there were vast tracts of land appropriate for growing cotton.
they included what would become known as the black belt of central alabama and mississippi 3 large region with a dark productive soil of rotted limestone.
the growth of southern settlement spread cotton plantations and slavery.

but wealthier planters soon fol the expansion lowed.
they bought up cleared or partially of slavery cleared land and the original settlers moved farther west and started over again.
the large planters made the westward journey in a style quite different from that of the first pioneers.
over the alternately dusty and muddy roads came great caravans consisting jf herds of livestock wagonloads of household goods long lines of slaves and at the rearthe planter s family riding in carriages.
success in the wilderness was by no means ensured sven for the wealthiest settlers.
but many planters soon expanded small clearings into vast cotton fields.
they replaced the cabins of the early pioneers with sumptuous log dwellings and ultimately with imposing mansions that symbolized the emergence of a newly wealthy class.
in later years these western planters would assume the airs of a long standing aristocracy.
but by the time of the civil war few planter families in the southwest had been there for more than one or two generations.
the rapid growth of the northwest and southwest resulted in the admission of four new states to the union in the immediate aftermath of the war of 1812 indiana in 1816 mississippi in 1817 illinois in 1818 and alabama in 1819.
trade and trapping in the far west not many anglo americans had much knowledge of or interest in the far western areas of the continent.
but a significant trade nevertheless developed between these far western regions and the united states beginning early in the nineteenth century and growing steadily for decades.
mexico which controlled texas california and much of the rest of the southwest won its independence from spain in 1821.
almost immediately it opened its northern territories to trade with the united states.
american traders poured into the region overland into texas and new mexico by sea into california.
merchants from the united states quickly displaced both indian and mexican traders who had previously dominated trade.
a steady traffic of commercial wagon trains was moving back and forth along the santa fe trail between missouri and new mexico.
fur traders created a wholly new commerce with the west.
before the war of 1812 john jacob astors american astors ur company had established astoria as a american fur trading post at the mouth of the columbia company river in oregon.
but when the war came astor sold his suddenly imperiled interests to the northwestern fur company a british concern operating out of canada.
after the war astor centered his operations in the great lakes area and eventually extended them westward to the rockies.
other companies carried on operations up the missouri and its tributaries and into the rocky mountains.
at first fur traders did most of their business by purchasing pelts from the indians.
but increasingly white trappers entered the region and began to hunt beaver on their own.
substantial numbers of anglo americans and french canadians moved deep into the great lakes region and beyond to join the iroquois and other indians in pursuit of furs.
as the trappers or mountain men moved west from the great lakes region they began to establish themselves in what is now utah and in parts of new mexico.
in 1822 andrew henry and william ashley founded the rocky mountain fur company and recruited white trappers to move permanently into the rockies in search of furs which were becoming increasingly scarce farther east.
henry and ashley dispatched supplies annually to their trappers in exchange for furs and skins.
the arrival of the supply train became the occasion for a gathering of scores of mountain men some of whom lived much of the year in considerable isolation.
but however isolated their daily lives these mountain men were closely bound up with the expanding market economy the fur of the united states.
some were employees trade and the of the rocky mountain fur company or market some other similar enterprise earning a economy f salary in return for providing a steady 220 chapter 8 rendezvous 1837 the annual gathering of fur trappers and traders was a major event in the lives of the lonely men who made their livelihoods gathering furs.

walters art museum baltimore usa the bridgeman art library supply of furs.
others were nominally independent but relied on the companies for credit they were almost always in debt and hence economically bound to the companies.
some trapped entirely on their own and simply sold their furs for cash but they too depended on merchants from the east for their livelihoods.
and it was to those merchants that the bulk of the profits from the trade flowed.
many trappers and mountain men lived peacefully and successfully with the native americans and mexicans whose lands they shared.
perhaps two thirds of the white trappers married women of indian or spanish backgrounds while living in the west.
but white indian relations were not always friendly or peaceful.
jedediah s smith a trapper who became an ashley partner led a series of forays deep into mexican territory that ended in disastrous battles with the mojaves and other tribes.
four years after an 1827 expedition to oregon in which sixteen members of his party of twenty had died smith set out for new mexico and was killed by comanches who took the weapons he was carrying and sold them to mexican settlers.
eastern images of the west americans in the east were only dimly aware of the world the trappers were entering and helping to reshape.
smith and others stephen longs expedition became the source of dramatic and often exaggerated popular stories.
but few trappers themselves wrote of their lives.
more important in increasing eastern awareness of the west were explorers many of them dispatched by the u s government with instructions to chart the territories they visited.
in 1819 and 1820 stephen h long led nineteen soldiers on a journey up the platte and south platte rivers through what is now nebraska and eastern colorado and then re turned eastward along the arkansas river through what is now kansas.
he wrote an influential report on his trip including an assessment of the regions potential for future settlement and development that echoed the dismissive conclusions of zebulon pike fifteen years before.
on the published map of his expedition he labeled the great plains the great american desert the era of good feelings the expansion of the economy the growth of white settlement and trade in the west the creation of new states all reflected the rising spirit of nationalism that was permeating the united states in the years following the war of 1812.
that spirit found reflection for a time in the character of national politics.
the triumphant tour of james monroe after james monroe s enormously successful tour of the northern and eastern states in 1818 midway through his first term as president there was widespread self congratulation through much of the united states for the apparent political unity that had gripped the nation.
only a few years earlier the northeast had been the bastion of federalist party opposition to the republican governments of the early nineteenth century.
at one point some federalist leaders had even proposed secession from the united states.
but now a virginia republican president had been greeted as a hero in the former federalist strongholds.
this book published in 1820 when monroe ran virtually unopposed for reelection is an account of the president s triumphant tour and a short account of his life an early version of the now familiar campaign biography fn collection of david j and janice l frent the end of the first party system ever since 1800 the presidency seemed to have been the special possession of virginians.

monroe received 183 ballots in the electoral college his federalist opponent rufus king of new york received only 34 yrom massachusetts connecticut and delaware.
monroe was sixty one years old when he became president.
in the course of his long career he had served as a soldier in the revolution as a diplomat and most recently as a cabinet officer.
he entered office under what seemed to be remarkably favorable circumstances.
with the decline of the federalists his party faced no serious opposition.
with the conclusion of the war of 1812 the nation faced no important international varieties of american nationalism 221 threats.
american politicians had dreamed since the first days of the republic of a time in which partisan divisions and factional disputes might come to an end.
in the prosperous postwar years monroe attempted to use his office to realize that dream.
he made that clear above all in the selection of his cabinet.
for secretary of state he chose the new englander and former federalist john quincy adams.
jefferson madison and monroe had all served as secretary of state before becoming president adams therefore immediately became the heir apparent suggesting that the virginia dynasty would soon come to an end.
speaker of the house henry clay declined an offer to be secretary of war so monroe named john c calhoun instead.
in his other appointments too monroe took pains to include both northerners and southerners easterners and westerners federalists and republicans.
soon after his inauguration monroe did what no president since washington had done he made a goodwill tour through the country.
in new england so recently the scene of rabid federalist discontent he was greeted every enthusiastic demonstrations.
the columbian centinel a federalist newspaper in boston commenting on the presidential jubilee in that city observed that an era of good feelings had arrived.
and on the surface at least the years of monroes presidency did appear to be an era of good feelings in 1820 monroe was reelected without opposition.
for all practical purposes the federalist party had now ceased to exist.
monroes goodwill tour where with john quincy adams and florida like his father the second president john quincy adams had spent much of his life in diplomatic service.
even before becoming secretary of state he had become one of the great diplomats in american history.
he was also a committed nationalist and he considered his most important task to be the promotion of american expansion.
adamss first challenge as secretary of state was florida.
the united states had already annexed west florida but that claim remained in dispute.
most americans believed the nation should gain possession of the entire peninsula.
in 1817 adams began negotiations with the spanish minister luis de onis in hopes of resolving the dispute and gaining the entire territory for the united states.
in the meantime events were taking their own course in florida.
andrew jackson now in command of american troops along the florida frontier had orders from the seminole 6 f xa.
war secretary of war calhoun to adopt the necessary measures to stop continuing raids on american territory by seminole indians south of the florida border.
jackson used those orders as an excuse to 224 chapter 8 confirming implied powers colleges charter granted by king george iii in 1769 to convert the private college into a state university.
daniel webster a dartmouth graduate and brilliant orator argued the colleges case.
the dartmouth charter he insisted was a contract protected by the same doctrine that the court had already upheld in fletcher v peck.
then according to legend he brought some of the justices to tears with an irrelevant passage that concluded it is sir a small college.
and yet there are those who love it the court ruled for dartmouth.
the decision placed important restrictions on the ability of state governments to control corporations.
in overturning the act of the legislature and the decisions of the new hampshire courts the justices also implicitly claimed for themselves the right to override the decisions of state courts.
but advocates of states rights especially in the south continued to challenge the supreme courts right to do so.
in cohens v virginia 1821 marshall explicitly affirmed the constitutionality of federal review of state court decisions.
the states had given up part of their sovereignty in ratifying the constitution he explained and their courts must submit to federal jurisdiction otherwise the federal government would be powerless at the feet of every state in the union meanwhile in mcculloch v maryland 1819 marshall confirmed the implied powers of congress by upholding the constitutionality of the bank of the united states.
the bank had become so unpopular in the south and the west that several of the states tried to drive branches out of business by outright prohibition or by confiscatory taxes.
this case presented two constitutional questions could congress charter a bank.
and if so could individual states ban it or tax it.
daniel webster one of the banks attorneys argued that establishing such an institution came within the necessary and proper clause of the constitution and that the power to tax involved a power to destroy if the states could tax the bank at all webster said they could tax it to death marshall adopted websters words in deciding for the bank.
in the case of gibbons v ogden 1824 the court strengthened congresss power to regulate interstate commerce.
the state of new york had indirectly granted aaron ogden the business of carrying passengers across the river between new york and new jersey.
but thomas gibbons with a license granted under an act of congress began competing with ogden for the ferry traffic.
ogden brought suit against him and won in the new york courts.
gibbons appealed to the supreme court.
the most important question facing the justices was whether congresss power to give gibbons a license to operate his ferry superseded the state of new yorks power to grant ogden a monopoly.
marshall claimed that the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce which he said included navigation was complete in itself and might be exercised to its utmost extent ogdens state granted monopoly therefore was void.
the decisions of the marshall court established the primacy of the federal government over the states in regulating the economy and opened the way for an increased federal role in establishing promoting economic growth.
they pro federal tected corporations and other private eco primacy nomic institutions from local government interference.
they were in short highly nationalistic decisions designed to promote the growth of a strong unified and economically developed united states.
the court and the tribes the nationalist inclinations of the marshall court were visible as well in a series of decisions concerning the legal status of indian tribes within the united states.
but these decisions did not simply affirm the supremacy of the united states they also carved out a distinctive position for native americans within the constitutional structure.
the first of the crucial indian decisions was in the case of johnson v mcintosh 1823.
leaders of the illinois and pinakeshaw tribes had sold parcels of their land to a group of white settlers including johnson but later signed a treaty with the federal government ceding territory that included those same parcels to the united states.
the government proceeded to grant homestead rights to new white settlers among them mcintosh on the land claimed by johnson.
the court was asked to decide which claim had precedence.
marshalls ruling not surprisingly favored the united states.
but in explaining it he offered a preliminary definition of the place of indians within the nation.
the tribes had a basic right to their tribal lands he said that preceded all other american law.
individual american citizens could not buy or take land from the tribes only the federal government the supreme authority could do that.
even more important was the courts 1832 decision in worcester v georgia in which the court invalidated georgia laws that attempted to regulate access by u s citizens to cherokee country.
only the federal government could do that marshall claimed thus taking another important step in consol worcestfr v bating federal authority over the states and georgia ovqt the tribes.
in doing so he further de fined the nature of the indian nations.
the tribes he explained were sovereign entities in much the same way georgia was a sovereign entity distinct political communities having territorial boundaries within which their authority is exclusive in defending the power of the federal government he was also affirming indeed expanding the rights of the tribes to remain free from the authority of state governments.
the marshall decisions therefore did what the constitution itself had not done they defined a place for indian tribes within the american political system.
the tribes had basic property rights.
they were sovereign entities not subject to the authority of state governments.
but the federal government like a guardian governing its ward had ultimate authority over tribal affairs even if that authority was according to the court limited by the governments obligation to protect indian welfare.
these provisions were seldom enough to defend indians from the steady westward march of white civilization but they formed the basis of what few legal protections they had.
varieties of american nationalism 225 the latin american revolution and the monroe doctrine americans looking southward in the years following the war of 1812 beheld a gigantic spectacle the spanish empire in its death revolution in throes a whole continent in revolt new latin america nations in the making.
already the united states had developed a profitable trade with latin america and was rivaling great britain as the principal trading nation there.
many americans believed the success of the anti spanish revolutions would further strengthen americas position in the region.
in 1815 the united states proclaimed neutrality in the wars between spain and its rebellious colonies implying a partial recognition of the rebels status as nations.
moreover the united states sold ships and supplies to the revolutionaries a clear indication that it was not genuinely neutral but was trying to help the insurgents.
finally in 1822 president monroe established diplomatic relations with five new nations la plata later argentina chile peru colombia and mexico making the united states the first country to recognize them.
in 1823 monroe went further and announced a policy that would ultimately be known beginning some thirty years later as the monroe doctrine even though it was primarily the the monroe wor of john quincy adams.
the american doctrine continents monroe declared.
are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers the united states would consider any foreign challenge to the sovereignty of existing american nations an unfriendly act.
at the same time he proclaimed our policy in regard to europe is not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers the monroe doctrine emerged directly out of americas relations with europe in the 1820s.
many americans feared american r at pains european allies notably fears france would assist spain in an effort to retake its lost empire.
even more troubling to adams and many other americans was the fear that great britain had designs on cuba.
adams wanted to keep cuba in spanish hands until it fell as he believed it ultimately would to the americans.
the monroe doctrine had few immediate effects but it was important as an expression of the growing spirit of nationalism in the united states in the 1820s.

the revival of opposition after 1816 the federalist party offered no presidential candidate and soon ceased to exist as a national political force.
the republican party which considered itself not a party but an organization representing the whole of the population was the only organized force in national politics.
by the late 1820s however partisan divisions were emerging once again.
in some respects the division mirrored the schism that had produced the first party system in the 1790s.
the republicans had in many ways come nedivisionscal t0 resemble the early federalist regimes in their promotion of economic growth and centralization.
and the opposition like the opposition in the 1790s objected to the federal governments expanding role in the economy.
there was however a crucial difference.
at the beginning of the century the opponents of centralization had also often been opponents of economic growth.
now in the 1820s the controversy involved not whether but how the nation should continue to expand.
the corrupt bargain until 1820 when the federalist party effectively ceased operations and james monroe ran for reelection unopposed presi dential candidates were nominated by end of the.
caucus system caucuses of the two parties m congress.
but in the presidential election of 1824 king caucus was overthrown.
the republican caucus nominated william h crawford of georgia the secretary of the treasury and the favorite of the extreme states rights faction of the party.
but other candidates received nominations from state legislatures and won endorsements from irregular mass meetings throughout the country.
one of them was secretary of state john quincy adams who held the office that was the traditional stepping stone to the presidency.
but as he himself ruefully understood he was a man of cold and forbidding manners with little popular appeal.
another contender was henry clay the speaker of the house.
he had a devoted personal following and a definite and coherent program the american system which proposed creating a great home market for factory and farm producers by raising the protective tariff strengthening the national bank and financing internal improvements.
andrew jackson the fourth major candidate had no significant political record even though he had served briefly as a representative in congress and was now a new member of the u s senate.
but he was a military hero and had the help of shrewd political allies from his home state of tennessee.
jackson received more popular and electoral votes than any other candidate but not a majority.
he had 99 electoral votes to adamss 84 crawfords 41 and clays 37.
the twelfth john quincy adams this photograph of the former president was taken shortly before his death in 1848 at the age of eighty almost twenty years after he had left the white house when he was serving as a congressman from massachusetts.
during his years as president he was as he had been throughout his life an intensely disciplined and hardworking man.
he rose at four in the morning and made a long entry in his diary for the previous day.
he wrote so much that his right hand at times became paralyzed with writer s cramp so he taught himself to write with his left hand as well.
hulton archive getty images amendment to the constitution passed in the aftermath contested 1800 election required the house of representatives to choose among the three candidates with the largest numbers of electoral votes.
crawford was by then seriously ill and not a plausible candidate.
clay was out of the running but he was in a strong position to influence the result election of t.
1824 jackson was clays most formidable political rival in the west so clay supported adams in part because alone among the candidates adams was an ar dent nationalist and a likely supporter of the american system.
with clay5s endorsement adams won election in the house.
the jacksonians believed their large popular and electoral pluralities entitled their candidate to the presidency and they were enraged when he lost.
but they grew angrier still when adams named clay his secretary of state.
the state department was the well established route to the presidency and adams thus appeared to be naming clay as his own successor.
the outrage the jacksonians expressed at what they called a corrupt bargain haunted adams throughout his presidency.
the second president adams throughout adamss term in the white house the political bitterness arising from the corrupt bargain charges thoroughly frustrated his policies.
adams proposed an ambitiously nationalist program reminiscent of clays american system.
but jacksonians in congress blocked most of it.
adams also experienced diplomatic frustrations.
he appointed delegates to an international conference that the venezuelan liberator simon bolivar had called in panama in 1826.
but haiti was one of the participating nations and southerners in congress opposed the idea of white americans mingling with the black delegates.
congress delayed approving the panama mission so long that the american delegation did not arrive until after the conference was over.
adams also lost a contest with the state of georgia which wished to remove the remaining creek and cherokee indians from the state to gain additional soil for cotton planters.
the u s government in a 1791 treaty had guaranteed that land to the creeks but in 1825 white georgians had extracted a new treaty from william mcintosh the leader of one faction in the tribe and a longtime advocate of indian cooperation with the united states.
adams believed the new treaty had no legal force since mcintosh clearly did not represent the wishes of the tribe and he refused to enforce the treaty setting up a direct conflict between the president and the state.
the governor of georgia defied the president and proceeded with plans for indian removal.
adams found no way to stop him.
even more damaging to the administration was its support for a new tariff on imported goods in 1828.
this measure originated with the demands of massachusetts and rhode island woolen manufacturers who complained that the british were on the american market at artificially low prices.
but to win support from middle and western states the administration had to accept duties on other items.
in the process it antagonized the original new england supporters of the bill the benefits of protecting their manufactured goods from foreign competition now had to be weighed against the prospects of having to pay more for raw materials.
adams signed the bill earning the animosity of southerners who cursed it as the tariff of abominations jackson triumphant by the time of the 1828 presidential election a new two party system had begun to emerge out of the divisions among the republicans.
on one side stood the supporters of john quincy adams who called themselves the national republicans and who supported the economic nationalism of the preceding years.
opposing them were the followers of andrew jackson who took the name democratic republicans and who called for an assault on privilege and a widening of opportunity.

what accounts for this decisive repudiation of president adams.
adams attracted the support of most of the remaining federalists jackson appealed to a broad coalition that opposed the economic aristocracy but issues seemed to count for little in the end as the campaign degenerated into a war of personal invective.
the jacksonians charged that adams as president had been guilty of gross waste and extravagance and had used public funds to buy gambling devices a chess set and a billiard table for the white house.
adamss supporters hurled even worse accusations at jackson.
they called him a murderer and distributed a coffin handbill which listed within coffin shaped outlines the names of militiamen whom jackson was said to have shot in cold blood during the war of 1812.
the men had been deserters who were legally executed after sentence by a court martial.
and they called his wife a bigamist.
jackson had married his beloved rachel at a time when the pair incorrectly believed her first husband had divorced her.
when jacksons wife first read of the accusations against her shortly after the election she collapsed and a few weeks later died not without reason jackson blamed his opponents for her death.
jacksons victory was decisive but sectional.
he won 56 percent of the popular vote and an electoral majority of 178 votes to 83.
adams swept virtually all of new england and showed significant strength in the mid atlantic region.
nevertheless the jacksonians considered their victory as complete and as important as jeffersons in 1800.
once again the forces of privilege had been driven from washington.
once jackson triumphant 228 chapter 8 again a champion of democracy would occupy the white house and restore liberty to the people and to the economy.
america had entered some jacksonians claimed a new era of democracy the age of the common man significant events looking back in the aftermath of the war of 1812 a vigorous nationalism came increasingly to characterize the political and popular culture of the united states.
in all regions of the country white men and women celebrated the achievements of the early leaders of the republic the genius of the constitution and the success of the nation in withstanding serious challenges from both without and within.
party divisions faded to the point that james monroe the fifth president won reelection in 1820 without opposition.
but the broad nationalism of the so called era of good feelings disguised some deep divisions within the united states.
indeed the character of american nationalism differed substantially from one region and one group to another.
battles continued between those who favored a strong central government committed to advancing the economic development of the nation and those who wanted a decentralization of power to open opportunity to more people.
battles continued as well over the role of slavery in american life and in particular over the place of slavery in the new western territories that the united states was rapidly populating and wresting from the tribes.

what events fed the growing tension between nationalism and states rights and what were the arguments on both sides of that issue.
what was the second party system and how did its emergence and rise change national politics.
setting the stage during the years of economic and territorial expansion in the early nineteenth century americans pondered the future of their democracy.
some feared that the nations rapid growth would produce social chaos and insisted that the country s first priority must be to establish order and a clear system of authority.
others argued that the greatest danger facing the nation was privilege and that society s goal should be to eliminate the favored status of powerful elites and make opportunity more widely available.
advocates of this latter vision won control of the federal government in 1829 with the inauguration of andrew jackson the democratization of government over which andrew jackson presided was accompanied by a lofty rhetoric of equality and aroused the excitement of working people.
but jackson and his followers were not egalitarians.
they accepted economic inequality and social gradation jackson himself was a frontier aristocrat and most of those who served him were people of wealth and standing.
they were not however usually aristocrats by birth they had they believed risen to prominence on the basis of their own talents and energies and their goal in public life was to ensure that others like themselves would have the opportunity to do the same.
for these national leaders the purpose of democratization was not primarily to aid farmers and laborers or to assist the disenfranchised african americans both slave and free women and native americans.
it was rather to challenge the power of eastern elites for the sake of the rising entrepreneurs of the south and the west.
the rise of mass politics on march 4 1829 an unprecedented throng thousands of americans from all regions of the country including farmers laborers and others of modest social rank crowded before the capitol in washington d c to witness the inauguration of andrew jackson.
after the inauguration ceremonies the boisterous crowd poured down pennsylvania avenue following their hero to the white house.
there at a public reception open to all they filled the state rooms to overflowing trampling one another soiling the carpets ruining elegantly upholstered sofas and chairs in their eagerness to shake the new presidents hand.

they had moved from ireland two years before andrew was born in a small village in the carolinas.
at the age of thirteen he was captured by the british during the american revolution.
when jackson refused to clean the boots of a british officer the officer cut jackson with a sword leaving him with scars and an enduring hatred of the british.
as he became older jackson received only sporadic education and worked in various shops and on farms.
as a young man he studied law and was admitted to the bar.
most of jacksons early legal work involved disputed land claims of which he soon tired.
he was elected as a delegate to the tennessee constitutional convention in 1796 and later that same year became a u s congressman.
in 1797 he went on to become a u s senator but resigned within a year in 1798 he was appointed a judge of the tennessee supreme court a position he held until 1804.
gradually jackson prospered as planter and merchant.
he also bought slaves to help his growing plantation.
in 1804 he acquired an elegant home the hermitage a large plantation in davidson county near nashville.
in time he had one of the largest plantations in the state with up to 300 slaves.
230 jacksonian america 231 jackson joined the tennessee militia in 1801 and in the next year was elected major general.
he fought indians in alabama and georgia.

when the british threatened new orleans jackson took command.
in the battle of new orleans his soldiers won a decisive victory over the british that ensured new orleans would be part of the united states.
he developed the reputation for being as tough as old hickory and thus earned the nickname old hickory jackson left the war with many people calling for him to run for president of the united states.
expanding democracy what some have called the age of jackson did not much advance the cause of economic equality.
the distribution of wealth and property in america was little different at the end of the jacksonian era than it had been at the start.
but it did mark a transformation of american politics that widely extended to new groups the right to vote.
until the 1820s relatively few americans had been permitted to vote.
most states restricted the franchise to white males broadening w were property owners or taxpayers or the franchise both effectively barring an enormous number of the less affluent from the voting rolls.
but beginning even before jackson s election the rules governing voting began to expand.
changes came first in ohio and other new states of the west which on joining the union adopted constitutions that guaranteed all adult white males the right to vote and gave all voters the right to hold public office.
older states concerned about the loss of their population to the west and thinking that extending the franchise might encourage some residents to stay began to grant similar political rights to their citizens dropping or reducing their property ownership or taxpaying requirements.
eventually every state democratized its electorate to some degree although some much later and less fully than others.
change provoked resistance and at times the democratic trend fell short of the aims of the radical reformers as when massachusetts held its constitutional convention in 1820.
reform minded delegates complained that in the massachusetts government the rich were better represented than the poor both because of restrictions on voting and officeholding and because of a peculiar system by which members of the state senate represented property rather than simply people.
but daniel webster one of the conservative delegates opposed democratic changes on the grounds that power naturally and necessarily follows property and that property as such should have its weight and influence in political arrangement.
webster and the rest of the conservatives could not prevent the reform of the rules for representation in the state senate nor could they prevent elimination of the property requirement for voting.
but to the dismay of the radicals the new constitution required that every voter be a taxpayer and that the governor be the owner of considerable real estate.
more often however the forces of democratization pre vailed in the states.
in the new york convention of 1821 for i andrew jackson this stern portrait suggests something of the fierce determination that characterized andrew jackson s military and political careers.
shattered by the death of his wife a few weeks after his election as president a death he blamed not without reason on the attacks his political opponents had leveled at her he entered office with a steely determination to live by his own principles and give no quarter to his adversaries.
collection of the new york historical society usa the bridgeman art library example conservatives led by james kent insisted that a tax paying requirement for suffrage was not enough and that at least in the election of state senators the property qualification should survive.
but reformers citing the declaration of independence maintained that life liberty and the pursuit of happiness not property were the main concerns of society and government.
the property qualification was abolished.
the wave of state reforms was generally peaceful but in rhode island democratization efforts created considerable instability.
the rhode island constitution still basically the old colonial charter barred more than half the adult males of the state from voting.
the conservative legislature chosen by this restricted electorate consistently blocked all efforts at reform.
in 1840 the lawyer and activist thomas w dorr and a group the dorr showers frmed a people s party rebellion held a convention drafted a new constitution and submitted it to a popular vote.
it was overwhelmingly approved.
the existing legislature however refused to accept the dorr document and submitted a new constitution of its own to the voters.
it was narrowly defeated.
the dorrites in the meantime had begun to set up a new government under their own constitution with dorr as governor and so in 1842 two governments were claiming.
232 chapter 9 percentage year participation in presidential elections 1824 1860 this chart reveals the remarkable increase in popular participation in presidential elections in the years after 1824.
participation almost doubled between 1824 and 1828 and it increased substantially again beginning in 1840 and continuing through and beyond the civil war.
what accounts for this dramatic expansion of the electorate.
who remained outside the voting population in these gears.
legitimacy in rhode island.
the old state government proclaimed that dorr and his followers were rebels and began to imprison them.
meanwhile the dorrites made a brief and ineffectual effort to capture the state arsenal.
the dorr rebellion as it was known quickly failed.
dorr himself surrendered and was briefly imprisoned.
but the episode helped pressure the old guard to draft a new constitution which greatly expanded the suffrage.
the democratization process was far from complete.
in much of the south election laws continued to favor the planters and politicians of the older counties and to limit the influence of newly settled western areas.
slaves of course were disenfranchised by definition they were not considered citizens and were believed to have no legal or political rights.
free blacks could vote nowhere in the south and hardly anywhere in the north.
pennsylvania in fact amended its state constitution in 1838 to strip african americans of the right to vote they had previously enjoyed.
in no state could women vote.
nowhere was the ballot secret and often voters had to cast a spoken vote rather than a written one which meant that political bosses could and often did bribe and intimidate them.
despite the persisting limitations however the number of voters increased far more rapidly than did the population as a whole.
indeed one of the most striking political trends of the early nineteenth century was the change in the method of the dorr rebellion the democratic sentiments that swept much of the nation in the 1830s and 1840s led to among many other events the dorr rebellion as its opponents termed it in rhode island.
thomas dorr was one of many rhode islanders who denounced the state s constitution which limited voting rights to a small group of property owners known as freeholders.

in 1800 the legislature had chosen the presidential electors in ten of the states and the people in only six.
by 1828 electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but south carolina.
in the presidential election of 1824 less than 27 percent of adult white males had voted.
in the election of 1828 the figure rose to 58 percent and in 1840 to 80 percent.
tocqueville and democracy in america the rapid growth of the electorate and the emergence of political parties were among the most striking events of the early nineteenth century.
as the right to vote spread widely in these years it came to be the mark of freedom and democracy.
one of the most important commentaries on this extraordinary moment in american life was a book by a french aristocrat alexis de tocqueville.
he spent two years in the united states in the 1830s watching the dramatic political changes in the age of andrew jackson.
the french government had requested him to make a study of american prisons which were thought to he more humane and effective institutions than prisons in europe jacksonian america 233 its atprtstsiaks rep stis o u abm fey mwtie tocqueville.

alexis de tocqueville renowned french printmaker and lithographer honore daumier created this caricature of alexis de tocqueville in 1849.
tocqueville also a frenchman traveled throughout the united states for two years in the 1830s witnessing the extraordinary growth of the u s electorate.
in his famous book democracy in america he examined and analyzed the political cultural and social life of the united states.
his work strongly influenced how many in france and the rest of europe would understand the young country s experience of its emerging democracy.
sterling and francine clark art institute williamstown massachusetts usa the bridgeman art library but tocqueville quickly went far beyond the study of prisons and wrote a classic study of american life titled democracy in america.
tocqueville examined not just the politics of the united states but also the daily lives of many groups of americans and their cultures their associations and their visions of democracy.
in france in the early decades of the nineteenth century the fruits of democracy were largely restricted to landowners and aristocrats.
but tocqueville recognized that traditional aristocracies were rapidly fading in america and that new elites could rise and fall no matter what their backgrounds.
tocqueville also realized that the rising democracy of america had many limits.
democracy was a powerful visible force in the lives of most white men.
few women could vote although some shared the democratic ethos through their families.
for many other americans democracy was a distant hope.
tocqueville wrote of the limits of equality and democracy.
he first who attracts the eye the first in enlightenment in power and in happiness is the white man the european man par excellence below him appear the negro and the indian.
these two unfortunate races have neither birth nor face nor language nor mores in common only their misfortunes look alike.
both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit both experience the effects of tyranny and if their miseries are different they can accuse the same author for them.
tocquevilles book helped spread the idea of american democracy into france and other european nations.
only later did it become widely read and studied in the united states as a remarkable portrait of the emerging democracy of the united states.
the legitimization of party the high level of voter participation was only partly the result of an expanded electorate.
it was also the result of a growing interest in politics and a strengthening of party organization and perhaps equally important party loyalty.
although party competition was part of american politics almost from the beginning of the republic acceptance of the idea of party was not.
for more than thirty years most americans who had opinions about the nature of government considered parties evils to be avoided and thought the nation should seek a broad consensus in which permanent factional lines would not exist.
but in the 1820s and 1830s those assumptions gave way to a new view that permanent institutionalized parties were a desirable part of the political process that indeed they were essential to democracy.
the elevation of the idea of party occurred first at the state level most prominently in new york state.
there martin van buren led a dissident political faction known as the bucktails or the albany regency.
in the years after the war of 1812 this group began to challenge the established political leadership led by the aristocratic governor de witt clinton that had dominated the state for years.
factional rivalries were not new of course.
but the nature of van burens challenge was.
refuting the traditional view of a political party as undemocratic they argued that only an institutionalized party based in the populace at large could ensure genuine democracy.
the alternative was the sort of closed elite that clinton had created.
in the new kind of party the bucktails proposed ideological commitments would be less important than loyalty to the party itself.
preservation of the party as an institution through the use of favors rewards and patronage would be the principal goal of the leadership.
above all for a party to survive it must have a permanent opposition.
competing parties would give each political faction a sense of purpose they would force politicians to remain continually attuned to the will of the people and they would check and balance each other in much the same way that the different branches of government checked and balanced one another.
by the late 1820s this new idea of party was spreading beyond new york.
the election of jackson in 1828 the result of a popular movement that seemed to stand apart from the usual political elites seemed further to legitimize the idea of the second party as a popular democratic institution.
party system parties of some sort must exist said a new york newspaper.
tis in the nature and genius of our government finally in the 1830s a fully the age of jackson fp many americans in the 1820s and 1830s andrew jackson was a champion of democracy 1 tj a symbol of a spirit of anti elitism and egalitarianism that was sweeping american life.
in the twentieth and twenty first centuries however historians have disagreed sharply not only in their assessments of jackson himself but also in their portrayal of american society in his era.
the progressive historians of the early twentieth century tended to see the politics of jackson and his supporters as a forerunner of their own generation s battles against economic privilege and political corruption.
frederick jackson turner encouraged scholars to see jacksonianism as the product of the democratic west a protest by the people of the frontier against the conservative aristocracy of the east which they believed restricted their own freedom and opportunity.
jackson represented those who wanted to make government responsive to the will of the people rather than to the power of special interests.
the culmination of this progressive interpretation of jacksonianism was the publication in 1945 of arthur m schlesinger jr s the age of jackson.
less interested in the regional basis of jacksonianism than turner s disciples had been schlesinger argued that jacksonian democracy was an effort to control the power of the capitalist groups mainly eastern for the benefit of non capitalist groups farmers and laboring men east west and south.
he portrayed jacksonianism as an early version of modern reform efforts to restrain the power of the the library of congress 3g06446u business community.
richard hofstadter in an influential essay in his 1948 book the american political tradition sharply disagreed.
jackson he argued was the spokesman of rising entrepreneurs aspiring businessmen who saw the road to opportunity blocked by the monopolistic power of eastern formed two party system began to operate at the national level with each party committed to its own existence as an institution and willing to accept the legitimacy of its opposition.
the anti jackson forces began to call themselves whigs.
jacksons followers called themselves democrats no longer democratic republicans thus giving a permanent name to what is now the nations oldest political party.
president of the common man unlike thomas jefferson jackson was no democratic philosopher.
the democratic party much less than jeffersons republicans embraced no clear or uniform ideological position.
but jackson himself did embrace a distinct if simple theory of democracy.
it should offer equal protection and equal benefits to all its white male citizens and favor no region or class over another.
in practice that meant an assault on what jackson and his associates considered the citadels of the eastern aristocracy and an effort to extend opportunities to the rising classes of the west and the south.
it also meant a firm commitment to the continuing subjugation of african americans and indians and although for different reasons women for the jacksonians believed that only by keeping these dangerous elements from the body politic could the white male democracy they valued be preserved.
jacksons first targets were the entrenched officeholders in the federal government many of whom had been in place for a generation or more.
official duties he believed could be made so plain and simple that men of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their performance offices belonged to the people he argued not to the entrenched officeholders.
or as one of his henchmen william l marcy of new york cynically put it to the victors belong the spoils in the end jackson removed a total of no more than one fifth of the federal officeholders during his eight years in office many the spoils t lem ess hr partisan reasons than because system they had misused government funds or en gaged in other corruption.
proportionally jackson dismissed no more jobholders than jefferson had dismissed during his presidency.
but by embracing the philosophy of the spoils system a system already well entrenched in a number of state governments the jackson administration helped make the right of elected officials to appoint their own followers to public office an established feature of american politics.
jacksons supporters also worked to transform the process by which presidential candidates won their partys nomination.
they had long resented the congressional caucus a process they believed favored entrenched elites.
jackson himself had avoided the caucus process in 1828.
in 1832 the presidents followers staged a national party convention to aristocrats.
the jacksonian leaders were less sympathetic to the aspirations of those below them than they were to the destruction of obstacles to their own success.
bray hammond writing in 1957 argued similarly that the jacksonian cause was one of enterpriser against capitalist other historians saw jacksonianism less as a democratic reform movement than as a nostalgic effort to restore a lost and largely imagined past.
in the jacksonian persuasion 1957 marvin meyer argued that jackson and his followers looked with misgivings on the new industrial society emerging around them and yearned instead for a restoration of the agrarian republican virtues of an earlier time.
in the 1960s historians examining the jacksonian era began looking less at jackson himself and more at the nature of american society in the early nineteenth century.
lee benson s the concept of jacksonian democracy 1961 used quantitative methods to demonstrate the role of religion and ethnicity in determining political divisions in the 1830s.
edward pessen s jacksonian america 1969 portrayed the jacksonian era as an increasingly stratified society.
this inclination to look more closely at society than at formal jacksonianism continued into the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries.
sean wilentz in chants democratic 1984 and in the rise of american democracy 2005 examined the rise in the 1820s of powerful movements among ordinary citizens who were attracted less to jackson than to the notion of popular democracy.
gradually this attention to jacksonian era society has led to reassessments of jackson himself and the nature of his regime.
in fathers and children andrew jackson and the subjugation of the american indian 1975 michael rogin portrays jackson as a leader of a new american revolution not against british tyranny but against those who challenged the ability of white men to control the continent.
alexander saxton in the pise and fall of the white republic 1990 makes the related point that jacksonian democracy was explicitly a white man s democracy that rested on the subjugation of women slaves and indians.
but the portrayal of jackson as a champion of the common man has not vanished from scholarly life.
the leading jackson biographer of the postwar era robert v remini has noted the flaws in jackson s concept of democracy but within the context of his time remini claims jackson was a genuine man of the people.
understand analyze and evaluate 1.
what was jacksonian democracy.
was it a reform movement against conservative special interests.
was it a regional movement designed to shift power to the west.
or was it a class based movement to elevate workers and farmers.
jackson was known as a man of the people.
which people were attracted to him.
can you think of a political movement today that is similar to jacksonianism a people s protest against restrictions on their freedom and opportunity and the desire to make government responsive to the will of the people rather than to the power of special interests.
enominate him for the presidency one year after the anti masons see p 245 became the first party to hold such a neeting.
in later generations some americans would see the arty convention as a source of corruption and political exclusivity.
but those who created it in the 1830s considered t a great triumph for democracy.
through the convention hey believed power would arise directly from the people lot from aristocratic political institutions such as the caucus.
the spoils system and the political convention did serve to imit the power of two entrenched elites permanent officeholders and the exclusive party caucus.
yet neither really transferred power to the people.
appointments to office almost always went to prominent political allies of the president and his associates.
delegates to national conventions were less often common men than members of local arty organizations.
political opportunity within the party was landing but much less so than jacksonian rhetoric suggested.
limited nature of democratic reform federal union acksons commitment to extending power beyond entrenched elites led him to want to reduce the functions of the federal government.
the concentration of power in washington he believed restricted opportunity to people with political connections.
but jackson also believed in forceful presidential leadership and was strongly committed to the preservation of the union.
thus at the same time that jackson was promoting an economic program to reduce the power of the national government he was asserting the supremacy of the union in the face of a potent challenge.
for no sooner had he entered office than his own vice president john c calhoun began to champion a controversial and in jacksons view dangerous constitutional theory nullification.
calhoun and nullification calhoun was forty six years old in 1828 with a distinguished past and an apparently promising future.
but the smoldering issue of the tariff created a dilemma for him.
once he had been an outspoken protectionist and had strongly supported the tariff of 1816.
but by the late 1820s many south carolinians had come to believe that the tariff of abominations was responsible for the stagnation of the states economy even though the stagnation was largely a result of the exhaustion of south carolinas farmland which could no longer compete effectively with the newly opened fertile lands of the southwest.
some exasperated carolinians were ready to consider a drastic remedy secession.
235 236 chapter 9 john c calhoun this photograph by mathew brady captured calhoun toward the end of his life when he was torn between his real commitment to the ideals of the union and his equally fervent commitment to the interests of the south.
the younger generation of southern leaders who would dominate the politics of the region in the 1850s were less idealistic and more purely sectional in their views.
the library of congress calhouns theory of nullification calhouns future political hopes rested on how he met this challenge in his home state.
he did so by developing a theory that he believed offered a moderate alternative to secession the theory of nullification.
drawing from the ideas of madison and jefferson and their virginia and kentucky resolutions of 1798 1799 and citing the tenth amendment to the constitution calhoun argued that since the federal government was a creation of the states the states not the courts or congress were the final arbiters of the constitutionality of federal laws.
if a state concluded that congress had passed an unconstitutional law then it could hold a special convention and declare the federal law null and void within the state.
the nullification doctrine and the idea of using it to nullify the 1828 tariff quickly attracted broad support in south carolina.
but it did nothing to help calhouns standing within the new administration in part because he had a powerful rival in martin van buren.
the rise of van buren van buren was about the same age as calhoun and equally ambitious.
he had won election to the governorship of new york martin van burens growing influence in 1828 and then resigned in 1829 when jackson appointed him secretary of state.
alone among the figures in the jackson administration van buren soon established himself as a member both of the official cabinet and of the presidents unofficial circle of political allies known as the kitchen cabinet which included such democratic newspaper editors as isaac hill of new hampshire and amos kendall and francis p blair of kentucky.
van burens influence with the president was unmatched and grew stronger still as a result of a quarrel over etiquette that drove a wedge between the president and calhoun.
peggy oneale was the attractive daughter of a washington tavernkeeper with whom both andrew jackson and his friend john h eaton had taken lodgings while serving as senators from tennessee.
oneale was married but rumors circulated in washington in the mid 1820s that she and the unmarried senator eaton were having an affair.
o neales husband died in 1828 and she and eaton were soon married.
a few weeks later jackson named eaton secretary of war and thus made the new mrs eaton a cabinet wife.
the rest of the administration wives led by mrs calhoun refused to receive her socially.
jackson remembering the effects of public slander directed against his own late wife was furious and demanded that the members of the cabinet accept her into their social world.
calhoun under pressure from his wife refused.
van buren a widower befriended the eatons and thus ingratiated himself with jackson.
by 1831 partly as a result of the peggy eaton affair jackson had chosen van buren to succeed him in the white house apparently ending calhouns dreams of the presidency.
the webster hayne debate in january 1830 as the controversy over nullification grew more intense a great debate occurred in the u s senate over another sectional controversy.
in the midst of a routine debate over federal policy toward western lands a senator from connecticut suggested that all land sales and surveys in the west be temporarily discontinued so as to slow the growth of slavery.
robert y hayne a young senator from south carolina responded charging that slowing down the growth of the west was a way for the east to retain its political and economic power.
although he had no real interest in western lands he hoped his stance would attract support from westerners in congress for south carolinas drive to lower the tariff.
both the south and the west he argued were victims of the tyranny of the northeast.
he hinted that the two regions might combine to defend themselves against that tyranny.
daniel webster now a senator from massachusetts and a nationalistic whig attacked hayne the next day and through him calhoun for what he considered their challenge to the integrity of the union.
he was in fact challenging hayne to a debate not on public lands and the tariff but on the issue of states rights versus national power.
hayne coached by calhoun jacksonian america 237 martin van buren as leader of the so called albany regency in new york in the 1820s van buren helped create one of the first modern party organizations in the united states.
later as andrew jacksons secretary of state and after 1832 vice president he helped bring party politics to the national level.
in 1840 when he ran for reelection to the presidency he lost to william henry harrison whose whig party made effective use of many of the techniques of mass politics that van buren himself had pioneered.
the library of congress daniel webster the great civil war photographer mathew brady took this portrait of daniel webster shortly before webster s death in 1852.
it conveys something of webster s intensity of purpose an intensity that was perhaps most famously visible in his dramatic 1830 debate with south carolina senator robert y hayne.
in his response to hayne he spoke words that became a rallying cry in the north liberty and union now and forever one and inseparable.
during his long political career webster was one of the giants of american politics a man of much greater stature than many of the presidents who were his contemporaries.
the library of congress with his own the union next to our liberty most dear the two most important figures in government had drawn sharp lines between themselves.
responded with a defense of the theory of nullification.
webster then spent two full afternoons delivering what became known states rights as h s second reply to hayne a speech versus national t lat northerners quoted and revered for power years to come.
he concluded with the ringing appeal liberty and union now and forever one and inseparable both sides now waited to hear what president jackson thought of the argument.
the answer became clear at the annual democratic party banquet in honor of thomas jefferson.
after dinner guests delivered a series of toasts.
the president arrived with a written text in which he had underscored certain words our federal union it must be preserved while he spoke he looked directly at calhoun.
the diminutive van buren who stood on his chair to see better thought he saw calhouns hand shake and a trickle of wine run down his glass as he responded to the president s toast the nullification crisis in 1832 finally the controversy over nullification produced a crisis.
a congressional tariff bill was passed that offered south carolinians no relief from the 1828 tariff of abominations almost immediately the legislature summoned a state convention which voted to nullify the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 and to forbid the collection of duties within the state.
at the same time south carolina elected hayne to serve as governor and calhoun who resigned as vice president to replace hayne as senator.
jackson insisted that nullification was treason and that those implementing it were traitors.
he strengthened the federal forts in south carolina and ordered a warship and several revenue ships to charleston.
when congress convened early in 1833 jackson proposed a force bill authorizing the president to use the military to see that acts of congress were obeyed.
violence seemed a real possibility.
238 chapter 9 new york harbor this aquatint by w j bennett after the painting by john william hill shows manhattan viewed from brooklyn heights around 1836.
by this time overseas traders had increasingly directed their business to new york leaving much less opportunity for other cities especially those in the south.
the granger collection new york compromise calhoun faced a predicament as he took his place in the senate.
not a single state had come to south carolinas support.
even south carolina itself was divided and could not hope to prevail in a showdown with the federal government.
but the timely intervention of henry clay newly elected to the senate averted a crisis.
clay devised a compromise by which the tariff would be lowered grad ually so that by 1842 it would reach approximately the same level as in 1816.
the compromise and the force bill were passed on the same day march 1 1833.
jackson signed them both.
in south carolina the convention reassembled and repealed its nullification of the tariffs.
calhoun and his followers claimed a victory for nullification which had they insisted forced the revision of the tariff.
but the episode made clear that no state could defy the federal government alone.
the removal of the indians there had never been any doubt about andrew jacksons attitude toward the indian tribes that continued to live in the eastern states and territories of the united states.
he wanted them to move west beyond the mississippi out of the way of expanding white settlement.
jacksons antipathy toward the native americans had a special intensity because of his own earlier experiences leading military campaigns against tribes along the southern border.
but in most respects his views were little different from those of most other white americans.
white attitudes toward the tribes changing attitudes toward the indians in the eighteenth century many white americans had consid ered the indians noble savages peoples without real civilization.
but with an inherent dignity that made civilization possible among them by the first decades of the nineteenth cen tury this vaguely paternalistic attitude the attitude of thomas jefferson amoty others was giving way to a more hostile one particular.
among the whites in the western states and territories whom jackson came to represent.
such whites were coming to view native americans simply as savages not only uncivilized but uncivilizable.
whites they believed should not be expect to live in close proximity to the tribes.
jacksonian america 239 white westerners favored removal as well because they feared that continued contact between the expanding white settlements and the indians would produce endless conflict and violence.
most of all however they favored indian removal because of their own insatiable desire for territory.
the tribes possessed valuable land in the path of expanding white settlement.
white americans wanted it.
the black hawk war sauk and fox indians defeated in the old northwest the long process of expelling the woodland indians culminated in a last battle in 1831 1832 between white settlers in illinois and an alliance of sauk or sac and fox indians under the fabled and now aged warrior black hawk.
an earlier treaty had ceded tribal lands in illinois to the united states but black hawk and his followers refused to recognize the legality of the agreement which a rival tribal faction had signed.
hungry and resentful a thousand of them crossed the river and reoccupied vacant lands in illinois.
white settlers in the region feared that the resettlement was the beginning of a substantial invasion and they assembled the illinois state militia and federal troops to repel the invaders the black hawk war as it became known was notable chiefly for the viciousness of the white military efforts.
white leaders in western illinois vowed to exterminate the bandit collection of indians and attacked them even when black hawk attempted to surrender.
the sauks and foxes defeated and starving retreated across the mississippi into iowa.
white troops and some bands of sioux whom they encouraged to join the chase pursued them as they fled and black hawk and whirling thunder after his defeat by white settlers in illinois in 1832 the famed sauk warrior black hawk and his son whirling thunder were capture sent on a tour of the east by andrew jackson displayed to the public as trophies of w y showed such dignity through the ordeal that much of the white public quickly began to sympa iz with them.
this portrait by john wesley jarvis was painted on the tour s final stop in ew or city.
black hawk wears the european style suit while whirling thunder wears native emphasize his commitment to his tribal roots.
soon thereafter black hawk returned wrote a celebrated autobiography and died in 1838.
the granger collection ne slaughtered most of them.
united states troops captured black hawk himself and sent him on a tour of the east where andrew jackson was one of many curious whites who arranged to meet him.
abraham lincoln served as a captain of the militia but saw no action in the black hawk war jefferson davis was a lieutenant in the regular army.
the five civilized tribes agrarian tribes of the south removal act more troubling to the government in the 1830s were the tribes remaining in the south.
in western georgia alabama mississippi and florida lived what were known as the five civilized tribes the cherokee creek seminole chickasaw and choctaw most of whom had established settled agricultural societies with successful economies.
the cherokees in georgia had formed a particularly stable and sophisticated culture with their own written language and a formal constitution adopted in 1827 that created an independent cherokee nation.
they were more closely tied to their lands than many of the nomadic tribes to the north.
even some whites argued that the cherokees unlike other tribes should be allowed to retain their eastern lands since they had become such a civilized society and had under pressure from missionaries and government agents given up many of their traditional ways.
cherokee men had once been chiefly hunters and had left farming mainly to women.
by now the men had given up most of their hunting and like most white men took over the farming themselves cherokee women also like their white counterparts restricted themselves largely to domestic tasks.
the federal government worked steadily to negotiate treaties with the southern indians that would remove them to the west and open their lands for white settlement.
but the negotiating process did not proceed fast enough to satisfy the regions whites.
the state of georgias independent effort to dislodge the creeks over the objection of president adams was one example of this impatience.
that same impatience became evident early in jacksons administration when the legislatures in georgia alabama and mississippi began passing laws to regulate the tribes remaining in their states.
they received assistance in these efforts from congress which in 1830 passed the removal act with jacksons approval to appropriate money to finance federal negotiations with the southern tribes aimed at relocating them to the west.
the president quickly dispatched federal officials to negotiate nearly a hundred new treaties with the remaining tribes.
thus the southern tribes faced a combination of pressures from both the state and federal governments.
most tribes were too weak to resist and they ceded their lands in return for token payments.
some however balked.
in georgia the cherokees tried to stop the white encroachments which were actively encouraged by jackson by appealing to the supreme court.
the courts decisions in cherokee nation v georgia and worcester v georgia in 1831 and 1832 see p 224 seemed at least partially to vindicate the tribe.
but jacksons longtime hostility toward native americans left him 240 chapter 9 with little sympathy for the cherokees and little patience with the court.
he was eager to retain the support of white southerners and westerners in the increasingly bitter partisan battles in which his administration was becoming engaged.
when the chief justice announced the decision in worcester v georgia jackson reportedly responded with contempt.
john marshall has made his decision he was reported to have said.
now let him enforce it the decision was not enforced.
in 1835 the federal government extracted a treaty from a minority faction of the cherokees none of them a chosen rep cherokee resentative of the cherokee nation.
the resistance treaty ceded the tribes land to georgia in return for 5 million and a reservation west of the mississippi.
the great majority of the 17 000 cherokees did not recognize the treaty as legitimate and refused to leave their homes.
but jackson would not be thwarted.
he sent an army of 7 000 under general winfield scott to round them up and drive them westward at bayonet point.
trails of tears about 1 000 cherokees fled across the state line to north carolina where the federal government eventually provided a cherokee small reservation for them in the smoky removal mountains which survives today.
but most of the rest made the long forced trek to indian territory which later became oklahoma beginning in the winter of 1838.
along the way a kentuckian observed even aged females apparently nearly ready to drop in the grave were travelling with heavy burdens attached to their backs sometimes on frozen ground and sometimes on muddy streets with no covering for their feet thousands perhaps an eighth or more of the emigres perished before or soon after reaching their unwanted destination.
indian in harsh new reservations in which they removal were now forced to live the survivors never forgot the hard journey.
they called their route the trail where they cried the trail of tears.
jackson claimed that the remnant of that ill fated race was now beyond the reach of injury or oppression apparently trying to convince himself or others that he had supported removal as a way to protect the tribes.
the cherokees were not alone in experiencing the hardships of the trail of tears.
between 1830 and 1838 virtually all the five civilized tribes were expelled from the southern states and forced to relocate in the new indian territory which the white house he ensured the few indians wouid remain oft h h exp its tribes ce dramatic removals of indian tribes ou of their traditiona a dti 7m w e se le sing there.
the result was a series of tribes had to travel.
ln west f the m ss ss ppi mostly in oklahoma.
note the very long distance many of these why os the route of the cherokees sho n in the upper portion of the map kno n os the trai of tears.
jacksonian america 241 congress had officially created by the indian intercourse act of 1834.
the choctaws of mississippi and western alabama were the first to make the trek beginning in 1830.
the army moved out the creeks of eastern alabama and western georgia in 1836.
the chickasaws in northern mississippi began the long march westward a year later and the cherokees finally a year after that.
the government thought the indian territory was safely distant from existing white settlements and consisted of land that most whites considered undesirable.
it had the additional advantage the government believed of being on the eastern edge of what earlier white explorers had christened the great american desert land unfit for habitation.
it seemed unlikely that whites would ever seek to settle along the western borders of the indian territory and thus the prospect of whites surrounding the reservation and producing further conflict seemed remote.
only the seminoles in florida managed to resist the pressures to relocate and even their success was limited.
like other tribes the seminoles had agreed under pressure to a settlement the 1832 1833 treaties of paynes landing by which they ceded their lands to the government and agreed to move to indian territory within three years.
most did move west but a substantial minority under the leadership of the chieftain osceola refused to leave and staged an uprising beginning in 1835 to defend their lands.
joining the seminoles in their struggle was a group of runaway black slaves who had been living with the tribe.
the seminole war dragged on for years.
jackson sent troops to florida but the seminoles with their african american associates were masters of guerrilla warfare in the seminole the jungly everlades even after osceola war had been treacherously captured by white troops while under a flag of truce and had died in prison even after white troops had engaged in a systematic campaign of extermination against the resisting indians and their black allies even after 1 500 white soldiers had died and the federal government had spent 20 million on the struggle even then followers of osceola remained in florida.
finally in 1842 the government abandoned the war.
by then many of the seminoles had been either killed or forced westward.
but the relocation of the seminoles unlike the relocation of most of the other tribes was never complete.
the meaning of removal by the end of the 1830s almost all the important indian societies east of the mississippi had been removed to the west.
the tribes had ceded over 100 million acres of eastern land to the federal government they had received in return about 68 million and 32 million acres in the far less hospitable lands west of the mississippi between the missouri and red rivers.
there they lived divided by tribe into a series of carefully de fined reservations in a territory surrounded by a string o united states forts to keep them in and to keep most w ites out in a region whose climate and topography bore little re a don to anything they had known before.
eventually even t is forlorn enclave would face incursions from white civilization.
what were the alternatives to the removal of the eastern indians.
there was probably never any realistic possibility that the government could stop white expansion westward.
white people had already been penetrating the west for nearly two centuries and such penetrations were certain to continue.
but did that expansion really require removal.
there were in theory at least several alternatives to the brutal removal policy.
there were many examples in the west of white settlers and native tribes living side by alternatives side anj creating a shared if not necessarily to removal equai world.

this policy forced thousands of native americans from their traditional tribal lands to new reservations west of the mississippi river.
the cherokees were among the first tribes forced to move.
the conditions of this forced displacement were harsh and many people died prompting survivors to call the route they had traveled the trail of tears.
private collection peter newark american pictures the bridgeman art library 242 chapter 9 in the fur trading posts of the pacific northwest in parts of texas and california settlers from mexico canada and the united states had created societies in which indians and whites were in intimate contact with each other.
even during the famous lewis and clark expedition white explorers had lived with western indians on terms of such intimacy that many of them contracted venereal disease from indian sexual partners.
sometimes these close contacts between whites and indians were beneficial to both sides even reasonably equal.
sometimes they were cruel and exploitive.
but the early multiracial societies of the west did not separate whites and indians.
they demonstrated ways in which the two cultures could interact each shaping the other.
by the mid nineteenth century however white americans had adopted a different model as they contemplated westward expansion.
much as the early british settlers along the atlantic coast had established plantations from which natives were in theory to be excluded so the westward moving whites of later years came to imagine the territories they were entering as virgin land with no preexisting civilization.
native americans they believed could not be partners either equal or subordinate in the creation of new societies in the west.
they were obstacles to be removed and as far as possible isolated.
indians andrew jackson once said had neither the intelligence the industry the moral habits nor the desire of improvement to be fit partners in the project of extending white civilization westward.
by dismissing native american cultures in that way white americans justified to themselves a series of harsh policies that they believed incorrectly would make the west theirs alone.
jackson and the bank war jacksons opposition to concentrated power jackson was quite willing to use federal power against rebellious states and indian tribes.
on economic issues however he was consistently opposed to concentrating power either in the federal government or in powerful and in his view aristocratic institutions associated with it.
an early example of his skeptical view of federal power was his 1830 veto of a congressional measure providing a subsidy to the proposed maysville road in kentucky.
the bill was unconstitutional jackson argued because the road in question lay entirely within kentucky and was not therefore a part of interstate commerce but the bill was also unwise he believed because it committed the government to what jackson considered extravagant expenditures.
jackson s opposition to federal power and aristocratic privilege lay behind the most celebrated episode of his presidency the war against the bank of the united states.
biddle s institution the bank of the united states in the 1830s was a mighty institution and it is not surprising that it would attract jacksons wrath.
its stately headquarters in philadelphia seemed to hard and soft money nicholas symbolize its haughty image of itself it biddle had branches in twenty nine other cities making it the most powerful and far flung financial institution in the nation.
by law the bank was the only place that the federal government could deposit its own funds the government in turn owned one fifth of the banks stock.
the bank did a tremendous business in general banking.
it provided credit to growing enterprises it issued bank notes which served as a dependable medium of exchange throughout the country and it exercised a restraining effect on the less well managed state banks.
nicholas biddle who served as president of the bank from 1823 on had done much to put the institution on a sound and prosperous basis.
nevertheless andrew jackson was determined to destroy it.
opposition to the bank came from two very different groups the soft money faction and the hard money faction.
advocates of soft money people who wanted more currency in circulation and believed that issuing bank notes unsupported by gold and silver was the best way to circulate more currency consisted largely of state bankers and their allies.
they objected to the bank of the united states because it restrained the state banks from issuing notes freely.
the hard money people believed that gold and silver were the only basis for money.
they condemned all banks that issued bank notes including the bank of the united states.
the soft money advocates were believers in rapid economic growth and speculation the hard money forces embraced older ideas of public virtue and looked with suspicion on expansion and speculation.
jackson supported the hard money position.
many years before he had been involved in some grandiose land and commercial speculations based on paper credit.
his business had failed in the panic of 1797 and he had fallen deeply into debt.
after that he was suspicious of all banks and all paper currency.
but as president he was also sensitive to the complaints of his many soft money supporters in the west and the south.
he made it clear that he would not favor renewing the charter of the bank of the united states which was due to expire in 1836.
a philadelphia aristocrat unaccustomed to politics biddle nevertheless began granting financial favors to influential men who he thought might help him preserve the bank.
in particular he turned to daniel webster and cultivated a close personal friendship with him.
he named webster the banks legal counsel and director of its boston branch webster was also a frequent heavy borrower from the bank.
he helped biddle win the support of other important figures among them henry clay.
clay webster and other advisers persuaded biddle to apply to congress in 1832 for a bill to renew the banks charter.
that was four years ahead of the date the original charter was scheduled to expire.
but forcing a vote now would allow the bank to become a major issue in the 1832 national elections.
congress jacksons veto passed the recharter bill jackson prediet ably vetoed it and the banks supporters in jacksonian america 243 candidate party electoral vote popular vote andrew jackson democrat 219 687 502 55 a henry clay 49 national republican 530 189 42 william wirt anti mason 7 33 108 3 john floyd independent democrat not voted 11 2 the election of 1832 jacksons reelection victory in 1832 was almost as decisive as his earlier victory in 1828.
what changes are visible in party loyalties since the previous election.
congress failed to override the veto.
just as clay had hoped the 1832 campaign now centered on the future of the bank.
clay ran for president that year as the unanimous choice of the national republicans who held a nominating convention in baltimore late in 1831.
but the bank war failed to provide him with the winning issue for which he had hoped.
jackson with van buren as his running mate overwhelmingly defeated clay and several minor party candidates with 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes more than four times as many as clay received.
these results were a defeat not only for clay but also for biddle.
appointed a new one.
when the new secretary similarly balked jackson fired him too and named a third more compliant secretary attorney general roger b taney his close friend and loyal ally.
taney began placing the governments deposits not in the bank of the united states as it had in the past but in a number of state banks which jacksons enemies called pet banks.
nicholas biddle whom jacksonians derisively called czar nicholas did not give in without a fight.
this worthy president he wrote sarcastically thinks that because he has scalped indians and imprisoned judges he is to have his way with the bank.
he is mistaken when the administration began to transfer funds directly from the bank of the united states to the pet banks as opposed to the initial practice of simply depositing new funds in those banks biddle called in loans and raised interest rates explaining that without the government deposits the banks resources were stretched too thin.
he realized his actions were likely to cause financial distress.
he hoped a short recession would persuade congress to recharter the bank.
nothing but the evidence of suffering he told a colleague would produce any effect in congress by now the struggle had become not just a conflict over policy and principle but also a bitter personal battle between two proud men both of them acting recklessly in an effort to humiliate and defeat the other.
as financial conditions worsened in the winter of 1833 1834 supporters of the bank blamed jacksons policies for the recession.
they organized meetings around the country and sent petitions to washington urging a rechartering of the bank.
but the jacksonians blamed the recession on biddle and refused to budge.
when distressed citizens appealed to the president for help he dismissively answered go to biddle finally biddle contracted credit too far even for his own allies in the business community who began to fear that in his effort to save his own bank he was threatening their interests.
some of them did go to biddle a group of new york and boston merchants protested.
to appease the business community biddle at last reversed himself and began to grant credit in abundance and on reasonable terms.
his vacillating and unpopular tactics ended his chances of winning a recharter of the bank.
jackson had won a considerable political victory.
but when the bank of the united states died in 1836 the country lost a jackson valuable albeit flawed financial institution victorious and was left with a fragmented and chronically unstable banking system that would plague the economy for more than a century.
the monster destroyed ackson was now more determined than ever to destroy the monster bank as quickly as possible.
he could not legally abolish the institution before the expiration of its charter.
instead he tried to weaken it.
he decided to remove the government s deposits from the bank.
his secretary of the trea sury believed that such an action would destabilize the financial system and refused to give the order.
jackson fired him an removal of government deposits the taney court in the aftermath of the bank war jackson moved against the most powerful institution of economic nationalism of all the supreme court.
in 1835 when john marshall died the president appointed as the new chief justice his trusted ally roger b taney.
taney did not bring a sharp break in constitutional interpretation but he gradually helped modify marshalls vigorous nationalism.
perhaps the clearest indication of the new judicial mood was the celebrated case of charles river bridge v warren bridge 244 chapter 9 tot.

the library of congress lc usz62 809 charles river bridge v warren bridge of 1837.
the case involved a dispute between two massachusetts companies over the right to build a bridge across the charles river between boston and cambridge.
one company had a long standing charter from the state to operate a toll bridge and claimed that this charter guaranteed it a monopoly of the bridge traffic.
another company had applied to the legislature for authorization to construct a second competing bridge that would since it would be toll free greatly reduce the value of the first company s charter.
the first company contended that in granting the second charter the legislature was engaging in a breach of contract and noted that the marshall court in the dartmouth college case and other decisions had ruled that states had no right to abrogate contracts.
but now taney speaking for the democratic majority on the court supported the right of massachusetts to award the second charter.
the object of government taney maintained was to promote the general happiness an object that took precedence over the rights of contract and property.
a state therefore had the right to amend or abrogate a contract if such action was necessary to advance the well being of the community.
such an abrogation was clearly necessary in the case of the charles river bridge he argued because the original bridge company by exercising a monopoly was benefiting from unjustifiable privilege.
it did not help the first company that its members were largely boston aristocrats closely associated with harvard college the challenging company by contrast consisted largely of newer aspiring entrepreneurs the sort of people with whom jackson and his allies instinctively identified.
the decision reflected one of the cornerstones of the jacksonian ideal that the key to democracy was an expansion of economic opportunity which would not occur if older corporations could maintain monopolies and choke off competition from newer companies.
the changing face of american politics jacks on s lorcelul some people claimed tyrannical crushing first the nullification movement and then the bank o the united states helped galvanize a growing birto of the opposition coalition that by the mid 1830 was ready to assert itself in national poimu jacksonian america 245 denouncing the president as king andrew i they began to refer to themselves as whigs after the party in england that had traditionally worked to limit the power of the king.
with the emergence of the whigs the nation once again had two competing political parties.
what scholars now call the second party system began what turned out to be its relatively brief life.
democrats and whigs the two parties were different from one another in their philosophies in their constituencies and in the character of their democrats emphasis on opportunity leaders.
but they became increasingly alike in the way they approached the process of electing their followers to office.
democrats in the 1830s envisioned a future of steadily expanding economic and political opportunities for white males.
the role of government should be limited they believed but it should include efforts to remove obstacles to opportunity and to avoid creating new ones.
that meant defend ing the union which jacksonians believed was essential to the dynamic economic growth they favored.
it also meant attacking centers of corrupt privilege.
as jackson himself said in his farewell address the society of america should be one in which the planter the farmer the mechanic and the laborer all know that their success depends on their own industry and economy in which artificial privilege would stifle no ones opportunity.
among the most radical members of the party the so called locofocos mainly workingmen and small businessmen and professionals in the northeast sentiment was strong for a vigorous perhaps even violent assault on monopoly and privilege far in advance of anything jackson himself ever contemplated.
the political philosophy that became known as whiggery was very different.
it favored expanding the power of the fed whigs call eral 8overnment encouraging industrial for economic an commercial development and knitting union the country together into a consolidated economic system.
whigs embraced material progress enthusiastically but unlike the democrats they were cautious about westward expansion fearful that rapid territorial growth would produce instability.
their vision of america was of a nation embracing the industrial future and rising to world greatness as a commercial and manufacturing power.
thus while democrats were inclined to oppose legislation establishing banks corporations and other modernizing institutions whigs generally favored such measures.
the whigs were strongest among the more substantial merchants and manufacturers of the northeast the wealthier planters of the south those who favored commercial development and the strengthening of ties with the north and the ambitious farmers and rising commercial class of the west usually migrants from the northeast who advocated internal improvements expanding trade and rapid economic progress.
the democrats drew more support from smaller merchants and the workingmen of the northeast from southern planters suspicious of industrial growth and from westerners usually with southern roots who favored a predominantly agrarian anti masons economy and opposed the development of powerful economic institutions in their region.
whigs tended to be wealthier than democrats to have more aristocratic backgrounds and to be more commercially ambitious.
but whig and democratic politicians alike were more interested in winning elections than in maintaining philosophical purity.
and both parties made frequent adjustments in their public postures to attract the largest possible number of voters.
in new york for example the whigs worked to develop a popular following by making a connection to a movement known as anti masonry.
the anti mason movement had emerged in the 1820s in response to widespread resentment against the secret exclusive and hence supposedly undemocratic society of freemasons.
such resentments greatly increased in 1826 when a former mason william morgan mysteriously disappeared and was assumed to have been murdered from his home in batavia new york shortly before he was scheduled to publish a book exposing the supposed secrets of freemasonry.
whigs seized on the anti mason frenzy to launch harsh attacks on jackson and van buren both freemasons implying that the democrats were part of the antidemocratic conspiracy.
in the process the whigs presented themselves as opponents of aristocracy and exclusivity.
they were attacking the democrats with the democrats own issues.
religious and ethnic divisions also played an important role in determining the constituencies of the two parties.
irish and german catholics among the largest of the recent immigrant groups tended to support the democrats who appeared to cultural share their own vague aversion to commer issues cial development and entrepreneurial prog ress and who seemed to respect family and community centered values and habits.
evangelical protestants gravitated toward the whigs because they associated the party with constant development and improvement goals their own faith embraced.
these and other ethnic religious and cultural tensions were often more influential in determining party alignments than any concrete political or economic proposals.
the whig party was more successful at defining its positions and attracting a constituency than it was in uniting behind a national leader.
no single person was ever able to command the loyalties of the party in the way andrew jackson did the democrats.
instead whigs tended to divide their loyalties among three figures each of whom was so substantial a figure that together they became known as the great triumvirate henry clay daniel webster and john calhoun.
clay won support from many of those who favored his program for internal improvements and economic development what he called the american system but his image as a devious operator and his identification with the west proved to be serious liabilities.
he ran for president three times and never won.
daniel webster the greatest orator of his era won broad support with his passionate speeches in defense of the constitution and the union but his close connection with the bank of the united states and the protective clays american system 246 chapter 9 tariff his reliance on rich men for financial support and his excessive and often embarrassing fondness for brandy prevented him from developing enough of a national constituency to win him the office he so desperately wanted.
john c calhoun the third member of the great triumvirate never considered himself a true whig and his identification with the nullification controversy in effect disqualified him from national leadership in any case.
but he had tremendous strength in the south supported a national bank and shared with clay and webster a strong animosity toward andrew jackson.
the problems that emerged from this divided leadership became particularly clear in 1836.
the democrats were united behind andrew jacksons personal choice for president martin van buren.
the whigs could not agree on a single candidate.
instead they ran several candidates hoping to profit from the regional strength of each.
webster represented the party in new england hugh lawson white of tennessee ran in the south and the former indian fighter and hero of the war of 1812 william henry harrison from ohio was the candidate in the middle states and the west.
party leaders hoped the three candidates election of 1836 candidate party electoral vote popular vote martin van buren 170 765 483 democrat 50 9 w h harrison 73 550 816 whig 36 6 hugh l white 26 146 107 whig 9 7 daniel webster 14 41 201 whig 2 7 w p magnum 11 independent the election of 1836 martin van buren who had served as vice president and secret of state for andrew jackson was the democratic candidate for president in 1836.
his connection to the revered jackson helped him easily defeat his whig opponent william henry harrison.
four yea later the same two men contested the presidency but that time it was harrison who won.
together might draw enough votes from van buren to prevent his getting a majority and throw the election to the house of representatives where the whigs might be able to elect one of their own leaders.
in the end however van buren won easily with 170 electoral votes to 124 for all his opponents combined.
van buren ano the panic of 1837 andrew jackson retired from public life in 1837 beloved by most americans.
martin van buren was very different from his predecessor and far less fortunate.
he was never able to match jacksons personal popularity and his administration encountered economic difficulties that devastated the democrats and helped the whigs.
van burens success in the 1836 election was a result in part of a nationwide economic boom that was reaching its height in that year.
canal and railroad builders were at a peak of activity.
prices were rising money was plentiful and credit was easy as banks increased their loans and notes with little regard to their reserves of cash.
the land business in particular was booming.
between 1835 and 1837 the government sold nearly 40 million acres of public land nearly three fourths of it to speculators who purchased large tracts in hopes of reselling them at a profit.
these land sales along with revenues the government received from the tariff of 1833 created a series of substantial federal budget surpluses and made possible a steady reduction of the national debt something jackson had always advocated.
from 1835 to 1837 the government for the first and only time in its history was out of debt with a substantial surplus in the treasury.
congress and the administration now faced the question of what to do with the treasury surplus.
reducing the tariff was not an option since no one wanted to raise that thorny issue again.
instead support grew for returning the federal surplus to distribution t ie states 1836 congress passed a dis act tribution act requiring the federal government to pay its surplus funds to the states each year in four quarterly installments as interest free unsecured loans.
no one expected the loans to be repaid.
the states spent the money quickly mainly to encourage construction of highways railroads and canals.
the distribution of the surplus thus gave further stimulus to the economic boom.
congress did nothing to check the speculative fever with which many congressmen themselves were badly infected.
webster for one was buying up thousands of acres in the west.
but jackson always suspicious of paper currency was unhappy that the government was selling good land and receiving in return various state bank notes worth no more than the credit of the issuing bank.
in 1836 not long before leaving office he issued a presidential order the specie circular it provided that in payment for public lands the government would accept only gold or silver coins or currency securely backed by gold or silver.
jackson was right to fear the speculative fever but wrong m thinking the specie circular would cure it.
on the contrary it produced a financial panic that began in the first months of jacksonian america 247 the times 1837 this savage caricature of the economic troubles besetting the united states in 1837 illustrates among other things popular resentment of the hard money orthodoxies of the time.

museum of the city of new york usa the bridgeman art library panic of 1837 van burens presidency.
hundreds of banks and businesses failed.
unemployment grew.
bread riots broke out in some of the larger cities.
prices fell especially the price of land.
many railroad and canal projects failed.
several of the debt burdened state governments ceased to pay interest on their bonds and a few repudiated their debts at least temporarily.
it was the worst depression in american history to that point and it lasted for five years.
it was a political catastrophe for van buren and the democrats.
both parties bore some responsibility for the panic.
but the depression was only partly a result of american policies.
england and western europe were facing panics of their own which caused european and especially english investors to withdraw funds from america putting an added strain on american banks.
a succession of crop failures on american farms reduced the purchasing power of farmers and required increased imports of food which sent more money out of the country.
but whatever its actual causes the panic of 1837 occurred during a democratic administration and the democrats paid the political price for it.
the van buren administration which strongly opposed government intervention in the economy did little to fight the depression.
some of the steps it took borrowing money to pay government debts and accepting only specie for payment of taxes may have made things worse.
van buren did succeed in establishing a ten hour workday on all federal projects by presidential order but he had only a few legislative achievements.
the most important and controversial of them was the creation of a new financial system to replace the bank of the united states.
under van burens plan known as the independent treasury or subtreasury system the government would independent place its funds in an independent treasury treasury at washington and in subtreasuries in other cities.
no private banks would have the governments money or name to use as a basis for specula tion the government and the banks would be divorced van buren called a special session of congress in 1837 to consider the proposal which failed in the house.
in 1840 the last year of van burens presidency the administration finally succeeded in driving the measure through both houses of congress.
the log cabin campaign as the campaign of 1840 approached the whigs realized that they would have to settle on one candidate for president this time if they were to have any hope of winning.
as a 248 chapter 9 result they held their first national nominating convention in harrisburg pennsylvania in december 1839.
passing over the controversial henry clay who had expected the nomination the convention chose william henry harrison and for vice president john tyler of virginia.
harrison was a descendant of the virginia aristocracy but had spent his adult life in the northwest.
he was a renowned soldier a famous indian fighter and a popular national figure.
the democrats nominated van buren.
but because they were not much more united than the whigs they failed to nominate a vice presidential candidate leaving the choice of that office to the electors.
the 1840 campaign was the first in which the new popular penny press carried news of the candidates to a large audience of workers and tradespeople.
it also illustrated how fully the concept of party competition the new subordination of ideology to immediate techniques political needs had established itself in of political america.
the whigs represented the af campaigning fluent elements of the population and they favored government policies that would aid business.
but they presented themselves in 1840 as the party of the common people.
so of course did the democrats.
both parties used the same techniques of mass voter appeal the same evocation of simple rustic values.
what mattered now was not the philosophical purity of the party but its ability to win votes.
the whig campaign was particularly effective in portraying william henry harrison a wealthy member of the frontier elite with a considerable estate as a simple man of the people who loved log cabins and hard cider.
they accused van buren of being an aloof aristocrat who used cologne drank champagne and ate from gold plates.
the democrats had no defense against the combination of these campaign techniques and the effects of the depression.
harrison won the election with 234 electoral votes to 60 for van buren and with a popular vote majority of 53 percent.
the frustration of the whigs despite their decisive victory the whigs found their four years in power frustrating and divisive.
in large part that was because their popular new president old tippecanoe william henry harrison died of pneumonia one month after taking office.
vice president tyler succeeded him.
control of the administration thus fell to a man with whom the whig party leadership had weak ties.
harrison had generally deferred harrison and reform this hand colored engraving was made for a brass brooch during the 1840 presidential campaign and served the same purposes that modern campaign buttons do.
it conveys harrison s presumably humble beginnings in a log cabin.
in reality harrison was a wealthy aristocratic man but the unpopularity of the aristocratic airs of his opponent president martin van buren persuaded the whig party that it would be good political strategy to portray harrison as a humble man of the people.

van buren unlike jackson was president during a sharp economic recession.
and even though his opponent william henry harrison was a wealthy frontier aristocrat the whig party effectively portrayed him as a humble man o t e people a contrast to what they claimed was van buren s extravagance and elitism.

the granger collection new york to henry clay and daniel webster whom he named secretary of state.
under tyler things quickly changed.
tyler was a former democrat who had left the party in reaction to what he considered jacksons excessively egalitarian program and imperious methods.
but there were still signs of his democratic past in his approach to public policy.
the president did agree to bills abolishing van burens independent treasury system and raising tariff rates.
but he refused to support clays attempt to recharter a bank of the united states.
and he vetoed several internal improvement bills that clay whigs b gak 1 congression.
whigs sponsor with tyler finally a conference of cong whigs read tyler out of the party.
every cabinet member but webster resigned five former democrats took their places.
when webster too left the cabinet ty er appointed calhoun who had rejoined the democratic party to replace him.
a new political alignment was emerging.
tyler and a small band of conservative southern whigs were preparing to rejoin the democrats.
joining the common mans party of jackson and van buren was a faction with decidedly aristocratic political ideas who thought that government had an obligation to protect and even expand the institution of slavery and who believed in states rights with almost fanatical devotion.
whig diplomacy in the midst of these domestic controversies a series of incidents in the late 1830s brought great britain and the united states once again to the brink of war.
residents of the eastern provinces of canada launched a rebellion against the british colonial government in 1837 and some of the rebels chartered an american steamship the caroline to ship supplies across the penny press r september 3 1833 a small newspaper appeared in new york city for the first time the new york sun published by a young former apprentice from massachusetts named benjamin day.
four pages long it contained mostly trivial local news with particular emphasis on sex crime and violence.

the poor pittance of several years is not worth being a villain for.
collection of the new york historical society tory of american journalism the age of the penny press.
before the advent of the penny press newspapers in america were far too expensive for most ordinary citizens to buy.
but several important changes in the business of journalism and the character of american society paved the way for benjamin day and others to challenge the established press.
new technologies the steam powered cylinder printing press new machines for making paper railroads and canals for distributing issues to a larger market made it possible to publish newspapers inexpensively and to sell them widely.
a rising popular literacy rate a result in part of the spread of public education created a bigger reading public.
the penny press was also a response to the changing culture of the 1820s and 1830s.
the spread of an urban market economy contributed to the growth of the penny press by drawing a large population of workers artisans and clerks into large cities where they became an important market for the new papers.
the spirit of democracy symbolized by the popularity of andrew jackson and the rising numbers of white male voters across the country helped create an appetite for journalism that spoke to and for the people.
hence benjamin day s slogan for his new paper it shines for all.
the sun and papers like it were committed to feeding the appetites of the people of modest means who constituted most of their readership.
human interest stories helped solidify their hold on the working public condescending stories about poor black men and women ridiculing their subjects illiteracy and their accents were also popular among these papers virtually all white readership.
within six months of its first issue the sun had the largest circulation in new york 8 000 readers more than twice the number of its nearest competitors.
james gordon bennett s new york herold which began publication in 1835 soon surpassed the sun in popularity with its lively combination of sensationalism and local gossip and with its aggressive pursuit of national and international stories.
the herald pioneered a letters to the editor column was the first paper to have regular reviews of books and the arts and launched the first daily sports section.
by 1860 its circulation of more than 77 000 was the largest of any daily newspaper in the world.
the caroline affair the niagara river to them from new york.
british authorities in canada seized the caroline and burned it killing one american in the process.
the british government refused either to disavow the attack or to provide compensation for it and resentment in the united states ran high.
but the british soon had reasons for anger as well.
authorities in new york attempting to exploit the caroline affair arrested a canadian named alexander mcleod and charged him with the murder of the american who had died in the incident.
the british government expressing majestic rage insisted that mcleod could not be accused of murder because he had acted under official orders.
the foreign secretary the bellicose lord palmerston demanded mcleods release and threatened that his execution would bring immediate and frightful war.
webster as secretary of state did not think mcleod was worth a war but he was powerless to release him.
the prisoner was under new york jurisdiction and had to be tried in the state courts a peculiarity of american jurisprudence that the british did not seem to understand.
a new york jury did what webster could not it defused the crisis by acquitting mcleod.
at the same time tensions flared over the boundary between canada and maine which had been in dispute since aroostook the treatv of 1783 ln 1838 roups f war americans and canadians mostly lumber jacks began moving into the aroostook river region in the disputed area precipitating a violent brawl between the two groups that became known as the aroostook war several years later there were yet more anglo american problems.
in 1841 an american ship the creole sailed from virginia for new orleans with more than 100 slaves aboard.
en route the slaves mutinied took possession of the ship and took it to the bahamas.
british officials there declared the slaves free and the english government refused to overrule them.
many americans especially southerners were furious.
at this critical juncture a new government eager to re duce the tensions with the united states came to power in the lexington blows.
this image in the new york sun was one of the first examples of large and in this case at least lurid illustration in the daily press.
this dramatic picture depicts an event that took place on the long island sound in 1840.
the library of congress lc usz62 2527 the newspapers of the penny press initiated the process of turning journalism into a profession.
they were the first to pay their reporters and the first to rely heavily on advertisements often devoting up to half their space to paid advertising.
they tended to be sensationalist and opinionated but they were often also aggressive in uncovering serious and important news in police stations courts jails streets and private homes as well as in city halls state capitals washington d c and the world.
understand.
an at v a amf ev aujanr not all the new penny papers were as sensationalist as the sun and the herald.
both the philadelphia public ledger and the baltimore sun founded in 1836 and 1837 respectively strove to provide serious coverage of the news.
the baltimore sun even developed a washington bureau the first of the penny papers to do so.
the new york tribune founded in 1841 by horace greeley prided itself on serious reporting and commentary all of it tinged with a conspicuous sympathy for socialism and for the aspirations of working people.
as serious as the tribune but more sober and self consciously objective in its reportage was the new york times which henry raymond founded in 1851.
we do not mean to write as if we were in a passion unless that shall really be the case the times huffily proclaimed in its first issue in an obvious reference to greeley and his impassioned reportage and we shall make it a point to get into a passion as rarely as possible 1.
how were the penny press newspapers a product of the jacksonian era.
before the advent of the penny press newspapers in america were aimed at a much narrower audience.
some published mainly business news and others worked to advance the aims of a political party.
what nationally circulated newspapers and other media today continue this tradition.
what characteristics of penny press newspapers are still common in newspapers today.
in what other contemporary news media do you see these same or similar elements.
webster ashburton treaty great britain.
in the spring of 1842 it sent lord ashburton an admirer of america to negotiate an agreement on the maine boundary and other matters.
the result of his negotiations with secretary of state webster and representatives from maine and massachusetts was the webster ashburton treaty of 1842.
its terms established a firm northern boundary between the united states and canada along the maine new brunswick border that survives to this day the new border gave the united states a bit more than half of the previously disputed territory.
other smaller provisions placated maine and massachusetts and protected critical trade routes in both the northern united states and southern canada.
in a separate exchange of notes ashburton eased the memory of the caroline and creole affairs by expressing regret and promising no fu ture officious interference with american ships.
during the tyler administration the united states established its first diplomatic relations with china.
in 1842 treaty of britain forced china to open certain ports wang hya t0 foreign trade.
eager to share the new privileges american mercantile interests persuaded tyler and congress to send a commissioner caleb cushing to china to negotiate a treaty giving the united states some part in the china trade.
in the treaty of wang hya concluded in 1844 cushing secured most fa vored nation provisions giving americans the same privileges as the english.
he also won for americans the right of extraterritoriality the right of americans accused of crimes in china to be tried by american not chinese officials.
in the next ten years american trade with china steadily increased.
in their diplomatic efforts at least the whigs were able to secure some important successes.
but by the end of the tyler administration the party could look back on few other victories.
in the election of 1844 the whigs lost the white house.
they were to win only one more national election in their history.
251 252 chapter 9 looking back the election of andrew jackson to the presidency in 1828 marked not only the triumph of a particular vision of government and democracy.
it represented as well the emergence of a new jackson s political world.
throughout the american legacy nation the laws governing political participa tion were loosening and the number of people permitted to vote which eventually included most white males but almost no one else was increasing.
along with this expansion of the electorate was emerging a new spirit of party politics.
parties had once been reviled by american leaders as contributing to the spirit of faction.
now a new set of ideas was emerging that saw in institutionalized parties not a challenge but a contribution to democracy.
party competition would be a way of containing and muting disagreements that might otherwise run amok.
it would be another of the healthy restraints another part of the system of checks and balances that made american government work.
andrew jackson was a party man and he set out as president to entrench his party the democrats in power.
he was also a fierce defender of his region the west and a sharp critic of what he considered the stranglehold of the aristocratic east on the nations economic life.
he sought to limit the role of the federal government in economic affairs fearful that it would serve to entrench existing patterns of wealth and power.
he worked to destroy the bank of the united states which he considered a corrupt vehicle of aristocratic influence.
jackson was finally a nationalist.
and he confronted the greatest challenge to american unity yet to have emerged in the young nation the nullification crisis of 1832 1833 with a strong assertion of the power and importance of the union.
these positions won jackson broad popularity and ensured his reelection in 1832 and the election of his designated successor martin van buren in 1836.
but the democrats were not the only ones to have learned the lessons of the age of parties.
a new coalition of anti jacksonians who called themselves the whigs launched a powerful new party that used much of the same anti elitist rhetoric the democrats had used to win support for their own much more nationalist program.
their emergence culminated in the campaign of 1840 with the election of the first whig president.

but the overwhelming majority of americans were farmers and tradespeople and the economy was largely a local one.
by the time the civil war began in 1861 the united states had transformed itself.
most americans were still rural people but even most american farmers were now part of a national and increasingly international market economy as well as a growing urbanized nation.
the united states had developed a major manufacturing sector and was beginning to challenge the industrial nations of europe for supremacy.
the nation had experienced the first stage of its industrial revolution.
the dramatic changes that resulted from the industrial revolution affected the nations economy society culture and politics but the changes did not have the same impact everywhere.
the northeast and the northwest were rapidly developing a complex modern economy and society increasingly dominated by large cities important manufacturing and profitable commercial farming.
it was in many ways an unequal society but it was also a fluid one firmly committed to the ideal of free labor.
in the south and southwest there were changes too.
southern agriculture particularly cotton farming flourished as never before in response to the qrowinq demand from textile mills in new regional divergences england and elsewhere.
but the south remained much less economically developed than the north.
as the north became ever more committed to the fluidity and mobility of its free labor system the south was becoming more and more resolute in its defense of slavery.
the economic revolution was transforming the nation.
it was also dividing it.
the changing american population the american industrial revolution was a result of many factors.
before it could occur the united states needed a population large enough both to grow its own food and to provide a surplus workforce for an industrial economy.
it needed a transportation and communications system capable of sustaining commerce over a large geographic area.
it needed the technology to permit manufacturing on a large scale.
and it needed systems of business organization capable of managing large industrial enterprises.
by 1860 the northern regions of the nation had acquired at least the beginnings of all those things.
the american population 1820 1840 three trends characterized the american population between 1820 and 1840 all of them contributing in various ways to economic growth.
the population was increasing rapidly much of it was moving from the countryside into the industrializing cities of the northeast and northwest and much of it was migrating westward.
the american population had stood at only 4 million in 1790.
by 1820 it had reached 10 million by 1830 nearly 13 million and by 1840 17 million.
the united states was growing much more rapidly in population than britain or europe.
one reason for this substantial population growth was improvements in public health.
the number and ferocity of epidemics such as the great cholera plague of 1832 which had periodically decimated urban and even rural populations in america slowly declined as did the nations mortality rate.
the population increase was also a result of a high birth.
on average of 6 14 children each a decline from the very high rate.
in 1840 white women bore an average ui u j reasons for population increase but still substantial enough to produce rapid population increases rates of the eighteenth century particularly srnce a larger proportion of children could expect to grow o adulthood than had been the case a generation or two earlier.
