chapter 10 chapter 10 the ill of rights what freedoms does the bill of rights protect and why are they important.
10 1 introduction to janies madison the creation of the constitution seemed nothing less than a miracle by 1788 however it seemed that it would take another miracle to get it adopted.
the adoption of the constitution depended on ratification or approval by 9 of the 13 states.
ratification started off smoothly with delaware pennsylvania new jersey georgia and connecticut all saying yes.
then came massachusetts where opposition ran strong.
when the massachusetts ratification convention met early in 1788 defeat seemed certain.
opponents objected that the constitution did not list the rights of the people.
many delegates said they would not vote in favor of ratification unless such a list were added.
in desperation the constitutions supporters the federalists looked to john hancock the governor of massachusetts.
hancock had stayed away from the convention pleading a painful attack of gout a form of arthritis in his feet.
in fact he was waiting to make an appearance until he could be sure he would be on the winning side.
the federalists tried to take advantage of hancocks vanity.
virginia they hinted might not ratify the constitution.
if it did not then george washington a virginian could not run for president.
and if washington didnt run who was the best choice for the honor.
why none other than the great governor of massachusetts.
hancock swallowed the bait.
the governor was carried into the convention his feet wrapped in bandages.
in a dramatic speech he urged the delegates to approve the constitution as written.
at the same time he promised that the first task of the new congress would be to amend the constitution by adding a bill of rights.
the vote was close but massachusetts chose to ratify.
the federalists strategy ratify now amend later also worked well in other states.
by the end of 1788 the constitution was the law of the land.
in this chapter you will learn how federalists kept their promise to add a list of rights to the constitution.
you will also learn about the freedoms protected by the bill of rights and why they are important.
this illustration represents the bill of rights atthe time it was approved in 1791.
john hancock helped win approval for the constitution and pushed for the inclusion of the bill of rights.
the bill of rights 183 james madison who is often called the father of the constitution also crafted the bill of rights.
this listing of the first ten amendments to the constitution was ratified in 1791.
bill of rights a formal listing of the basic rights of u s citizens 10 2 creating the bill of rights for all his hopes john hancock never got to be president.
by a narrow vote virginia did ratify the constitution.
in the first presidential election held in 1789 george washington became the nations first president.
john adams of massachusetts became vice president.
when the first congress met that year no one seemed in much of a hurry to amend the constitution.
representative james madison however did not forget the promises made during the ratification debate.
originally he had opposed adding a bill of rights to the constitution.
such a listing seemed unnecessary to him.
thomas jefferson helped change his mind.
in a letter to madison jefferson argued that a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth and what no just government should refuse debate and approval in congress while congress debated other issues madison sifted through nearly 100 proposed amendments.
he chose those that seemed least controversial or least likely to cause conflict and presented them to congress on june 8 1789.
critics jumped on madisons proposals as meaningless milk and water cures for imaginary problems.
the debate that followed was in madisons words extremely difficult as months dragged on with no agreement he wrote to a friend that the task had become a nauseous project still he persevered until congress finally approved 12 amendments.
ratification by the states under the constitution three quarters of the states must ratify an amendment before it can become law.
the states rejected the first two amendments which dealt with the size of congressional districts and congressional pay raises.
both amendments were considered unnecessary.
by 1791 the required number of states nine had approved the other ten amendments.
together these ten amendments form the bill of rights.
when madison first proposed the bill of rights some people saw his amendments as useless paper barriers against abuses of government power.
for more than 200 years however his paper barriers have proven far stronger than even madison might have hoped.
10 3 first amendment rights james madison combined five basic freedoms into the first amendment.
these are the freedoms of religion speech the press and assembly and the right to petition the government.
many people consider these basic freedoms to be the most important part of the bill of rights.
these first amendment rights would have been meaningless owever without some way to protect them.
when a person believes that the government has violated these rights he or she may challenge the governments action in court.
the same is true of all other rights protected in the constitution.
j 84 chapter 10 if the case reaches the supreme court the nine supreme court justices decide how the constitution applies to the situation.
after hearing both sides the justices vote on the case.
one of the justices from the majority side then writes a majority opinion.
this document explains how the court interpreted the constitution to reach its decision.
any justices who disagree with the majority decision may write minority opinions explaining their reasoning.
as you read about first amendment rights you will see how the supreme court has applied these rights to real life situations.
the right to worship freely the first amendment has two guarantees of religious freedom.
the first says congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion this means that congress cannot make any faith the official religion of the united states.
nor can it make laws that favor any religion over another.
as thomas jefferson explained in a letter to a friend the amendment builds a wall of separation between church and state how high should that wall be.
the founders of the american republic disagreed about the answer to this question.
for example lawmakers in virginia proposed using state taxes to help pay for teachers of religion.
george washington was among those who supported this idea as long as no particular church was favored.
opponents of the proposal like madison argued that government and religion should be completely separate.
in a 1971 case known as lemon v kurtzman the supreme court sided with madisons view.
this case challenged a pennsylvania law that used public tax money to pay for books and teachers salaries at private religious schools.
the court held that the law was unconstitutional because it allowed too close a connection between government and religion.
the second religious guarantee in the first amendment says congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion.
this means that people can hold any religious beliefs without fear of punishment.
however they cannot necessarily do whatever they want in the name of religious freedom.
for instance the supreme court has held that parents are not free to deny their children medical treatment or vaccinations because of their religious beliefs.
the beliefs of minority religious groups like the hare krishna pictured here are protected by the bill of rights.
the bill of rights 185 in the 1960s students atthe ur of california berkeley protest imposed by the school adminisi on their freedom of speech.
thi protests became known as the speech movement and spread dents at campuses across the i the right to free speech and press the first amendment protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
the supreme court often treats these rights together as the right of free expression.
freedom of the press is important because of the vital roles that the press plays in a democratic society.
newspapers magazines and other media such as books and television act as watchdogs on the government.
they also allow for the free flow of ideas which citizens need to stay informed and to make up their own minds about important issues.
without a free press democratic self government would be impossible.
americans had learned in colonial days that a free press was their best protection against abuse of government power.
in 1735 john peter zenger was arrested for printing reports that the governor of new york had taken bribes.
the prosecutors said that it was illegal to damage the governors good name even if zenger had published the truth.
zengers lawyer argued that no one should be jailed for exposing and opposing arbitrary power by speaking and writing truth the jury agreed and zenger was freed.
freedom of the press also brings responsibilities such as taking care not to spread false accusations or publish information that would be helpful to an enemy in wartime.
freedom of speech brings respon sibilities as well.
although the first amendment protects the right to speak freely in public places like streets and parks that right is not unlimited.
the supreme court has allowed limits on some kinds of speech such as speech that endangers public safety.
as one justice said the most stringent strongest protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.
the supreme court has held that speech means more than just words.
free expression includes symbolic speech or actions people take to express their opinions.
chapter 10 protection of symbolic speech was an issue in the case of texas v johnson 1989.
this case involved a man who had been convicted in texas of burning an american flag as a form of protest.
when he appealed his case to the supreme court the justices overturned his conviction.
no form of expression can be banned the court held just because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable the right to assemble and petition the final two rights protected in the first amendment are the right to peaceably assemble meet together with others and to petition appeal to the government.
the right to assembly means that citizens can use public property for meetings and demonstrations.
parades protest marches and political rallies are all forms of peaceful assembly protected by the first amendment.
while the first amendment protects peaceful meetings it does not give people the right to close streets or buildings or to protest violently police can arrest a speaker who urges listeners to riot or to break the law.
what if an assembly is peaceful but the people watching it are not.
this question came up in the case of gregory v chicago 1969.
the case began when comedian dick gregory led a protest march to the home of chicagos mayor.
residents in the neighborhood began throwing eggs and shouting insults at the marchers.
fearful of a riot police asked the marchers to leave.
when the marchers refused the police arrested them.
the marchers challenged their arrests in court claiming that their protest was protected under the first amendments right of assembly.
the supreme court agreed that the marchers had assembled peacefully.
if anyone should have been arrested it was the mayor s neighbors.
this earth day demonstration on the mall in washington d c illustrates the right of assembly protected under the first amendment.
i jf v earthdaynefwor.
5 fi qenerufiof.
earth day on the national mall w s j5 w earth pay on the national 10 4 citizen protections the next three amendments protect citizens from various kinds of government abuse.
all three reflect the experience of american colonists under british rule.
second amendment the right to bear arms during colonial times great britain had used a standing or permanent army to keep order in the colonies.
after winning their independence americans were suspicious of standing armies.
they preferred to rely on volunteer state militias to protect the new nation.
the second amendment states that a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed limited the meaning of this amendment has been much debated.
some people argue that it protects the right of people to own guns only if they are part of an organized militia.
an example of such a militia is todays national guard.
others believe that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to own weapons for their own self defense.
in 2008 the supreme court supported this view in the case of district of columbia v heller.
the court held that the second amendment protects an individuals right to own a gun for personal use including self defense inside the home.
third amendment quartering troops in homes before the american revolution great britain had forced colonists to house british soldiers.
the third amendment gave americans the right to refuse such requests.
today soldiers are not quartered in homes.
the third amendment remains important however as a warning to the government to respect the privacy of people s homes.
as supreme court justice joseph story said a man s house shall be his own castle privileged against all civil and military intrusion in colonial america guns were an important part of everyday life.
they were used for hunting and for protection in a time when police were often far away.
militias also protected colonists against outside invasion and indian attacks.
in colonial america guns were an important part of everyday life.
they were used for hunting and for protection in a time when police were often far away.
militias also protected colonists against outside invasion and indian attacks.
the granger collet 188 chapter 10 fourth amendment searches and seizures the fourth amendment protects people and their belongings from unreasonable searches and seizures a seizure is the act of forcibly taking control of a person or property.
before arresting a person or searching someones home police must show a judge that there is good reason for such action.
the judge then issues a warrant that says exactly who will be arrested or what will be searched.
nowhere in the fourth amendment however does it say that a warrant is required for every government search.
many supreme court cases have held that warrants are not always necessary.
but there must be probable cause or a strong reason for the search.
the fourth amendment also does not define unreasonable search the supreme court provided a definition in 1967 when it held that the search must respect an individuals right to privacy police must follow careful guidelines in searches and seizures of private property.
10 5 legal rights and protections the next four amendments lay out the rights and protections that apply to people who are accused of crimes or are involved in other legal disputes.
fifth amendment legal rights the fifth amendment is the longest amendment in the bill of rights.
it lists five important rights of citizens involved with the justice system.
first this amendment gives people who are accused of serious crimes the right to a grand jury hearing.
a grand jury is a group of citizens who hear the governments evidence and decide whether a trial is justified.
if so the grand jury issues an indictment or formal charge.
if not the accused person is released.
second the amendment protects citizens from double jeopardy.
jeopardy means risk.
this protection ensures that a person who is tried for a crime and found not guilty cannot be tried again for that same crime.
third the amendment prohibits self incrimination.
this means that police cannot force people to say things that might be used against them in a trial.
today police are required to remind people of their right to remain silent before they start to question them.
they must also warn people that anything they do say can be used against them at a trial.
this reminder is known as the miranda warning after the case in which the supreme court defined this requirement.
warrant an order from a judge that authorizes police or other officials to take a certain action such as searching someones property double jeopardy putting a person on trial more than once for the same crime self incrimination giving testimony that can be used against oneself the bill of rights 189 due process the concept that the government must follow clear rules and act reasonably as it carries out the law defendant a person who is required to defend himself or herself in a legal action.
an example is an accused person who is put on trial for a crime.
the protection against self incrimination also applies to a defendant testifying in court.
defendants may refuse to answer questions that might damage their case.
this refusal is called taking the fifth.
next the fifth amendment says that a person cannot be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the government must follow clear rules and act reasonably as it carries out the law.
this concept is known as due process.
for example the supreme court has held that every person should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
in addition the government must prove its case against a defendant beyond a reasonable doubt finally the fifth amendment says that the government cannot take someones private property for public use without just compensation just compensation means that the government must pay a fair price when it takes over a persons property for purposes such as building roads or parks.
sixth amendment criminal trial rights the sixth amendment lists a number of rights that are designed to provide accused persons with fair trials.
it begins with the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury the right to a speedy trial means that people cannot be kept in jail for long periods before being judged at a trial.
speedy trials also ensure that witnesses testify while their memories of events are still fresh.
public means that trials may not be held in secret.
citizens have a right to attend trials to make sure that justice is being done.
an accused person also has the right to be judged by a jury of people who live in his or her area.
the jury must be impartial which means that jurors are not prejudiced influenced against the defendant.
courts have also said that prosecutors cannot exclude potential jurors based on their race or gender.
monica goodling was an official in the administration of president george w bush.
in 2007 she took the fifth amendmentto avoid testifying before congress about the dismissal of several u s attorneys until she was granted immunity.
390 chapter 10 mbbli before a trial the prosecutor must tell the accused person not only the charge but also the time and place of the supposed crime.
this information is essential to the accused persons preparation of his or her defense.
a defendant also has the right to hear and question all witnesses who testify at the trial.
in addition the defendant can ask the court to order reluctant unwilling witnesses to testify against their wishes.
lastly a defendant has the right to an attorney to assist in his or her defense.
the supreme court has called this the most important of all the rights of accused persons.
without legal help an innocent person may all too easily be convicted of a crime.
in the past only people with money to hire lawyers enjoyed this important right.
today people accused of crimes are provided with a lawyer if they cannot afford to pay for one.
seventh amendment civil trial rights not all trials involve criminal actions.
some trials decide civil cases or disputes between people or businesses.
civil cases typically involve money property or family matters such as divorce.
the seventh amendment says that in all but the most minor cases people involved in a civil case have a right to a jury trial.
the seventh amendment also says that no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined this means that after a jury decides the facts of a case no judge can overrule the jurys decision.
a lawyer s job is to convince the jury to decide in his or her client s favor during a trial.
the right to a jury trial is one of a number of citizen protections found in the sixth amendment.
eighth amendment bail and punishments the eighth amendment protects an accused persons rights both before and after trial.
before a trial it forbids a judge from demanding excessive bail.
bail is money or property given to the court to hold until an accused person shows up at trial.
if a defendant cannot pay bail he or she stays in jail until trial.
the eighth amendment prevents judges from using unreasonably high bail to keep someone in jail before his or her day in court.
after a trial if the person is found guilty the eighth amendment forbids excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments.
it does not say what such punishments are.
in 1791 physical punishments like whipping and branding were common.
today they are considered cruel.
as supreme court justice thurgood marshall has written a penalty that was permissible at one time in our nation s history is not necessarily permissible today the bill of rights 191 calvin and hobbes ok calmtn let s check oier w mato homework.

this cartoon illustrates how passionate the supreme court has interpreted this amendment to mean that americans are about their rights even punishments must be proportionate to the crime.
judges cannot those that don t exist.
for example impose long prison terms on people convicted of minor crimes.
the court has also held that this amendment prohibits inhumane prison conditions such as depriving prisoners of food.
today americans continue to debate whether the death penalty should be banned under the eighth amendment.
opponents of the death penalty have argued that executing anyone is a cruel and unusual punishment no matter how horrible the crime.
the supreme court has disagreed.
in the 1976 case of gregg v georgia the courts decision stated that the punishment of death for the crime of murder does not under all circumstances violate the eighth amendment.
10 6 other rights and powers the last two amendments were included to help keep a proper balance of rights and power among the federal government the people and the states.
ninth amendment rights retained by the people one argument raised against putting a bill of rights in the constitution was that no such list could be complete.
if some rights were listed and others were not did this mean that people had only the listed rights.
the ninth amendment provides the answer.
it says that even though certain rights are listed in the constitution other rights and liberties not listed there are also retained kept by the people the rights protected under the constitution are not the only rights people have.
an example of this is the right to privacy.
tenth amendment powers reserved to the states the tenth amendment was included to protect the states from excessive ederal power.
it says that powers not given to the national government by the constitution are reserved to the states or to the people j 92 chapter 10 this amendment is known as the reserved powers clause.
reserved powers are those that the constitution does not specifically give to the national government or specifically prohibit the states from having.
so what are reserved powers.
the examples are numerous and they affect many areas of everyday life.
states use their reserved powers to pass laws regulating speed limits for drivers.
reserved powers allow the states to determine how many days students attend public schools.
states have the power to run elections to regulate businesses inside their borders and to set up local governments.
do you get your hair cut in a salon or barber shop.
do you visit the doctor when you are sick.
the tenth amendment gives your state the power to issue business licenses to hair salons and the power to make sure your doctor is licensed to practice medicine in your state.
chapter summary in this chapter you read about the bill of rights the first ten amendments to the constitution and the important freedoms it protects.
creating the bill of rights by 1791 nine of the 13 states had ratified ten amendments drafted by james madison and approved by congress.
these ten amendment form the bill of rights.
first amendment rights the first amendment protects five basic freedoms the right to worship freely freedom of speech freedom of the press and the rights of assembly and petition.
citizen protections the second third and fourth amendments protect people against the abuse of government power.
legal rights and protections the fifth through the eighth amendments are intended to guarantee fair treatment for people involved in legal actions.
other rights and powers the ninth and tenth amendments concern the relationships among the federal government the states and the people.
the ninth amendment protects rights that are not expressly listed in the constitution.
the tenth amendment says that powers that are neither given to the national government nor forbidden to the states belong to the states and the people.
the bill of rights contains many of the rights that we think of as american freedoms.
the bill of rights 193 reading further marian ward right was a senior in high school when she legally challenged a federal court s ruling against public prayer at her school.
what is religious freedom.
freedom of religion is the first right listed in the bill of rights.
the founders of our nation took this freedom very seriously.
yet despite its prominent place in the first amendment religious freedom is a hotly debated issue.
the struggle to define and protect this right continues even today.
september 3 1999 was a big day in santa fe texas a small town just south of houston.
it was the first day of the high school football season.
but there was more happening that day than just a football game.
marian ward a student at the school was going to read a prayer over the loudspeaker before the game.
this was a common custom in towns across texas.
but a u s district court had recently said that public prayer on school grounds violated religious freedom under the first amendment.
this decision angered many people in santa fe who believed they had a right to hear prayers at football games.
marian the daughter of a baptist minister defied the court that night and delivered her prayer anyway.
god thank you for this evening she began.
thank you for all the prayers that were lifted up this week for me.
i pray that youll bless each and every person here tonight when she was done the crowd erupted in applause.
not everyone applauded though.
amanda bruce another student objected that the prayer could be offensive to every other faith that does not pray to jesus or god.
people need to think about the person sitting next to them who may not be a christian amanda who is catholic helped to organize a protest before the homecoming game a month later.
she and other students carried signs that read prayer is private the football game prayers continued through that season though.
the following year the supreme court declared the practice unconstitutional throughout the nation.
the dispute over public prayer at football games highlights a deeper question what is religious freedom.
in theory it is the right to worship as one pleases or not to worship at all without interference from others.
but it is not quite that simple.
in fact religious freedom means different things to different people.
most americans believe strongly in the principle of religious freedom.
but they dont always agree on how this right should be defined and protected.
religious liberty in the colonies the issue of religious freedom has been debated since the earliest days of the american colonies.
many colonists came to america seeking religious freedom.
but that does not mean they extended that liberty to people who held different beliefs.
for the most part their attitude seemed to be religious freedom for me but not for you most colonies chapter 10 set up a government sponsored church and insisted that people attend services.
people who practiced a different faith could be punished.
they might be fined jailed or even whipped.
gradually however things began to change.
as more colonists arrived the variety of religious faiths increased.
this made it more difficult to impose any one faith on a colony.
another factor was the growing influence of enlightenment beliefs.
leading thinkers such as thomas jefferson and james madison believed that people had a natural right to equality.
this meant that no religion or church should be favored over any other.
to do so they argued would deny equal rights to all.
jefferson s law in jeffersons view in fact government should not support or oppose any church or religion.
all religious matters should be left to the individual.
in other words there should be a clear separation between church and state.
in 1776 jefferson began to promote religious reform in the virginia assembly.
three years later as governor he proposed a bill to make religious freedom the law in virginia.
jeffersons bill aroused great opposition.
some members of the assembly thought it was too radical.
they wanted the state to support the christian religion.
while jefferson was away in france madison fought for the bills passage.
finally in 1786 it became law.
jeffersons law the virginia statute for religious freedom said that no one could be forced to attend or support any religious worship place or ministry it also said that no one should be made to suffer for his religious opinions or belief all people it said should be free to express their opinions in matters of religion jefferson considered this law one the most important achievements of his life.
it laid the foundation for religious freedom in the first amendment.
americans have disputed the meaning of religious freedom since colonial times.
these football players pray before a game in odessa texas even though a supreme court decision bans public prayer at school events.
the bill of rights 195 i i from the 1940s on the supreme court has issued decisions on arguments about religious freedom.
even on the court the nine justices disagree on interpretation of the first amendment.
the religion clause of the first amendment like jefferson james madison was committed to religious liberty.
in his proposal for the bill of rights he made sure it contained a clause on religious freedom.
in fact that clause is the first right listed in the first amendment.
during the months that congress debated the bill of rights the religion clause was revised several times.
finally congress approved the final version which reads congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof this sentence may have seemed clear at the time.
but it has led to some confusion over the years.
first it mentions congress but says nothing about the states.
madison tried to include words that would prevent states from limiting religious freedom but the senate blocked his efforts.
a second source of confusion is the phrase an establishment of religion to some people this simply means that the government cannot create an official religion or support a particular church.
others argue that the phrase means more than that.
they say it forbids all government involvement in religion.
to support this view they cite a letter jefferson wrote in 1802.
in it he said that the first amendment builds a wall of separation between church and state the issue moves to the courts for 150 years after the bill of rights was written there was little debate over religious freedom.
the courts and most americans seemed to agree on what it meant.
in the 1940s however that sense of agreement came to an end.
the supreme court began to hear cases that involved possible violations of religious freedom at the state level.
the court based its actions on the fourteenth amendment which was ratified in 1868.
this amendment guarantees equal protection of the laws to all citizens wherever they live.
this means that first amendment rights including religious freedom apply to the states.
one of the courts first important cases was everson v board of education of the township of ewing 1947.
this case involved the use of tax money in new jersey to fund bus transport for students at catholic schools.
a man named arch everson claimed that this use of public money represented government support for religion.
in its decision the court agreed that the first amendment does not allow public funds to be used for religious activities including religious education.
it said that government must remain neutral in religious matters.
it cannot promote or oppose any church or religion.
in this case however the court did not agree that the use of tax money violated the first amendment.
it said that providing basic services such as bus transport does not qualify as support for religion.
it said that students have a right to basic services no matter where they went to school.
the courts decision affirmed the separation of church and state.
but it also showed that the details of a case matter.
the issue is not always clear cut.
since that time the court has heard many cases involving religious freedom.
school prayer has been a key issue.
in engel v vitale 1962 the court struck down the use of an official prayer in new york public schools.
in lee v weisman the court banned school sponsored prayer at graduation ceremonies.
and in santa fe independent school district v doe 2000 the football prayer case the court said that schools cannot sponsor a prayer before football games.
these decisions sparked angry protests.
some people claimed that religion belongs in public schools.
they said the court was violating their religious freedom by prohibiting prayer and other religious activities in schools.
some justices on the court disagreed with the majority decisions.
they argued that the court was opposing religion.
for most justices however the decisions reflected a neutral position neither for nor against religion.
clearly the issue of religious freedom arouses strong feelings.
what seems like a right to some people may not seem like a right to others.
these disputes are not resolved easily.
in fact they may never be settled completely.
the effort to ensure religious freedom for all remains an ongoing challenge.
in mississippi opponents of school prayer made the statement that separation of church and state was pro constitution not anti religion.

chapter 11 political developments in the early republic how did the federalist and republican visions for the united states differ.
11 1 introduction the illustration to the left shows four leaders in the first government formed under the constitution.
on the far right stands former continental army general george washington who had been lured out of retirement to serve as the nations first president.
seldom has a leader seemed more reluctant to take power.
my movements to the chair of government he wrote on leaving home will be accompanied by feelings not unlike those of a culprit criminal who is going to the place of his execution henry knox sits opposite washington.
during the american revolution this boston bookseller became a general and washingtons close friend and adviser.
when washington became president in 1789 he made knox his secretary of war.
take a close look at the other two men portrayed here.
alexander hamilton who stands beside the president served as washingtons secretary of the treasury.
thomas jefferson who stands behind knox served as secretary of state.
it was his job to manage relations between the united states and other countries.
washington chose hamilton and jefferson for these positions because of all they had in common.
both were strong patriots.
both had served their country during the war hamilton in the continental army and jefferson in the continental congress.
both had brilliant minds.
but for all they had in common the two men were opposites in many ways.
hamilton dressed with great care.
jefferson was sloppy with clothes.
hamilton moved with precision.
jefferson slouched.
hamilton was a doer who moved briskly from task to task.
jefferson was a thinker who took time to explore ideas.
as you will discover hamilton and jefferson soon became political rivals.
their rivalry eventually gave rise to the nation s first political parties which had different visions for the new nation.
thomas jefferson above and alexander hamilton below led the first political parties of the new nation.
george washington atthe far right meets with his close advisers.
political developments in the early republic 205.
11 2 launching the new government on april 30 1789 george washington took the oath of office as the first president of the united states.
after his inauguration washington addressed both houses of congress.
he asked congress to work with him to put into place the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend at times his hands shook so much that he had trouble reading his speech.
i martha washington on the left held tea parties on friday evenings atthe presidential mansion in new york city.
atthese parties people could discuss important issues with president washington shown nearthe center.
the debate over washington s title washington had reason to be nervous.
the first congress was deeply divided.
some members were eager to build a strong national government.
others were just as eager to limit the power of the new government.
these differences showed up immediately in a debate over what title to use when addressing the president.
vice president john adams pointed out that european heads of government had titles like your excellency that showed respect for their office.
the president he argued should have a similar title.
supporters of a strong national government agreed.
others argued that such titles smelled of royalty and had no place in a democracy.
a few members of congress joked that the rather plump adams should be given the title his rotundity his roundness.
the debate finally ended when washington let it be known that he preferred the simple title mr.
president setting up the executive branch next congress turned to the task of creating executive departments.
as washington had feared arguments broke out at once over what those departments should be and what powers they should have.
congress eventually approved three departments.
the department of state was set up to handle relations with other countries.
the department of war was established to defend the nation.
the treasury department was set up to oversee the nations finances.
congress also created an attorney general to serve as the presidents legal adviser and a postmaster general to head the postal system.
washington chose men he trusted such as thomas jefferson alexander hamilton and henry knox to fill these positions.
he often met with them to ask for their ideas and advice.
the heads of the executive departments came to be known as the presidents cabinet.
chapter 11 11 3 washington as president the most critical problem facing the new government was a lack of funds.
the national treasury was empty.
congress had the power to raise funds through taxes.
but its members argued endlessly about what to tax and by how much.
in 1791 congress finally agreed to place an excise tax on whiskey and other luxury goods such as carriages.
an excise tax is a tax on the production or sale of a product.
the whiskey rebellion settlers living west of the appalachian mountains reacted angrily to the tax.
western farmers found it too costly to transport their grain across the mountains to sell in eastern cities.
instead they distilled their bulky wheat into whiskey which could be shipped more cheaply.
many farmers complained that the tax made their whiskey too expensive and they refused to pay it.
to end these protests congress lowered the excise tax in 1793.
most farmers began to pay up but not the tax rebels of western pennsylvania.
in 1794 these whiskey boys tarred and feathered tax collectors who tried to enforce the law.
alexander hamilton and george washington saw the whiskey rebellion as a threat to the authority of the national government.
at hamiltons urging washington led 13 000 state militia troops across the mountains to crush the rebels.
faced with overwhelming force the rebellion ended.
thomas jefferson thought that the idea of sending an army to catch a few tax rebels was foolish.
even worse he believed was that hamilton was prepared to violate peoples liberties by using armed force to put down opposition to government policies.
the granger collection newyork whiskey rebellion a revolt by farmers in 1794 against an excise tax on whiskey the whiskey rebellion challenged the new nation s ability to enforce its laws.
when several hundred farmers refused to pay a federal whiskey tax president washington personally led 13 000 state militia troops to put down the rebellion.
the french revolution meanwhile the nation was caught up in a debate over events in france.
in 1789 the french people rebelled against their king.
the leaders of the french revolution dreamed of building a nation based on liberty equality and fraternity brotherhood three years later france became a republic and declared a war of all peoples against all kings many americans were thrilled by the french revolution.
this was especially true of jefferson and his followers who began calling themselves democratic republicans or simply republicans.
the republicans saw the french revolution as part of a great crusade for democracy.
political developments in the early republic 207 the granger collection newyork in time news from france caused supporters of the revolution to change their opinion.
cheered on by angry mobs frances revolutionary government began beheading wealthy nobles.
some 20 000 men women and children were killed.
hamilton and his followers who called themselves federalists were appalled by the bloodshed.
many federalists were themselves wealthy.
after hearing about the fate of wealthy families in france they began to fear for their own safety wondering whether such terrors could happen in the united states.
behold france warned one federalist an open hell in which we see perhaps our own future washington s farewell address the growing division between republicans and federalists so disturbed washington that he agreed to run for a second term as president in 1792.
he was the only person hamilton and jefferson told him who could keep the nation together.
near the end of his second term washington announced that he would not run again.
before leaving office the president prepared a message that became known as washington s farewell address.
in it he reminded americans of all that bound them together as a people.
with slight shades of difference he said you have the same religion manners habits and political principles.
you have in a common cause fought and triumphed together next washington warned of two threats to the nations future.
one of those threats was problems the nation was having with other countries.
the other threat was the spirit of party it was natural for people to hold different opinions washington said.
but he warned against the dangers of passionate loyalty to parties.
if fighting between parties was not controlled it could tear the young nation apart.
despite his worries for the future washington had much to be proud of as he left office.
the new government was up and running.
the nation was growing so fast that it had added three new states kentucky tennessee and vermont.
most of all washington had steered his government safely through quarrelsome times.
he left the nation united and at peace.
when the french revolution turned violent and thousands of nobles were beheaded on the guillotine many americans withdrew their support for the revolution.
washington s farewell address george washingtons parting message to the nation given in 1796 in which he warned of threats to the nations future 108 chapter 11 11 4 alexander hamilton and the federalist party george washingtons warnings did not stop the rise of political parties in the young nation.
the federalist party appeared first during the debates over the ratification of the constitution.
its most influential leader was washingtons energetic treasury secretary alexander hamilton.
personal background hamilton was born in the west indies and raised on the caribbean island of st croix.
when hamilton was 13 a devastating hurricane struck the island.
hamilton wrote a vivid description of the storm that impressed all who read it.
a few st croix leaders arranged to send the talented teenager to new york where he could get the education he deserved.
once in america hamilton never looked back.
hamiltons blue eyes were said to turn black when he was angry.
but most of the time they sparkled with intelligence and energy.
with no money or family connections to help him rise in the world he made his way on ability ambition and charm.
george washington spotted hamiltons talents early in the american revolution.
washington made the young man his aide de camp or personal assistant.
near the end of the war hamilton improved his fortunes by marrying elizabeth schuyler who came from one of new yorks richest and most powerful families.
with her familys political backing hamilton was elected to represent new york in congress after the war.
later he served as a delegate from new york to the constitutional convention.
view of human nature hamiltons view of human nature was shaped by his wartime experiences.
all too often he had seen people put their own interests and desire for personal profit above the cause of patriotism and the needs of the country.
every man ought to be supposed a knave scoundrel he concluded and to have no other end goal in all his actions but private interest most federalists shared hamiltons view that people were basically selfish and out for themselves.
for this reason they distrusted any system of government that gave too much power to the mob or the common people.
such a system said hamilton could only lead to error confusion and instability.
american artist john trumbull painted this portrait of alexander hamilton.
hamilton rose from poverty to lead the federalist party.
his brilliant career was cut short when he was killed in a duel with vice president aaron burr whom he had accused of being a traitor.
political developments in the early republic 209 views on government federalists believed that the best people educated wealthy public spirited men like themselves should run the country.
such people they believed had the time education and background to run the country wisely.
they could also be trusted to make decisions for the general good not just for themselves.
those who own the country said federalist john jay bluntly ought to govern it federalists favored a strong national government.
they hoped to use the new governments powers under the constitution to unite the quarreling states and keep order among the people.
in their view the rights of states were not nearly as important as national power and unity.
hamilton agreed.
having grown up in the caribbean hamilton had no deep loyalty to any state.
his country was not new york but the united states of america.
he hoped to see his adopted country become a great and powerful nation.
alexander hamilton believed thatto become strong the united states need ed to develop businesses such as this foundry in connecticut.
a foundry is a factory for melting and shaping metal.
views on the economy hamiltons dream of national greatness depended on the united states developing a strong economy.
in 1790 the nations economy was still based mainly on agriculture.
hamilton wanted to expand the economy and increase the nations wealth by using the power of the federal government to promote business manufacturing and trade.
before this could happen the new nation needed to begin paying off the huge debts that congress and the states had accumulated during the american revolution.
in 1790 hamilton presented congress with a plan to pay off all war debts as quickly as possible.
if the debts were not promptly paid he warned the government would lose respect both at home and abroad.
hamiltons plan for repaying the debts was opposed by many americans especially in the south.
most southern states had already paid their war debts.
they saw little reason to help states in the north pay off what they still owed.
to save his plan hamilton linked it to another issue the location of the nations permanent capital.
both northerners and southerners wanted the capital to be located in their section of the country.
hamilton promised to support a location in the south if southerners would support his debt plan.
the debt plan was passed and the nations new capital called the district of columbia was located in the south on the potomac river between maryland and virginia.
210 chapter 11 hamilton asked congress to establish the first national bank.
the bank collected taxes printed money and made loans to businesses.
next hamilton asked congress to establish a national bank.
such a bank hamilton said would help the government by collecting taxes and keeping those funds safe.
it would print paper money backed by the government giving the nation a stable currency.
most important the bank would make loans to businesspeople to build new factories and ships.
as business and trade expanded hamilton argued all americans would be better off.
once again hamiltons proposal ran into heavy opposition.
where in the constitution his opponents asked was congress given the power to establish a bank.
in their view congress could exercise only those powers specifically listed in the constitution.
hamilton in contrast supported a loose construction or broad interpretation of the constitution.
he pointed out that the elastic clause allowed congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying out its listed powers.
since collecting taxes was one of those powers congress could set up a bank to help the government with tax collection.
after much debate hamilton was able get his bank approved by congress.
once established in 1791 the bank of the united states helped the nations economy grow and prosper.
views on great britain and france when the french revolution began hamilton hoped that it would lead to the establishment of free and good government but as he watched it lead instead to chaos and bloodshed his enthusiasm for the revolution cooled.
when war broke out between france and england in 1793 most federalists sided with great britain.
some were merchants and shippers whose business depended on trade with america s former enemy.
others simply felt more comfortable supporting orderly great britain against revolutionary france.
hamilton favored great britain for yet another reason.
great britain was all that he hoped the united states would become one day a powerful and respected nation that could defend itself against any enemy.
loose construction abroad interpretation of the constitution meaning that congress has powers beyond those specifically given in the constitution political developments in the early republic 211 thomas jefferson was one of america s greatest patriots.
his strongest support came from the middle class farmers laborers artisans and shopkeepers.
the granger collection newyork 2 chapter 11 11 5 thomas jefferson and the republican party alexander hamiltons success in getting his plans through congress alarmed thomas jefferson and his fellow republicans.
in jeffersons view almost everything hamilton did in the name of putting the united states on the path to greatness was instead a step down the road to ruin.
the two men held very different views on almost everything.
personal background jefferson was born in virginia to an old and respected family.
one of ten children he was gifted with many talents.
as a boy he learned to ride hunt sing dance and play the violin.
later he carried a violin with him in all his travels.
jefferson was also a gifted student.
when he entered college at age 16 he already knew greek and latin.
he seemed to know something about almost everything.
he once wrote that not a sprig of grass is uninteresting to me this curiosity would remain with him all his life.
with land inherited from his father jefferson set himself up as a virginia tobacco planter.
like other planters he used slaves to work his land.
once he was established as a planter jefferson entered virginia politics.
asa politician he lacked the ability to make stirring speeches.
instead jefferson wrote eloquently with a pen.
his words in the declaration of independence and other writings are still read and admired today.
view of human nature jeffersons view of human nature was much more hopeful than hamiltons.
he assumed that informed citizens could make good decisions for themselves and their country.
i have so much confidence in the good sense of man jefferson wrote when revolution broke out in france that i am never afraid of the issue outcome where reason is left free to exert her force jefferson had great faith in the goodness and wisdom of people who worked the soil farmers and planters like hint self.
state a problem to a ploughman farmer and a professor he said and the former will decide it often better than the latter views on government republicans favored democracy over any other form of government.
they had no patience with the federalists view that only the best people should rule.
to republicans this view came dangerously close to monarchy or rule by a king.
republicans believed that the best government was the one that governed the least.
a small government with limited powers was most likely to leave the people alone to enjoy the blessings of liberty.
to keep the national government small they insisted on a strict construction or interpretation of the constitution.
the constitution they insisted meant exactly what it said no more and no less.
any addition to the powers listed in the document such as the creation of a national bank was unconstitutional and dangerous.
along with advocating for a weak national government republicans favored strong state governments.
state governments they argued were closer to the people and the people could control them more easily strong state governments could also keep the national government from growing too powerful.
views on the economy like most americans in the 1790s jefferson was a country man.
he believed that the nation s future lay not with federalist bankers and merchants in big cities but with plain republican farmers.
those who labor in the earth he wrote are the chosen people of god if ever he had a chosen people.
republicans favored an economy based on agriculture.
they opposed any measures such as the national bank designed to encourage the growth of business and manufacturing.
in their view the national bank was not only unconstitutional but against farmers.
while the bank was happy to loan money to businesspeople to build factories and ships it did not make loans to farmers to buy land.
agriculture according to thomas jefferson was the most important part of the economy.
he believed farming was the best occupation because it kept people out of corrupt cities.
strict construction a narrow interpretation of the constitution meaning that congress has only those powers specifically given in the constitution political developments in the early republic 213 views on great britain and france another topic over which republicans and federalists had heated arguments was the french revolution.
most americans favored the revolution until it turned violent and led to war.
as you have read most federalists then turned against the new french republic and sided with great britain.
for this change of heart a republican newspaper called the federalists british bootlickers implying that they were weak and eager to please the british.
despite the violence of the revolution most republicans continued to support france.
while regretting the bloodshed they argued that the loss of a few thousand aristocrats was a small price to pay for freedom.
for their loyalty to france republicans were scorned in a federalist newspaper as man eating blood drinking cannibals in 1793 the french government sent edmond genet zhuh nay to the united states as its new official representative.
genet preferred to be called citizen genet french revolutionaries adopted this title to emphasize the equality of all people.
his mission was to convince americans that they should join france in its war against great britain.
republicans welcomed citizen genet as a conquering hero.
large crowds cheered him as he traveled about the country.
in philadelphia the nations temporary capital a great banquet was held in his honor.
when genet formally presented himself to president george washington he expected another warm and enthusiastic reception.
washington however did not want to be drawn into war with great britain.
his response to genet was cool and dignified.
genet began making speeches against the president.
these attacks on washington brought thousands of genets supporters into philadelphias streets.
day after day recalled vice president john adams the protesters threatened to drag washington out of his house and compel the government to declare war in favor of the french revolution.
this was too much even for jefferson.
calling genet hotheaded.
disrespectful and even indecent toward the president secretary of state jefferson asked the french government to recall its troublesome representative.
edmond genet the french representative to the united states attempted to convince americans to join the french in their war with britain.
after genet insulted president washington he was ordered to leave the country.
here secretary of state jefferson presents genet to the president in 1793.
chapter 11 116 the presidency of john adams when the framers of the constitution created the electoral college they imagined that the electors would simply choose the two best leaders for president and vice president.
that was how the nations first two presidential elections worked.
by the third election in 1796 however it was clear that political parties had become part of the election process.
the republicans supported thomas jefferson for president that year.
his support came mainly from farmers in the south and west.
the federalists supported john adams who appealed to lawyers merchants ship owners and businesspeople in the north.
when the electoral votes were counted john adams was elected president by just three votes.
jefferson came in second making him vice president.
the nations new top two leaders were political leaders from opposing parties.
sedition the crime of encouraging rebellion against the government the alien and sedition acts at first president adams tried to work closely with jefferson.
party violence adams found made such efforts useless meanwhile federalists in congress passed four controversial laws known as the alien and sedition acts.
they argued that these laws were needed as protection against foreigners who might threaten the nation.
in fact the real purpose of the alien and sedition acts was to make life difficult for the federalists rivals the republicans.
three of the laws the alien acts were aimed at aliens or noncitizens.
the first law lengthened the time it took for an immigrant to become a citizen with the right to vote from 5 to 14 years.
since most immigrants voted republican jefferson saw this law as an attack on his party.
the other two alien acts allowed the president to either jail or deport aliens who were suspected of activities that threatened the government.
although these laws were never enforced they did frighten a number of french spies and troublemakers who then left the country.
the fourth law known as the sedition act made sedition encouraging rebellion against the government a crime.
its definition of sedition included printing uttering or publishing any false scandalous and malicious hateful writing against the government congress or the president.
alexander hamilton approved of this law believing that it would punish only those who published lies intended to destroy the government.
instead the sedition act was used to punish republican newspaper editors who insulted president adams in print.
one for example called him old querulous whiny bald blind crippled toothless adams twenty five people were arrested under the new law.
ten of them were convicted of printing seditious opinions.
john adams a federalist was elected the second president of the united states by only 3 votes in the electoral college.
thomas jefferson a democratic republican who had 68 votes to adams s 71 became vice president.
political developments in the early republic 215 nullify to refuse to recognize a federal law.
this action by a state is called nullification.
states rights theory the theory that rights not specifically given to the federal government by the constitution remain with the states the virginia and kentucky resolutions republicans viewed the sedition act as an attack on the rights of free speech and free press.
since the federal government was enforcing the act republicans looked to the states to protect these freedoms.
thomas jefferson and james madison drew up a set of resolutions or statements opposing the alien and sedition acts and sent them to state legislatures for approval.
they argued that congress had gone beyond the constitution in passing these acts.
states therefore had a duty to nullify the laws that is to declare them to be without legal force.
only two states virginia and kentucky adopted the resolutions.
the arguments put forward in the virginia and kentucky resolutions were based on the states rights theory of the constitution.
this theory holds that rights not specifically given to the federal government remain with the states.
of these one of the most important is the right to judge whether the federal government is using its powers properly.
when no other states approved the virginia and kentucky resolutions the protest died.
the states rights theory however was not forgotten.
it would be raised and tested again in the years ahead.
the imew national capital in 1800 the federal government moved to the city of washington in the district of columbia.
most of the governments buildings were still under construction.
president adamss wife abigail described the new presidents house as a castle in which not one room or chamber is finished she used the large east room for hanging laundry as it was not fit for anything else.
in this political cartoon a devil and a lion symbolizing great britain encourage a federalist editor represented by a hedgehog to cross out important phrases from america s great documents.
liberty weeps at benjamin franklin s tomb.
chapter 11 11 7 the election of 1800 the move to washington d c came in the middle of the 1800 presidential election.
once again republican leaders supported thomas jefferson for president.
hoping to avoid the strange outcome of the last election they chose a new york politician named aaron burr to run as his vice president.
the federalists chose john adams to run for reelection as president.
charles pinckney of south carolina was selected to run for vice president.
some federalists would have preferred alexander hamilton as their presidential can didate.
but the caribbean born hamilton was not eligible to run as the constitution requires the president to be a u s born citizen.
the campaign the candidates outlined their campaign issues early.
jefferson supported the constitution and states rights.
he promised to run a frugal and simple government.
adams ran on his record of peace and prosperity.
the campaign however centered more on insults than on issues.
republican newspapers attacked adams as a tyrant.
they even accused him of wanting to turn the nation into a monarchy so that his children could follow him on the presidential throne.
some federalist newspapers called jefferson an atheist.
an atheist is someone who denies the existence of god.
jefferson these newspapers charged would destroy religion introduce immorality and loosen all the bonds of society frightened by these charges some elderly federalists buried their bibles to keep them safe from the godless republicans.
this republican presidential campaign banner is from 1800.
the banner reads t jefferson president of the united states of america.
john adams no more.
the divided federalists hamilton and his followers refused to support adams because of disagreements over the presidents foreign policy we shall never find ourselves in the straight road of federalism while mr adams is president stated oliver wolcott one of hamiltons close allies.
as the campaign heated up hamilton worked feverishly behind the scenes to convince the men chosen for the electoral college to cast their presidential ballots for pinckney over adams.
pinckney seemed more likely than adams to value hamilton s advice and his firm federalist principles.
with pinckney as president hamilton believed that he would be able to personally guide the united states into the new century.
political developments in the early republic 217 1 2 here republican women help thomas jefferson win the election in new jersey in 1800.
women were allowed to vote in new jersey until 1808.
11 8 a deadlock and a new amendment when the electoral college voted early in 1801 it was clear that john adams had lost the election.
but to whom.
under the constitution each elector cast two votes with the idea that the candidate finishing second would be vice president.
all of the republican electors voted for thomas jefferson and aaron burr.
the result was a tie between them.
breaking the tie in the case of a tie the constitution sends the election to the house of representatives.
there each state has one vote.
burr could have told his supporters in the house to elect jefferson president as his party wanted.
instead he remained silent hoping in the presidential election of 1800 thomas jefferson and aaron burr received the same number of electoral votes.
after almost a week of deadlock in the house of representatives jefferson was elected president.
the twelfth amendment was ratified in 1804 to prevent such ties in the future.
the election of 1800 presidential candidate party state electoral votes thomas jefferson republican virginia 73 aaron burr republican newyork 73 john adams federalist massachusetts 65 charles pinckney federalist south carolina 64 john jay federalist new york 1 18 chapter 11 the election might go his way.
when the house voted the result was another tie.
after 6 days and 35 ballots it was federalist alexander hamilton who broke the deadlock.
he asked his supporters in the house to vote for jefferson.
of the two republicans he said jefferson is to be preferred.
he is by far not so dangerous a man the tie was broken and jefferson was elected president.
in 1804 the twelfth amendment was added to the constitution to prevent such ties.
the amendment calls for the electoral college to cast separate ballots for president and vice president.
if no presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes the house of representatives chooses a president from the top three candidates.
if no candidate for vice president receives a majority the senate chooses the vice president.
a peaceful revolution the election of 1800 was a victory for jefferson and his republican party.
but it was also a victory for the new system of government established by the constitution.
in other countries power changed hands by means of war or revolution.
in the united states power had passed from one group to another without a single shot being fired.
chapter summary in this chapter you read about the beginnings of political parties in the united states.

in 1794 he ended the whiskey rebellion a farmers protest against taxes.

political developments in the early republic 219 reading further j when john and abigail adams arrived washington was more an idea than a city.
after the site was selected the district of columbia had to be built.
this view is of the district of columbia in 1801.
the president s house what kind of home should the president of a brand new country live in.
the early leaders had to decide this question.
congress gave george washington the freedom to make this decision and his ideas led to the building we know today as the white house.
but it would be the second president john adams who first lived in the house.
john adams reached washington on saturday afternoon november 1 1800.
because travel at that time was difficult no one had known ahead of time exactly when the president would arrive.
as it turned out he was earlier than expected.
the only people there to greet him were a few workers and two commissioners who were overseeing work on the nations capital.
a welcoming committee was not the only thing missing when the president arrived.
the building that the president would call home was little more than a shell on that november day.
when adams moved in j only 6 of the 36 rooms in the presidents house were fit to live in.
only j 18 rooms had finished plaster walls.
fires burned in 13 fireplaces every day to keep the house warm and dry enough to live in.
the fires also helped dry the plaster in the rooms that had it.
from the unfinished house president adams wrote to his wife abigail who was still at their home in massachusetts.
he told her that the building is in a state to be habitable.
and now we wish for your company abigail arrived two weeks later.
the first lady was not happy about the condition of her new home.
shiver shiver she wrote to her daughter.
surrounded with forests j can you believe that wood for fires is not to be had because people.

servants had to haul it nearly half a mile to the presidents house.
but abigail made the best of it.
she and john improvised.
abigail used what was to become the formal east room for hanging laundry.
the adamses even managed to entertain guests in their unfinished home.
the adamses knew that the building would be beautiful one day.
they also hoped that it would last for a very long time like the nation whose leaders it would house.
a palace for the president george washington had turned down the chance to be king of the united states.
but washington a federalist believed in a strong central government with the president playing a central role.
he wanted the leader of the new republic to live in a house that reflected the presidents importance.
chapter 11 those who disagreed with the federalist idea of a strong executive wanted a more modest home for the president.
secretary of state thomas jefferson a republican favored a small central government.
he wanted the presidents house to reflect that belief.
so he proposed a plain house built of brick.
to him a big house built of stone like those of european leaders suggested royalty and he wanted no part of that.
in 1792 jefferson announced that he would hold a contest to choose an architect to design the presidents house.
his advertisement for the contest required applicants to include an estimate of the cubic feet of brickwork composing the whole mass of the wall but george washington had other ideas.
he wanted a presidential palace that was large and made of stone.
he saw pictures of buildings designed by james hoban an architect who had trained in ireland.
he liked the buildings and he wanted hoban to design the presidents house.
hoban entered the contest and not surprisingly won.
hobans design was for a grand house.
it was to have three stories and to be built of stone.
but a lack of money limited his elaborate plans.
the presidential home would still look like a palace but it would be only two stories tall with only the first story made of solid stone.
the second story would be made of brick and covered with a layer of stone.
in the end then the presidents house was something of a compromise.
the fact that the new nation had limited time and money meant that jeffersons republican ideals were present though washingtons influence is reflected even more.
these plans from 1793 top show the final design for the president s house.
in 1800 when john adams moved in the building was unfinished.
he and his wife abigail lived there for the last four months of his term before thomas jefferson moved in in march 1801.
in 1792 james hoban submitted a plan bottom for the second floor of the white house.
it looks very close to this today.
building the president s house george washington laid the cornerstone for the presidents house on october 13 1792.
the outside structure looked finished by 1800 but it took another two years to complete the basic structure inside.
in part that is because builders stopped working on the house in 1799.
they reasoned that it would be easy for one man to find a place to sleep even if that man was the president.
finding a place for the legislature to meet on the other hand would be difficult.
so they shifted their energy to building the capitol.

tsiio si iliibij.
u f records show that slaves worked as carpenters on the president s house in may 1795.
the men tom peter ben harry and daniel belonged to architect james hoban.
many people were involved in building the presidents house.
some were immigrants.
scottish masons built the stone walls and covered the second story brick with stone.
the commissioners who oversaw the process had hoped to bring in other immigrant workers.
but they had very little success so they turned to local laborers.
many of those laborers were african americans.
some were free but many jjj were slaves.
the government leased the slaves from their masters.
slaves dug the stone from the quarries in virginia.
they also made bricks which they used to build the huts they lived in at the work site.
in addition much of the lumber for the building came from a slave managed mill.
the regal looking sandstone that george washington wanted created a problem for the stone masons.
sandstone is porous absorbent so the masons made a whitewash to keep moisture out.
they applied the whitewash like paint over the brick but it sealed like glue.
that is why the presidents house is white although it was not until 1901 that president theodore roosevelt officially called the building the white house.

in the painting president george washington confers with architect james hoban.
chapter 11 continuity and change the white house today looks enough like the white house of the past that a viewer can tell it is the same building.
but it has gone through many changes over the years.
wear and tear took their toll on the building even in the early years.
by 1803 so much water had leaked through the roof that the ceiling of the east room collapsed.
many of the changes to the white house have simply kept the building up to date outfitting it with modern conveniences.
pipes installed in 1833 brought running water into the house.
heated water piped to the second floor allowed the first family to take hot showers.
starting in 1837 a central furnace took off the chill.
gas lights were installed in 1848 and electric lights in 1891.
several major renovations have also ensured that the presidents house has remained the building for the ages that abigail adams envisioned.
in 1814 british forces burned the presidents house and only the external structure survived.
the entire interior was rebuilt.
during theodore roosevelts administration a 1902 renovation added the west wing for the president and his staff.
in doing so it doubled the size of the familys living space.
but the 1902 renovation plus the addition of the third story in the 1920s put a huge strain on the structure.
a 1948 engineers report concluded that the white house was standing up purely from habit a 1952 renovation gutted the building strengthened the structure and rebuilt it.
since 1952 no major overhauls have been necessary.
however repairs are ongoing and in recent years efforts have been made to make the white house more energy efficient.
although it has changed over time the white house remains the home of the president just as it was when john adams arrived.
carved in the mantle of the state dining room today is the blessing that adams made for his new home in that long ago november of 1800 beginning in 1848 the chandeliers in the east room were lit by gas rather than candles.
ceiling decorations were added to the room in 1853.
in 2009 first lady michelle obama welcomed musician stevie wonder as he performed in the east room.

chapter 13 a growing sense of nationhood what did it mean to be an american in the early 1800s.
13 1 introduction if you had been there on that rainy night in maryland during the war of 1812 you might have mistaken the bombardment for thunder.
but maryland lawyer francis scott key knew better.
he huddled in a boat in baltimore harbor and watched as british warships fired on fort mchenry.
fort mchenry had a flag so big that the british would have no trouble seeing it from a distance boasted the forts commander.
it was 30 feet high and 42 feet long.
you can see a photograph of that very flag on the opposite page.
key knew that if the flag came down it meant that both the fort and baltimore had been defeated.
but when the sun rose the flag was still there and the british were retreating.
key celebrated by writing a poem the defence of fort mchenry six days later it was published in a newspaper.
before long it had been reprinted across the country.
it was set to music in 1814 and sung as the star spangled banner in 1931 it was proclaimed the national anthem.
moments like these during the war of 1812 helped give americans a feeling of national identity.
but what did being american mean.
how was it different from being european.
alexis de tocqueville a french nobleman who toured the united states in 1831 and 1832 had one answer.
i do not know a country where the love of money holds a larger place in the heart of man he wrote in his book democracy in america.
the pursuit of wealth was an important element of the emerging american identity.
but there were also other elements that united americans of different backgrounds and experiences.
in this chapter you will learn how a growing sense of nationhood developed during the early 1800s in spite of significant differences between various regions of the country.
the flag that inspired the writing of the star spangled banner is displayed at the smithsonian s national museum of american history.
this painting depicts francis scott key watching the flag flying over fort mchenry during the battle of baltimore in 1814.
a growing sense of nationhood 243 i 13 2 developing a nation in a land of differences in the early 1800s the united states was a very young country.
older adults at that time could still remember when they were british subjects.
even after the american revolution the united states seemed less like a single nation than a collection of states.
a surge of patriotism following the war of 1812 helped forge a new national identity.
because many federalists had been opposed to the war a stance their opponents described as disloyal the federalist party struggled to survive in the face of this growing patriotism.
leaders like james monroe hoped that partisan strife or fighting between political parties was a thing of the past.
most americans looked with pride on a rapidly growing country whose brightest days they believed lay ahead.
i frontier unexplored wilderness at the edge of the country in 1820 most americans lived east of the mississippi river.
to the west of the river lay the great frontier.
the united states in the early 1800s the nation in 1800 was very different from what it is today.
two out of every three americans still lived within 50 miles of the atlantic coast.
fewer than one in ten lived west of the appalachians.
these round topped forested mountains extended like a bumpy spine from maine through georgia.
they made travel between east and west very difficult.
beyond the mountains the land flattened out and was covered by dense woods.
more and more settlers crossed the appalachians in the early 1800s clearing trees and starting farms and mills.
for americans of the day this land between the eastern mountains and the mississippi river was known as the west across the mississippi lay the frontier a vast unexplored wilderness.
everywhere travel was difficult and slow.
nothing moved faster than a horse could run not people not goods not messages.
news could take weeks to travel from one city to another as the post office labored to deliver letters and newspapers over rutted muddy roads.
in part because of geographical differences distinct regional lifestyles developed.
this led to stereotypes or exaggerated images of different groups.
the yankees of the northeast with its growing cities and bustling trade were seen as enterprising thrifty and in the eyes of southerners quick to chase a dollar.
the rich plantation owners of the south were seen as gracious north america 1820 chapter 13 cultured and in the eyes of northerners lazy.
the frontier settlers who sought their fortunes in the west were seen as rugged hardy and in the eyes of people on the east coast crude.
many of the countrys leaders knew they would have to overcome geographical obstacles and stereotypes to truly unite the country.
one idea they favored was an ambitious program of building roads and canals to make transportation easier and faster.
symbols and values uniting the nation required more than building roads and waterways.
citizens needed to feel american.
one way to accomplish this was to build on americans pride in their government.
after the british burned washington d c during the war of 1812 congress hired architects to rebuild the white house and the capitol in a style that would equal the grand stately buildings of europe.
congress complained about the cost but not about the result.
these magnificent buildings are admired to this day as national symbols.
another national symbol was born during this period uncle sam.
legend has it that the name came from sam wilson a new york butcher.
uncle sam it was said had provided the army with meat during the war of 1812.
more likely the name was made up to match the initials u s for united states.
after the war uncle sam became a popular nickname for the federal government.
a national identity requires more than symbols.
citizens need to share values as well.
white american men saw themselves as devoted to individualism and equality.
their commitment to these values may not have extended to enslaved african americans american indians or women.
still they were united in the belief that they were different and better than europeans.
alexis de tocqueville sensed this feeling just four days into his visit.
the americans carry national pride to an altogether excessive length he noted.
by the end of his trip however he had come to admire this distinctly american spirit.
that spirit was reflected in every aspect of life from politics to art music and literature.
the u s capitol shown here in an 1824 painting after the structure was rebuilt following the war of 1812 is a powerful symbol of national unity.
a growing sense of nationhood 245 james monroe was the last president to have fought in the american revolution.
when he ran for reelection no one opposed him.
he won the electoral college vote 231 to 1 capitalism an economic system based on the private ownership of farms and businesses american system a proposal to the government that called for taxes on imports federally funded transportation projects and a new national bank 13 3 politics the era of good feelings after being elected president in 1816 janies monroe went on a goodwill tour.
huge crowds greeted him so warmly that a newspaper proclaimed an era of good feelings monroes eight years as president are still known by this name today.
to many americans at the time it seemed that a new period of national unity had dawned.
economic nationalism the swelling of nationalist spirit was reflected in proposals that the federal government take a more active role in building the national economy.
one of the leading supporters of such measures in congress was henry clay of kentucky.
clay was a persuasive speaker full of charm and intelligence.
driven by ambition clay wanted to be president.
he campaigned for the office five times but was never elected.
clay believed that americas future lay in capitalism an economic system in which individuals and companies produce and distribute goods for profit.
most supporters of capitalism agreed that government should have a limited role in the economy.
but clay believed that the national government had a role to play in encouraging economic growth.
clay supported an economic plan called the american system.
this plan called for taxes on imported goods to protect industry as well as federal spending on transportation projects like roads and canals.
a third part of clays plan was a new national bank to standardize currency and provide credit.
congress adopted this idea in 1816 when it created the second bank of the united states.
the first national bank had lapsed in 1811.
the bank was a private business but the government owned one fifth of it and deposited government funds there.
another early champion of economic nationalism was south carolinas john c calhoun.
in congress calhoun supported the national bank a permanent road system and a tax on imports.
yet in other ways he resisted federal power.
by the 1830s he would become the leading spokesman for states rights largely to protect slavery in the south.
his career illustrates the tensions between nationalism and the pull of regional differences.
a third proponent of nationalism was daniel webster of massachusetts.
webster served several terms in both the house and senate.
unlike clay who was a war hawk webster bitterly opposed the war of 1812.
after the war however he voiced strong support for clay s american system.
let us act under a settled conviction and an habitual feeling that these twenty four states are one country webster urged in 1825.
later he would strongly challenge calhouns claim that states had the right to defy the federal government.
judicial nationalism both nationalism and commerce had a friend in the supreme courts chief justice john marshall.
appointed by john adams in 1801 marshall wrote some of the most important court decisions in u s history.
46 chapter 13 marshall s decisions had two major effects.
first they strengthened the role of the supreme court itself and the federal governments power over the states.
second they encouraged the growth of capitalism as a few specific cases show.
in mcculloch v maryland 1819 the court confirmed congresss authority to create a national bank that was free from state interference.
this strengthened the federal governments position.
in another case the marshall court held that business contracts could not be broken even by state legislatures.
this decision gave contracts a fundamental place in constitutional law.
in gibbons v ogden 1824 the court further reduced state powers.
this case ended a monopoly that new york state had granted to a steamboat company operating between new york and new jersey.
only congress the court said had the authority to regulate interstate commerce.
besides strengthening the power of the federal government this decision promoted business growth by limiting the ability of states to regulate transportation.
the end of the era of good feelings in 1824 four candidates including clay competed to succeed monroe as president.
none of the candidates won a majority in the electoral college.
as a result the election had to be decided by the house of representatives.
the house elected john quincy adams the son of john adams.
the houses action enraged the candidate who had received the most votes on election day.
that candidate was andrew jackson of tennessee one of the heroes of the war of 1812.
jackson vowed to run again in the next election.
the voters who rallied around him in 1828 would become the heart of a new political party the democrats.
the era of good feelings was over.
partisan strife was here to stay.
americans were on the move in the 1800s with many bound for the frontier.
henry clay envisioned a government built system of roads and canals that would link regions of the frontier with the nation s cities.
a growing sense of nationhood 247 i folk art art made by ordinary people as opposed to trained artists using traditional methods in the subsiding of the waters of the deluge 1829 thomas cole bathed his scene in a soft glowing light.
like other painters of the hudson river school cole favored grand vistas that celebrated the nation s natural beauty.
13 4 early american art americans had brought european art traditions with them to the colonies but by the 1800s they were expressing their national identity by developing styles all their own.
not all artists were professionals.
ordinary people produced many kinds of folk art.
men carved weather vanes and hunting decoys.
women sewed spare bits of cloth into quilts.
untrained artists created signs murals and images of national symbols like the american flag.
such folk art was simple direct and often very colorful.
most professional artists made a living doing portraits.
portrait artists of the period tried to capture the personalities and emotions of their subjects.
the best known portrait artist was gilbert stuart.
the image of george washington on a dollar bill is adapted from a stuart painting.
the painting was so treasured that when the british attacked washington d c during the war of 1812 president madison s wife dolly saved stuarts painting of washington from the burning white house.
strangely enough it was an englishman whose work led to a uniquely american brand of fine art.
when thomas cole arrived from england in 1818 he fell in love with the immense and varied american landscape.
his most famous works feature both storm clouds and sunny skies over broad stretches of land.
the glowing light made a striking contrast to the stormy darkness.
fellow artists followed coles example and started what became known as the hudson river school of painting.
these painters focused on nature rather than people often choosing to paint broad scenic vistas.
other artists portrayed more particular aspects of nature.
john james audubon painted finely detailed portraits of birds.
in some respects audubon was more a naturalist than an artist.
he made accurate realistic studies of the species he observed in the fields and woods.
no one in the united states would print his four volume book so he found a publisher in england.
the birds of america made him the countrys first internationally famous artist.
philadelphias george catlin turned his eye on the natives of the american west.
he saw that american indians traditional ways were disappearing.
for years catlin chapter 13 crisscrossed the west drawing the native people and capturing in rich colors their villages hunts and rituals.
by choosing as their subject the wondrous features of their new country americans gave their art a distinct identity.
at times they presented dangerous landscapes in deceptively positive tones.
still the vividness and optimism of their work accurately reflected the national outlook.
13 5 early american music americans national identity was also expressed through music.
until the 1800s music in the united states was performed and heard mostly in church.
songs were performed outside church too but they were usually old tunes with new lyrics.
the music for the star spangled banner for instance came from an english tune.
with growing prosperity came an outburst of musical activity.
in the north orchestras played classical music from europe.
they also provided the music for the cotillion in which groups of four couples danced together with elegantly coordinat ed movements.
dancers swirled through ballrooms performing lively minuets gavottes mazurkas and waltzes.
sometimes female dancers lifted their floor length petticoats to show off their footwork.
displaying their ankles was considered quite daring.
in the south slaves combined the hymns of white churchgoers with african musical styles to create spirituals.
they also entertained themselves and sometimes slave owners with folk songs accompanied by violin drum and banjo an african american invention.
in the south and west square dances became common.
these were less formal versions of the popular cotillion.
as fiddles played a caller told dancers which steps to perform.
as demand for popular songs grew composers answered with a stream of patriotic anthems.
the best known is america written in 1832 by samuel francis smith.
it begins my country tis of thee and is sung to the tune of englands god save the king.
white composers from the south inspired by the music of african americans created a type of music known as minstrel songs.
these songs honored black music by mimicking it.
but at the same time the performers mocked african americans by blackening their own white faces wearing shabby clothes and singing in exaggerated african american dialects.
one white composer thomas dartmouth rice caused a national sensation in 1828 with his song jump jim crow some americans relaxed with folk songs and fiddle tunes while others listened to classical orchestras and performed formal dances.
from the north to the south music was a popular form of entertainment.
spiritual a religious folk song of african american origin weel about and turn about and dojis so ebery time i weel about i jump jim crow.
a growing sense of nationhood 249 i ihe racist phrase jim crow which came from rices black minstrel show character had a long life.
many years later laws that discriminated against african americans would be known as jim crow laws minstrel shows became the most popular form of entertainment in the country.
they inspired composer stephen foster to write such famous songs as old folks at home camptown races and oh.
susanna foster earned nationwide fame proof that a truly american musical tradition had arrived.

13 6 early american literature in 1820 a british writer sneered who reads an american book.
or goes to an american play.
or looks at an american picture or statue in the eyes of europeans the united states was a culturally backward nation.
yet america was finding its cultural voice especially in literature.
like the painters of the hudson river school writers began to use uniquely american subjects and settings.
one of the first to achieve literary fame was washington irving.
he drew on german folklore for his colorful tales of rip van winkle and the legend of sleepy hollow but he set them in the wilds of upstate new york.
irvings enchanted stories were an immediate hit.
one of the nation s first novelists was james fenimore cooper.
in books such as the pioneers and the last of the mohicans cooper wrote about the adventures of settlers in the wilderness.
his descriptions of frontier life and american indians attracted worldwide interest.
in france 18 publishers competed to publish the pioneers.
davy crockett was a real life frontiersman who spun tall tales about his life as a hunter scout soldier and explorer.
his election to congress from tennessee horrified alexis de tocqueville.
ihe frenchman described crockett as a man who has no education can read with difficulty has no property no fixed residence but passes his life hunting selling his game to live and dwelling continuously in the woods.
but that very image captivated americans who saw crockett as the fictional frontier hero come to life.
crocketts autobiography which was full of his plain backwoods speech and rough humor helped give popular literature a new distinctly american accent.
new england s henry wadsworth longfellow was one of the first serious american poets.
he wrote americas first epic poem the song of hiawatha based on stories of american indians.
other poems like his famous paul reveres ride touched on patriotic themes.

humanity with all its fears with all the hopes of future years is hanging breathless on thy fate.
i chapter 13 in both subject matter and style writers like these encouraged the growth of a national identity.
in particular they promoted the myth of rugged individualism that for many people at home and abroad best characterized the united states.
chapter summary in this chapter you read about the growing sense of nationhood in the united states after the war of 1812.
developing a nation in a land of differences a spirit of patriotism after the war of 1812 helped the united states form a national identity even though distinct lifestyles developed in different regions of the country.
this national identity was shown in americans pride in symbols such as the white house the capitol and uncle sam and in shared values such as equality.
politics the era of good feelings james madison became president in 1816.
his presidency is known as the era of good feelings because of the national unity the country experienced between 1816 and 1824.
during these years leaders like henry clay john c calhoun and daniel webster supported proposals that called for the federal government to take a more active role in developing the nations economy.
also during this period the chief justice of the supreme court john marshall helped strengthen federal power over the states and encourage the growth of capitalism.
early american art music and literature american art forms also helped the nation develop a unique identity.
painters of the hudson river school created artworks that highlighted the landscapes natural beauty and george catlin painted scenes of american indian life.
new forms of music included spirituals and patriotic anthems.
writers used uniquely american settings and subjects to create such stories as rip van winkle and the legend of sleepy hollow and popular novels like the pioneers and the last of the mohicans.

a new literature celebrates a new nation as the country grew american writers began to develop a uniquely american literature.
stories and novels took place in beautiful american settings.
they also focused on distinctly american topics both celebrating the new nation and pondering its future.
rip van winkle the title character of an 1819 short story by washington irving was a happy man.
he lived in new york s lush hudson valley and spent his days hanging out with his friends shooting squirrels and avoiding his domineering wife.
one afternoon as he rested in the hills after hunting with his dog rip heard someone call his name.
he saw a strange looking elflike man who wanted his help.
rip helped the little man carry a heavy keg to a green valley.
there he saw more small oddly dressed men who were bowling on a lawn.
rip wondered if there was something magical about the scene.
how had the little man known his name.
and why every time a ball hit some pins did thunder roar.
soon rips curiosity about what was in the keg and his desire to avoid his wife overcame him and he had a drink.
he had a few more drinks and then he fell asleep.
when rip woke the next morning everything had changed.
the little men were gone and when he made his way home he saw that his village seemed altered it was larger and more populous than it had been when he had left.
he felt that the character of the people seemed changed.
a busy bustling tone had replaced the drowsy tranquility that rip had known.
in fact rip van winkle had slept for 20 years although it felt like just one night to him.
rip soon discovered that he had become an old man.
he found himself stiff in the joints and he looked different.
when he passed the local villagers they all stared at him with equal marks of surprise and whenever they cast eyes upon him invariably stroked their chins.
the constant recurrence of this gesture induced rip involuntarily to do the same when to his astonishment he found his beard had grown afoot long.
washington irving rip van winkle from the sketch book of geoffrey crayon gent 1819 more than rips appearance had changed during his long night.
while he slept the american colonies had fought and won a war for independence.
imagine rips confusion on visiting the local tavern where the political changes were visible.
er 13 he recognized on the sign the ruby face of king george under which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe but even this was singularly metamorphosed transformed.
the red coat was changed for one of blue and buff a sword was stuck in the hand instead of a sceptre the head was decorated with a cocked hat and underneath was painted in large characters general washington.
talking with the townsfolk rip discovered what had happened.
instead of being a subject of his majesty george the third he found out he was now a free citizen of the united states in the story rip van winkle 20 years seemed to pass overnight.
a man fell asleep and the colony where he lived had become part of a new country.
many people consider rip van winkle to be the united states first short story.
written not long after independence it expressed wonder and shock at how quickly a revolution had happened and how much it had changed the lives of the people of the new nation.
atthe same time that american writers were setting stories in the american landscape painters were painting it.
thomas cole was one of those painters.
view on the catskill early autumn shows the beauty of the area where the story of rip van winkle took place.
a growing sense of nationhood 253 i 11 e h this drawing appeared in an 1893 version of the pioneers.

at the same time irving was writing james fenimore cooper penned the first american novels.
set in the fictional town oi templeton new york the leatherstocking tales told about the settle ment and rapid disappearance of the frontier.
the pioneers was the first of the series written in 1823.
it introduced readers to natty bumppo.
this fictional character a former wilderness scout was probably modeled after daniel boone.
he was called leatherstocking because he wore leather chaps to cover his leg in coopers novels natty bumppo tried to protect both nature andh own way of life from the onslaught of civilization.
in one scene cooper described the clash between the pioneers who represented civilization and a flock of birds which represented nature.
the excitement began early one morning.
the gulls are hovel ing over the lake already one templeton resident exclaimed and th heavens are alive with pigeons.
you may look an hour before you can find a hole through which to get a peep at the sun the excited townspeople gathered.
cooper wrote if the heavens were alive with pigeons the whole village seemed equally in motion with men women and children they brought their guns all kinds of guns and started to shoot at the pigeons.
there were so many birds that the hunters didnt even need to aim.
they simply shot into 4 chapter 13 the air and the pigeons fell.
at one point the hunters grew so enthusiastic that two of them brought out a cannon to shoot even more pigeons.
that was too much for natty bumppo.
he harshly criticized the settlers for recklessly spoiling nature.
this comes of settling a country he said.
here have i known the pigeon to fly for forty long years and till you made your clearings there was nobody to shear scare or to hurt them.
i loved to see them come into the woods for they were company to a body hurting nothing being as it was as harmless as a gar ter snake james fenimore cooper the pioneers 1823 in describing the hunters as not even bothering to see whether the birds were dead or to pick them up off the ground cooper seemed to agree with natty that the settlers threatened the natural world.
on the other hand the settlers did have some valid reasons for their actions.
cooper sympathized with them too.
one hunter billy kirby heard nattys outrage and replied actor daniel day lewis played natty bumppo in a film version of the last of the mohicans.
the novel one of the leatherstocking tales takes place during the french and indian war.
old leather stocking he cried grumbling at the loss of a few pigeons.
if you had to sow your wheat twice and three times as i have done you wouldn t be so massyfully mercifully feeling toward the divils.
hurrah boys.
scatter the feathers the settlers were farmers and the birds threatened the crops they needed to survive.
in coopers eyes the settlers motive was as valid as leatherstockings anger.
but the needs of nature and the needs of the pioneers clashed and would continue to clash until the settlers finally won out.
a disappearing world washington irving and james fenimore cooper were two of the first truly american writers.
both had lived overseas and wanted europeans to respect the budding american culture.
both saw themselves as voices for the new nation.
the content of their writing was distinctly american.
irving and cooper set their stories in the beautiful american landscape.
they also addressed american issues.
they were proud of their new country.
but they also knew that along with the nations growth there would be unforeseen changes.
a growing sense of nationhood 255.
chapter 12 foreign affairs in the young nation to what extent should the united states have become involved in world affairs in the early 1800s.
12 1 introduction did you know that you are carrying a history lesson in your pocket or purse.
you will find it on any 1 bill.
look at a dollar and see for yourself.
on one side you will see two circles showing the great seal of the united states.
for thousands of years governments have used seals like this one to mark their approval of important documents.
our nations founders thought that a national seal was so important that they began work on it the same day they declared independence july 4 1776.
in 1782 congress approved the design we see on our currency today.
the great seal symbolizes the nations principles.
for example the unfinished pyramid on one side of the seal signifies strength and endurance.
the bald eagle on the other side is a symbol of the united states.
in one claw the eagle holds an olive branch a symbol of peace.
in the other the eagle holds arrows to symbolize war.
the olive branch and arrows of war show that the united states will pursue peace but will also protect itself.
notice that the eagle faces peace.
now turn the dollar bill over.
you will see a portrait of george washington.
americans still honor washington as the nations first president.
but few remember that washington defined u s foreign policy in the early years of the nations history.
during his presidency washington established policies that would guide the united states in its future dealings with other nations.
the united states could be actively involved in world affairs risking war.
or it could avoid involvement in other nations conflicts in the hope of staying at peace.
which choice would you have made for the new nation.
in this chapter you will read about four dilemmas that faced early u s presidents.
their decisions would shape the foreign policy pursued by later presidents.
george washington was considered a hero even in his own time.
here we see lady liberty crowning a statue of washington.
the inscription on the bust reads first in war first in peace first in the hearts of his countrymen.
the great seal of the united states foreign affairs in the young nation 225 12 2 president washington creates a foreign policy when george washington took office as the nations first president in 1789 the united states appeared to be weak militarily.
the army that washington had commanded during the american revolution had disbanded.
it had not been replaced for two reasons.
first the government did not have the money to keep its army active.
second americans had learned that a standing national army could be used to take away their liberty.
state militia troops they believed could handle any threats the country might face.
and there were indeed threats.
the new nation was surrounded by unfriendly powers.
to the north great britain still controlled canada.
the british also refused to abandon their forts in the ohio valley even though this region now belonged to the united states.
to the south and west spain controlled florida and louisiana.
events in europe also threatened the new nation.
in 1789 the french people rose up against their king and declared france a republic.
most americans were thrilled by the french revolution.
in 1793 however france declared war against great britain.
the war between france and great britain presented president washington with the difficult problem of deciding which side to take.
during its own revolution the united states had signed a treaty george washington s farewell address was published in newspapers in 1796.
as part of his advice to the nation he urged neutrality in foreign relations.
neutrality a policy of not choosing sides in a dispute or war between other countries isolationism a policy of avoiding political or military agreements with other countries of alliance with france in 1788.
alliances are agreements made with other nations to aid and support each other.
in that treaty the united states had promised to aid france in time of war.
many americans were eager to honor that pledge even if it meant going to war with great britain.
washington knew that the united states was not prepared for war.
instead he announced a policy of neutrality.
under this policy the united states would do nothing to aid either france or great britain in their war.
before leaving office washington summed up his foreign policy in a farewell address to the nation.
the united states he said could gain nothing by becoming involved in other nations affairs.
it is our true policy he declared to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world washingtons policy of avoid ing alliances with other countries became known as isolationism.
for the next century isolationism would be the foundation of u s foreign policy.
226 chapter 12 north american land claims 1796 in 1796 the united states was surrounded by colonies that belonged to the european countries of great britain france and spain.
what problems do you thinkthis fact might have caused forthe newly independent united states.
foreign affairs in the young nation 227 12 3 president adams s dilemma protecting u s.
ships isolationism sounded good in theory.
but it is often hard to stay out of other countries conflicts.
no one knew this better than john adams the nations second president.
adams tried to follow george washingtons policy of neutrality.
with france however staying neutral proved to be difficult.
the jay treaty french leaders hoped that great britains refusal to leave the ohio valley would lead to war between great britain and the united states.
those hopes were dashed when washington sent john jay chief justice of the supreme court to london to settle things with the british.
in the treaty signed in 1794 known as the jay treaty the british finally agreed to pull their troops from the ohio valley.
france still at war with great britain viewed the jay treaty as a violation of its own treaty with the united states made back in 1778.
in july 1796 the french navy began attacking u s merchant ships bound for great britain.
over the next year french warships seized 316 american ships.
in this cartoon american envoys meet with a french diplomat depicted as a multiheaded monster holding a dagger.
the cartoonist shared the negative view of french diplomacy held by most americans in the 1790s.
the granger collection newyork the xyz affair president adams sent three envoys or representatives to france to ask the french to end the attacks.
french foreign minister talleyrand refused to speak to the americans.
instead they were met by secret agents later identified only as x y and z.
the agents said that no peace talks would be held unless talleyrand received a large sum of money as a tribute.
a tribute is money given to someone in exchange for that persons protection.
shocked by the request the american envoys refused.
the xyz affair as it became known outraged americans when the story reached home.
at president adamss request congress voted to recruit an army of 10 000 men.
it also voted to build 12 new ships for the nations tiny navy.
the slogan millions for defense but not one cent for tribute was heard everywhere as americans prepared for war.
meanwhile congress authorized u s warships and privately owned ships called privateers to launch a half war on the seas.
during this undeclared war american ships captured more than 80 armed french vessels.
as war fever mounted president adams never a well loved leader found himself unexpectedly popular.
his federalist party gained support in all parts of the country.
the question facing adams was whether the popular thing waging an undeclared war on france was also the best thing for the country.
chapter 12 president john adams believed that the united states needed a strong navy.
congress approved the construction of 12 warships including the philadelphia shown here under construction in 1800.
12 4 what happened adams pursues peace president john adams knew that no matter how good war might be for the federalist party it would not be good for the country.
in february 1799 he announced that he was sending a group of men to france to work for peace.
federalist leaders were furious.
they pleaded with the president to change his mind but adams would not budge.
by the time the peace mission reached france a french military leader named napoleon bonaparte had taken over the french government.
napoleon was eager to make peace with both great britain and the united states.
he had already ordered the navy to stop seizing american ships and to release captured american sailors.
in a treaty made between france and the united states in 1800 napoleon agreed to end france s 1778 alliance with the united states.
in exchange the americans agreed not to ask france to pay for all the ships it had seized.
this meant that the u s government would have to pay american ship owners for their lost property.
to adams this seemed a small price to pay for peace with france.
choosing the olive branch cost adams political popularity.
his pursuit of peace with france created strong disagreements within the federalist party.
these disagreements lost adams and the federalists votes when he ran for reelection in 1800.
jefferson defeated adams in the election and the federalist party lost much of its support.
over the next few years adams would watch his federalist party slowly fade away.
still adams had no regrets.
he wrote i will defend my missions to france as long as i have an eye to direct my hand or a finger to hold my pen.
i desire no other inscription over my gravestone than here lies john adams who took upon himself the responsibility of the peace with france in the year 1800 foreign affairs in the young nation 229 12 5 president jefferson s dilemma dealing with pirates the peace that john adams achieved with france did not last long.
in 1803 france and great britain were again at war.
as the conflict heated up both nations began seizing american ships that were trading with their enemy.
president thomas jefferson who took office in 1801 complained bitterly that england has become a den of pirates and france has become a den of thieves still like washington and adams before him jefferson tried to follow a policy of neutrality.
in the late 1700s and early 1800s the mediterranean sea was filled with pirates who attacked u s merchant ships.
the united states paid tribute to leaders of the barbary states to preventthese attacks.
the barbary coast impressment remaining neutral when ships were being seized was hard enough.
it became even harder when great britain began impressing american sailors kidnapping them and forcing them to serve in the british navy.
the british claimed that the men they impressed were british deserters.
this may have been true in some cases as some sailors may well have fled the terrible conditions on british ships.
yet thousands of unlucky americans were also impressed.
american anger over impressment peaked in 1807 after a british warship the leopard stopped a u s warship the chesapeake to search for deserters.
when the chesapeake s captain refused to allow a search the leopard opened fire.
twenty one american sailors were killed or wounded.
this attack triggered another case of war fever this time against great britain.
piracy american ships faced a different threat from the barbary states of north africa piracy or robbery at sea.
for years pirates from morocco algiers tunis and tripoli had preyed on merchant ships entering the mediterranean sea.
the pirates seized the ships and held their crews for ransom.
presidents washington and adams both paid tribute to barbary state rulers in exchange for the safety of american ships.
while americans were shouting millions for defense but not one cent for tribute during the xyz affair the united states was quietly sending money to the barbary states.
by the time jefferson became president the united states had paid the barbary states almost 2 million.
the ruler of tripoli however demanded still more tribute.
to show that he was serious he declared war on the united states.
jefferson hated war.
but he also hated paying tribute.
the question was which was worse.
230 chapter 12 the newyork historical society negative 7278 12 6 what happened jefferson solves the problem as much as thomas jefferson hated war he hated paying tribute more.
in 1802 he sent a small fleet of warships to the mediterranean to protect american shipping interests.
the war with tripoli plodded along until 1804 when american ships began bombarding tripoli with their cannons.
then one of the ships the philadelphia ran aground on a hidden reef in the harbor.
the captain and crew were captured and held for ransom.
rather than let pirates have the philadelphia a young naval officer named stephen decatur led a raiding party into the heavily guarded tripoli harbor and set the ship afire.
after a year of u s attacks and a blockade tripoli signed a peace treaty with the united states in 1805.
tripoli agreed to stop demanding tribute payments.
in return the united states paid a 60 000 ransom for the crew of the philadel phia.
this was a bargain compared to the 3 million first demanded.
pirates from other barbary states continued to raid ships in the mediterranean.
in 1815 u s and european naval forces finally destroyed the pirate bases.
meanwhile jefferson tried desperately to convince both france and great britain to leave american ships alone.
all of his diplomatic efforts failed.
between 1803 and 1807 great britain seized at least a thousand american ships.
france captured about half that many.
when diplomacy failed jefferson proposed an embargo a complete halt in trade with other nations.
under the embargo act passed by congress in 1807 no foreign ships could enter u s ports and no american ships could leave except to trade at other u s ports.
jefferson hoped that stopping trade would prove so painful to france and great britain that they would agree to leave american ships alone.
the embargo however proved far more painful to americans than to anyone in europe.
some 55 000 sailors lost their jobs.
in new england newspapers pointed out that embargo spelled backward reads 0 grab me which made sense to all who were feeling its pinch.
congress repealed the unpopular embargo act in 1809.
american ships returned to the seas and french and british warships continued to attack them.
president thomas jefferson ordered an embargo to force great britain and france to leave american ships alone.
this political cartoon pictures the embargo as a snapping turtle preventing american merchants from selling their goods overseas.
embargo a government order that forbids trade with another country foreign affairs in the young nation 231 blockade a closing off of an area to keep people or supplies from going in or out indiana governor william henry harrison on the far left is shown encouraging his troops during the battle of tippecanoe creek.
after the battle harrison s men discovered thatthe indians were armed with british guns which added to americans anger atthe british.
12 7 president madison s dilemma protecting sailors and settlers president james madison took office in 1809.
he tried a new approach to protecting americans at sea.
he offered france and great britain a deal if you agree to cease your attacks on american ships the united states will stop trading with your enemy.
napoleon promptly agreed to madisons offer.
at the same time napoleon gave his navy secret orders to continue seizing american ships headed for british ports.
madison who desperately wanted to believe napoleons false promise cut off all trade with great britain.
meanwhile the british continued seizing ships and impressing american sailors.
madison saw only one way to force great britain to respect american rights.
he began to think about abandoning george washingtons policy of isolationism and going to war with great britain.
new englanders and federalists generally opposed going to war.
merchants in new england knew that war would mean a blockade of their ports by the british navy.
they preferred to take their chances with the troubles at sea.
many people in the south and to the west however supported going to war.
like all americans they resented great britains policy of impressing u s sailors.
they also accused the british of stirring up trouble among indians in the states and territories to the northwest.
trouble with the indians was growing as settlers moved into the ohio and mississippi valleys and pushed indians off their lands.
two shawnee indians a chief named tecumseh and his brother the prophet tried to fight back by uniting indians along the mississippi river into one great indian nation.
on november 7 1811 shawnee warriors fought against a militia force led by indiana governor william henry harrison in the battle of tippecanoe creek.
harrison defeated the indian forces.
after the battle however harrisons men discovered that the indians were armed with british guns.
americans were outraged.
several young congressmen from the south and west including henry clay of kentucky and john c calhoun of south carolina were so eager for war with great britain that they were nicknamed war hawks they argued that to make the northwestern frontier safe for settlers the united states needed to drive the british out of canada.
once that was done canada could be added to the united states.
losses at sea national pride and a desire to make the frontier safe for settlement all contributed to the reasons for war.
still madison hesitated.
was the nation strong enough to launch the arrows of war.
or should he hold tightly to the olive branch of peace.
12 8 what happened the war of 1812 james madison chose to abandon isolationism.
at his request congress declared war on great britain on july 17 1812.
this was a bold step for a nation with an army of 7 000 poorly trained men and a navy of only 16 ships.
the shawnee leader tecumseh united american indians in an attemptto halt the advance of white settlers onto indian lands.
battles on land and sea war hawks were overjoyed when the war of 1812 began.
they thought that conquering canada was a mere matter of marching they were wrong.
in 1812 1813 and again in 1814 u s forces crossed into canada but each time british forces turned them back.
the british too found the going much rougher than expected.
on september 10 1813 a u s naval force under the command of oliver hazard perry captured a british fleet of six ships on lake erie.
perrys victory enabled william henry harrison to push into upper canada where he defeated the british in a major battle.
chief tecumseh who was fighting on the side of the british was killed.
but in december the british drove the americans back across the border.
by 1814 napoleon had been defeated in europe and great britain was able to send 15 000 troops to canada.
american plans to conquer canada came to an end.
meanwhile in august 1814 another british army invaded washington d c.
the british burned several public buildings including the capitol and the white house.
president madison had to flee for his life.
next the british attacked the port city of baltimore maryland.
on september 13 an american lawyer named francis scott key watched as the british bombarded fort mchenry which guarded the citys harbor.
the bombardment went on all night.
when dawn broke key was thrilled to see that the american flag still waved over the fort proving that the fort had not been captured.
he expressed his feelings in a poem that was later put to music as the star spangled banner.
foreign affairs in the young nation 233 this map shows american and british offensives or attacks during the war of 1812.
despite victories on both sides neither country really won the war.
still the war had important effects in the united states.

in great britain news of this defeat would greatly weaken the desire to continue the war.
but the news took time to travel and in the meantime british commanders in the united states launched another invasion.
this time their target was new orleans.
new orleans was defended by general andrew jackson and a ragtag army of 7 000 militia free african americans indians and pirates.
on january 8 1815 more than 7 500 british troops marched confidently into battle.
jacksons troops met them with deadly fire.
some 2 000 british soldiers were killed or wounded compared with only about 20 americans.
the battle of new orleans was the greatest u s victory of the war of 1812.
it was also totally unnecessary.
two weeks earlier american and british diplomats meeting in ghent ghent belgium had signed a peace treaty ending the war.
the news did not reach new orleans until after the battle was fought.
results of the war although both sides claimed victory neither great britain nor the united states really won the war of 1812.
the treaty of ghent settled none of the issues that had led to the fighting.
instead the problems of impressment and ship seizures faded away as peace settled over europe.
still the war had important effects.
first indian resistance in the northwest territory weakened after tecumsehs death.
over time most of the american indians who fought with tecumseh would be driven out of the ohio valley.
second national pride in the united states surged.
many americans considered the war of 1812 the second war of independence they felt that by standing up to the british the united states had truly become a sovereign nation.
third the war had political effects.
the federalists were badly damaged by their opposition to the war and their party never recovered.
two of the wars heroes william henry harrison and andrew jackson would later be elected president.
chapter 12 12 9 president monroe s dilemma a new foreign policy challenge james monroe became president in 1817.
after the excitement of the war of 1812 he was relieved to return the nation to its policy of isolationism.
americans began to turn their attention away from europe however and direct it to events happening in latin america.
from mexico to the tip of south america latin americans were rising up in revolt against spain.
latin america s revolutions in mexico the revolt against spanish rule was inspired by a catholic priest named miguel hidalgo me ghell heh dahl goh.
on september 16 1810 hidalgo spoke to a crowd of poor indians in the town of dolores.
my children hidalgo said will you make an effort to recover from the hated spaniards the lands stolen from your fore fathers three hundred years ago.
death to bad government hidalgos speech remembered today as the cry of dolores inspired a revolution that lasted ten years.
in 1821 mexico finally won its independence from spain.
two other leaders liberated south america.
in 1810 a venezuelan named simon bolivar see mohn buh lee var launched a revolution in the north with this cry spaniards you will receive death at our hands.
americans you will receive life jose de san martin ho zay de san mar teen a revolutionary from argentina led the struggle for independence in the south.
by the end of 1825 the last spanish troops had been driven out of south america.
new latin american nations many americans were excited by independence movements in latin america.
the british also supported the revolutions for their own reasons.
spain had not allowed other nations to trade with its colonies.
once freed from spanish rule the new latin american nations were able to open their doors to foreign trade including trade with great britain.
other european leaders were not so pleased.
some even began to talk of helping spain recover its lost colonies.
in 1823 great britain asked the united states to join it in sending a message to these leaders telling them to leave latin america alone.
president james monroe asked former presidents thomas jefferson and james madison for advice.
should the united states do something to support the new latin american nations.
if so what.
a catholic priest miguel hidalgo lower center inspired an independence movement in mexico.
in his upraised hand hidalgo holds the flames of revolution that spread throughout latin america in the early 1800s.
foreign affairs in the young nation 235 monroe doctrine president james monroes declaration in 1823 that the western hemisphere was no longer open to european colonization with the monroe doctrine by his side.
uncle sam warns foreign powers to keep their hands off the americas.
even though the monroe doctrine is more than 180 years old it still guides u s presidents as they make foreign policy decisions.
mfihrcfe doctrine proclaimed 12 10 what happened the monroe doctrine both thomas jefferson and james madison liked the idea of joining with great britain to send a warning to the nations of europe.
jefferson wrote to james monroe our first and fundamental maxim principle should be never entangle ourselves in the broils fights of europe.
our second never to suffer europe to intermeddle interfere with america north and south president monroes secretary of state john quincy adams agreed with jefferson.
but adams insisted that it would be more candid honest as well as more dignified for the united states to speak boldly for itself.
president monroe agreed.
in 1823 monroe made a speech to congress announcing a policy that became known as the monroe doctrine.
monroe stated that the nations of north and south america were free and independent and were not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers.
the united states he said would view efforts by europeans to take over any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety europeans denounced monroe s message as arrogant.
by what right asked a french newspaper did the united states presume to tell the other nations of the world what they could do in north and south america.
americans however cheered monroes message.
it made them proud to see the united states stand up for the freedom loving people of latin america.
er 12 in the years ahead the monroe doctrine joined isolationism as a basic principle of u s foreign policy.
the doctrine asserted that the united states would not accept european interference in american affairs.
it also contained another hidden message.
by its very boldness the monroe doctrine told the world that the united states was no longer a weak collection of quarreling states.
it had become a strong and confident nation a nation to be respected by the world.
chapter summary in this chapter you learned about the development of foreign policy in the united states under the nations first five presidents.
president washington creates a foreign policy the first u s president knew that the young nation was unprepared for war.
george washington established a policy of isolationism to avoid alliances with other countries which could draw the country into wars abroad.
president adamss dilemma during the presidency of john adams france attacked u s ships.
adams followed washingtons policy of isolationism and kept the united states at peace by securing a treaty with france.
president jeffersons dilemma president thomas jefferson also faced threats at sea.
when peace talks failed he passed the embargo act of 1807.
it too was unsuccessful.
president madisons dilemma president james madison offered a trade deal to both france and great britain but the attacks at sea continued.
he finally abandoned isolationism and declared war on great britain.
the war of 1812 ended in a peace treaty with great britain.
president monroes dilemma president james monroe in support of the new latin american states issued a policy called the monroe doctrine.
in it he warned european nations to respect the newly independent colonies.
the monroe doctrine established the united states as a strong nation willing to stand up for its own freedom and that of its neighbors.

both are necessary to protect the liberty at the top that americans hold so dear.
i foreign affairs in the young nation 237 reading further tecumseh was one of the greatest american indian leaders.
byall accounts he was an imposing figure.
this portraitwas based on a sketch made during tecumseh s lifetime.
tecumseh the shooting star in the early 1800s american indians in ohio and other parts of the northwest territory faced a critical choice.
white settlers were moving in and taking their land.
the indians could give up their land peacefully and try to live among the settlers.
or they could stand and fight for their way of life.
for one visionary american indian leader the choice was never in doubt.
the shawnee canoes slid swiftly down the wabash river.
they were painted in bright colors the colors of war.
the shawnee were headed for the town of vincennes the capital of the indiana territory.
the date was august 12 1810.
the shawnee about 75 of them had come to meet with the governor william henry harrison.
they camped a mile outside of town.
several days later the meeting began at the governors mansion.
the governor had set up tables and chairs on the mansions large porch but the shawnee chief tecumseh said he wanted to sit on the lawn.
as he put it the earth was the most proper place for the indians as they liked to repose rest on the bosom of their mother as everyone took a seat tecumseh remained standing.
he was a tall handsome man with long hair and an athletic body.
everyone would later agree that he had a commanding presence and a gift for words.
in shawnee his name meant shooting star tecumseh faced governor harrison and began to speak.
he described the injustices his people had suffered at the hands of the u s government.
he spoke of unfair treaties and broken promises that had stripped them of their land.
he said the government had persuaded indians to sell land that did not belong to them.
the land he said was never divided but belongs to all and he continued no tribe has the right to sell even to each other much less to strangers.
sell a country.
why not sell the air the great sea as well as the earth.
did not the great spirit make them all for the use of his children.
tecumseh claimed to speak for all american indians.
he said his people wanted to live in peace but they would fight if necessary.
harrison was unmoved by tecumsehs words but he knew he could not ignore the shawnee leader.
he later called him one of those uncommon geniuses which spring up occasionally to produce revolutions and overturn the established order of things he wanted to make sure tecumseh did not stand in the way of u s expansion.
who was tecumseh and how did he become such a powerful figure.
8 chapter 12 the making of a warrior tecumseh was born in the ohio territory around 1768.
ohio was a beautiful land of rivers and forests rich in wildlife.
it was a sacred place to the shawnee.
they called it the center of the world tecumseh grew up in troubled times however.
white settlers were crossing the appalachians and taking indian lands.
during the american revolution most indians fought on the british side hoping to halt western settlement.
after the war however westward expansion continued.
and so did the conflict between indians and white americans.
indians called the americans long knives because of the army swords some of them carried.
tecumseh lost his father in fighting with the long knives.
he and his family also had to move many times as the americans raided and burned their villages.
these experiences led tecumseh to become a warrior.
as a boy he saw shawnee war parties prepare for battle.
he watched them paint their faces and put on their war feathers.
as a young man he learned the arts of warfare.
by his early twenties he had become a brave and skillful warrior.
at first the indians enjoyed great success in their battles with the long knives.
but in 1794 they suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of fallen timbers.
the following year they were forced to sign the treaty of greenville.
under this treaty they gave up most of the ohio territory to white settlement.
in exchange they received money and the promise of lands in western ohio and indiana.
tecumseh refused to sign the treaty.
he knew that the government had failed to honor previous treaties.
he also believed that ohio was the land of his people.
many older indian leaders had grown tired of fighting.
they did not believe they could defeat the long knives.
but tecumseh would not give up.
historians believe thatthese war clubs belonged to tecumseh.
foreign affairs in the young nation 239 tecumseh s brother was known as the prophet.
he helped tecumseh launch a movementfor indian unity.
his indian name was lalawethika.
he later changed itto tenskwatawa meaning open door.
the quest for indian unity after the treaty of greenville tecumseh and his followers moved west into the indiana territory.
but the white settlers continued to move closer.
they cleared the land and killed the wild game.
soon there would be nothing left to sustain the indian way of life.
by the early 1800s tecumseh knew that he had to do something to save his people.
the only solution he believed was to form a single indian nation.
this was not a new idea.
indians had formed tribal confederacies in the past.
but tecumsehs plan was much bigger.
he imagined a grand confederation of indian peoples stretching from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico.
this confederation would unite dozens of tribes around the common goal of defending their land.
to these various tribes he declared brothers we all belong to one family it was an enormous challenge perhaps too big even for an inspired leader like tecumseh.
but he got crucial help from his younger brother lalawethika.
in 1805 lalawethika fell into a fire and nearly died.
but in his suffering he had a mystical vision that told him how his people could be saved.
they had to embrace indian customs and reject the ways of the white world.
if they did this the white people would be driven from their land.
this message had a powerful effect on other indians who began calling lalawethika the prophet tecumseh realized that he could combine the prophets message with his own call for indian unity to forge a powerful movement.
together the two brothers founded a new indian village called prophetstown.
indians began flocking there to join the movement.
these events made governor harrison very nervous.
but he continued with his plans to settle indiana.
in 1809 he gathered a number of indian leaders together and persuaded them to sign the treaty of fort wayne.
they agreed to sell 3 million acres of land to the government for just pennies an acre.
tecumseh was furious.
in his view the indians had no right to sell the land.
he went to meet harrison at vincennes the famous meeting of 1810 and told him that the treaty was invalid.
but harrison refused to listen.
tecumseh went away more convinced than ever that only indian unity and war could save his people.
tecumseh s defeat war came sooner than tecumseh wanted.
in the fall of 1811 while tecumseh was away trying to win new allies governor harrison made his move.
he marched his militia to prophetstown and told the indians to leave.
tecumseh had warned the prophet not to get drawn into war while he was gone.
but the prophet ignored this order.
he believed his spiritual power would protect the indians from harm.
l0 chapter 12 just before dawn on november 7 the indians crept into the militia camp.
they were a much smaller force several hundred warriors against a thousand soldiers but they hoped to take the camp by surprise.
with a flurry of war cries they fell on the unsuspecting soldiers.
the battle of tippecanoe had begun.
at first it seemed their strategy might work.
in the darkness and confusion of battle the indians quickly gained the upper hand.
but as the day dawned and the fighting wore on it was clear that they were outnumbered and outgunned.
finally they were forced to retreat.
harrison and his troops entered prophetstown and burned it to the ground.
the governor returned home in victory.
this defeat struck hard at tecumsehs plans.
but the fighting had just begun.
tecumseh continued to build his confederacy.
when the war of 1812 began he and his indian allies joined with british forces in canada to fight the u s army.
once again tecumseh showed his bravery and brilliance.
the british commanders were awed by his military genius.
in 1813 however tecumseh and the british were defeated by a much larger u s force at the battle of the thames.
the british quickly fled the battlefield but tecumseh refused to retreat.
our lives are in the hands of the great spirit he said.
we are determined to defend our lands and if it is his will we shall leave our bones upon them he was killed in the battle.
in the end tecumseh failed to realize his vision of a great american indian nation.
indians continued to lose their lands and their lives to u s expansion.
but he set an example in his dedication to his ideals and his commitment to his people.
for a brief time his star burned bright.
today tecumseh is regarded as an american hero.
tecumseh was killed on october 5 1813 atthe battle of the thames.
the battle was a decisive victory forthe americans in the war of 1812.

chapter 16 life in the west what were the motives hardships and legacies of the groups that moved west in the 1800s.
16 1 introduction the vast region that stretches from the mississippi river to the pacific ocean is one of the most extraordinary landscapes on earth.
tourists come from all over to see its mountains canyons deserts and plains.
to american settlers east of the mississippi river this great expanse of grasslands mountains and deserts was the west.
for all its beauty the west was a challenging environment.
look at the names that settlers gave to its features.
where else in the united states can you find a mountain range called the crazies a scorching desert named death valley a blood red canyon called flaming gorge or a raging river known as the river of no return.
despite its geographic challenges the west was never empty.
perhaps as many as 3 million american indians lived there before europeans arrived.
these first westerners were far more diverse in language and culture than the europeans who claimed their land.
for most americans in the early 1800s however the west was mostly a blank map.
by 1850 it had become the land of opportunity.
the west boasted wide open spaces and great wealth in timber gold silver and other natural resources.
it became a magnet for immigrants and for easterners looking for a new start in life.
as americans began their westward trek they created new markets for eastern merchants.
in time the west changed the nations economy and politics.
it also created folklore of rugged individualism that has become a lasting part of american culture.
newspaperman horace greeley captured the growing enthusiasm for going west when he wrote if you have no family or friends to aid you and no prospect opportunity opened to you turn your face to the great west and there build up a home and fortune in this chapter you will learn about eight groups of people who turned their faces to the west in the first half of the 1800s.
you will learn about their motives for heading west the hardships they faced and the legacies they left behind.
westward bound settlers had to cross mountains deserts and wide open spaces in their questfor new opportunities.
westward the course of empire takes its way painted in 1861 by emanuel gottlieb leutze life in the west 297 this painting shows members of the lewis and clark expedition at three forks montana.
the woman is sacagawea.
to her right are meriwether lewis william clark and clark s slave york.
16 2 the explorers in the early 1800s a number of expeditions set out from the united states to explore the west.
the most famous was the lewis and clark expedition which was ordered by president thomas jefferson.
the major motive behind the expedition was to make friendly contact with indian groups that might be interested in trade.
a second motive was to find the northwest passage a water route across north america that explorers had been seeking ever since columbus reached the americas.
with the purchase of louisiana from france in 1803 the expedition gained a third motive finding out just what the united states had bought.
lewis and clark expedition a journey made from 1804 to 1806 by meriwether lewis and william clark to explore the territory gained in the louisiana purchase up the missouri river in may 1804 the 45 member expedition left st louis missouri in three boats.
jeffersons private secretary meriwether lewis and his friend william clark led the expedition.
its members included soldiers frontiersmen and an african american slave named york who worked for clark.
was hard going from the first day.
rowing upstream against the missouri rivers strong current left the explorers hands blistered and eir muscles sore.
mosquitoes feasted on their sunburned faces.
by summer the explorers had reached indian country.

as they moved up the missouri river rapids and waterfalls slowed their progress.
when they hauled their boats by land around these obstacles the thorns of the prickly pear cactus pierced their feet.
meanwhile grizzly bears raided their camps.
game became scarce.
by late summer the explorers could see the rocky mountains looming ahead.
to cross the mountains before the first snows of winter closed the high passes they would have to find horses and soon.
fortunately the expedition had reached the land of sacagawea s childhood.
one day a group of indians approached.
to sacagawea s great joy they proved to be shoshone.
learning that her brother was now a shoshone chief sacagawea persuaded him to provide the explorers with the horses they desperately needed.
ihe explorers made it over the rockies but they were more dead than alive.
the nez perce nehz pers an indian people living in the pacific northwest saved them from starvation.
a grateful lewis wrote in his journal that the nez perce are the most hospitable honest and sincere people that we have met with in our voyage as winter closed in the explorers reached their final destination the pacific ocean.
clark marked the event by carving on a tree william clark december 3rd 1805 by land from the u states the explorers legacy after a wet and hungry winter in oregon the explorers headed home.
in september 1806 two years and four months after setting out they returned to st louis.
lewis proudly wrote to jefferson in obedience to our orders we have penetrated the continent of north america to the pacific ocean lewis and clark had good reason to be proud.
they had not found the northwest passage for it did not exist.
but they had traveled some 8 000 miles.
they had mapped a route to the pacific.
they had established good relations with western indians.
most of all they had brought back priceless information about the west and its peoples.
other explorers added to this legacy and helped prepare the way for the settlement of the west.
in 1806 the same year lewis and clark returned to st louis 26 year old army lieutenant zebulon pike set out to explore the southern part of the new louisiana territory.
pike and his party traveled up the valley of the arkansas river into present day colorado.
there pike saw the mountain that today is called pikes peak.
pike went on to explore spanish territory along the rio grande and the red river.
his reports of the wealth of spanish towns brought many american traders to the southwest.
but pike was not impressed with the landscape.
he called the west the great american desert another famed explorer john c fremont helped to correct this image.
nicknamed the pathfinder fremont mapped much of the territory between the mississippi valley and the pacific ocean in the 1840s.
his glowing descriptions of a land of plenty inspired many families to try their luck in the west.
legacy a persons or a groups impact on future generations 7 zebulon pike s published reports of his expedition spurred american interest in the southwest.
part of his route would become the santa fe trail which was used by thousands of pioneers.
life in the west 299 the prosperity and pride of the californios is evident in this painting of a spanish landowner with his workers.
16 3 the californios if lewis and clark had turned south from oregon after reaching the pacific they would have found spains best kept secret a sun drenched land called california.
the california missions in 1769 a spanish missionary named junipero serra who nee peh ro sehr ra led soldiers and priests north from mexico to california.
serras goal was to convert the california indians to christianity.
to do this he established a chain of missions that eventually stretched from san diego to just north of san francisco.
each mission controlled a huge area of land as well as the indians who worked it.
rancho a land grant made by the mexican government used mostly for raising cattle and crops d xxxxooivfnaiicd meant wen me missions were aeaai to native californians.
indians were sometimes treated harshly am thousands died of diseases brought to california by the newcomers settlers followed the missionaries to california.
we were the p neers of the pacific coast wrote guadalupe vallejo building puel towns and missions while george washington was carrying on tl war of the revolution to reward soldiers and attract settlers the spanish began the practice of making large grants of land.
when mexico won its independence in 1821 california came under mexican rule.
in 1833 the mexican government closed the missions.
half of the mission land was supposed to go to indians.
mexico however established its own system of land grants in the southwest and gave most of californias mission lands to soldiers settlers.
the typical spanish speaking californian or californio w granted a rancho of 50 000 acres or more.
chapter 16 life on the ranchos life on the ranchos combined hard work and the occasional fiesta or social gathering.
most families lived in simple adobe houses with dirt floors.
the californios produced almost everything they needed at home.
indian servants did much of the work.
the ranchos were so huge that neighbors lived at least a days journey apart.
as a result strangers were always welcome for the news they brought of the outside world.
during weddings and fiestas californios celebrated with singing dancing and brilliant displays of horsemanship.
in the 1830s cattle ranching became californias most important industry.
cattle provided hides and tallow beef fat that could be traded for imported goods brought by ship.
among the goods that an american sailor named richard henry dana carried to california in his trading ship were teas coffee sugars spices raisins molasses hardware dishes tinware cutlery clothing jewelry and furniture.
because california was so far from the capital in mexico city the mexican government neglected the territory.
soldiers were not paid and they took what they needed to survive from the people they were supposed to protect.
officials sent to govern california were often unskilled and sometimes dishonest.
the californios legacy in 1846 the united states captured california as part of the war with mexico.
before long californios were a minority in california.
still the californios left a lasting mark.
california is full of spanish place names such as san diego los angeles and san francisco.
ihe californios also introduced many of californias famous crops such as grapes olives and citrus fruits.
most of all they opened california to the world and the world soon rushed in.
mountain men like the one pictured here were rugged individualists.
they often wore shirts and trousers made from animal hides and had hairthat hung to their shoulders.
16 4 the mountain men the lewis and clark expedition stimulated new interest in an old industry the fur trade.
inspired by the explorers reports of finding beaver in the rockies a spanish trader named manuel lisa followed their route west.
in 1807 lisa led 42 trappers up the missouri river.
the next year he took 350 trappers into the rockies.
for the next 30 years trappers crisscrossed the west in search of valuable furs.
the trapper s life the trappers who were also called mountain men lived hard and usually died young.
during the spring and fall they set their traps in icy streams.
in july they traveled to trading posts to swap furs for supplies or gathered for an annual rendezvous or get together.
the granger collection newyork life in the west 301 in their search for furs mountain men established new routes to oregon and california.
the rendezvous may have been fun but the trappers lives were filled with hazards.
fur thieves indians wolves and bears attacked them.
mountain man hugh glass was mauled by a mother bear that threw chunks of his flesh to her hungry cubs before friends rescued him.
accidents were common too.
a single misplaced step on a mountain or a misjudged river rapid often meant sudden death.
disease also took a heavy toll.
when one man asked for news about a party of trappers he learned that some had died by lingering diseases and others by the fatal rifle ball or arrow out of 116 men he wrote there were not more than sixteen alive i freedom and adventure trappers braved this dangerous way of life because of the freedom and adventure it offered.
a good example is jim beckwourth an african american from virginia who became a fur trapper and explorer.
while hunting beaver in the rockies beckwourth was captured by crow indians.
according to beckwourth an old woman identified him as her long lost son and he was adopted into the tribe.
what could i do he wrote later.
even if i should deny my crow origin they would not believe me beckwourth lived with the crow for six years and became a chief.
by the time he left the tribe in the 1830s the fur trade was in decline.
like other mountain men however beckwourth continued his adventurous life as an explorer army scout and trader.
in 1850 he discovered the lowest pass across the sierra nevada range known today as beckwourth pass.
the mountain men s legacy in their search for furs the mountain men explored most of the west.
the routes they pioneered across mountains and deserts became the oregon and california trails.
their trading posts turned into supply stations for settlers moving west along those trails.
a surprising number of mountain men left another kind of legacy personal journals.
their stories still have the power to make us laugh and cry and to wonder how they lived long enough to tell their tales.
w w wwiviiui ico ever since lewis and clark appeared among them the nez perce been friendly toward americans.
in 1831 three nez perce travele st louis to learn more about the white mans ways.
there the nt perce asked if someone would come west to teach their people thi secrets of the black book or bible.
chapter 16 several missionaries answered that call.
the best known were marcus and narcissa whitman and henry and eliza spalding.
in 1836 the two couples traveled west from st louis along the oregon trail.
it was a difficult journey.
narcissa described the rockies as the most terrible mountains for steepness still the missionaries arrived safely in oregon proving that women could endure the journey west.
oregon trail an overland route that stretched about 2 000 miles from independence missouri to the columbia river in oregon a difficult start on reaching oregon the group split up.
the spaldings went to work with the nez perce.
the whitmans worked among a neighboring group the cayuse.
neither couple knew very much about the people they hoped to convert.
the result was a difficult start.
after three years the spaldings finally made their first converts.
in 1839 henry baptized two nez perce chiefs.
a year later one of the chiefs had his infant son baptized as well.
the child would grow up to be the leader best known as chief joseph.
the whitmans were less successful.
the cayuse were far more interested in the whites weapons and tools than in their religion.
the couple also offended the cayuse.
they refused to pay for the land they took for their mission or to offer visitors gifts as was the indians custom.
not a single cayuse converted to the new faith.
a pioneer s paradise marcus whitman was far more successful at converting americans over to the belief that oregon was a pioneers paradise.
it does not concern me so much what is to become of any particular set of indians he wrote.
our greatest work is to aid the white settlement of this country and help to found its religious institutions in 1842 marcus traveled east on horseback.
along the way he urged americans to settle in oregon.
on his return he guided a large group of settlers along the oregon trail.
more settlers soon followed.
the poor indians are amazed at the overwhelming number of americans coming into the country observed narcissa.
they seem not to know what to make of it in 1847 measles came west with settlers and swept through the whitman mission.
marcus treated the sick as best he could.
the cayuse noticed that whites usually recovered while their own people were dying.
rumors spread that whitman was giving deadly pills to indians.
cayuse indians attacked the mission killing both marcus and narcissa.
in 1836 marcus and narcissa whitman married and set out for oregon to establish a mission.
here they are offering prayers for a safe journey.
life in the west 303 the missionaries legacy like the spanish priests in california american preachers in oregon hoped their legacy would be large numbers of christian indians.
in fact relatively few indians became christians.
adany however died of the diseases that came west with the missionaries.
the missionaries true legacy was to open the west to settlement.
in california oregon and other territories settlers followed in the footsteps of the missionaries.
16 6 the pioneer women women pioneers shared in the danger and the work of settling the west.
most of these women were wives and mothers but some were single women with motives of seeking homesteads husbands or other new opportunities.
pioneer women not only helped to shape the future of the west but also earned new status for themselves and for women throughout the united states.
although pioneer women had to travel 15 to 20 miles a day they were still expected to take care of household chores when the wagon train stopped for the night.
on the trail between 1840 and 1869 about 350 000 people traveled west in covered wagons.
most westward bound pioneers gathered each spring near independence missouri.
there they formed columns of wagons called wagon trains.
the journey west lasted four to six months and covered about 2 000 miles.
wagon space was so limited that pioneers were forced to leave most of the comforts of home behind.
when the way became steep they often had to toss out the few treasures they managed to bring.
the oregon trail was littered with furniture china books and other cherished objects.
women were expected to do the work they had done back home but while traveling 15 to 20 miles a day.
they cooked washed clothes and took care of the children.
meals on wheels were simple.
about the only change we have from bread and bacon wrote helen carpenter is to bacon and bread the daily drudgery wore many women down.
lavinia porter recalled i would make a brave effort to be cheerful and patient until the camp work was done.
then starting out ahead of the team and my men folks when i thought i had gone beyond hearing distance i would throw myself down on the unfriendly desert and give way like a child to sobs and tears trail hazards the death toll on the trail was high.
disease was the worst killer.
accidents were also common.
people drowned crossing rivers.
indian attacks were rare but the prospect of them added to the sense of danger.
chapter 16 by the end of the journey each woman had a story to tell.
some had seen buffalo stampedes and prairie fires on the great plains.
some had almost frozen to death in the mountains or died of thirst in the deserts.
but most survived to build new lives in the west.
one group of pioneer women african americans who had escaped from slave states or who were brought west by their owners faced a unique danger.
even though slavery was outlawed in most of the west bounty hunters were often able to track down fugitive slaves.
but for some african american women the move west brought freedom.
for example when biddy masons owner tried to take her from california a free state to texas mason sued for her freedom and won.
she moved to los angeles where she became a well known pioneer and community leader.
before setting out on the trail pioneers who were headed west met in the spring to form groups called wagon trains.
the pioneer women s legacy the journey west changed pioneer women.
the hardships of the trail brought out strengths and abilities they did not know they possessed.
i felt a secret joy declared one oregon pioneer in being able to have the power that sets things going.
women did set things going.
wherever they settled schools churches libraries literary societies and charitable groups soon blossomed.
annie bidwell for example left behind a remarkable legacy.
when annie married john bidwell she moved to his ranch in what is now the town of chico california.
there she taught sewing to local indian women and helped their children learn to read and write english.
annie convinced john to give up drinking he closed the tavern that had been part of his home and encouraged the building of chico s first church.
life in the west 305 mormons members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints founded by joseph smith in 1830 annie was active in other causes as well including the movement to give women a right that had long been denied them in the east the right to vote.
wyoming territory led the way by granting women the right to vote in 1869.
by 1900 a full 20 years before women across the nation would win the right to vote women were voting in four western states.
the freedom and sense of equality enjoyed by women in the west helped pave the way for more equal treatment of women throughout the united states.
this was perhaps the greatest legacy of the women pioneers.
16 7 the mormons in 1846 a wagon train of pioneers headed west in search of a new home.
looking down on the shining surface of great salt lake in what is now utah their leader brigham young declared this is the place it was not a promising spot.
one pioneer described the valley as a broad and barren plain blistering in the rays of the midsummer sun a woman wrote weak and weary as i am i would rather go a thousand miles further than remain but that was one of the valleys attractions.
no one else wanted the place that brigham young claimed for his followers the mormons.
a persecuted group the mormons were members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints.
joseph smith had founded this church in new york in 1830.
smith taught that he had received a sacred book the book of mormon from an angel.
he believed it was his task to create a community of believers who would serve god faithfully.
smiths followers lived in close communities working hard and sharing their goods.
yet wherever they settled first new york then ohio missouri and illinois their neighbors persecuted them.
many people were offended by the mormons teachings especially their acceptance of polygamy the practice of having more than one wife.
others resented the mormons rapidly growing power and wealth.
in 1844 resentment turned to violence when a mob in illinois killed joseph smith.
after smith s death brigham young took over as leader of the mormons.
young decided to move his community to utah.
there the mormons might be left alone to follow their faith in peace.
west to utah young turned out to be a practical as well as a religious leader.
prayer is good he said but when baked potatoes and pudding and milk are needed prayer will not supply their place young carefully planned every detail of the trek to utah.
the pioneers he led west stopped along the way to build shelters and plant crops for those who would follow.
even with all this planning the journey was difficult.
we soon thought it unusual wrote one mormon to leave a campground without burying one or more persons 06 chapter 16 when he arrived at great salt lake young laid out his first settlement salt lake city.
by the time he died in 1877 utah had 125 000 mormons living in 500 settlements.
to survive in this dry country mormons had to learn new ways to farm.
they built dams canals and irrigation ditches to carry precious water from mountain streams to their farms in the valley.
with this water they made the desert bloom.
the mormons legacy the mormons were the first americans to settle the great basin.
they pioneered the farming methods adopted by later settlers of this dry region.
they also helped settlers make their way west.
salt lake city quickly became an important stop for travelers in need of food and supplies.
to the mormons however their greatest legacy was the faith they planted so firmly in the utah desert.
from its center in salt lake city the mormon church has grown into a worldwide religion with more than 11 million members.
when mormons were unable to purchase wagons or oxen for the journey to utah they pulled their belongings in handcarts.
life in the west 307 forty niners the people who joined the rush for gold in california in 1849 16 8 the forty niners in 1848 a carpenter named james marshall was building a sawmill on the american river in northern california.
suddenly he spotted something shining in the water.
i reached my hand down and picked it up he wrote later.
it made my heart thump for i felt certain it was gold when word of marshalls discovery leaked out people across california dropped everything to race to the goldfields.
all were off to the mines wrote a minister some on horses some on carts and some on crutches the search for gold was difficult.
miners spent long days searching through the mud and stones of freezing streams for this precious metal.
the world rushes in by 1849 tens of thousands of gold seekers from around the world had joined the california gold rush.
about two thirds of these forty niners were americans.
the motive of fortune also brought settlers from mexico south america europe australia and even china.
the forty niners first challenge was simply getting to california.
from china and australia they had to brave the rough crossing of the pacific ocean.
from the east many traveled by ship to panama in central america crossed through dangerous jungles to the pacific side and boarded ships north to san francisco.
others made the difficult journey overland.
most forty niners were young and almost all were men.
when luzena wilson arrived in sacramento with her family a miner offered her 5 for her biscuits just to have bread made by a woman when she hesitated he doubled his offer.
women were scarce in those days she wrote.
i lived six months in sacramento and saw only two life in the mining camps wherever gold was spotted mining camps with names like mad mule gulch and you bet popped up overnight.
at coyote diggings luzena found a row of canvas tents a few months later there were two thousand men and the streets were lined with drinking saloons and gambling tables merchants made fortunes selling eggs for 6 a dozen and flour for 400 a barrel.
with no police to keep order the camps were rough places.
miners frequently fought over the boundaries of their claims and they took it on themselves to punish crimes.
in the short space of twenty four hours wrote louise clappe we have had murders fearful accidents bloody deaths a mob whippings a hanging an attempt at suicide and a fatal duel digging for gold was hard and tedious work.
the miners spent long days digging up mud dirt and stones while standing knee deep in icy streams.
all too soon the easy to find gold miners shoveled gravel into a narrow box called a sluice.
the water running through washed away the lighter particles and the gold remained.
the day for quick fortune making is over wrote a miner in 1851.
there are thousands of men now in california who would gladly go home if they had the money the forty niners legacy by 1852 the gold rush was over.
while it lasted about 250 000 people flooded into california.
for californias indians the legacy of this invasion was dreadful.
between 1848 and 1870 warfare and disease reduced their number from about 150 000 to just 30 000.
in addition many californios lost their land to the newcomers.
the forty niners also left a prosperous legacy.
by 1850 california had enough people to become the first state in the far west.
these new californians helped to transform the golden state into a diverse land of economic opportunity.
16 9 the chinese gam saan or gold mountain was what people in china called california in 1848.
to poor and hungry chinese peasants gam saan sounded like a paradise.
there they were told you will have great pay large houses and food and clothing of the finest description money is in great plenty by 1852 more than 20 000 chinese had ventured across the pacific to california.
that year one of every ten californians was chinese.
life in the west 309 thousands of chinese left their homeland and flocked to the california goldfields.
most failed to strike it rich.
however many settled in california s central valley where their knowledge of farming helped the area develop.
an uncertain welcome at first the chinese were welcomed.
lai chun chuen an early immigrant observed that they were received like guests and greeted with favor in 1852 the governor of california praised chinese immigrants as one of the most worthy classes of our newly adopted citizens as gold mining became more difficult however attitudes toward immigrants began to change.
a miner from chile complained the yankee regarded every man but an american as an interloper intruder who had no right to come to california and pick up the gold the chinese too came under attack.
american miners called on the government to drive foreigners out of the goldfields.
in 1852 the state legislature passed a law requiring foreign miners to pay a monthly fee for a license to mine.
as the tax collectors arrived in the camps most of the foreigners left.
one traveler saw them scattered along the roads in every direction life refugees fleeing an invading army.
nc viunese stay the chinese however paid the tax and staye on.
when the miners tax failed to drive off the chinese american tried to force them into leaving.
whites hacked off the long queues kyus or braids worn by chinese men.
they burned the shacks o chinese miners.
beatings followed burnings.
discouraged chinese immigrants left the mines to open restau rants laundries and stores in californias growing cities.
the eating houses in san francisco one miner wrote were those opcn by the chinese.
so many chinese settled in san francisco that loca newspapers called their neighborhood chinatown.
today san fran ciscos chinatown remains the oldest and largest chinese conunufl in the united states.
310 er 16 other chinese put their farming skills to work in californias fertile central valley.
they drained swamps and dug irrigation ditches to water arid fields.
in time they would help transform california into americas fruit basket and salad bowl.
the legacy of the chinese immigrants most of the chinese who came to california in search of gold hoped to return to china as rich men.
a few did just that.
most however stayed on in the united states.
despite continued prejudice against them their hard work energy and skills greatly benefited california and other western states.
in mining farming in factories and in the labor generally of california observed a writer in 1876 the employment of the chinese has been found most desirable the chinese not only helped to build the west but they also made it a more interesting place to live.
wherever they settled chinese immigrants brought with them the arts tastes scents and sounds of one of the worlds oldest and richest cultures.
chapter summary in this chapter you learned about the people who settled the west in the 1800s.
the explorers explorers meriwether lewis and william clark went west to find the northwest passage and to establish friendly relations with native people.
the expedition helped prepare the way for future settlement.
the californios in california spanish speaking settlers followed in the footsteps of missionaries.
the californios way of life centered on the rancho and the raising of cattle.
the mountain men valuable beaver furs and a life of freedom and adventure attracted fur trappers to the west.
many of these hardy mountain men stayed on as scouts guides and traders.
the missionaries people traveled to oregon and other western territories in hopes of converting indians to christianity.
although they made few converts the missionaries attracted other settlers to the west.
the pioneer women many women pioneers sought new opportunities in the west.
besides working to establish homes and farms women often brought education and culture to new settlements.
the mormons mormon pioneers traveled to utah in search of religious freedom.
they built cities and towns and introduced new methods of farming to the dry plains.
the forty niners gold seekers from all over the world rushed to california in 1849.
few became rich but many stayed to help build the new state s economy.
the chinese the gold rush attracted thousands of chinese immigrants to california.
although they often had to fight prejudice most of them remained in the united states working as laborers and starting new businesses and farms.
life in the west 311 reading further much of california s gold was mined from streams and rivers.
but the mining was not easy or pleasant work as this painting seems to show and miners were not all white men.
gold rush pioneers during the gold rush of 1849 thousands of fortune seekers flocked to california.
most of them were white american men but not all.
women african americans californios and people from around the world also caught gold fever.
they all dreamed of riches and a better life.
what they found in california rarely lived up to their dreams.
but through hard work they helped build a new state.
luzena wilson and her husband mason were living on a farm in missouri when they heard about the discovery of gold in california.
the gold excitement spread like wildfire even out to our log cabin in the prairie she later recalled.
as we had almost nothing to lose and we might gain a fortune we early caught the fever.
my husband grew enthusiastic and wanted to start immediately but i would not be left behind.
i thought where he could go i could and where i went i could take my two little toddling babies.
i little realized then the task i had undertaken.
if i had i think i should still be in my log cabin in missouri.
but it sounded like such a small task to go out to california and once there fortune of course would come to us.
i the wilsons packed up their wagon and traveled overland to sacramento california arriving in september 1849.
there they sold their oxen and bought a share in a hotel business.
with luzena as cook and manager they soon prospered.
but over the next few years their fortunes would rise and fall and rise again.
after a few months a severe flood swamped sacramento and wiped out the wilsonss business.
they decided to move to the mining town of nevada city and start again.
the town was rich from gold strikes.
everybody had money and everybody spent it luzena recalled.
money ran through ones fingers like water through a sieve.
she started cooking meals for miners and they soon opened another hotel the el dorado.
before long their business was booming.
in march 1851 disaster struck.
a fire raged through nevada city and burned much of the town including the el dorado.
once again the wilsons lost nearly everything.
they were still determined to succeed however.
they moved to a valley west of sacramento.
there they farmed hay for livestock and started another hotel.
they prospered again and this time their fortune lasted.
their business was on the road from sacramento to san francisco.
other settlers came and put down roots.
before long the town of vacaville was born j luzena wilson and her husband remained there for the rest of their lives.
they had not struck it rich but they had built a life in california 12 chapter 16 an irish immigrant s story thomas kerr also found life in california a challenge.
unlike the wilsons he never enjoyed much success.
in fact he never even made it to the gold country.
kerr left his native ireland during the great famine of 1845 1850.
a disease had destroyed the irish potato crop causing hunger hardship and death.
along with many other irish kerr decided to try his luck in america.
he said goodbye to his wife and child and sailed to san francisco arriving in march 1850.
kerr tried to earn money to pay his passage to the goldfields.
but work was hard to find in san francisco and costs were high.
he eventually got a job building a house near sacramento.
that was as close as he would get to the gold country.
the job paid very little.
in addition the work was hard and the conditions were tough.
kerr wrote in his journal god knows any money a man earns in calafornia its dearly won for he deprives himself of all the comforts in addition to being burned up with a scurching sun.
and eaten alive by muskeatoes mosquitoes kerr returned to san francisco where his wife and child joined him in 1852.
he continued to get odd jobs ending up in the grocery business.
but he never made the fortune he imagined.
people may talk about the gold of calafornia he wrote but its very difficult to obtain it women were rare in gold rush towns and even rarer in the goldfields.
some cooked meals and washed clothes for miners.
in return the miners paid them well and treated them with respect.
a chilean migrant s tale many other foreigners also came to california hoping to strike it rich among these immigrants were approximately 7 000 chileans.
many had already worked as miners in chile.
one of these men was vicente perez rosales.
perez came from a wealthy landowning family that had lost its fortune in the 1820s.
he had tried his hand at various jobs since then including gold mining and cattle ranching with little success.
then he learned of the gold strikes in california.
late in 1848 he left chile with several partners on a ship bound for san francisco.
perez was not confident that his group would find gold but he did believe they could profit from the gold rush.
we felt sure only a lazy man could fail to make money he wrote in his journal and we were willing to work hard.
but little did we know what we faced perez and his party soon headed for the gold country.
they worked at various gold diggings and had some success but not enough to justify their efforts.
there was plenty of gold perez wrote but not enough for all the men in california looking for it competition for gold claims was fierce and violence often broke out.
much of this violence was directed at foreign miners particularly mexicans chileans and chinese.
eventually perez and his party fled the goldfields.
seeking another way to earn a living they set up a stand on a street in sacramento and sold such goods as cheese peaches and beef jerky.
but an epidemic of disease struck the city and once again they had to flee.
perez recalled almost overnight the gold rush changed san francisco from a sleepy village into a bustling city.
money flowed freely to those who were skilled at running businesses.
banking trade and investment flourished.
we had been miners and had failed at that.
then we had become merchants and that too as they say came tumbling down.
we had begun to think that with our luck if we started a hat factory we could expect men would be born without heads.
vicente perez rosales diary of a journey to california 1848 1849 after that perez started a restaurant in san francisco.
but after initial success that failed too.
he and his partners had already decided to return to chile in late 1850 when a fire broke out in san francisco and burned down their building.
they barely escaped with their lives.
two months later they were back in chile.
a black forty niner s success although the gold rush did not pan out for many forty niners some did find gold and achieve their dreams.
this was the case for hundreds of enslaved african americans who came west to work in the goldfields and managed to win their freedom.
among these black miners alvin coffey stands out as a particular success.
in april 1849 he set out from missouri with his owner dr bassett who put him to work digging for gold.
in his memoirs coffey recalled we dug and dug to the first of november.
at night it commenced raining and rained and snowed pretty much all the winter.
we had a tent but it barely kept us all dry by the next year coffey had dug up 5 000 in gold.
bassett kept the money and took coffey back to missouri where he sold him to another man.
the new owner was kinder however.
he agreed to let coffey buy his way to freedom.
in 1854 coffey returned to california and earned 7 000 in the goldfields enough to free himself and his family.
coffey settled down in northern california and became a prosperous farmer.
his children and grandchildren prospered too.
for alvin coffey the gold rush had lived up to its promise.
the results for california the gold rush also brought statehood to california.
vicente perez rosales was there to witness the election of the new california legislature.
he saw parades campaign speeches and even fistfights between rival candidates.
overall though he was impressed by the peaceful nature of the election.
there was no pistol shooting he recalled.
arms on that day were silent and he went on how different it all was from the way these things are handled in other countries.
not only that but once the election was over all the voters accepted the man elected.
they dropped the private preferences to hail the majority s choice and showed as much enthusiasm as if they had contributed to his triumph themselves.
the gold rush had helped lay the foundation for californias political and economic future.
and it appeared in 1850 that that future would be very bright indeed.
by 1852 when this photograph was taken more than 2 000 african americans were living in california.
most lived and worked in the goldfields.
even today california s gold rush history is an important part of the state s image.
the state s motto eureka a greek word meaning i have found it reflects the excitement of the successful miners.

chapter 17 mexicano contributions to the southwest how have mexicano contributions influenced life in the united states.
a rs a this mexicano family is shown in front of their adobe home in 1887.
17 1 introduction the texas war for independence and the mexican american war in the 1840s had a lasting effect on the people of the southwest.
spanish speaking people had made their homes in the region since the days of the conquistadors in the 1500s.
by 1848 from 80 000 to 100 000 mexicanos or mexican citizens lived in the territories given up by mexico in the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo.
most of these people remained in the southwest and became u s citizens.
the treaty with mexico promised mexican americans full citizenship rights the right to keep their property and the right to use their language.
these promises were not kept.
armed with the belief that they were a superior people white settlers pushed mexicanos off their land.
whites also made it illegal for mexicano children to speak spanish in schools.
they found ways to keep mexicanos from exercising their right to vote.
mexicanos protested each of these assaults on their rights.
but the government did little to protect them.
before long mexican americans found themselves in the words of one historian foreigners in their native land the problems of prejudice poverty and lack of political power persisted well into the 20th century.
despite much progress many of these problems are still with us today.
yet mexican americans also had a deep influence on their new country.
even though most white settlers had little respect for mexican americans they freely borrowed much that was useful from them.
spanish words and mexican foods laws technology and architecture all became a lasting part of the southwest culture.
in this chapter you will learn about many contributions mexicanos made to american life.
the del valles one of california s leading mexican american families posed forthis portrait in the late 1880s.
mexicano contributions to the southwest 317 i i 17 2 mining mining in the west developed in three waves gold silver and copper.
each wave depended on the contribution of mexican miners.
mexicanos came to the southwest with a rich mining tradition.
they knew where to look for precious metals and how to get them out of the ground.
gold mining the americans who rushed to california in 1849 had many skills.
but they knew nothing about mining.
mexicanos introduced them to the batea bah tay ah or gold pan.
miners scooped up mud from streambeds with the ti this is an arrastra or grinding mill.
a horse moved a round stone to crush gold bearing rocks from which miners could then remove the precious metal.
then they swished it around to wash away the lightweight sand the heavier flakes of gold sank to the bottom of the pan.
mexicanos also brought the riffle box to the goldfields.
the bottom of this long box was crossed with pieces of wood called riffles.
as mud washed through the box the heavy gold sank and was trapped behind the riffles.
the riffle box was used extensively by both american and chinese miners.
before long miners discovered that the gold they were picking up in streams came from veins of quartz rock in the sierra nevada.
quartz mining was a mystery to americans but it was familiar to mexicanos.
mexicanos taught other miners how to dig the quartz out of mountains.
they also showed miners how to use a simple arrastra ar ras trah or grinding mill to crush the rock so they could easily remove the gold.
mexicanos spanish speaking people who in the 1800s lived in parts of the united states that previously belonged to mexico silver and copper mining a mexicano miner sparked the wests first big silver strike.
in 1859 a prospector named henry comstock was looking for gold in nevada.
much to his annoyance his gold was mixe with a lot of worthless blue stuff one day a mexicano miner loote at the blue stuff and started shouting mucha plata.
mucha pl a much silver in its first 20 years the comstock lode yielded over 300 million in silver and gold.
mexicanos discovered copper in the southwest in the early 1800s.
when americans began to mine copper in arizona they turned to m ican miners for help.
by 1940 arizona mines had produced 3 bilhn worth of copper copper that carried electricity and telephone calls10 millions of homes across america.
318 chapter 17 17 3 cattle ranching cattle ranching in the west was built on traditions brought north from mexico.
spanish colonists imported the first cattle to the americas.
the animals adapted well to the dry conditions of mexico and the american southwest.
in time millions of spanish cattle ran wild in texas and california.
spanish cattle were thin wiry creatures with long wide spreading horns.
they moved quickly and were dangerous.
californios mexicanos in california often found themselves dodging behind trees or diving into ditches to escape the charge of an angry longhorn.
with cattle so abundant californios and tejanos found ranching to be a good business.
so did the americans who learned the cattle business from mexican rancheros or ranchers.
the rancho western cattle ranching was nothing like dairy farming in the east.
eastern dairy farms were small family businesses that produced mostly milk butter and cheese.
by comparison western ranchos were huge.
in the arid southwest large grants of land were needed to provide enough food and water for cattle herds.
instead of dairy products the main products of ranchos were meat hides and tallow fat.
ranch life followed traditions that had been developed in spain and perfected in mexico.
rancheros spent most of their day on horseback overseeing their land and herds.
caring for the cattle was the work of hired vaqueros vah kair ohs or cowboys.
the roundup among the vaqueros most important jobs were the rodeo or roundup and branding.
branding or using a hot iron to burn a mark into the hide of cattle was essential because herds belonging to different owners mixed together on unfenced grasslands.
to avoid conflicts every owner had to mark his cattle with a distinctive brand.
during the rodeo vaqueros drove unbranded calves to a roundup area.
there the calves were branded with the brand their mothers bore.
as americans took up ranching they adopted the rancheros practice of branding cattle.
along with cowboys and the roundup cattle brands are still part of ranch life in the west.
during the rodeo vaqueros drove unmarked cattle to special roundup areas.
there the animals were branded with a rancho s distinctive identification mark.
branding was necessary because cattle belonging to different owners grazed on the same land.
the vaquero s sombrero shaded him from the sun.
his neckerchief when worn over his mouth protected him from dust.
his high heeled pointed boots kept him secure in the stirrups of his saddle.
17 4 the cowboy hollywood movies make it seem that nothing is more american than the western cowboy.
cowboys however learned their job from the mexican vaquero.
across the southwest vaqueros were admired for their skill at riding roping and handling cattle.
american cowboys adopted the vaqueros clothes and gear as well as much of their language.
cowboy clothes and gear from head to toe cowboys dressed in clothing borrowed from the vaqueros.
for example the cowboys ten gallon hats which shaded their eyes and sometimes served as a water pail or a pillow came from the vaqueros wide brimmed sombreros sohm brer ohs.
the leather chaps that protected the cowboyslegs from cacti and sagebrush were modeled on the vaqueros chaparreras chap ar rehr ahs.
the high heeled pointed toe boots that slipped so easily into the cowboys stirrups were based on the vaqueros botas bo tas.
even the poncho that protected cowboys from cold and rain was borrowed from the vaqueros.
mexicanos also invented the western or cowboy saddle with its useful horn.
the saddles brought to america from europe did not have horns.
when a vaquero on a european saddle roped a steer he had to tie his rope to the horses tail to keep it anchored.
this method was hard on both the horse and the rider.
by adding a horn to the saddle vaqueros made their job easier and their horses job as well.
cowboys borrowed another essential piece of gear from the vaqueros la riata la ree ah tah or the lariat.
vaqueros were masters of the art of throwing a 60 foot rope great distances with amazing accuracy.
this skill was especially useful for roping calves during a roundup.
in a remarkable display of roping skill a vaquero named jose romero once roped a full grown eagle right out of the sky.
cowboy lingo american cowboys borrowed or adapted many ranching words from the vaqueros as well.
the terms bronco stampede corral lasso burro buckaroo and vamoose all come from spanish mexican words.
so do mesa canyon mesquite chaparral and other terms used to describe the southwestern landscape.
the cowboy slang word for jail hoosegow came from the spanish juzgado hooz ga doh.
and of course the terms ranch and rancher came from rancho and ranchero.
320 chapter 17 17 5 sheep raising in new mexico the most important industry was sheep raising.
from the founding of the territory up to the mexican cession sheep fed clothed and supported spanish and mexican settlers.
the spanish brought a long tradition of sheep raising to the americas.
two kinds of sheep were raised in spain the merinos meh ree nohs with their fine wool and the churros chur rohs with their coarse wool.
the spanish brought the scrawny churro to new mexico and for good reason.
this tough little sheep knew how to survive in a dry environment like that of the southwest.
the spanish sheep raising system when americans came to new mexico they did not think of sheep raising as a business.
in the east a farmer might raise a few sheep as a sideline but not large herds.
once they saw the spanish sheep raising system in new mexico however some americans changed their minds.
under the spanish system sheep raising was a large and well organized business.
the spanish governor of new mexico for example once owned 2 million sheep and employed 2 700 workers.
at the top of this business stood the patron pah trohn or owner of the herds.
below him were several layers of managers.
these supervisors and range bosses spent their days on horseback checking range conditions and the health of the sheep.
the lowest level worker was the pastor pahs tohr or herder.
each pastor was responsible for 1 500 to 2 000 sheep.
a pastor stayed with his flock night and day slowly guiding it from place to place so that the sheep could graze as they moved.
during spring lambing season the pastor assisted with difficult births cared for orphaned lambs and helped the newborns survive.
one pastor described this busy time as a month long hell of worry and toil americans adopt the spanish system americans soon adopted the spanish system as their own.
large scale sheep raising spread from new mexico across the southwest.
in california the churro was crossed with the merino to produce a sheep with far better wool.
as a result between 1862 and 1880 u s wool production soared from 5 million to 22 million pounds a year.
sheep raising was the most important industry in new mexico when the territory belonged to mexico.
an owner of a sheep ranch might have over a million sheep.
mexicano contributions to the southwest 321 the mexicanos introduced a system of irrigation that allowed settlers in the southwest to turn deserts into productive fertile fields.
irrigation a system for bringing water to farmland by artificial means such as using a dam to trap water and ditches to channel it to fields 17 6 irrigated farming americans coming to the southwest knew as little about irrigated farming as they did about mining cattle ranching and sheep raising.
in the east enough rain fell year round to water a farmers crops.
irrigation was unnecessary and unknown.
but in the southwest where six months could go by with no rain irrigation was essential.
mexicano settlers in the southwest brought with them irrigation techniques that had been developed centuries earlier in spain and north africa.
they borrowed other techniques from the pueblo indians of new mexico.
when the settlers first arrived the pueblos were irrigating from 15 000 to 25 000 acres of cropland in the arid rio grande valley.
the mexican system of irrigation bringing water to fields involved an enormous amount of work.
first farmers had to redirect water from local streams to their fields.
they began by building a dam of rocks earth and brush across the stream.
the water that backed up behind the dam was brought to the fields by irrigation ditches.
to keep from wasting this precious water mexicanos carefully leveled their fields.
then they divided the fields into squares.
each square was marked off by a wall of earth high enough to hold in water.
when one square had been soaked with water farmers made a hole in its wall.
the water then flowed to the next square.
the farmers continued in this way until the entire field was soaked.
this method of irrigation was known as the mexican system.
w k uaoivei using crops introduced by mexicano the mexican system of irrigation american settlers turned the so west into americas fruit basket among the many fruits brougl mexicanos to the southwest were grapes dates olives apples wal pears plums peaches apricots and quinces.
mexicano settlers brought the first citrus fruits lemons limes and oranges to the gion.
many of these fruits were unknown in the east where the cli was too cold for them to grow.
but they thrived in sunny arizona 3 california.
with the help of mexicano farmworkers american transformed dry deserts into irrigated fruit orchards and citrus grc 322 er 17 xj l food in 1835 william heath davis became one of the first americans to settle in california.
there he got his first taste of mexican food.
davis later wrote of the californios their tables were frugally simply furnished the food clean and inviting consisting mainly of good beef broiled on an iron rod or steaks with onions also mutton sheep chicken eggs.
the bread was tortillas sometimes made with yeast.
beans were a staple dish.
their meat stews were excellent when not too highly seasoned with red pepper.
davis may not have known it but the food he was enjoying in california brought together the best of two worlds.
a food revolution the spanish conquest of mexico in 1521 began one of the great food revolutions in history.
the spanish came to mexico in search of gold but the greatest treasures they found were indian foods unknown in europe.
these foods included corn tomatoes chocolate peanuts vanilla beans squash avocados coconuts sunflower seeds and chili peppers.
the spanish shipped these new foods back to spain.
from there they spread throughout europe greatly expanding peoples food choices.
in turn the spanish brought the foods of europe to mexico.
they introduced meats such as pork beef lamb chicken and goat.
they brought nuts and grains such as almonds walnuts rice wheat and barley.
they planted fruits and vegetables such as apples oranges grapes olives lettuce carrots sugarcane and potatoes which they discovered in peru.
and they introduced herbs and spices such as cinnamon parsley coriander oregano and black pepper.
corn a food of the native indians was a staple in the mexicano diet.
here a mexicano woman is grinding corn that she will use to make a flat corn bread called tortillas.
a new style of cooking mexican cooks combined these foods of diverse origins to create a rich and flavorful style of cooking that was neither indian nor spanish.
it was distinctly mexican.
as americans settled the southwest they were introduced to mexican food.
many of them liked the new tastes and they borrowed recipes from mexicano cooks.
in texas the mingling of mexican and american dishes resulted in a style of cooking known as tex mex.
across america a spicy stew of beef and beans known simply as chili became as american as apple pie.
mexicano contributions to the southwest 323 17 8 architecture throughout the southwest the mexicano contribution to architecture is easy to see.
many buildings can be found with the thick walls red tile roofs rounded arches and courtyards that are typical of spanish architecture.
spanish style architecture took root in mexico during the colonial period.
mexican settlers brought their knowledge of this tradition to the southwest.
their missions homes and other structures were simple and attractive.
they were ideally suited to the hot dry climate of the southwest.
rounded arches thick walls and adobe buildings since wood was scarce in the southwest mexica red tile roofs are characteristics of nos used adobe ah doh beh bricks as their main building material.
spanish style architecture.
adobe is a mixture of earth grass and water that is shaped into bricks and baked in the sun.
mexicanos covered their adobe homes with colorful red clay tiles.
besides being attractive and fireproof a tile roof kept the adobe walls from being washed away during heavy rains.
many adobe buildings featured patios and verandas.
a patio is a roofless inner courtyard often located at the center of a home.
a veranda is a roofed porch or balcony extending along the outside of a building.
patios and verandas allowed mexicanos to spend much of their time outdoors while still protected from the hot sun and dry desert winds.
newcomers adopt the spanish style americans moving to the southwest quickly saw the advantages of building with adobe.
because of their thick walls adobe structures stayed cooler in summer and warmer in winter than the wood buildings that americans from the east were used to.
adobe structures could also be easily constructed from locally available materials.
american settlers used adobe to build not only homes but also courthouses trading posts post offices and other buildings.
later builders adapted spanish architecture to new materials such as concrete and stucco.
by the 1930s nearly a million spanish style homes had been built in california.
who would live in a structure of wood and brick if they could get a palace of mud wrote an admiring easterner.
the adobes make the most picturesque and comfortable homes and harmonize with the whole nature of the landscape chapter 17 17 9 laws the mexicanos of the southwest were used to being governed by mexican laws.
these laws often differed from american laws.
for example mexico had outlawed slavery in 1829.
slaves from the american south sometimes ran away to find freedom in mexican settlements.
recall that mexicos abolition of slavery was one of the issues that led texans to fight for their independence from mexico.
in time both mexican and american legal traditions would shape laws in the west.
particularly important were mexicano laws governing mining water and community property.
mining law before the discovery of gold in california there was so little mining in the united states that americans had no mining law.
once in the goldfields the forty niners desperately needed rules to keep order.
with the help of mexicano miners americans developed a law of the mines based on mexican mining law.
california miners later carried this law of the mines to other parts of the southwest.
water law the water law brought west by americans worked well enough in the east where rainfall was abundant.
under american law water flowing across a field or farm belonged to the owner of that land.
landowners could use their water in whatever ways they wanted this principle did not work well in the west where water was scarce and precious.
disputes over who controlled streams led to endless legal conflicts and even water wars.
to end these conflicts settlers wrote new laws based on mexican pueblo law pueblo law said that water was too valuable to be owned or controlled by any one person.
instead water belonged to an entire community and should be used for the benefit of all.
community property law for women the most important legal principle borrowed from mexican law was the idea of community property.
in eastern states married women had few property rights.
any property acquired by a married couple such as a home farm r business belonged solely to the husband.
in contrast mexican law said that all property acquired during a marriage was community property.
if a couple separated half of that property belonged to the wife half to the husband.
american settlers liked the idea of sharing the gains of marriage between husband and wife.
today texas california new mexico arizona idaho nevada washington wisconsin and louisiana are all community property states.
this couple is performing the fandango.
during this popular mexican dance the man and woman play castanets which are small pieces of wood held in the palm of the hand and clicked together.
17 10 entertainment the californios observed william heath davis were about the happiest and most contented people i ever saw californios worked hard.
but they also knew how to entertain themselves with music dance and fiestas celebrations.
americans settling the southwest shared in these entertainments.
music and dancing mexicano music greatly influenced country and western music in the southwest.
the most important contribution was the corrido kor ree doh or folk ballad.
a corrido is a dramatic story sung to the accompaniment of guitars.
the subjects of corridos ranged from exciting tales of heroes and bandits to sad songs of love and betrayal.
american settlers admired the color and energy of traditional mexicano dance.
dancing was an important part of any mexicano fiesta.
favorite dances included the jota hoh tah the fandango and la bamba.
the last of these the bamba was danced by a young woman balancing a full glass of water on her head.
generations of schoolchildren learned another popular dance the jarabe tapatio hah rah beh tah pah tee oh or mexican hat dance as part of their southwestern cultural heritage.
326 er 17 i fiestas and rodeos throughout the year mexicanos held a variety of religious fiestas.
one of the most important honored our lady of guadalupe the patron saint of mexico.
in san antonio texas tejanos marked this day december 12 with an elaborate procession to the cathedral.
after attending church services the tejanos danced all night long in their homes.
today the most widely celebrated mexicano holiday is el cinco de mayo el seen koh day my oh which means the fifth of may.
this holiday commemorates an important victory in mexicos fight for independence from french rule in 1862.
cinco de mayo fiestas bring together mexican and non mexican americans to enjoy mexicano music dance and food.
for millions of americans rodeo is an exciting professional sport.
rodeos roots go back to cattle roundups on mexicano ranchos.
during these get togethers mexicano cowboys competed with each other in events such as calf roping bull riding and bronco busting.
american cowboys joined in these contests and soon rodeos became annual events in western cities.
to its many fans the rodeo with its mixed mexicano and american heritage represents the best of the west.
chapter summary in this chapter you learned about mexicano contributions to the southwest and how they have influenced life in the united states.
mining mexicano knowledge skills and techniques advanced the development of mining in the southwest.
these contributions helped build the gold silver and copper mining industries.
cattle cowboys and sheep american settlers learned about cattle ranching cowboy life and sheep raising from mexicanos.
they adopted mexicano traditions for raising cattle and sheep.
the american cowboys language was enriched by spanish mexican words like burro rodeo and lasso.
farming and food white settlers in the southwest adopted irrigation techniques that had been pioneered by mexicanos and pueblo indians.
they also learned to appreciate mexicano food.
architecture laws and entertainment today mexicano culture survives in such american adaptations as spanish style homes and buildings as well as legal traditions regarding mining water and community property.
millions of americans enjoy music dances festivals and rodeos that come from mexicano traditions.
mexicano contributions to the southwest 327 reading further these murals in el paso texas show pride in the mixing of cultures in this city which is on the border between the united states and mexico.
murals tell stories of mexican american lives.
this panel from the great wall of los angeles shows a woman protesting being evicted from her neighborhood to make way for a new stadium.
mexicano culture today just as mexicanos influenced life in the united states in the 1800s they influence american life today.
in the arts mexicanos create beauty as they tell their stories.
through performances and festivals they share their cultural heritage.
the mural called the great wall of los angeles is half a mile long.
it is painted on a concrete wall.
in lively pictures it tells californias history.
images at one end show people who lived in the area long long ago.
images at the other end show los angeles life in the 1950s.
judith baca a mexican american artist designed the wall.
neighborhood kids and teenagers painted it.
baca the director of the social and public art resource center in venice california said when i first saw the blank wall i envisioned a long narrative of another history of california one which included ethnic peoples women and minorities.
the discovery of the history of california s multi cultured peoples was a revelation to me as well as to the members of my teams.
one panel for example shows a scene from the chavez ravine neighborhood of los angeles.
in the late 1950s the city evicted the areas residents.
the city government wanted to use the space to build dodger stadium.
but at least one resident refused to leave.
the mural shows a police officer taking away aurora archega.
she wears a red dress and clenches her fist.
dodger stadium looms behind her.
this story and others reveal a past that many people do not know about.
it is a past that means a lot to the local residents.
the process of making the great wall has been as important to the local mexicano community as the walls content.
between 1974 and 1983 more than 400 young people have contributed to the wall.
they were joined by many artists and historians.
the wall has truly been a community effort.
murals showcase community mural making became important in mexico about 100 years ago.
murals there taught history to people who could not read.
as mexicans immigrated to the united states they brought the muralmaking tradition with them.
murals by mexican americans now adorn walls in cities beyond los angeles and states beyond california.
they are part of american culture and they are different from the art seen in museums.
for one thing they are in public places where everyone can view them without paying an entry fee or even entering a building.
for another it is not just where they are shown that makes them unique.
it is how they are made.
many are made by teams of people rather than by individual artists.
while each mexicano mural is unique many express a neighborhoods identity.
take the tattoo mural for example.
this mosaic is on a wall on 29th street in south tucson arizona.
it is called the tattoo mural because mexican american body art inspired many of its images.
this mural was meant to honor everything that happens in south tucson said alex garza one of the lead muralists for the project.
that is why the mural overflows with imagery that is meaningful to the people of south tucson.
community members themselves produce many murals.
as with the great wall of los angeles young neighborhood residents made the tattoo mural.
garza and lupe ruiz oversaw the murals production.
the project was part of las artes a youth development program.
the muralists finished high school while they worked at las artes.
murals serve many purposes.
they beautify urban neighborhoods.
they tell stories that have not been told.
they express community pride and they provide meaningful work for young people who need it.
any way you look at it the murals are a success story.
the images in south tucson s tattoo mural reflect what is important to the neighborhood s residents.
using tattoo images is part of the community connection.
tattoos go back generations explained alex garza one of the project s leaders.
mexicano theater the time 1965.
the place the back of a flatbed truck in the bean fields of californias central valley.
on this day the back of the truck serves as a stage.
amateur actors perform plays for mexicano farmworkers.
based on the farmworkers lives the plays tell stories that are familiar 1 the audience.
in fact the actors are farmworkers themselves.

ar rlr tv haul mom w wasmtnotbn hhkk fiomissiom sy oonapom w 4 pawa patmoms w luis valdez founder of el teatro cam pesino believes that art enables people to understand each other.
ultimately it is artistry that cuts across the barriers to understanding he said.
from the plays of the 1960s above to performances on college campuses today below etc brings valdez s philosophy to life.
for years farmworkers had labored in california s fields for long hours and low pay.
in 1965 they formed a union the united farm workers ufw to organize for their rights.
the theater in the bean fields was a way to tell the workers stories.
the actos or plays helped articulate the workers concerns.
the plays became an important part of the political work the ufw was doing.
the theater in the fields was called el teatro campesino the farmworkers theater and it still exists today.
its performances do not take place in the bean fields any more.
now el teatro campesino etc has its own theater in a former packing plant in san juan bautista california.
and it is no longer part of the union.
now it is an independent theater company.
but it still tells the stories of the lives of mexicanos.
it still gives voice to their concerns.
el teatro campesino has always had a two part mission.
luis valdez the groups founder and artistic director explained it this way until we had the artists who could express what the people farmworkers were feeling and saying we wouldn t really register politically.
art gives us the tools of that expression.
today etc has spread far beyond the bean fields.
the group has performed around the united states latin america and europe.
luis valdez has also brought stories about mexicanos to much larger audiences.
zoot suit his historically based play about a fight for justice in 1940s los angeles became a broadway show in 1979.
it was made into a movie in 1982.
el teatro campesino sparked a mexicano theater movement.
theater companies formed across the southwest and in other parts of the country.
like etc they showcase mexicano talent and tell mexicano stories.
0 charro days and ballet folklorico mexicano culture is murals and theater but it is a lot more too.
you can see the influence of mexicano culture in many parts of american life today.
once a year for example people gather on both sides of the border that separates the united states and mexico to celebrate charro days.
street parties abound.
there is food music and dancing costumes and of course the charros char rohs.
charros are gentleman cowboys who are known for their brightly colored clothes and wide sombreros.
they came from spain to mexico hundreds of years ago.
over time they moved into the southwestern united states.
today although there are few working cowboys left people on both sides of the border celebrate the charros.
brownsville texas and matamoros mexico two cities connected by international bridges hold joint charro day celebrations every year.
i believe this is the only parade that starts in one country and ends in another says charro days president john patriarca.
you can also see mexicano influence in the traditional dances called ballet folklorico bahl lay fohk lohr ee koh.
the women wear flowing skirts in splashy colors with ruffled blouses.
the men wear black pants waist length jackets and wide brimmed hats.
ballet folklorico is not one specific dance or even one specific kind of dance.
rather the term refers to a lot of different dances.
some came from native people.
others came from the spanish who ruled mexico for hundreds of years.
still others celebrate mexican independence.
what the dances have in common is that they express the diversity of mexican life and mexican american life.
ballet folklorico troupes have sprung up across the united states with many in areas where there is a large mexicano population.
the dance companies help audiences appreciate the heritage that mexican immigrants brought with them to the united states.
through the arts mexicanos have celebrated their culture and told their stories.
their efforts have inspired pride among mexicanos and encouraged greater understanding of mexicanos among other americans.
iheir art has also made mexicano culture a vibrant part f american culture.
ballet folklorico draws on the traditions of the many ethnic groups that make up mexico.
the ballet folklorico de mexico performs traditional dances around the world.

an expanding nation americans in the mid 1800s in 1787 in order to form a more perfect union a group of political leaders wrote the constitution of the united states.
some 50 years later however some people believed that the union was still far from perfect.
most of them were not political leaders.
instead they were everyday americans men and women black and white ministers and teachers.
from the 1830s through the 1850s these reformers tried to improve american society in many ways.
some of their efforts met with great resistance.
one of the most controversial issues was the struggle to end slavery.
many northerners as well as many white southerners thought slavery was morally wrong.
however the south s economy depended on slave labor.
over time that dependence grew.
the constitution banned the importation of slaves starting in 1808.
yet as white southerners moved westward the demand for slave labor increased.
this demand was met by the natural growth of slave populations in older parts of the south.
slaveholders in these areas sold slaves to buyers from other regions.
the map on the opposite page shows the cities where much of this slave trade took place.
it also shows how slavery spread west.
the map below shows the distribution of the slave population in 1860.
in this unit you will learn about the movement to end slavery and about other attempts at reform.
you will also learn about northern and southern society including differences in the lives of free african americans and slaves.
finally you will learn about the economies of the north and south and why they made the end of slavery so difficult to achieve.

chapter 15 manifest destiny and the growing nation how justifiable was u s expansion in the 1800s.
15 1 introduction more than 150 years ago the phrase manifest destiny inspired great hopes and dreams among many americans.
it led to a war with mexico.
and it changed the map of the united states.
manifest destiny means obvious fate john osullivan a new york newspaper editor first used the phrase in 1845.
osullivan wrote that it was the united states manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent looking at the land beyond the rocky mountains he argued that americans had a divine right to settle this area and make it their own.
the fact that great britain claimed part of this land a huge area known as oregon made no difference to osullivan.
after all the united states had stood up to great britain in the war of 1812.
nor was osullivan impressed by mexicos claims to much of the west.
like many americans of the time he believed that the united states had a duty to extend the blessings of democracy to new lands and peoples.
it was gods plan he wrote for americans to expand their great experiment of liberty when americans began their great experiment in 1776 the idea that the united states might one day spread across the continent seemed like a dream.
by 1848 however the dream was a reality.
in this chapter you will learn how the united states tripled its size in a little more than a single lifetime.
manifest destiny took many forms.
the united states expanded through treaties settlement and war.
as you read think about how each new area was acquired and whether the decisions that led to u s expansion across north america were justifiable.
the spirit of manifest destiny helped the continental united states more than double in size between 1803 and 1853.
u s territorial acquisitions 1803 1853 american progress painted in 1872 by john gast manifest destiny and the growing nation 279 territory a region of land also a region designated by congress and organized under a governor 15 2 the louisiana territory the nations first opportunity for expansion during the early 1800s involved the vast territory to the west of the mississippi river then known as louisiana.
the united states wanted possession of the port city of new orleans near the mouth of the mississippi river.
by 1800 thousands of farmers were settling land to the west of the appalachian mountains.
to get their crops to market they floated them down the mississippi to new orleans.
there the crops were shipped to europe or to cities on the east coast.
the farmers depended on being able to move their crops freely along the mississippi.
the mississippi wrote james madison is to them everything.
it is the hudson the delaware the potomac and all the navigable rivers of the atlantic states formed into one stream louisiana across the mississippi river lay the unexplored territory of louisiana.
this immense region stretched from canada in the north to texas in the south.
from the mississippi it reached west all the way to the rocky mountains.
first claimed by france it was given to spain after the french and indian war.
in 1800 the french ruler napoleon bonaparte convinced spain to return louisiana to france.
napoleon had plans for louisiana.
he hoped to settle the territory with thousands of french farmers.
these farmers would raise food for the slaves who worked on frances sugar plantations in the caribbean.
napoleons plans alarmed frontier farmers.
new orleans was part of louisiana.
if napoleon closed the port to american goods farmers would have no way to get their crops to market.
a noble bargain president thomas jefferson understood the concerns of american farmers.
in 1803 he sent james monroe to france with an offer to buy new orleans for 7 5 million.
by the time american diplomats standing work out the final details of the louisiana purchase with talleyrand the french foreign minister.
0 chapter 15 monroe reached france napoleon had changed his plans.
a few years earlier a slave named toussaint louverture too san loo ver teer had led a slave revolt in the french caribbean colony known today as haiti.
the former slaves defeated the french troops who tried to take back the colony.
as a result napoleon no longer needed louisiana.
in addition france and great britain were on the brink of war.
napoleon knew that he might lose louisiana to the british.
rather than lose louisiana it made sense to sell it to the united states.
napoleons offer to sell all of louisiana stunned james monroe.
instead of a city suddenly the united states had the opportunity to buy an area as big as itself.
it didnt take long for monroe to agree.
on april 30 1803 he signed a treaty giving louisiana to the united states in exchange for 15 million.
said the french foreign minister you have made a noble bargain for yourselves and i suppose you will make the most of it the purchase debate to most americans the louisiana purchase looked like the greatest land deal in history.
the new territory would double the countrys size at a bargain price of just 2 to 3 cents an acre.
still not everyone approved.
some people worried that such a large country would be impossible to govern.
politicians in the east fretted that they would lose power.
sooner or later they warned louisiana would be carved into enough new states to outvote the eastern states in congress.
others objected to the 15 million price tag.
we are to give money of which we have too little wrote a boston critic for land of which we already have too much opponents also accused jefferson of tearing the constitution to tatters they said that the constitution made no provision for purchasing foreign territory.
jefferson was troubled by the argument that the louisiana purchase was unconstitutional.
still he believed it was better to stretch the limits of the constitution than to lose a the granger collection new york historic opportunity.
late in 1803 the senate voted to ratify the louisiana purchase treaty.
frontier farmers welcomed the news.
you have secured to us the free navigation of the mississippi a grateful westerner wrote jefferson.
you have procured an immense and fertile country and all these great blessings are obtained with out war and bloodshed in this painting the american flag is raised in new orleans as the french flag is taken down.
the ceremony marked the official transfer of the louisiana territory in 1803.
manifest destiny and the growing nation 281 escaped slaves were accepted into seminole indian communities.
here we see chief abraham a seminole leader of both african and seminole heritage.
15 3 florida having acquired louisiana through diplomacy president jefferson turned next to florida.
spain had colonized florida in the late 1500s.
by the 1800s florida had a diverse population of seminole indians spanish colonists english traders and runaway slaves.
in 1804 jefferson sent two diplomats to spain to buy florida.
spains answer was no deal many white americans in the southeast wanted the united states to take over florida.
slave owners in georgia were angry because slaves sometimes ran away to florida.
seminole indians welcomed some of the escaped slaves.
in addition white landowners in georgia were upset by seminole raids on their lands.
over the next few years spains control of florida weakened.
the spanish government could do nothing to stop the raids on farms in georgia by seminoles and ex slaves.
diplomacy the art of conducting negotiations with other countries andrew jackson invades florida in 1818 president james monroe sent andrew jackson the hero of the battle of new orleans to georgia with orders to end the raids.
jackson was told that he could chase raiding seminoles into florida.
but he did not have the authority to invade the spanish colony.
despite his orders jackson marched into florida with a force of 1 700 troops.
over the next few weeks he captured spanish military posts and arrested tried and executed two british subjects for stirring up indian attacks.
he also replaced the spanish governor with an american.
spain demanded that jackson be called back to washington and punished for his illegal invasion.
govern or get out fearing war president monroe asked his cabinet for advice.
all but one of his cabinet members advised him to remove jackson and apologize to spain.
the exception was secretary of state john quincy adams.
rather than apologize adams convinced monroe to send a blunt message to spain.
the message was this govern florida properly or get out.
equally fearful of war spain decided to get out.
in 1819 the spanish government agreed to yield florida to the united states.
in exchange the united states agreed to pay off 5 million in settlers claims against spain.
the united states also agreed to honor spains longtime claim to texas.
not all americans were happy about leaving spain in charge of texas.
one newspaper declared texas was worth ten floridas even so the senate ratified the florida treaty two days after it was signed.
82 chapter 15 15 4 texas there was a reason many americans felt that texas was so valuable.
much of this region was well suited for growing cotton the souths most valuable cash crop.
many southerners hoped that one day texas would become part of the united states.
americans come to texas the story of texas begins with moses austin a banker and business owner who dreamed of starting a u s colony in spanish texas.
in 1821 spanish officials granted austin a huge piece of land.
after moses austin died that same year his son stephen took over his fathers dream.
stephen f austin arrived in texas just as mexico declared its independence from spain.
now texas was a part of mexico.
mexican officials agreed to let austin start his colony under certain conditions.
austin had to choose only moral and hardworking settlers.
the settlers had to promise to become mexican citizens and to join the catholic church.
austin agreed to mexicos terms.
by 1827 he had attracted 297 families soon known as the old three hundred to texas.
stephen f austin made his father s dream a reality when he founded a colony in texas in 1822.
here we see austin talking with a group of anglo american settlers about the rules that mexico required them to live by.
rising tensions the success of austins colony started a rush of settlers to texas.
by 1830 there were about 25 000 americans in texas compared to 4 000 tejanos tay ha nos or texans of mexican descent.
soon tensions between the two groups began to rise.
the americans had several complaints.
they were used to governing themselves and they resented taking orders from mexican officials.
they were unhappy that all official documents had to be in spanish a language most of them were unwilling to learn.
in addition many were slaveholders who were upset when mexico outlawed slavery in 1829.
the tejanos had their own complaints.
they were unhappy that many american settlers had come to texas without mexicos permission.
worse most of these new immigrants showed little respect for mexican culture and had no intention of becoming citizens.
the mexican government responded by closing texas to further u s immigration.
the government sent troops to texas to enforce the immigration laws.
the texans rebel americans in texas resented these actions.
a group led by a lawyer named william travis began calling for revolution.
another group led by stephen f austin asked the mexican government to reopen texas to immigration and to make it a separate mexican state.
that way texans could run their own affairs.
manifest destiny and the growing nation 283 in 1833 austin traveled to mexico and presented the texans demands to the new head of the mexican government general antonio lopez de santa anna.
the general was a power hungry dictator who once boasted if i were god i would wish to be more rather than bargain with austin santa anna tossed him in jail for promoting rebellion.
soon after austin was released in 1835 texans rose up in revolt.
determined to crush the rebels santa anna marched north with some 6 000 troops.
fewer than 200 texans fought 4 000 mexican troops atthe alamo.
when the battle was over they were all dead including james bowie and davy crockett.
the alamo in late february 1836 a large part of santa annas army reached san antonio texas.
about 180 texan volunteers including eight tejanos defended the town.
the texans had taken over an old mission known as the alamo.
among them was davy crockett the famous frontiersman and former congressman from tennessee.
sharing command with william travis was james bowie a well known texas freedom fighter the alamos defenders watched as general santa anna raised a black flag that meant expect no mercy the general demanded that the texans surrender.
travis answered with a cannon shot.
slowly santa annas troops began surrounding the alamo.
the texans were vastly outnumbered but only one man fled.
meanwhile travis sent messengers to other towns in texas pleading for reinforcements and vowing not to abandon the alamo.
victory or death.
he proclaimed.
but reinforcements never came.
r 15 for 12 days the mexicans pounded the alamo with cannonballs.
then at the first light of dawn on march 6 santa anna gave the order to storm the fort.
desperately the texans tried to fight off the attackers with rifle fire.
for 90 minutes the battle raged.
then it was all over.
by days end every one of the alamos defenders was dead.
by santa annas order those who had survived the battle were executed on the spot.
santa anna described the fight for the alamo as but a small affair but his decision to kill every man at the alamo filled texans with rage.
texas wins its independence sam houston the commander of the texas revolutionary army understood texans rage.
but as santa anna pushed on houstons only hope was to retreat eastward.
by luring santa anna deeper into texas he hoped to make it harder for the general to supply his army and keep it battle ready.
houstons strategy wasnt popular but it worked brilliantly.
in april santa anna caught up with houston near the san jacinto san ha sin to river.
expecting the texans to attack at dawn the general kept his troops awake all night.
when no attack came the weary mexicans relaxed.
santa anna went to his tent to take a nap.
late that afternoon houstons troops staged a surprise attack.
yelling remember the alamo the texans overran the mexican camp.
santa anna fled but he was captured the next day.
in exchange for his freedom he ordered all his remaining troops out of texas.
the texas war for independence had been won but mexico did not fully accept the loss of its territory.
texas war for independence the 1836 rebellion of texans against mexican rule that resulted in texas becoming an independent nation annex to add a territory to a country.
such an addition is called an annexation.
manifest destiny the belief that it was americas right and duty to spread the nation across the north american continent ro annex texas or not.
now an inde endent country texas became known as he lone star republic because of the single tar on its flag.
but most texans were americans who wanted texas to become part of the jnited states.
despite their wishes texas remained in lependent for ten years.
people in the united fates were divided over whether to annex exas.
southerners were eager to add another lave state.
northerners who opposed slavery wanted to keep texas out.
others feared that nnexation would lead to war with mexico.
the 1844 presidential campaign was influenced by the question of diether to expand u s territory.
one of the candidates henry clay rarned annexation and war with mexico are identical his opponent james k polk however was a strong believer in manifest des iny.
he was eager to acquire texas.
after polk was elected congress oted to annex texas.
in 1845 texas was admitted as the 28th state.
collection of the star of the republic museum washington.
sam houston was elected the first president of the independent country of texas in 1836.
in 1845 texas was admitted to the united states.
this is the only known official lone star flag of the republic of texas.
manifest destiny and the growing nation 285 15 5 oregon country far to the northwest of texas lay oregon country.
this enormous tree covered wilderness stretched from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean.
to the north oregon was bounded by alaska which belonged to russia.
to the south it was bordered by spanish califor nia and new mexico.
in 1819 oregon was claimed by four nations russia spain great britain and the united states.
spain was the first to drop out of the scramble.
as part of the treaty to purchase florida spain gave up its claim to oregon.
a few years later russia also dropped out.
by 1825 russia agreed to limit its claim to the territory that lay north of the 5440 parallel of latitude.
today that line marks the southern border of alaska.
that left great britain and the united states.
for the time being the two nations agreed to a peaceful joint occupation of oregon.
in the 1800s wagon trains transported thousands of families from established eastern settlements to the rugged west.
this wagon train is winding its way across nebraska toward oregon country.
discovering oregon the united states claim to oregon was based on the lewis and clark expedition.
between 1804 and 1806 meriwether lewis and william clark had led a small band of explorers to the oregon coast.
lewis thought that many more americans would follow the path blazed by the expedition.
in the course of 10 or 12 years he predicted in 1806 a tour across the continent by this rout route will be undertaken with as little concern as a voyage across the atlantic that was wishful thinking.
the route that lewis and clark had followed was far too rugged for ordinary travelers.
there had to be a better way.
in 1824 a young fur trapper named jedediah smith found that better way.
smith discovered a passage through the rocky mountains called south pass.
unlike the high steep passes used by lewis and clark south pass was low and flat enough for wagons to use in crossing the rockies.
now the way was open for settlers to seek their fortunes in oregon.
oregon fever the first american settlers to travel through south pass to oregon were missionaries.
these missionaries made few converts among oregons indians.
but their glowing reports of oregons fertile soil and towering forests soon attracted more settlers.
these early settlers wrote letters home describing oregon as a pioneers paradise the weather was always sunny they claimed.
disease was unknown.
trees grew as thick as hairs on a dogs back.
and farms were free for the taking.
one man even joked that pigs are running about under the great acorn trees round and fat and already cooked with knives and forks sticking in them so you can cut off a slice whenever you are hungry reports like these inspired other settlers who were looking for a fresh start.
in 1843 about 1 000 pioneers packed their belongings into covered wagons and headed for oregon.
a year later nearly twice as many people made the long journey across the plains and mountains.
the oregon fever has broke out reported one observer and is now raging settlers who braved the 2 000 mile trekfrom independence missouri to oregon country were rewarded with fertile land in the willamette valley.
all of oregon or half.
along with texas oregon fever also played a role in the 1844 presidential campaign.
polk won the election with such stirring slogans as all of oregon or none and fifty four forty or fight polk promised he would not rest until the united states had annexed all of oregon country.
but polk didnt want oregon enough to risk starting a war with great britain.
instead he agreed to a compromise treaty that divided oregon roughly in half at the 49th parallel.
that line now marks the western border between the united states and canada.
the senate debate over the oregon treaty was fierce.
senators from the south and the east strongly favored the treaty.
they saw no reason to go to war over worse than useless territory on the coast of the pacific senators from the west opposed the treaty.
they wanted to hold out for all of oregon.
on june 18 1846 the senate ratified the compromise treaty by a vote of 41 to 14.
polk got neither fifty four forty nor a fight.
what he got was a diplomatic settlement that both the united states and great britain could accept without spilling a drop of blood.
manifest destiny and the growing nation 287 volunteers from exeter new hampshire line up as they leave new england to fight in the war against mexico.
15 6 the mexican american war you might think that texas and oregon were quite enough new territory for any president.
but not for polk.
this humorless hardworking president had one great goal.
he wanted to expand the united states as far as he could.
polks gaze fell next on the huge areas known as california and new mexico.
he was determined to have them both by purchase if possible by force if necessary.
these areas were first colonized by spain but became mexican territories when mexico won its independence in 1821.
both were thinly settled and the mexican government had long neglected them.
that was reason enough for polk to hope they might be for sale.
he sent a representative to mexico to try to buy the territories.
but mexican officials refused even to see polks representative.
mexican american war the war with mexico from 1846 to 1847 that resulted in mexico ceding to the united states a huge region from texas to california war breaks out in texas when congress voted to annex texas relations between the united states and mexico turned sour.
to mexico the annexation of texas was an act of war.
to make matters worse texas and mexico could not agree on a border.
texas claimed the rio grande as its border on the south and the west.
mexico wanted the border to be the nueces new ay sis river about 150 miles northeast of the rio grande.
on april 25 1846 mexican soldiers fired on u s troops who were patrolling along the rio grande.
sixteen americans were killed or wounded.
this was just the excuse for war that polk had been waiting for.
mexico he charged has invaded our territory and shed american blood upon american soil two days after polks speech congress declared war on mexico.
the mexican american war had begun.
the fall of new mexico and california a few months later general stephen kearny led the army of the west out of kansas.
his orders were to occupy new mexico and then continue west to california.
mexican opposition melted away in front of kearnys army.
the americans took control of new mexico without firing a shot.
genl kearny a pleased polk wrote in his diary has thus far performed his duty well meanwhile a group of americans led by the explorer john c fremont launched a rebellion against mexican rule in california.
the americans arrested and jailed general mariano guadalupe vallejo vuh yay oh the mexican commander of northern california.
then they raised a crude flag showing a grizzly bear sketched in blackberry juice.
california they declared was now the bear flag republic.
when kearny reached california he joined forces with the rebels.
within weeks all of california was under u s control.
chapter 15 the united states invades mexico the conquest of mexico itself was far more difficult.
u s troops under general zachary taylor battled their way south from texas.
taylor was a no nonsense general who was known fondly as old rough and ready because of his back woods clothes.
after 6 000 u s troops took the mexican city of monterrey an old enemy stopped them.
general santa anna had marched north to meet taylor with an army of 20 000 mexican troops.
in february 1847 the two forces met near a ranch called buena vista bwey nuh vis tuh.
after two days of hard fighting santa anna reported that both armies have been cut to pieces rather than lose his remaining forces santa anna retreated south.
the war in northern mexico was over.
a month later u s forces led by general winfield scott landed at veracruz ver uh crooz in southern mexico.
scott was a stickler for discipline and loved fancy uniforms.
these traits earned him the nickname old fuss and feathers for the next six months his troops fought their way to mexico city mexicos capital.
outside the capital the americans met fierce resistance at the castle of chapultepec chuh puhl tuh pek.
about 1 000 mexican soldiers and 100 young military cadets fought bravely to defend the fortress.
six of the cadets chose to die fighting rather than surrender.
to this day the boys who died that day are honored in mexico as the ninos heroes neen yos ehr oh ace the boy heroes.

mexican cession and gadsden purchase the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo early in 1848 mexico and the united states signed the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo gwa duh loo pay hih dahl go.
mexico agreed to give up texas and a vast region known as the mexican cession.
a cession is something that is given up.
this area included the present day states of california nevada utah arizona and new mexico as well as parts of colorado and wyoming.
under this agreement mexico gave up half of all its territory.
in return the united states agreed to pay mexico 15 million.
it also promised to protect the 80 000 to 100 000 mexicans living in texas and in the mexican cession.
most of these promises however were not kept.
in washington a few senators spoke up to oppose the treaty.
some of them argued that the united states had no right to any mexican territory other than texas.
they believed that the mexican american war had been unjust and that the treaty was even more so.
new mexico and california together they said were not worth a dollar and should be returned to mexico.
other senators opposed the treaty because they wanted even more land.
they wanted the mexican cession to include a large part of northern mexico as well.
to most senators however the mexican cession was a manifest destiny dream come true.
the senate ratified the treaty by a vote of 38 to 14.
the mexican cession added california nevada utah arizona and new mexico to the united states as well as parts of colorado and wyoming.
the gadsden purchase was a region of land purchased from mexico that was added to arizona and new mexico.
the gadsden purchase a few years later the united states acquired still more land from mexico.
in 1853 james gadsden arranged the purchase of a strip of land just south of the mexican cession for 10 million.
railroad builders wanted this land because it was relatively flat and could serve as a good railroad route.
the acquisition of this and known as the gadsden purchase created the present day border of the southwestern united states with mexico.
most americans were pleased with the new outlines of their county.
till not everyone rejoiced in this expansion.
until the mexican merican war many people had believed that the united states was oo good a nation to bully or invade its weaker neighbors.
now they knew that such behavior was the dark side of manifest destiny chapter summary in this chapter you read about how americans extended their nation to the west and the south.

she was one of only a few women to travel the santa fe trail.
westward on the santa fe trail calling all adventurers.
the signs might have said.
it s 1821 and the santa fe trail is open for business.
and business it was.
traders loaded their wagons in missouri and crossed plains deserts and mountains to sell their goods in mexico.
the action lasted about 60 years before the railroads came.
but in its brief history the santa fe trail became the stuff of legend.
on june 11 1846 newlywed susan shelby magoffin left independence missouri.
she was headed for santa fe then part of mexico.
just 18 years old susan magoffin was very excited about her upcoming honeymoon adventure.
my journal tells a story tonight different from what it has ever done before.
the curtain rises now with a new scene she wrote as she and her husband set out on their journey part of a wagon train on the santa fe trail.
susans husband samuel was 27 years older than his bride.
he had been traveling and trading on the santa fe trail for nearly 20 years.
the couples honeymoon trip was also a business trip samuel was overseeing 14 wagonloads of american goods.
he planned to sell his cargo in mexico at the towns of santa fe and chihuahua.
over the years samuel magoffin had made a fortune on the santa fe trail.
like other businessmen of his day he had seen possibility in trading with mexico.
in search of profit these entrepreneurs had charted a course from the western edges of what was then the united states to the lands beyond.
and j when santa fe became part of the united states in 1848 after the mexican war the booming business did not stop.
i the trips were risky.
dust storms illness pos z sible attacks by hostile indians and lack of water all.
a n v v f threatened their efforts.
but for nearly 60 years men like samuel magoffin took those risks.
in the process they helped expand the united states southwestern border.
fortunately for historians people like susan magoffin kept detailed journals of their experiences.
their accounts bring to life a time of adventure on the american frontier.
almost 100 years after she wrote it susan magoffin s diary was found in the attic of one of her descendants.
as a daily record of the magoffins journey west the 206 page diary is an invaluable historical document.
292 chapter 15 the path west in the 1800s several trails left the united states heading west.
settlers farmers ranchers and miners took the oregon trail toward new lives in the pacific northwest.
families traveled along what became known as the mormon trail looking for religious freedom in the desert.
and across the california trail prospectors and others marched toward what they hoped would be great wealth.
the santa fe trail was different.
its main purpose was trade.
political events made that trade possible.
in 1821 mexico won its independence from spain.
spain had prohibited trade with the united states but mexico welcomed it.
with the door open american businessmen like samuel magoffin and his brother james headed west.
the santa fe trail began in missouri and spanned 900 miles across north america.
traders braved bad weather hostile indians dangerous animals and lack of water.
they were in search of profits and they found them.
in 1822 trade on the trail totaled 15 000.
by 1860 it had reached 3 5 million.
when the railroad ended trade on the santa fe trail in 1880 as many as 6 000 wagons were using the trail every year.
if money was important to santa fe traders so was adventure.
many traders and other travelers loved the excitement of life on the trail.
some simply loved the beautiful outdoors.
one wrote the air is many times clearer and incomparably drier than in the eastern part of the united states and the heavens burn nightly with millions of magnified stars which the people of the east never dreamed of.
this painting traders on the santa fe trail appeared in josiah gregg s book commerce of the prairies in 1844.
inhis classic account of the santa fe trail gregg reported on the enthusiasm of the traders and said even the mules prick up their ears.
on the trail susan magoffin appreciated being free from the strict rules of society.
in her diary she wrote there is such independence so much free uncontaminated air which fills the mind the feelings nay every thought with purity.
i breathe free without that oppression and uneasiness felt in the gossiping groups of a settled home.
susan magoffin stayed at bent s fort in 1846 after an accident on the trail.
her room had a dirt floor but she had her own furniture.
the fort in colorado has been re created based on extensive historical descriptions and is part of a national historic site.
joy and hardship on the trail when samuel magoffin set off to santa fe with his young wife he was determined that she travel in comfort.
so he hired servants and outfitted carriages to make his first home with susan as nice as possible.
the magoffins slept in a tent but not in sleeping bags on the ground.
no they slept in a bed that the servants put up every night.
there were sheets on the mattress plus blankets pillows and mosquito netting.
tables cabinets and carpets added to the luxury.
their meals were often equally elegant.
susan and samuel brought chickens with them so that they could have fresh eggs.
they also ate ham fresh buffalo and sometimes even one of the chickens.
they might top off a good meal with gooseberry tarts.
it is the life of a wandering princess mine susan wrote in her journal.
during the days susan wrote sewed studied spanish and knit.
when she wanted flowers but didnt want to climb out of her carriage servants riding on mules pick them for me her devoted greyhound ring kept her company.
ring also helped her feel protected by barking at the wolves and coyotes.
i felt safe with this trusty soldier near me she wrote.
but life on the trail wasnt all luxury even for wealthy travelers like susan and samuel magoffin.
difficulties abounded.
dust storms and prairie fires plagued travelers.
rattlesnakes frightened them.
and then there were the mosquitoes.
millions upon millions are swarming upon me susan wrote and their knocking against the carriage reminded me of a hard rain fear of hostile indians also troubled the travelers.
at pawnee rock susan stopped to carve her name on the sandstone as others had done.
samuel and susans servant jane kept watch because the rock was the site of pawnee attacks.
from the rock the hostile indians could dash down upon the santa fe traders like hawks to carry off their plunder and their scalps wrote one traveler.
94 chapter 15 susan didnt encounter any indians at pawnee rock but she did have a terrible accident as the caravan moved on.
the wagon she was riding in went over the edge of a river bank.
she described what happened.
we were whirled completely over with a perfect crash.
one to see the wreck of that carriage now with the top and sides entirely broken to pieces could never believe that people had come out of it alive.
but strange wonderful to say we are almost entirely unhurt.
spanish colonists founded santa fe in 1608 on a site where pueblo people had lived for hundreds of years.
far from the cities of mexico or the united states it was still a tiny town when the magoffins arrived.
that wasnt quite true.
susan was knocked unconscious during the crash.
pregnant at the time she lost the baby due to the accident.
it took 11 weeks for the magoffins to reach santa fe partly because travel was difficult and partly because susans ill health required them to spend nearly two weeks at bents fort an important stopping point along the trail.
when they arrived in santa fe they met up with samuels brother james and joined in the high society life of the village such as it was.
susan attended a nearby church practiced her spanish and spent time with the local people.
over the next 10 years susan and samuel magoffin had three children.
eventually the family settled in st louis where susan magoffin died in 1855.
she was only 29 years old.

chapter 14 andrew jackson and the growth of american democracy how well did president andrew jackson promote democracy.
jackson atthe upper left greets his supporters after winning the presidency in the election of 1828.
the granger collection new york 14 1 introduction the presidential campaign of 1828 was one of the dirtiest in u s history.
the two candidates were john quincy adams running for re election and andrew jackson the popular hero of the war of 1812s battle of new orleans.
during the campaign both sides hurled accusations at each other a practice called mudsling ing.
adams for example was called a sabbath breaker for traveling on sunday.
he was accused of using public money to purchase gambling furniture for the white house.
in reality he had used his own money to buy a billiard table.
the presidents supporters lashed back.
they called jackson a crude and ignorant man who was unfit to be president.
they also brought up old scandals about his wife.
jackson was called old hickory by his troops because he was as tough as the hardest wood in all creation but when he read such lies he broke down and cried.
when the votes were counted jackson was the clear winner.
but his supporters came from among the general population not the rich and upper class.
in this chapter you will discover how his presidency was viewed by different groups of people.
you will also learn how jacksons government affected the growth of democracy in the nation.
men line up to vote in the presidential election of 1828.
andrew jackson and the growth of american democracy 257 andrew jackson was born on the south carolina frontier.
in the early 1800s he moved to tennessee and bought a plantation called the hermitage.
his first home there was a log cabin similar to this one.
14 2 from the frontier to the white house andrew jackson was born in 1767 on the south carolina frontier.
his father died before he was born leaving the family in poverty.
young jackson loved sports more than schoolwork.
he also had a hot temper.
a friend recalled that he would pick a fight at the drop of a hat and hed drop the hat himself the american revolution ended jacksons childhood.
when he was just 13 jackson joined the local militia and was captured by the british.
one day a british officer ordered jackson to polish his boots.
sir he replied boldly i am a prisoner of war and claim demand to be treated as such the outraged officer lashed out with his sword slicing the boy s head and hand.
jackson carried these scars for the rest of his life.
frontier lawyer after the war jackson decided to become a lawyer.
he went to work in a law office in north carolina.
he quickly became known as the most roaring rollicking game cocking horse racing card playing mischievous fellow in town.
in 1788 jackson headed west to nashville tennessee to practice law.
at that time nashville was a tiny frontier settlement of rough cabins and tents.
but the town grew quickly and jacksons practice grew with it.
he soon earned enough money to buy land and slaves and set himself up as a gentleman farmer.
despite his success jackson never outgrew his hot temper.
a slave trader named charles dickinson found this out when he called jack son a worthless scoundrel enraged jackson challenged dickinson to a duel with pistols.
at that time duels were accepted as a way of settling disputes between gentlemen.
jackson killed dickinson with a single shot even though dickinson shot first and wounded him.
chapter 14 the people s choice jackson entered politics in tennessee serving in both the house and senate.
but he did not become widely known until the battle of new orleans during the war of 1812.
his defense of the city made old hickory a national hero.
in 1824 jackson ran for president against three other candidates henry clay william crawford and john quincy adams.
jackson won the most popular votes as well as the most electoral votes.
but he did not have enough electoral votes for a majority.
when no candidate has an electoral majority the house of representatives chooses a president from among the three leading candidates.
clay who had come in fourth urged his supporters in the house to vote for adams.
that support gave adams enough votes to become president.
adams then chose clay to be his secretary of state.
it made sense for adams to bring clay into his cabinet because the two men shared many of the same goals.
jacksons supporters however accused adams and clay of making a corrupt bargain to rob their hero of his rightful election.
they promised revenge in 1828.
jacksons supporters used the time between elections to build a new political organization that came to be called the democratic party the name it still uses today.
this new party they promised would represent ordinary farmers workers and the poor not the rich and upper class who controlled the republican party.
in the election of 1828 jacksons supporters worked hard to reach the nations voters.
besides hurling insults at adams they organized parades picnics and rallies.
at these events supporters sang the hunters of kentucky the nations first campaign song and cheered for old hickory.
they wore jackson badges carried jacksonian democracy the idea that the common people should control the government hickory sticks and chanted catchy campaign slogans like adams can write but jackson can fight the result was a great victory for jackson.
but it was also a victory for the idea that the common people should control their government.
this idea eventually became known as jacksonian democracy.
this campaign poster shows the theme of jacksons presidential campaign.
his supporters said that if jackson were elected the government would finally be in the hands of ordinary people not just the rich and upper class.
jackson forever.

andrew jackson and the growth of american democracy 259 people of every color age and class mobbed the white house to attend a public reception after andrew jackson took the oath of office.
one observer claimed thatthe scene was like the invasion of barbarians into rome.
14 3 the inauguration of andrew jackson on march 4 1829 more than 10 000 people who came from every state crowded into washington d c to witness andrew jacksons inauguration.
the visitors overwhelmed local hotels sleeping five to a bed.
i never saw such a crowd here before observed senator daniel webster.
persons have come five hundred miles to see general jack son and they really seem to think that the country is rescued from some dreadful disaster many of the people flocking into the capital were first time voters.
until the 1820s the right to vote had been limited to the rich and upper class.
until then only white men with property were thought to have the education and experience to vote wisely.
the new states forming west of the appalachians challenged this argument.
along the frontier all men rich or poor educated or not shared the same opportunities and dangers.
they believed they should also share the same rights including the right to vote.
with the western states leading the way voting laws were changed to give the common man the right to vote.
this expansion of democracy did not yet include african americans american indians or women.
still over one million americans voted in 1828 more than three times the number who voted in 1824.
many of these new voters did believe they had rescued the country from disaster.
in their view the national government had been taken over by corrupt monied interests that is the rich.
jackson had promised to throw the rich out and return the government to the people.
his election reflected a shift in power to the west and to the farmers shopkeepers and small business owners who supported him.
after jackson was sworn in as president a huge crowd followed him to the white house.
as the crowd surged in the celebration turned into a near riot.
ladies fainted men were seen with bloody noses and such a scene of confusion took place as is impossible to describe wrote an eyewitness margaret bayard smith.
jackson was nearly pressed to death before escaping out a back door.
but it was the people day and the peoples president smith concluded.
and the people would rule ill io er 14 the granger collection new york in this political cartoon titled office hunters for the year 1834 andrew jackson is a puppet master.
he is pulling strings attached to people who wantto be appointed to public offices.
what is the cartoonist s opinion of jackson.
14 4 jackson s approach to governing andrew jackson approached governing much as he had leading an army.
he listened to others but then did what he thought was right.
the kitchen cabinet jackson did not rely only on his cabinet for advice.
he made most of his decisions with the help of trusted friends and political supporters.
because these advisers were said to meet with him in the white house kitchen they were called the kitchen cabinet the rich men who had been used to influencing the government viewed the kitchen cabinet with deep suspicion.
in their eyes the men around the president were not the proper sort to be running the country.
one congressman accused amos kendall jacksons closest adviser of being the presidents lying machine jackson ignored such charges and continued to turn to men he trusted for advice.
the spoils system jacksons critics were even more upset by his decision to replace many republican officeholders with loyal democrats.
most of these civil servants viewed their posts as lifetime jobs.
jackson disagreed.
rotating people in office was more democratic than lifetime service he said because it gave more people a chance to serve their government.
jackson believed that after a few years in office civil servants should go back to making a living as other people do.
jacksons opponents called the practice of rewarding political supporters with government jobs the spoils system.
this term came from the saying to the victor belong the spoils prizes of war.
jacksons opponents also exaggerated the number of republicans removed from office.
only about 10 percent of civil servants were replaced and many deserved to be.
one official had stolen 10 000 from the treasury.
when he begged jackson to let him stay the president said i would turn out my own father under the same circumstances.
civil servant an employee of the government spoils system the practice of rewarding political supporters with government jobs andrew jackson and the growth of american democracy 261 tariff a tax imposed by the government on goods imported from another country secede to withdraw from an organization or alliance 14 5 the nullification crisis andrew jacksons approach to governing met its test in an issue that threatened to break up the united states.
in 1828 congress passed a law raising tariffs or taxes on imported goods such as cloth and glass.
the idea was to encourage the growth of manufacturing in the united states.
higher tariffs meant higher prices for imported factory goods.
american manufacturers could then outsell their foreign competitors.
northern states humming with new factories favored the new tariff law.
but southerners opposed tariffs for several reasons.
tariffs raised the prices they paid for factory goods.
high tariffs also discouraged trade among nations and planters in the south worried that tariffs would hurt cotton sales to other countries.
in addition many southerners believed that a law favoring one region in this case the north was unconstitutional.
based on this belief john c calhoun jacksons vice president called on southern states to declare the tariff null and void or illegal and not to be honored.
jackson understood southerners concerns.
in 1832 he signed a new law that lowered tariffs but not enough to satisfy the most extreme supporters of states rights in south carolina.
led by calhoun they proclaimed south carolinas right to nullify or reject both the 1828 and 1832 tariff laws.
such an action was called nullification.
south carolina took the idea of states rights even further.
the state threatened to secede if the national government tried to enforce the tariff laws.
even though he was from south carolina jackson was outraged.
if one drop of blood be shed there in defiance of the laws of the united states he raged i will hang the first man.
r of them i can get my hands on n n c rs tree 1 can he called on congress to pass the force ill which would allow him to use the federal army to collect tariffs uee j l samc time con8ress passed a compromise bill that lowered tariffs still further.

however the tensions between the in this cartoon john c calhoun who believed states have the right to nullify federal laws is reaching toward a crown.
the crown symbolizes his desire for power.
andrew jackson is pulling on the coat of a calhoun supporter.
he wants to prevent calhoun from trampling on the constitution and destroying the union.

andrew jackson on the left attacks the many headed bank of the united states with a veto stick.
bank president nicholas biddle in the center wears a top hat.
the many heads represent the 24 state directors of the bank.
vice president martin van buren in the center chokes massachusetts and delaware.
14 6 jackson battles the bank of the united states andrew jackson saw himself as the champion of the people and never more so than in his war with the bank of the united states.
the bank was partly owned by the federal government and it had a monopoly on federal deposits.
jackson thought that the bank benefited rich eastern depositors at the expense of farmers and workers as well as smaller state banks.
he felt that the bank stood in the way of opportunity for capitalists in the west and other regions.
he also distrusted the banks president nicholas biddle who was everything jackson was not wealthy upper class well educated and widely traveled.
the banks charter or contract was due to come up for renewal in 1836.
jackson might have waited until after his reelection to slay the monster but henry clay who planned to run for president against jackson in 1832 decided to force the issue.
clay pushed a bill through congress that renewed the banks charter four years early.
he thought that if jackson signed the bill the farmers who shared his dislike of banks would not reelect him.
if jackson vetoed the bill he would lose votes from businesspeople who depended on the bank for loans.
what clay had forgotten was that there were many more poor farmers to cast votes than there were rich bankers and businesspeople.
jackson vetoed the recharter bill.
even though the supreme court had held that the bank was constitutional jackson called the bank an unconstitutional monopoly that existed mainly to make the rich richer.
the voters seemed to agree.
in 1832 a large majority elected jackson to a second term.
chapter 14 andrew jackson and the growth of american democracy 263 sequoyah sih kwol uh developed an 86 letter alphabetfor the cherokee language.
the alphabet contained both roman letters and symbols sequoyah created.
even though these indians developed what many whites considered an advanced civilization wealthy planters and poor settlers were determined to force them out and seize their lands.
rather than wait for the bank to die when its charter ran out jackson decided to starve it to death.
in 1833 he ordered the secretary of the treasury to remove all federal deposits from the bank and put the money in state banks.
jacksons enemies called these banks pet banks because the presidents supporters ran them.
delegations of business owners begged jackson not to kill the bank.
jackson refused.
abolishing the bank he believed was a victory for economic democracy.
14 7 jackson s indian policy as a frontier settler andrew jackson had little sympathy for american indians.
during his presidency it became national policy to remove indians who remained in the east by force.
white settlers had come into conflict with indians ever since colonial days.
after independence the new national government tried to settle these conflicts through treaties.
typically the treaties drew boundaries between areas claimed for settlers and areas that the government promised to let the indians have forever.
in exchange for giving up their old lands indians were promised food supplies and money.
despite the treaties american indians continued to be pushed off their land.
by the time jackson became president only 125 000 indians still lived east of the mississippi river.
war and disease had greatly reduced the number of indians in the east.
other indians had sold their lands for pennies an acre and moved west of the mississippi.
jackson was determined to remove the remaining indians to a new indian territory in the west.
most of the eastern indians lived in the south.
they belonged to five groups called tribes by whites the creek cherokee chickasaw choctaw and seminole.
hoping to remain in their homelands these indians had adopted many white ways.
most had given up hunting to become farmers.
many had learned to read and write.
the cherokee had their own written language a newspaper and a constitution modeled on the u s constitution.
whites called these indians the five civilized tribes while the five civilized tribes may have hoped to live in peace with their neighbors many whites did not share this goal.
as cotton growing spread westward wealthy planters and poor settlers alike looked greedily at indian homelands.
the indians they decided had to go.
the indian removal act in 1830 urged on by president jackson congress passed the indian removal act.
this law allowed the president to make treaties in which american indians in the east traded their lands for new territory on the great plains.
the law did not say chapter 14 that the indians should be removed by force and in 1831 the supreme court held that indians had a right to keep their lands.
an angry jack son disagreed.
groups that refused to move west voluntarily were met with military force usually with tragic results.
this was true of the sac and fox indians of illinois.
led by a chief named black hawk the sac and fox fought removal for two years.
black hawks war ended in 1832 with the slaughter of most of his warriors.
as he was taken off in chains the chief told his captors black hawk is an indian.
he has done nothing for which an indian ought to be ashamed.
he has fought for his countrymen the squaws women and papooses young children against white men who came year after year to cheat them of and take away their land.
you know the cause of our making war.
it is known to all white men.
they ought to be ashamed of it.
the trail of tears many whites were ashamed over the treatment of indians and sent protests to washington d c.
still the work of removal continued.
in 1836 thousands of creek indians who refused to leave alabama were rounded up and marched west in handcuffs.
two years later under president martin van buren more than 17 000 cherokees were forced from their homes in georgia and herded west by federal troops.
four thousand of these indians died during the long walk to indian territory which took place in the winter.
those who survived remembered that terrible journey as the trail of tears.
a soldier who took part in the cherokee removal called it the crudest work i ever knew trail of tears the removal of cherokee indians from georgia to indian territory in 1838 and 1839 this artist painted an unrealistic picture of the trail of tears.
most of the cherokees had no horses or warm blankets.
they were dragged from their homes and allowed to take only the clothes they had on.
many died as they walked barefoot for hundreds of miles.
in the 1830s american indians were removed from their homelands and sent to a government created territory in the west.
many indians became ill or died during this forced removal.
led by a young chief named osceola ah see oh luh the seminoles of florida resisted removal for ten years.
their long struggle was the most costly indian war ever fought in the united states.
a number of seminoles were finally sent to indian territory.
but others found safety in the florida swamps.
their descendants still live in florida today.
when andrew jackson left office he was proud of having solved the american indian problem for good.
in reality jackson had simply moved the conflict between american indians and whites across the mississippi river.

from the frontier to the white house andrew jackson was a self made man who rose from poverty to become president of the united states.
first time voters many of them farmers and frontier settlers helped elect jackson in 1828.
his supporters celebrated his election as a victory for the common man over the rich and powerful.
jacksons approach to governing as president jackson relied on his kitchen cabinet rather than the official cabinet.
he replaced a number of republican civil servants with democrats in a practice that became known as the spoils system.
the nullification crisis a controversy over higher tariffs led to the nullification crisis in which south carolinians threatened to secede from the united states.
although jackson forced them to back down the crisis was another sign of developing tensions between north and south.
the battle against the bank jackson thought the bank of the united states benefited rich eastern depositors at the expense of farmers workers and smaller state banks.
he also thought it stood in the way of opportunity for capitalists in the west and other regions.
jackson vetoed the banks renewal charter.
jacksons indian policy jacksons indian policy was simple move the eastern indians across the mississippi to make room for whites.
the indian removal act caused great suffering for tens of thousands of american indians.
andrew jackson was the nation s first president from the frontier.
he came to office with great popular support.
his supporters viewed him as a president of the people.
his critics did not believe he was the sort of man who should be running the government.
andrew jackson and the growth of american democracy 267 reading further images cannot convey the realities of the cherokee experience.
in paintings like this left in the care of the grandmothers however artists try to show the desolation of the journey.
the trail where they cried in the 1830s thousands of cherokees were forcibly removed from their homeland in the appalachian mountains.
they had tried valiantly to hold on to their land but their efforts were in vain.
like other eastern indians they were driven west on the trail of tears.
in 1890 john g burnett a former soldier wrote a story to his family on the occasion of his 80th birthday.
he wanted to tell them about his experiences with the cherokees.
the removal of the cherokee indians in the year of 1838 he recalled took place when he was a young man in the prime of life burnett had grown up in eastern tennessee on the edge of cherokee territory.
as a young man he had roamed the hills and valleys of the appalachians.
he had fished for trout and hunted for deer and wild boar.
he had also gotten to know many cherokees.
he spent time hunting with them by day and sleeping around their campfires by night he wrote.
i learned to speak their language and they taught me the arts of trailing and building traps and snares through his experiences burnett learned to respect the cherokees way of life.
when the removal began burnett was a private in the u s army.
because he spoke cherokee he was brought in as an interpreter.
in that role he witnessed what he called the most brutal order in the history of american warfare he recalled i saw the helpless cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades fenced in enclosures.
and in the chill of a drizzling rain on an october morning i saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into six hundred and forty five wagons and started toward the west on the morning of november the 17th we encountered a terrific sleet and snow storm with freezing temperatures and from that day until we reached the end of the fateful journey on march the 26th 1839 the sufferings of the cherokees were awful.
the trail of the exiles was a trail of death.
burnett called the cherokee removal a form of murder.
why was this tragedy inflicted on the cherokees.
the cherokee nation or centuries the cherokees had lived in the southern appalachians.
this was their ancient home and the center of their world.
like other southeastern indians they had lost land to white settlers during the colonial period.
by the end of the american revolution their homeland was much reduced in size.
but they were determined to hold on to it chapter 14 unlike some american indians who continued to fight white settlement the cherokees tried to work with the u s government to keep their land.
they accepted the terms of treaties that limited their territory.
they also agreed to the governments efforts to civilize them.
they took up farming as their main activity.
they dressed in european clothing.
they went to school and learned to read and write.
they even created a republican form of government with a written constitution.
they embraced the values of american democracy.
they were in the eyes of many americans a model indian people.
the cherokees were not willing to do everything the government wanted though.
they were not willing to sell their land and blend in with other americans.
they wanted to maintain their own identity as a separate cherokee nation.
this meant they were still an obstacle to white settlement and expansion in the south.
the state of georgia in particular found the cherokee position unacceptable.
georgia settlers felt they had a right to cherokee land and they had strong supporters to back up their claim.
one of these supporters was andrew jackson.
the cherokees had been faithful allies of the united states during the war of 1812.
they had even fought under jacksons command against other indians.
but jackson did not believe that indians could live alongside white americans.
he wanted them moved out of the way to lands in the west.
as president jackson allowed georgia to put pressure on the indians.
this pressure increased after gold was discovered on cherokee land in 1829.
the following year congress passed the indian removal act with jacksons support.
but the president still could not force the cherokees to move.
their land rights were based on a treaty with the government.
they would have to sign another treaty giving up their land.
to the cherokees their homeland was the spiritual as well as the geographical center of their world.
the thought of abandoning it was devastating.
i 4 cherokee chief john ross led his people for more than 30 years.
after losing the battle to preserve their homelands ross helped the cherokees move west.
american indian artist brummet echo hawk depicted the hardships of the removal in his painting trail of tears.
as the soldier moves the marchers along one who did not survive is buried by the roadside.
the removal the cherokee government under chief john ross had worked hard to prevent removal.
it had appealed to the american people to win sympathy for its cause.
it had also taken its case to court asking the justice system to support the cherokees right to their land.
but not all cherokees supported these efforts.
a number of cherokee leaders believed that removal was inevitable.
in 1835 these men signed the treaty of new echota agreeing to give up the land and move west to indian territory.
chief ross and the majority of cherokees were outraged.
they called the treaty illegal and asked congress to cancel it.
but their appeals failed.
everyone would have to go they were told.
some cherokees mainly those who supported the treaty left voluntarily.
but most waited until the deadline of may 1838.
at that point an army of 7 000 u s soldiers surrounded cherokee territory.
they forced the cherokees out of their homes and into temporary camps or stockades.
the soldiers came and took us from home one cherokee woman recalled.
they drove us out of doors and did not permit us to take anything with us not even a.
change of clothes many cherokees were held in the camps for months.
conditions were harsh.
one missionary reported that the indians were obliged at night to lie down on the naked ground in the open air exposed to wind and rain and herd ed together.
like droves of hogs some cherokees escaped and fled into the mountains only to be captured by soldiers and returned to the camps.
the march west began in the summer of 1838.
it took place in several phases and along several routes.
the first parties set out in june traveling by land and river.
but summer heat and drought conditions caused great suffering.
the government decided to postpone further actions until fall.
in october the removals began again.
the 850 mile journey west took several months.
although some cherokees traveled in wagons or on horseback most went on foot.
one witness wrote even aged females apparently nearly ready to drop into the grave were traveling with heavy burdens attached to the back on the sometimes frozen ground.
with no covering for the feet except what nature had given them as winter took hold conditions worsened.
one wagon driver reported there is the coldest weather in illinois i ever experienced anywhere.
the streams are all frozen over something like eight or twelve inches thick.
we are compelled to cut through the ice to get water for ourselves and the animals.
martin davis in a letter of december 1838 several parties were held up by winter weather unable to go forward for weeks on end.
they suffered from exposure disease and starvation.
these conditions were especially hard on children and the elderly.
one woman recalled that there was much sickness and a great many little children died of whooping cough many cherokees were buried along the trail.
finally in the spring of 1839 the last of the groups arrived in indian territory.
by that time some 4 000 cherokees around a fourth of all those removed had died.
the survivors would call this journey nu no du na tlo hi lu or the trail where they cried the aftermath at first life in indian territory was hard.
the cherokees had no homes and few possessions.
in addition many of the later arrivals had bitter feelings toward the treaty supporters who had moved west before them.
they considered these people traitors.
violence sometimes flared between the newer and older groups of settlers.
gradually however the cherokee people got back on their feet.
they formed a new government and set up farms and businesses.
they also established a good public school system.
john ross continued to lead the cherokees until his death in 1866.
today the cherokee nation in oklahoma has around 240 000 citizens.
smaller separate bands of cherokees live in oklahoma and north carolina.
many other americans also have cherokee ancestry.
for all cherokees the trail of tears represents a great tragedy in their history.
but they also take pride in what they have achieved.
as chad smith the current leader of the cherokee nation put it we are not a people of the past.
we are a people of the present and for many centuries we will be a people of the future.
the cherokee heritage is preserved in the lives of modern cherokee people as well as in museums.
in this alabama museum on the site of ancient burial mounds a cherokee guide right explains traditional uses of furs to visitors.

800 miles n 400 an expanding nation in this unit you will learn about the growth of the united states from about 1800 to the early 1850s.
in 1800 the united states was bordered by the atlantic ocean to the east and the mississippi river to the west.
farther west lay regions claimed by great britain russia france and spain.
by the 1850s the united states had acquired these lands more than doubling its size and extended its western border to the pacific ocean.
the map on opposite page shows the steps by which the nation s growth took place.
picture yourself moving west along a trail pioneers used the oregon trail or the santa fe trail.
the first half of your journey will cross a vast treeless plain.
on a good day your wagon train might travel 20 miles.
rivers slow you down though as crossing them is dangerous.
several weeks on the trail will bring you to an even greater obstacle the ranges of the rugged rocky mountains.
here your progress will slow from 20 miles per day to 20 or so miles per week.
timing is everything on this part of your journey.
the high mountain passes are open for only a short time each year.
if you reach the mountains too late in the year you may end up trapped by snow which will likely mean your death.
despite such challenges thousands of settlers made this journey in the 1840s and 1850s.
the map on the opposite page shows the nation s pattern of settlement in 1860.

chapter 19 the worlds of north and south how was life in the north different from life in the south.
19 1 introduction eli whitney a young man from massachusetts listened politely to the georgia planters complaints.
tobacco prices were low and rice and indigo prices werent much better.
cotton grew well but cleaning the seeds out of cotton fibers was a big problem.
a slave picking out seeds by hand could clean only a few pounds a day.
at that rate even using cheap slave labor there was little profit in raising cotton.
as the planters talked a solution to their problem began to take shape in whitneys mind.
while growing up in massachusetts whitney had revealed a gift for invention.
as a boy he had invented a machine to manufacture nails more quickly than making them by hand.
from nails he had gone on to hat pins and mens canes.
after graduating from college in 1792 whitney went to georgia to work as a tutor.
instead of tutoring however he became intrigued by the problem of cotton cleaning and he wrote struck out a plan of a machine in my mind the result as you will read was an invention that changed life in both the north and the south but in very different ways.
this probably did not surprise whitney.
as a northerner living in the south he had already noticed many differences between the two areas of the country.
as american citizens northerners and southerners shared a fierce pride in their country and a faith in democracy.
yet their outlooks and attitudes about many things were quite different.
the two areas also differed in their economies transportation systems and societies.
between 1800 and 1850 these differences led to sharply conflicting views on many national issues so much so that at times northerners and southerners seemed to be living in two separate worlds.
geography economy transportation and society made life in the north very different from life in the south.
inventor eli whitney s cotton gin would greatly affect life in both the north and the south.
the worlds of north and south 355 19 2 geography of the north from the rocky shores of maine to the gently rolling plains of iowa the north had a variety of climates and natural features.
northerners adapted to these geographical differences by creating different industries and ways of making a living.
climate all the northern states experienced four distinct seasons from freezing winters to hot humid summers.
but the most northerly states such as maine and minnesota had colder winters and shorter summer growing seasons than states farther south such as pennsylvania and ohio.
deforestation the clearing away of forests natural features different areas of the north had distinctive natural features.
the jagged new england coast for example had hundreds of bays and inlets that were perfect for use as harbors.
shipbuilding fishing and commerce flourished in this area while towns such as boston became busy seaports.
inland from the sea lay a narrow flat plain with a thin covering of rocky soil.
farming was not easy here.
instead many people turned to trade and crafts.
others moved west in search of better farmland.
new englands hills rose sharply above v shaped valleys carved by steep streams.
the hillsides offered barely enough land for small farms but they were covered with thick forests of spruce and fir.
new englanders found that they could make money by harvesting timber.
the wood was used for shipbuilding and in trade with other countries.
farther south in new york pennsylvania and new jersey broad rivers like the hudson and the delaware had deposited rich soil over the plains.
people living in these areas supported themselves by farming.
across the appalachian mountains lay the central plains a large forested region drained by the ohio and mississippi rivers.
the central plains boast some of the best agricultural soil in the world.
from ohio to illinois settlers cleared the forests to make way for farms.
industrious northerners were thus changing the landscape.
one result was deforestation or the clearing of forests.
by 1850 americans had cleared about 177 000 square miles of dense forest.
and with the growth of industry the demand for coal and other minerals led to a big increase in mining after about 1820 especially in pennsylvania.
this photograph shows a section of new england coastline.
what geographic features can you identify.
19 3 geography of the south ihe south extended from maryland south to florida and from the atlantic coast west to louisiana and texas.
climate and natural features encouraged southerners to base their way of life on agriculture.
this photograph shows a southern waterway.
what geographic features can you identify.
climate compared to the north the southern states enjoyed mild winters and long hot humid summers.
plentiful rainfall and long growing seasons made this a perfect place for raising warm weather crops that would have withered and died farther north.
tural features wide coastal plains edged the southern shoreline n chesapeake bay to the gulf of mexico.
these fertile lowlands tched inland for as much as 300 miles in parts of the south.
along the coast the plains were dotted with swamps and marshes.
se damp lowlands were ideal for growing rice and sugarcane which ived in warm soggy soil.
indigo was grown on the dry land above swamps and tobacco and corn were farmed farther inland.
a visitor his area noted that the planters by the richness of the soil live in most easie and pleasant manner of any people i have ever met with.
above the plains rose the appalachians.
settlers who ventured into s fugged backcountry carved farms and orchards out of rolling hills 1 mountain hollows.
some backcountry farmers worked on land so ep that it was joked that they kept falling out of their cornfields.
although most people in the south were farmers southerners used ural resources in other ways as well.
in north carolina they har kd thick pine forests for lumber.
from chesapeake bay in virginia maryland they gathered fish oysters and crabs.
an especially important feature of the south was its broad flat ers.
many of the south s earliest towns were built at the mouths of ers as people moved away from the coast they followed the rivers and building their homes and farms alongside these water high ys.
oceangoing ships could even sail up southern rivers to conduct siness right at a planters private dock.
here the ships were loaded tobacco or other cash crops for sale in the caribbean or europe.
the worlds of north and south 357 agrarian a person who favors an agricultural way of life and government policies that support agricultural interests plantation a large area of privately owned land where crops were grown through the labor of workers who lived on the land cotton gin a hand operated machine that cleans seeds and other unwanted material from cotton 19 4 economy of the south the souths economy was based on agriculture.
most white southerners were agrarians who favored a way of life based on farming.
this was especially true of rich plantation owners who did not have to do the hard work of growing crops themselves.
although most white southerners worked their own small farms plantation owners used slaves to grow such cash crops as tobacco rice sugarcane and indigo.
by the early 1790s however the use of slaves had begun to decline.
europeans were unwilling to pay high prices for tobacco and rice which they could purchase more cheaply from other british colonies.
cotton was a promising crop but growers who experimented with it had a hard time making a profit.
until someway was found to clean the seeds out of its fiber easily cotton was of little value.
discouraged planters were buying fewer slaves and even letting some go free.
in 1793 a young yale graduate named eli whitney took a job tutoring children on a georgia plantation.
there he saw his first cotton boll.
observing the way cotton was cleaned by hand whitney had an idea.
if a machine could be invented which would clean the cotton with expedition speed he wrote his father it would be a great thing to the country i whitney set to work.
six months later he had a working machine that would change agriculture in the south.
the impact of the cotton gin whitneys cotton engine called the cotton gin for short was a simple machine that used rotating combs to separate cotton fiber from its seeds.
using a cotton gin a single worker could clean as much cotton as 50 laborers working manually or by hand.
across the south planters began growing cotton.
within ten years cotton was the souths most important crop.
by 1860 sales of cotton overseas earned more than all other u s exports combined.
the cotton gin invented in 1793 made the process of separating cotton fiber from the seeds quicker and easier.
as a result cotton quickly became the most important crop in the south.
358 chapter 19 u s agriculture 1860 expanding demand for land and slaves raising cotton in the same fields year after year soon wore out the soil.
in search of fresh fertile soil cotton planters pushed west.
by 1850 cotton plantations stretched from the atlantic coast to texas.
whitney had hoped his invention would lighten the work of slaves.
instead it made slavery more important to the south than ever.
as cotton spread westward slavery followed.
between 1790 and 1850 the number of slaves in the south rose from 500 000 to more than 3 million.
with many white southerners putting money into land and slaves the south had little interest in building factories.
as a result wrote an alabama newspaper we purchase all our luxuries and necessities from the north the slaveholder dresses in northern goods rides in a northern saddle sports his northern carriage reads northern hooks.
in northern vessels his products are carried to market.
one successful southern factory was the tredegar iron works in richmond virginia.
using mostly slave labor the factory made ammunition and weapons for the u s army as well as steam engines rails and locomotives.
but the vast majority of white southerners made their living off the land.
this map shows the primary agricultural products of the united states in 1860.

the worlds of north and south 3j industrial revolution the dramatic change in economies and cultures brought about by the use of machines to do work formerly done by hand industrialist a person whose wealth comes from the ownership of industrial businesses and who favors government policies that support industry 19 5 economy of the north while the cotton gin made cotton the south s dominant crop other types of machines were causing changes in the north.
the people and the ideas behind these machines were part of the industrial revolution which began in england in the late 1700s and spread to the united states and the rest of the world by the early 1800s.
during the industrial revolution people shifted from making things and doing work by hand to making things and doing work with machines.
it created a new class of workers as well as a new class of industrialists owners of large factories and other businesses based on manufacturing.
the growth of industry in the north one of the people who helped bring the industrial revolution to the united states was francis cabot lowell a boston business owner.
in 1810 lowell visited england.
there he saw how textile mill owners were using machines to spin cotton into thread and weave the thread into cloth.
to power these devices they used fast moving streams to turn a wheel which in turn supplied energy to the machinery.
lowell memorized the design of the british machines.
when he returned to massachusetts he built even better ones.
by 1815 he and his partners had built one of the first american textile factories along the merrimack river outside boston.
this factory combined spinning and weaving machinery in the same building.
one observer marveled that lowell s mill took your bale of cotton in at one end and gave out yards of cloth at the other after goodness knows what digestive process the fast flowing rivers of the north provided the power source fortextile mills like the one pictured here.

5ses e t i to run his machinery lowell hired young women who jumped at the chance to earn cash wages.
the lowell girls toiled 12 to 15 hours each day with only sundays off.
soon textile mills were springing up all along other northern rivers.
by the 1830s inventors in both the united states and europe had learned to use steam engines to power machinery.
with steam engines businesspeople could build factories anywhere not just along rivers.
meanwhile the inventive eli whitney showed manufacturers how they could assemble products even more cheaply by making them from identical interchangeable parts.
new inventions and manufacturing methods made goods cheaper and more plentiful.
but these innovations also shifted work from skilled craftspeople to less skilled laborers.
when elias howe developed the sewing machine in 1846 for example skilled seamstresses could not compete.
some took jobs in garment factories but they earned much less money working the sewing machines than they had sewing by hand.
for northern industrialists the new machines and production methods were a source of great wealth.
factory owners tended to favor a strong national government that could promote improvements m manufacturing trade and transportation.
southern agrarians however looked down on the newly rich industrialists and the labor ers who worked for them.
proud southerners called factory workers wage slaves but they also worried that northern interests might grow too powerful and threaten the south s way of life.
factories such as this one produced more goods and made them more affordable.
however they also put many skilled craftspeople out of work.

what relationship do you see between where coal and iron ore are found and where industries are primarily located.
machines make agriculture more efficient the industrial revolution had effects on farming as well.
new machines increased the rate at which agricultural goods could be produced.
in 1831 virginia farmer cyrus mccormick built a working model of a rigf smart machine called a reaper.
a reaper could cut 28 times more grain than a single man using a scythe which is a hand tool with a long curved blade.
in 1847 mccormick built a reaper factory in chicago illinois.
using interchangeable parts his factory was soon producing several thousand reapers a year.
around the same time john deere invented the steel tipped ph1 this innovation drastically reduced the amount of labor needed to plow a field.
by making it easier to plant and harvest large quantities of wheat inventions like the steel tipped plow and the reaper helped transform the central plains into americas bread basket thanks to the industrial revolution the northern economy gre rapidly after 1800.
by i860 the value of manufacturing in the north was ten times greater than in the south.
362 chapter 19 19 6 transportation in the north factory owners needed fast inexpensive ways to deliver their goods to distant customers.
south carolina congressman john c calhoun had a solution.
let us bind the republic together he said with a perfect system of roads and canals calhoun called such projects internal improvements.
building better roads in the early 1800s most american roads were rutted boneshakers.
in 1806 congress funded the construction of a national road across the appalachian mountains.
the purpose of this highway was to connect the new western states with the east.
with its smooth gravel surface the national road was a joy to travel.
as popular as the national road was in 1816 president james monroe vetoed a bill that would have given states money to build more roads.
monroe argued that spending federal money for a states internal improvements was unconstitutional.
fast ships and canals even with better roads river travel was still faster and cheaper than travel by land.
but moving upstream against a rivers current was hard work.
to solve this problem inventors in both the united states and europe experimented with boats powered by steam engines.
in 1807 robert fulton showed that steamboats were practical by racing the steamboat clermont upstream on new yorks hudson river.
said fulton i overtook many boats and passed them as if they had been at anchor a dutchman watching the strange craft from the shore shouted the devil is on his way up river with a sawmill on a boat by the 1820s smoke belching steamboats were chugging up and down major rivers and across the great lakes.
many new and fasterforms of transportation were put to use in the north how many of them can you identify in this painting.
the worlds of north and south of course rivers werent always located where people needed them.
in 1817 the state of new york hired engineers and workers to build a 363 mile canal from the hudson river to lake erie.
the erie canal provided the first all water link between farms on the central plains and east coast cities.
it was so successful that other states built canals as well.
overseas traders also needed faster ways to travel.
sailing ships sometimes took so long to cross the pacific ocean that the goods they carried spoiled.
in the 1840s sleek clipper ships were introduced that cut ocean travel time in half.
the clipper ships led to increased northern trade with foreign ports around the world.
this map shows the locations of railroads in 1860.
notice thatthe railroad lines in the north connectto one another more than those in the south.
how might this difference have affected the growth of trade and industry in the two areas.
traveling by rail the future of transportation however lay noton water but on rails.
inspired by the success of steamboats inventors developed steam powered locomotives.
these trains traveled faster than steamboats and could go wherever tracks could be laid even across mountains.
so many railroad companies were laying tracks that by the 1840s railroads were the norths biggest business.
by 1860 more than 20 000 miles of rail linked northern factories to cities hundreds of miles away.
u s railroads 1860 364 chapter 19 19 7 transportation in the south most of the rail lines in the united states were in the north.
in the south people and goods continued to move on rivers.
the slow current and broad channels of southern rivers made water travel easy and relatively cheap.
cotton was the most important southern product shipped by water.
on plantation docks slaves loaded cotton bales directly onto steam powered riverboats.
the riverboats then traveled hundreds of miles downstream to such port cities as savannah georgia or mobile alabama.
west of the appalachians most cotton moved down the mississippi river the largest of all the southern waterways.
the cotton boom made new orleans the port at the mouth of the mississippi one of the souths few big cities.
once the cotton reached the sea it was loaded onto sailing ships headed for ports in england or the north.
because river travel was the souths main form of transportation most southern towns and cities sprang up along waterways.
with little need for roads or canals to connect these settlements southerners opposed bills in congress that would use federal funds for internal improvements.
such projects they believed would benefit the north for more than the south.
some railroads were built in the south including lines that helped southern farmers ship their products to the north.
southerners were pfoud of the fact that the iron rails for many of the areas railroads came from virginias tredegar iron works.
still in 1860 the south had just 10 000 miles of rail compared with over 20 000 miles in the north.
this photograph shows products being loaded onto steam powered riverboats.
what geographic feature of the south made riverboats the most practical way to transport goods.
the worlds of north and south the granger collection new york wealthy southern planters modeled their homes and lives on european nobility.
their large mansions had tall columns and fancy gardens.
most southern whites however owned or worked on small farms with few of the luxuries enjoyed by the rich.
19 8 society in the south for the most part the south was not greatly affected by the jacksonian spirit of equality and opportunity or the reform movements of the mid 1800s.
many southerners in 1860 still measured wealth in terms of land and slaves.
the result was a rigid social structure with a few rich plantation owners at the top white farmers and workers in the middle and african americans mostly enslaved at the bottom.
slavery deeply affected the lives of all southerners black and white.
as long as the slave economy could be preserved the south had little incentive to make progress economically or culturally.
even religion was affected.
southern church leaders defended the practice taking a position that divided them from many churches in the north whose leaders taught that slavery was un christian.
in the words of one historian the south grew but it did not develop white southerners a small group of wealthy plantation owners dominated the economy and politics of the south.
they enjoyed a leisurely way of life filled with parties and social visits.
while their sons often went to colleges and universities their daughters received little education.
instead girls were brought up to be wives and hostesses.
most white families owned some land but only about one in four owned even one slave.
the majority of white families worked their own fields and made most of what they needed themselves.
about 10 percent of whites were too poor to own any land.
they rented rugged mountain or forest land and paid the rent with the crops they raised.

by 1860 about seven in ten northerners still lived on farms.
but more and more northerners were moving to towns and cities.
between 1800 and 1850 the number of cities with populations of at least 2 500 had increased from 33 to 237.
except for a few cities around the great lakes such as chicago and detroit nearly all of the 50 largest urban areas were in the northeast.
only 12 were in the slave states of the south.
and northern cities were growing rapidly.
between 1840 and 1860 the populations of new york philadelphia and boston nearly tripled.
by 1860 more than a million people lived in new york.
new or old northern cities often lacked sewers and paved streets.
in dirty and crowded neighborhoods diseases spread rapidly.

although blacks in the north were free they were not treated as equal to whites.
in most states they could not vote hold office serve on juries or attend white churches and schools.
in 1860 most northerners still lived on farms but more and more people were moving to towns and cities like this one.
these cities often sprang up near factories and railroad hubs.

immigrant a person who moves from one country to another.
such a movement is called immigration.
immigrants arrive in the north between 1845 and 1860 four million immigrants most of them from ireland and germany swelled the north s growing population.
in ireland a potato famine from 1845 to 1849 drove hundreds of thousands of families to the united states.
in the german states failed revolutions sent people fleeing overseas.
some immigrants had enough money to buy land and farm.
but most settled in cities where they found jobs in mills and factories.
some americans resented the newcomers especially the irish.
irish immigrants faced hostility because they were roman catholic.
the united states at the time was mostly protestant.
in addition many irish immigrants were poor.
because they would accept very low wages they were thought to take jobs away from native born workers.
german immigrants did not experience the same hostility that irish immigrants endured.
most german immigrants were protestant and middle class.
between 1820 and 1860 more than one third of all u s immigrants came from ireland.
more than 1 million irish immigrants came to the united states between 1846 and 1855.

8 chapter 19 chapter summary in this chapter you learned how the north and the south developed differently from each other in the first half of the 1800s.
geography geography was one reason why northerners and southerners developed different ways of life.
in the north physical features such as harbors encouraged the growth of shipbuilding fishing and commerce.
the land and climate supported the harvesting of timber and such crops as corn and wheat.
in the south the climate and land was ideal for warm weather crops like cotton rice and sugarcane.
economy in contrast to the variety of trades and businesses in the north the south depended primarily on agriculture.
although only a minority of white southerners owned slaves much of the souths economy depended on slave labor.
in the north the new inventions of the industrial revolution led to the development of mills and factories.
increasing numbers of people went to work as wage earners.
transportation steamboats and railroads improved transportation for northerners making it easier for them to travel and to ship goods over long distances.
in the south however people continued to travel by river and rail lines were fewer.
society in the south the wealthy few enjoyed great influence and power.
but even the poorest whites ranked above african americans whether free or slave.
the north too had its wealthy class.
but farmers and laborers alike believed they could create comfortable lives for their families through hard work.

the mill girls of lowell in the first half of the 1800s factory work gave girls and young women a taste of city life.
many of these young women came from farms to work in new england s textile mills.
they wanted to earn money.
they also wanted to find adventure in the cities that were growing up around the factories.
row after row of looms line the huge wooden floor of a red brick factory building.
long pulleys connect the looms to the ceiling and their power source.
during a workday hundreds of machines are running at one time.
the racket is deafening.
clouds of cotton dust foul the air.
the factory has huge glass windows but they are kept closed so the air stays humid.
that keeps the threads from breaking as machines turn them into cloth.
it is 1850.
over a mile of five and six story red brick buildings line the banks of the merrimack river in lowell massachusetts.
six miles of canals run waterwheels for the 40 mill buildings.
in the buildings the waterwheels power 10 000 looms and 320 000 spindles.
more than 10 000 people work in the factories of the young city.
every week lowells mills produce nearly a million yards or 568 miles of cloth.
the cloth is made of cotton.
the cotton has traveled hundreds of miles by ship or rail from the south.
northern textile manufacturers including those who own the factories in lowell get virtually all their cotton from the south where african american slaves have planted tended harvested and cleaned it.
on the factory floor workers dart quickly back and forth between machines so they can tend more than one at a time.
most of the workers are girls and women.
many have left family farms across new england to make a new life in lowell and other cities that had sprouted up along new englands rivers.
factory work was difficult but great rewards waited for the women who worked in the mills.
money culture and independence changed the lives of countless farm girls who for a while at least became factory workers.
the mill girl workforce in big bold letters the recruiting notice announced jobs for 75 young women in the cotton mills in lowell and chicopee massachusetts.
the women would commit to work for a year.
in exchange they would earn a dollar a week paid in cash every month.
today the promise of a factory job might not seem so inviting but it was quite appealing in the 1830s.
the factories had an almost magnetic pull for many young women especially those who had been raised on chapter 19 new england farms.
if they stayed on the farms most of them could count on marrying having children and working on the farm their whole lives.
and farming in new england challenged even the hardiest workers.
the population was growing making land scarce.
the soil was rocky and the growing season was short.
more and more people were looking elsewhere for work to crafts to the west or to the cities.
answering the call of the factory recruiter promised something new different and profitable.
one young woman sally rice left her family in vermont eventually to work in a factory in connecticut.
in a letter written in 1839 she explained her reasons for leaving home.
i can never be happy there in among so many mountains.
i am aljmost 19 years old.
i must of course have something of my own before many years have passed over my head.
and where is that something coming from if i go home and earn nothing you may think me unkind but how can you blame me for wanting to stay here.
i have but one life to live and i want to enjoy myself as well as i can while i live.
many other women shared sally rices feelings and like her they went to work in the factories.
while most of the women who first staffed the factories came from farms some girls came for other reasons.
harriet hansons mother moved to lowell from boston with her four small children after her husband died.
harriet started working at the mills when she was ten years old.
after lucy larcoms mother was widowed she moved the family to lowell from a nearby town.
lucy started working in a factory when she was 11.
at the very least life in the mills offered girls and women survival.
at the most it promised a chance to have something of their own in cluding adventure before they settled down and married.
this lowell mil girl was photographed at her loom in 1850.
on 10 000 looms like this one mill workers produced more than 500 miles of cloth every week.
8 1 h monthly magazine the lowell offering published the writings of the factory girls.
the writers told of their lives and the working conditions in lowell.
a mill girl s life in the 1830s it would not have been considered proper for a young woman to move to a city alone without an adult chaperone.
the mill owners had to find a way to make the move to factory life feel safe for their workers and to reassure the workers parents.
they also wanted to make sure the workers were well disciplined so that they would be efficient.
for those reasons the manufacturing companies built boarding houses.
the young women lived there under the protective watch of an older woman.
they ate their meals at the boarding house slept there and often became friends with other boarders.
one lowell mill worker wrote to her father in new hampshire that i have a very good boarding place.
the girls are all kind and obliging.
the girls that i room with are all from vermont and good girls too the mill girls had opportunities in lowell that they would never have had on the farm.
they could attend lectures and plays and join literary discussion groups and libraries.
and their wages allowed them to shop.
one woman whose sister worked in lowell described how the women who went to the factories came home changed they went in their plain country made clothes and after working several months would come home for a visit or perhaps to be married in their tasteful city dresses and with more money in their pockets than they had ever owned before young women in lowell even started their own magazine the lowell offering.
from 1840 to 1845 the girls wrote essays stories and poems.
some of their writing told about how much they liked their lives in lowell.
other pieces told stories about women coming to work in the mills so they could help their families out of financial problems.
but when historians looked at other sources like bank accounts they discovered that most of the mill girls were not helping their families at all.
instead they were saving money to use later for school clothes or a dowry money they would bring to a marriage.
chapter 19 hard work at the mills the mill girls enjoyed the opportunities they had in lowell and other mill towns.
but they had to work very hard in the factories to support themselves.
workdays were long and ruled by the bell.
in the summer the wake up bell rang at 4 30 a m twenty minutes later the girls reported to work.
they had a half hour break for breakfast and another for dinner.
dinner was the afternoon meal.
they did not finish their workday until 7 p m not only were the workdays long but the work was hard.
harriet hanson described her work as a doffer.
doffers were the youngest girls.
their job was to take bobbins that had filled with yarn off the machines and replace them with empty ones.
she remembered her job many years later i can see myself now racing down the alley between the spinning frames carrying in front of me a bobbin box bigger than i was.
doffers had to be very swift in their movements so as not to keep the spinning frames stopped long.
harriet h robinson loom spindle or life among the early mill girls 1898 lucy larcom described being overwhelmed by a machine she was supposed to tend it had to be watched in a dozen directions every minute she wrote.
i felt as if the half live creature with its great groaning joints and whizzing fan was aware of my incapacity to manage it the mill work got more demanding for women over time.
company owners wanted to make more money so they increased the amount of work the women had to do and lowered their wages.
the mill girls did not simply accept such changes.
several times they went out on strike to protest pay cuts and increases in the fees they paid to live in the boarding houses.
the women described themselves as daughters of freemen their ancestors had fought to be free from english rule they said.
they believed that the factory owners actions interfered with their freedom and so they rebelled.
over time mill girls began to leave the factories finding better opportunities elsewhere.

chapter 18 an era of reform to what extent did the reform movements of the mid 1800s improve life for americans.
18 1 introduction in 1851 a group of people gathered in a church in ohio to discuss the rights of women.
a tall african american woman made her way through the crowd and sat down.
her name was sojourner truth.
a former slave she had learned to pay careful attention to white people.
now she listened as whites discussed whether women should have the same rights as men.
truth heard one speaker after another explain that women didnt need more rights because they werent smart or strong enough to do much besides raise children.
women they argued needed help from men.
one man summed it up by saying women are weak truth had heard enough.
she rose slowly to her feet and walked to the pulpit.
the room grew quiet as everyone waited for her to speak.
that man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages and lifted over ditches and have the best place everywhere she began.
nobody ever helps me into carriages or over mud puddles or gives me any best place her voice rose to a thunderous pitch.
and aint i a woman.
look at me.
look at my arm.
i have plowed and planted and gathered into barns and no man could head outdo me.
and aint i a woman.
i could work as much and eat as much as a man when i could get it and bear the lash as well.
and aint i a woman.
i have borne thirteen children and seen them most all sold into slavery and when i cried out with my mothers grief none but jesus heard me.
and ain 11 a woman.
when she finished people applauded.
some cried.
one witness said she had taken us up in her strong arms and carried us safely.
sojourner truth represented two of the great reform movements in america in the 1800s the movement for womens equality and the movement to end slavery.
between about 1820 and 1850 many americans devoted themselves to such causes as ending slavery promoting womens rights and improving education.
in this chapter you will learn to what extent these reform movements improved life for americans.

an era of reform reform to make changes in order to bring about improvement end abuses or correct injustices 18 2 the spirit of reform it was fitting that the meeting attended by sojourner truth took place in a church.
new religious movements played a key role in inspiring thousands of americans to try to reform society.
second great awakening a revival of religious feeling and belief from the 1800s to the 1840s preachers at religious meetings like this one proclaimed that people could help earn their salvation by doing good works.
this message encouraged many people to work to improve society.
the second great awakening a revival of religious feeling swept across the nation from the 1800s to the 1840s.
church leaders called this period the second great awakening.
day after day people gathered in churches and big white tents to hear messages of hope.
preachers like charles g finney a leader of the movement urged christians to let themselves be filled with the spirit of god their listeners prayed shouted and sang hymns.
sometimes they cried for hours or fell down in frenzies.
like the great awakening during the 1730s and 1740s this religious revival appealed to peoples emotions.
but the second great awakening offered something new.
in the past most christian ministers had said that god had already decided who would be saved.
now many preachers said everyone could gain forgiveness for their sins.
many of them taught that doing good works could help them to be saved.
this optimistic message attracted enthusiastic followers throughout the west and north.
it gave men and women alike a reason to work for the improvement of society.
charles finneys preaching for example inspired many people to oppose slavery.
340 chapter 18 optimistic ideas other optimistic ideas also inspired americans during this time.
in new england ralph waldo emerson a former minister was the central figure in a movement called transcendentalism.
emerson believed that every human being has unlimited potential.
but to realize their godlike nature people have to transcend or go beyond purely logical thinking.
they can find the answers to lifes mysteries only by learning to trust their emotions and intuition.
transcendentalists added to the spirit of reform by urging people to question societys rules and institutions.
do not conform to others expectations they said.
if you want to find god and your own true self look to nature and the god within emersons friend henry david thoreau captured this new individualism in a famous essay.
if a man does not keep pace with his companions wrote thoreau perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.
let him step to the music which he hears thoreau practiced what he preached.
in 1845 he went into the woods near concord massachusetts to live alone and as close to nature as possible.
thoreau spent more than two years in solitude recording his thoughts in a 6 000 page journal.
in 1846 he was jailed overnight for refusing to pay taxes because of his opposition to the governments involvement in the mexican american war.
model communities while thoreau tried to find the ideal life in solitude other transcendentalists tried to create ideal communities.
in 1841 george ripley started a community called brook farm near boston.
residents at brook farm tried to live in brotherly cooperation instead of competing with each other as people in the larger society did.
they shared the labor of supporting themselves by farming teaching and making clothes.
brook farm was only one of hundreds of model communities started by reformers in the first half of the 1800s.
most of these experiments lasted only a few years.
but they were a powerful expression of the belief that people of good will could create an ideal society.
18 3 prison reform one day in 1841 a boston woman named dorothea dix agreed to teach sunday school at a jail.
what she witnessed that day changed her life forever.
dix was horrified to see that many prisoners were bound in chains and locked in cages.
children accused of minor thefts were jailed with adult criminals.
were conditions this bad everywhere.
dix devoted herself to finding out the answer to her question.
she visited hundreds of jails and prisons throughout massachusetts.
she also visited debtors prisons or jails for people who owed money.
most of the thousands of americans in debtors prisons owed less than 20 dollars.
while they were locked up they could not earn money to repay their debts.
as a result they remained imprisoned for years.

there he meditated on the meaning of his life society nature and the human spirit.
an era of reform 34 dorothea dix worked tirelessly to improve conditions for prisoners and the mentally ill.
treatment of the mentally hi what shocked dix most of all was the way mentally ill people were treated.
most were locked in dirty crowded prison cells.
if they misbehaved they were whipped.
dix and other reformers believed that the mentally ill needed treatment and care not punishment.
massachusetts had one private asylum or hospital for the mentally ill only the wealthy could afford to send a family member there.
even so the asylum was filled to overflowing.
campaigning for better conditions for two years dix gath ered information about the horrors she had seen.
then she prepared a detailed report for the massachusetts state legislature.
i come as the advocate of helpless forgotten insane men and women she said.
i proceed to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined in cages closets cellars stalls pens.
chained naked beaten with rods and lashed into obedience shocked by dix s report the lawmakers voted to create public asylums for the mentally ill dix visited prisons in other states as well.
after she prepared reports demanding humane treatment for the mentally ill those states also created special mental hospitals.
dix continued campaigning for prison reform for the rest of her life.
by the time she died in 1887 state governments no longer put debtors in prison.
most states had created special justice systems for children in trouble.
many had outlawed cruel punishments such as branding people with hot irons.
dix had shown that reformers could lead society to make significant changes.
18 4 education reform a second reform movement that won support in the 1800s was the effort to make education available to more children.
the man who would become known as the father of american public schools horace mann led this movement.
the need for public schools as a boy in massachusetts in the early 1800s horace mann attended school only ten weeks a year.
the rest of the time he had to work on his familys farm.
mann was lucky to have even this limited time in school.
in massachusetts puritans had established town schools but few other areas had public schools or schools paid for by taxes.
wealthy parent t children to private schools or hired tutors.
on the frontier c lldren might attend a part time one room school.
their teacher a mutededucation and received little pay.
most children simply di not go to school at all.
r t es some poor children stole destroyed property and set res.
e ormers believed that education would help these children escape poverty and become good citizens.
influenced by the need for in everv t m tlcsnew york set up public elementary schools in every town as early as the 1820s.
342 chapter 18 meanwhile in massachusetts mann became the states supervisor of education.
in towns and villages he spoke out on the need for public schools.
our means of education he stated are the grand machinery by which the raw material of human nature can be worked up into inventors and discoverers into skilled artisans and scientific farmers citizens in massachusetts responded to manns message.
they voted to pay taxes to build better schools to provide teachers with higher salaries and to establish special training schools for teachers.
an unfinished reform by 1850 many states in the north and west used manns ideas.
soon most white children especially boys attended free public schools.
but states still did not offer public education to everyone.
most high schools and colleges did not admit girls.
states as far north as illinois passed laws to keep african americans out of public schools.
when towns did allow blacks to attend school most made them go to separate schools that received less money.
in the south few girls and no african americans could attend public schools.
education for girls and women did make some progress.
in 1837 oberlin college in ohio became the first college to admit women as well as men.
when states opened the first public universities in the 1860s most accepted female students.
african americans however had few options.
when prudence crandall admitted a black student to her girls school in connecticut in 1833 white parents took their children out of the school.
crandall responded by opening a school for african american girls.
angry white people threw stones at the school and had crandall jailed.
in 1834 she was forced to close her school.
horace mann realized that much more needed to be done to increase educational opportunities for women and african americans.
in 1853 he became the first president of a new college for men and women antioch college in ohio.
there he urged his students to become involved in improving society.
be ashamed to die he fold them until you have won some victory for humanity the granger collection newyork an era of reform 34 abolitionist a person who supported abolition or the ending of slavery 18 5 the movement to end slavery in 1835 a poster appeared on walls throughout washington d c.
the poster showed two drawings.
one drawing labeled the land of the free showed the founding fathers reading the declaration of independence.
the other labeled the home of the oppressed showed slaves trudging past the u s capitol building the home of congress.
the poster posed a challenging question how could america the land of the free still allow slavery.
by the 1830s growing numbers of people were asking this question.
these people were called abolitionists.
the struggle begins some americans had opposed slavery even before the american revolution began.
quakers stopped owning slaves in 1776.
by 1792 every state as far south as virginia had antislavery societies.
congress passed a law that ended the atlantic slave trade in 1808.
once it became illegal to import slaves northern shipping communities had no more interest in slavery.
northern textile mills however wanted the cheap cotton that slave labor in the south provided.
although slavery ended in the north by the early 1800s many northerners still accepted slavery.
abolitionists wanted to end slavery but they did not always agree about how to do it.
some abolitionists tried to inspire slaves to rise up in revolt.
others wanted to find a peaceful way to end slavery immediately.
still others wanted to give slaveholders time to develop farming methods that didnt rely on slave labor.
from its earliest days both blacks and whites worked in the abolition movement sometimes together sometimes separately.
black activists often kept their distance from their white counterparts.
one african american journalist remarked as long as we let them think and act for us they will outwardly treat us as men while in their hearts they still hold us as slaves in 1831 a deeply religious white man william lloyd garrison started a fiery abolitionist newspaper the liberator.
344 chapter 18 william lloyd garrison above left published a newspaper called the liberator s the 1830s.
his newspaper called for not only an end to slavery but full equality for african americans.
the abolition movement gained public attention through garrison s articles.
braving the disapproval of many northerners garrison demanded the immediate freeing of all slaves.
1 will be as harsh as truth he wrote.
i will not retreat a single inch and i will be heard angry proslavery groups destroyed garrison s printing press and burned his house.
frederick douglass speaks out one day gar rison heard an escaped slave frederick douglass speaking at a meeting of abolitionists.
over six feet tall douglass spoke with a voice like thunder.
when he described the cruel treatment of enslaved children people cried.
when he made fun of ministers who told slaves to love slavery people laughed.
when he finished garrison jumped up and cried shall such a man be held a slave in a christian land the crowd called out no.
no douglass quickly became a leader in the abolitionist movement.
his autobiography published in 1845 was an instant best seller.
a brilliant and independent thinker douglass eventually started his own newspaper north star.
its motto read right is of no sex truth is of no color god is the father of us all and we are all brethren brothers women get involved many women were inspired by religious reform movements to become involved in the fight against slavery.
like other abolitionists they sometimes faced violence.
when a young woman named angelina grimke spoke against slavery an anti abolition mob threw stones at her.
when she kept speaking they burned the building she was speaking in.
angelina and her sister sarah had been raised in a south carolina slaveholding family.
after traveling north and becoming quakers they saw slavery in a new way.
in the 1830s the two sisters began speaking out about the poverty and pain of slavery.
at first they spoke only to other women but soon they were addressing large groups of men and women throughout the north.
the grimkes led the way for other women to speak in public.
some abolitionists like sojourner truth were former slaves.
truth had always been strongly spiritual and had preached throughout the north at religious meetings and on street corners.
when she met douglass and garrison their enthusiasm inspired her to speak out loudly about slavery.
an outstanding speaker truth argued that god would end slavery peacefully.
abolitionists were a minority even in the north.
but their efforts and the violence directed at them helped change northerners attitudes toward slavery.
in addition the antislavery fight helped pave the way for the next great reform movement the struggle for women s rights.
frederick douglass a former slave was an important leader in the abolitionist movement.
through his writings and speeches he waged a fierce campaign against slavery.
an era of reform 345x photograph 2010 museum of fine arts bostor in this painting from about 1850 women are represented in traditional ways shy in the background or serving men.
during the mid 1800s many women began to work to change the way women were viewed.
18 6 equal rights for women women abolitionists were in a strange position.
they were trying to convince lawmakers to make slavery illegal yet they themselves could not vote or hold office.
they worked to raise money for the movement yet their fathers and husbands controlled their money and property.
they spoke out against slave beatings yet their husbands could discipline them however they wanted.
even wealthy women like the grimke sisters started to see that women and slaves had much in common.
what then can woman do for the slave asked angelina grimke when she is herself under the feet of man and shamed into silence the movement begins the organized movement for womens rights was sparked by the friendship between lucretia mott and elizabeth cady stanton.
the two women met in 1840 at the world anti slavery convention in london.
when they arrived they were outraged to discover that women were not allowed to speak at the meeting.
the men who ran the convention made women sit in the balcony behind a curtain.
the mens decision may have backfired because it was in the balcony that mott and stanton met.
at first glance the two women seemed quite different.
mott was 47 years old the mother of four children and an active reformer.
inspired by the grimke sisters and her quaker faith mott had preached against slavery in both white and black churches.
she had also helped prudence crandall try to find students for her school for black girls.
chapter 18 stanton was 25 years old and newly married.
she had never spoken in public.
as a young girl she had overheard women beg her father a judge to protect them from husbands who had beaten them.
he had to tell them that there was no law against it.
later she attended troy female seminary the nations first high school for girls.
she knew from her history studies that the united states did not treat women fairly.
when she met mott in london she readily agreed that something had to be done about the injustices suffered by women.
unequal treatment of women even a fine education like stantons did not mean women would receive equal treatment.
when lucy stone graduated from oberlin college in 1847 the faculty invited her to write a speech.
but a man would have to give the speech since the school did not allow women to speak in public.
stone refused.
after graduation she spoke out for womens rights.
because women could not vote she refused to pay property taxes.
women suffer taxation she said and yet have no representation stones sister in law elizabeth blackwell wanted to be a doctor.
she had studied mathematics science and history.
yet she was rejected by 29 medical schools before one finally accepted her.
in 1849 she graduated at the top of her class becoming the countrys first female doctor.
still no hospitals or doctors would agree to work with her.
to overcome such barriers women would have to work together.
by the time stanton and mott left london they had decided to hold a convention and form a society to advocate the rights of women.
lucretia mott on the left and elizabeth cady stanton on the right met at an anti slavery convention in 1840.
their friendship helped spark the organized movement for women s rights.
an era ofreforin seneca falls convention the gathering of supporters of womens rights in july 1848 that launched the movement for womens right to vote declaration of sentiments a formal statement of injustices suffered by women written by the organizers of the seneca falls convention.
sentiments means beliefs or convictions the seneca falls convention eight years passed before stanton and mott met again.
over afternoon tea at the home of motts sister they decided to send a notice to the local newspaper announcing a womens convention in seneca falls new york.
the organized movement for womens rights was about to begin.
on july 19 1848 nearly 300 people including 40 men arrived for the seneca falls convention.
many were abolitionists quakers or other reformers.
some were local housewives farmers and factory workers.
the convention organizers modeled their proposal for womens rights the declaration of sentiments on the declaration of independence.
we hold these truths to be self evident the document began that all men and women are created equal just as the declaration of independence listed king georges acts of tyranny over the colonists the new declaration listed acts of tyranny by men over women.
man did not let woman vote.
he did not give her the right to own property.
he did not allow her to practice professions like medicine and law.
stantons presentation of the declaration at the convention was her first speech.
a few other women also spoke.
one of them charlotte woodward was a 19 year old factory worker.
every fibre of my being she said rebelled against all the hours that i sat and sewed gloves for a miserable pittance small amount of money which as it was earned could never be mine debate about the right to vote the conven tion passed resolutions in favor of correcting the injustices listed in the declaration of sentiments.
then stanton proposed that women demand the right to vote.
for many this step was too much.
even mott cried thou will make us ridiculous.
we must go slowly at this point stanton received powerful support from another participant at the convention frederick douglass.
everyone who believed that black men should have the right to vote douglass argued must also favor giving black women the right to vote.
and that meant all women should have this important right.
inspired by douglasss speech the convention voted narrowly to approve this last resolution.
elizabeth cady stanton on the left and susan b anthony on the right worked together in the campaign for women s rights.
stanton wrote powerful speeches which anthony traveled from town to town to deliver.
the legacy of seneca falls the seneca falls convention helped to create an orgamzed campaign for womens rights.
sojourner truth who would later mesmerize an audience with her aint i a woman speech became an active campaigner in the movement.
stanton didn t like speaking at conventions but she could write powerful speeches.
she befriended susan b anthony a reformer with a flair for public speaking.
while stanton stayed in seneca falls to raise her children anthony traveled from town to town speaking for womens rights.
of their lifelong teamwork stanton said i forged the thunderbolts she fired them slowly reformers for womens rights made progress.
new york gave women control over their property and wages.
massachusetts and indiana passed more liberal divorce laws.
elizabeth blackwell started her own hospital which included a medical school to train other female doctors.
other reforms including the right to vote in all states would take decades to become reality.
of all the women who signed the declaration at seneca falls just one would live to vote for president legally charlotte woodward.
chapter summary in this chapter you read about the reform movements in the united states from about 1820 to 1850.
the spirit of reform many americans were inspired by the second great awakening which emphasized the role of good works in the lives of christians.
transcendentalist writers like ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau who urged people to question societys rules and institutions also inspired americans.
some transcendentalists formed communities that attempted to create an ideal society of cooperation.
prison reform dorothea dix pioneered the reform of prisons and the treatment of people with mental illness.
her efforts led to improvements in state prison systems and the creation of public institutions and hospitals for the mentally ill education reform horace mann led the movement to make education freely available to all.
his ideas led many northern states to establish public schools.
education reform did not improve opportunities for most girls women and african americans however.
the movement to end slavery inspired in part by religious revivalism abolitionists worked to end the practice of slavery.
key leaders in the movement included william lloyd garrison frederick douglass angelina and sarah grimke and sojourner truth.
equal rights for women the womens rights movement began with the seneca falls convention and its declaration of sentiments.
elizabeth cady stanton and lucretia mott organized the convention.
susan b anthony was another key leader in the movement.
an era of reform 349 reading further to its founders brook farm was the ideal place for an ideal community.
their goal was to create a rural haven in an increasingly industrialized world.
brook farm and the utopian dream in the early 1800s social reformers were seeking ways to improve american life.
some were inspired by dreams of a perfect society.
they formed model or utopian communities based on principles they believed would lead to a better world.
one of the best known of these social experiments was brook farm in massachusetts.
in april 1841 the writer nathaniel hawthorne became a resident at brook farm.
he had not yet achieved the fame that would come with the publication of his novel the scarlet letter.
but he was well known in boston literary circles and had friends in the transcendentalist movement.
seeking a place to live and write he decided to join the brook farm community.
soon after his arrival hawthorne got his first taste of farm life.
i have done wonders he wrote about his first day of farm labor.
before breakfast i went out to the barn and began to chop hay for the cattle then i brought wood and replenished the fires and finally sat down to breakfast and ate up a huge mound of buckwheat cakes.
after breakfast mr ripley put a four pronged instrument into my hands which he gave me to understand was called a pitch fork and he and mr farley being armed with similar weapons we all three commenced a gallant attack upon a heap of manure.
nathaniel hawthorne from a letter to sophia peabody 1841 hawthorne was not used to this kind of work but he took to it with relish.
he even referred to the manure pile as the gold mine in a joking effort to glorify farmwork.
it was a delectable way of life he wrote.
we get up at half past six dine at half past twelve and go to bed at nine brook farm was one of more than a hundred utopian communities that sprang up across the country in the first half of the 1800s.
the word utopian comes from the 16th century book utopia which describes a perfect society on an imaginary island.
these communities were all based on ideals and practices aimed at building a new society free of social ills like poverty crime and injustice.
most of the communities had religious foundations.
but even those that did not like brook farm were meant to create a kind of heaven on earth.
the origins of brook farm george ripley a former minister founded brook farm with his wife sophia and several partners in march 1841.
ripley was concerned about the social problems he saw in urban industrial america.
he wanted to form a rural community where people could live a healthier 50 chapter 18 iiii life in harmony with nature.
he also wanted to bring different social classes together and help the working poor.
in a letter ripley expressed his goals for brook farm.
it would be a place he said to combine the thinker and the worker in the same individual to guarantee the highest mental freedom by providing all with labor adapted to their tastes and talents he said that he hoped to prepare a society of liberal intelligent and cultivated persons whose relations with each other would permit a more simple and wholesome life in ripleys vision residents at brook farm would enjoy the benefits of physical labor.
but they would also have time to take walks create art and music and converse.
it would be the perfect blend of work and play.
the community would support itself by selling goods produced on the farm.
everyone would share the profits equally.
these ideas reflected the eras reform spirit.
but they also arose from the special features of the transcendentalist movement.
tran scendentalists believed that people carried the light of god within them.
they could experi ence that light by opening up to the beauties of nature and a simpler life.
many young people at the time were also filled with the spirit of change or what they called the newness freedom was in the air.
young men grew beards and let their hair grow long.
they wore floppy hats and loose fitting clothes.
they embraced new ideas such as vegetarian diets and new ways of speaking.
this sense of freedom was reflected at brook farm.
the farm itself was set in beautiful rolling country just eight miles west of boston.
its 170 acres were dotted with woods pastures and meadows.
running through the property was a little brook that gave the farm its name.
a two story farmhouse became the principal residence.
residents called it the hive because it was the hub of activity.
there was also a large barn with stalls for cattle and horses.
brook farm was an ideal setting or a rural retreat.
gl brook farm was a pretty place that charmed nearly everyone who saw it.
a visitor painted this picture of the farm in 1848.
an era of reform keeping a good balance between work and play was important at brook farm.
providing food like milk and cheese for the community was essential but so was taking time for skating and other recreation.
life on the farm everyone at brook farm was expected to work.
but they were free to choose the kind of work they did.
women could plow the fields if they wanted and men could do housework.
all labor was sacred when done for a common interest wrote one resident.
everyone was paid the same and no one worked more than ten hours a day or six days a week.
at the time that was considered a short workweek.
most residents seemed to enjoy work on the farm.
one young woman marianne dwight took special pleasure in what she called fancy work sewing caps and other clothing for sale in boston.
she believed that the money and skills gained through this work would help aid the cause of womens rights.
we may start other branches of business she wrote in a letter so that all our proceeds may be applied to the elevation of women forever how the whole aspect of society will be changed residents at the farm did more than work.
they also held dances attended concerts and lectures and performed in plays.
during the winter they enjoyed snow sports like skating and sledding.
children attended a school on the farm.
the quality of education was excellent and the school soon attracted students from the surrounding area.
the school became the farms most profitable activity.
by the summer of 1842 70 people were living at brook farm.
most were not permanent residents however.
students and other temporary lodgers lived there as well.
many visitors also came to the farm including such noted figures as the writers ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau.
ther visitors were less notable and some were downright odd.
ere were dreamers and schemers of all sorts one resident wrote.
ample one visitor claimed he could survive without sleep until caught snoring in the library.
another claimed to live on a diet ot raw wheat.
but he was found behind the barn one day eating table scraps set out for the chickens.
x 2 chapter 18 although visitors paid for their stay on the farm they did not contribute labor.
the farm had to add new buildings to house them.
this placed a burden on the farms finances.
the end of the dream in fact brook farms finances had never been solid.
in the beginning ripley had asked members to invest in the farm but few had done so.
he had also hoped to sell farm products but few residents had any farming experience.
furthermore the farms soils were not very good for growing crops.
as a result the farm was always short of money.
residents began to drift away from the farm.
some complained of financial difficulties.
others tired of farmwork.
even nathaniel hawthorne lost his enthusiasm for farm life.
he left after six months saying he feared his soul might perish under a dung heap concerned about the future in 1844 ripley and other residents decided to reorganize the farm.
they established a new set of principles to promote small industry and put the farm on a firmer footing.
they invited new members to join including a number of craft workers and laborers.
they also began construction of a new much larger building and bought a steam engine to power new machinery.
to pay for these improvements the farm took out new loans.
before long however tensions developed in the community.
some members insisted on holding religious services which others opposed.
also some of the new members complained of poor treatment by the original members.
creditors began to demand repayment of loans.
i difficulties were mounting when disaster struck.
on march 3 1846 a fire broke out in the new building bbs and burned it to the ground.
after that more people chose to leave the community.
the ripleys and a handful of others stayed on until the fall of 1847.
then they too abandoned the farm.
despite its short history brook farm was not a total failure.
it changed the lives of many of its members and influenced various reform movements including the abolition and womens rights movements.
it also inspired many people 1 with its ideals of workplace equality and a simpler more sustainable life.
those ideals live on today.
unlike brook farm the utopian oneida community of new york developed various communal industries.
atthis sewing bee men and women make traveling bags.
from their profits the community members built a large mansion.
i l an era of reform 3e.
chapter 20 african americans in the mid 1800s how did african americans face slavery and discrimination in the mid 1800s.
20 1 introduction by 1850 the population of the united states had grown to just over 23 million.
this figure included 3 6 million african americans.
the great majority of african americans lived in slavery.
harriet powers the woman who created the quilt on the opposite page was one of them.
powers was born into slavery in georgia in 1837.
like many slaves she grew up hearing bible stories.
in her quilts she used animals and figures from africa and the united states to illustrate those stories along with scenes from her life.
hidden in her images were messages of hope and freedom for slaves.
not all african americans were slaves.
by mid century there were about half a million free blacks as well.
many were former slaves who had escaped to freedom.
whether african americans lived in slavery or freedom discrimination unequal treatment shaped their lives.
throughout the country whites looked down on blacks.
whites ignored the contributions blacks made to american life.
they thought of the united states as their country such racist thinking later prompted african american scholar and reformer w e b.
du bois to ask harriet powers s quilts are considered the best examples of 1800s southern quilting.
two of her quilts survive.
they are preserved in museums in washington d c and boston massachusetts.
above is a detail from the quilt at left.

how came it to be yours.
before the pilgrims landed we were here.
here we brought you our three gifts and mingled them with yours a gift of story and song soft stirring melody in an unmelodious land the gift of sweat and brawn physical strength to beat back the wilderness and lay the foundations of this vast economic empire.
the third a gift of the spirit.
in this chapter you will explore how african americans faced and endured discrimination and slavery in the mid 1800s.
you will also learn more about the gifts that african americans brought to america.
african americans in the mid 1800s 3j free african americans usually held low paying jobs.
the barber pictured here is one example.
the granger collection newyork racism the belief that one race is superior to another 20 2 north and south slave and free the experiences of african americans in the mid 1800s depended on where they lived and whether they lived in slavery or freedom.
former slave frederick douglass toured the north talking to white audiences about slavery.
to him the biggest difference between slaves and free blacks was their legal status.
free blacks had some rights by law.
slaves did not.
whether free or slave however the lives of african americans were shaped by racism the belief that one race is superior to another.
slaves legal status the law defined slaves as property.
legally slaveholders could do almost anything with their slaves.
they could buy and sell slaves.
they could leave slaves to their children or heirs.
they could give slaves away to settle a bet.
but in many states they could not set slaves free.
as property slaves had none of the rights that free people took for granted.
in law the slave has no wife no children no country no home douglass said.
he can own nothing possess nothing acquire nothing rural and urban slaves most slaves worked on farms and plantations across the south.
by 1860 there were also about 70 000 slaves living in towns and cities.
most were hired out or sent to work in factories mills or workshops.
the wages they earned belonged to their owners.
often urban slaves were allowed to live out on their own rather than under the watchful eyes of their owners.
because of such freedom observed douglass a city slave is almost a freeman compared with a slave on the plantation free blacks in the south about half of all free african americans lived in the south.
most worked as laborers craftspeople or household servants in towns and cities.
376 chapter 20 many white southerners viewed free blacks as a dangerous group that had to be controlled so that in the words of south carolina slaveholders they would not create discontent among our slaves free blacks were forbidden to own guns.
they could not travel freely from town to town or state to state.
blacks were not allowed to work at certain jobs.
such restrictions led douglass to conclude no colored man is really free in a slaveholding state free blacks in the north african americans in the north lived freer lives.
but blacks experienced discrimination or unequal treatment everywhere they turned.
in many states african americans were denied the right to vote.
they had trouble finding good jobs.
in the 1850s some 87 percent of free blacks in new york held low paying jobs.
why should i strive hard asked one young african american.
what are my prospects.
no one will employ me white boys wont work with me in addition to unequal treatment policies of segregation separated blacks from whites in nearly all public places.
black children were often denied entry into public schools.
those states that did educate black children set up separate schools for that purpose.
a new yorker observed around 1860 discrimination unequal treatment based on a persons race gender religion place of birth or other arbitrary characteristic segregation the social separation of groups of people especially by race even the noblest black is denied that which is free to the vilest worst white.
the omnibus the railroad car the ballot box the jury box the halls of legislation the army the public lands the school the church the lecture room the social circle the restaurant table are all either absolutely or virtually denied to him.
douglass discovered how deeply rooted this racism was when he ried to join a church in new bedford massachusetts and was turned way.
i tried all the other churches in new bedford with the same esult he wrote.
african americans responded to discrimination by organizing to teip themselves.
in 1816 richard allen a former slave became he first bishop of the african methodist episcopal church fhe ame which still exists today quickly became a enter of african american life.
allen also created rganizations to improve the lives of blacks such ls the african society for the education of youth.
other northern blacks started their own schools lurches and self help organizations.
in 1853 free tlacks formed the national council of colored peo le to protest the unequal treatment they received.
uch treatment the council declared would humble he proudest crush the energies of the strongest nd retard the progress of the swiftest that blacks vere neither humbled nor crushed by prejudice an hscrimination was evidence of their courage an sp lemuel haynes shown here preaching from a pulpit fought at lexington during the revolutionary war.
he was the first black minister of a white congregation.
grangerco ect on african americans in the mid 1800s 377 20 3 the economics of slavery only wealthier planters could afford to buy slaves.
the great majority of white southerners did not own slaves.
why then did the south remain so loyal to slavery.
part of the answer to that question lies in the growth of the southern economy after the invention of the cotton gin in 1793.
the cotton gin made cotton a hugely profitable cash crop in the south.
in 1790 the south produced just 3 000 bales of cotton.
by the 1850s production had soared to more than 4 million bales a year.
cotton brought new wealth to the south.
robert fogel a historian who has studied the economics of slavery wrote if we treat the north and south as separate nations the south would stand as the fourth most prosperous nation of the world in 1860 more prosperous than france germany denmark or any of the countries in europe except england.
whether they owned slaves or not white southerners understood that their economy depended on cotton.
they also knew that cotton planters depended on slave labor to grow their profitable crop.
for planters with few or no slaves however the prospect of owning slaves became less likely as the demand for and the price of slaves rose.
the south s economy depended upon slave labor to grow and harvest cotton the south s mostvaluable export.
er 20 the slave system 1801 1860 the map shows the increase in cotton production from the early to the mid 1800s.
the graph shows that by i860 the nation s slave population was concentrated in the south.
northern states had outlawed slavery by this time.
unorganized territory free states 90w total state populations 1860 cz3 03 w co c 03 source u s census bureau high prices were both good and bad for the men and women trapped in slavery.
as prices went up slaves became more valuable to their owners.
this may have encouraged slaveholders to take better care of their workers.
at the same time the rising value of their slaves made slaveholders less willing to listen to talk of ending slavery.
in their eyes freeing their slaves could only mean one thing utter financial ruin.

they might be beaten if they failed to pick their usual amount.
i i i 20 4 working conditions of slaves slaves worked on farms of various sizes.
on small farms owners and slaves worked side by side in the fields.
on large plantations planters hired overseers to supervise their slaves.
overseers were paid to care for nothing but to make a large crop to do this they tried to get the most work possible out of the slaves who worked in the fields.
about three quarters of rural slaves were field hands who toiled from dawn to dark tending crops.
an english visitor described a field hands day he is called up in the morning at day break and is seldom allowed time enough to swallow three mouthfuls of hominy boiled corn or hoecake cornbread but is driven out immediately to the field to hard labor.
about noon.
he eats his dinner and he is seldom allowed an hour for that purpose.
then they return to severe labor which continues until dusk.
even then a slaves workday was not finished.
after dark there was still water to carry wood to split pigs to feed corn to shuck cotton to clean and other chores to be done.
one slave recalled i never know what it was to rest.
i just work all the time from morning till late at night.
i had to do everything there was to do on the outside.
work in the field chop wood hoe corn till sometime i feels like my back surely break.
not all slaves worked in the fields.
some were skilled seamstresses carpenters or blacksmiths.
others worked in the masters house as cooks or servants.
when asked about her work a house slave replied what kind of work i did.
i cooked then i was house maid an i raised i don t know how many children.
i was always good when it come to the sick so that was mostly my job.
no matter how hard they worked slaves could never look forward to an easier life.
most began work at the age of six and continued until they died.
as one man put it slave young slave long chapter 20 20 5 living conditions of slaves most masters viewed their slaves as they did their land things to be worn out not improved they provided only what was needed to keep their slaves healthy enough to work.
slaves lived crowded together in rough cabins.
one recalled we lodged in log huts and on bare ground.
wooden floors were an unknown luxury.
in a single room were huddled like cattle ten or a dozen persons men women and children.
we had neither bedsteads nor furniture of any description.
our beds were collections of straw and old rags thrown down in the corners.
slaves seldom went hungry.
not to give a slave enough to eat reported frederick douglass is regarded as meanness stinginess even among slaveholders slaves received rations of cornmeal bacon and molasses.
many kept gardens or hunted and fished to vary their diets.
the owner described below fed his slaves well marse master alec had plenty for his slaves to eat.
there was meat bread collard greens snap beans waters peas all sorts of dried fruit and just lots of milk and butter.
slaves wore clothing made of coarse homespun linen or rough negro cloth northern textile mills made this cloth especially for slave clothes.
douglass reported that a field hand received a yearly allowance of two coarse linen shirts one pair of linen trousers one jacket one pair of trousers for winter made of coarse negro cloth one pair of stockings and one pair of shoes children too young to work received two coarse linen shirts per year.
when these failed them they went naked until the next year.
while slaves were poorly housed and clothed compared to most white southerners they were more likely to receive medical care.
slaveholders often hired doctors to treat sick or injured slaves.
given doctors limited medical knowledge this care probably did little to improve slaves health.
most slave cabins consisted of a single room where the entire family lived.
they had a fireplace for cooking and heat.
the windows usually had no glass.
african americans in the mid 1800s some slave owners beat or whipped slaves as a way of controlling them.
however most slave owners avoided savage beatings because injured slaves could not work and lash marks reduced their resale value.
20 6 controlling slaves slavery was a system of forced labor.
to make this system work slaveholders had to keep slaves firmly under control.
some slaveholders used harsh punishments beating whipping branding and other forms of torture to maintain that control.
but punishments often backfired on slaveholders.
a slave who had been badly whipped might not be able to work for some time.
harsh punishments were also likely to make slaves feel more resentful and rebellious.
slaveholders preferred to control their workforce by making slaves feel totally dependent on their masters.
owners encouraged such dependence by treating their slaves like grown up children.
they also kept their workers as ignorant as possible about the world beyond the plantation.
frederick douglasss master said that a slave should know nothing but to obey his master to do as it is told to do slaves who failed to learn this lesson were sometimes sent to slave breakers.
such men were experts at turning independent spirited african americans into humble obedient slaves.
when he was 16 douglass was sent to a slave breaker named edward covey.
coveys method consisted of equal parts violence fear and overwork.
soon after douglass arrived on coveys farm he received his first whipping.
after that he was beaten so often that aching bones and a sore back were my constant companions coveys ability to instill fear in his slaves was as effective as his whippings.
slaves never knew when he might be watching them.
he would creep and crawl in ditches and gullies douglass recalled to spy on his workers.
finally covey worked his slaves beyond endurance.
wrote douglass we worked in all weathers.
it was never too hot or too cold it could never rain blow hail or snow too hard for us to work in the field.
the longest days were too short for him and the shortest nights too long for him.
i was somewhat unmanageable when i first got there but a few months of this discipline tamed me.
i was broken in body soul and spirit.
the dark night of slavery closed in upon me.
20 7 resistance to slavery despite the efforts of slaveholders to crush their spirits slaves found countless ways to resist slavery.
as former slave harriet jacobs wrote after escaping to freedom my master had power and law on his side.
i had a determined will.
there is might power in each day to day resistance for most slaves resistance took the form of quiet or passive acts of rebellion.
field hands pulled down fences broke tools and worked so sloppily that they damaged crops.
house slaves sneaked food out of the masters kitchen.
382 chapter 20 slaves pretended to be dumb clumsy sick or insane to get out of work.
one slave avoided working for years by claiming to be nearly blind only to regain his sight once freed.
in some instances resistance turned deadly when house servants put poison into slave owners food.
so many slaves set fire to their owners homes and barns that the american fire insurance company refused to insure property in the south.
open defiance quiet resistance sometimes flared into open defiance.
when pushed too hard slaves refused to work rejected orders or struck back violently.
owners often described slaves who reacted in this way as insolent disrespectful or unmanageable frederick douglass reached his breaking point one day when the slave breaker covey began to beat him for no particular reason.
rather than take the blows as he had so many times before douglass fought back.
he wrestled covey to the ground holding him so firmly by the throat that his blood followed my nails for douglass this moment was the turning point in my career as a slave my long crushed spirit rose cowardice departed bold defiance took its place and i now resolved that however long i might remain a slave inform the day had passed when i could be a slave in fact.
i did not hesitate to let it be known of me that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping must also succeed in killing me.
covey knew this and never laid a hand on douglass again.
reward running away some slaves tried to escape by running away to freedom in the north.
the risks were enormous.
slaveholders hired professional slave catchers and their packs of bloodhounds to hunt down runaway slaves.
if caught a runaway risked being mauled by dogs brutally whipped or even killed.
still douglass and countless other slaves took the risk.
this 1872 engraving shows escaping slaves resisting slave catchers.
atthe upper right is a notice of a reward being offered for escaped slaves.
african americans in the mid 1800s harriet tubman underground railroad a secret network of free blacks and whites who helped thousands of slaves escape to free states and to canada nat turner s rebellion a slave rebellion led by nat turner that took place in virginia in 1831 slaves found many ways to escape bondage.
some walked to freedom in the north hiding by day and traveling at night when they could follow the north star.
others traveled north by boat or train using forged identity cards and clever disguises to get past watchful slave patrols.
a few runaways mailed themselves to freedom in boxes or coffins.
thousands of runaways escaped to free states and to canada with the help of the underground railroad a secret network of free blacks and sympathetic whites.
the members of the underground railroad provided transportation and safe houses where runaways could hide.
a number of guides or conductors risked their lives to help escaping slaves travel the freedom train one of the most successful was harriet tubman.
having escaped slavery herself tubman courageously returned to the south approximately 20 times between 1850 and 1860 guiding more than 300 men women and children to freedom.
rebellion at times resistance erupted into violent rebellion.
slave revolts occurred in cities on plantations and even on ships at sea.
fear of slave uprisings haunted slaveholders.
planters wrote one visitor to the south never lie down to sleep without loaded pistols at their sides in 1822 authorities in charleston south carolina learned that denmark vesey a free black was preparing to lead a sizable revolt of slaves.
vesey along with more than 30 slaves was arrested and hanged.
nine years later in 1831 a slave named nat turner led a bloody uprising in virginia.
in what became known as nat turner s rebellion turner and his followers set out to kill every white person they could find.
armed with axes and guns they killed at least 57 people over a period of two days.
vesey s and turner s rebellions panicked white southerners.
in response southern states passed strict slave codes that tightened owners control of their slaves and provided for harsher punishment of slaves by authorities.
as one frightened virginian remarked a nat turner might be in any family the bloodiest slave uprising in the south was organized in 1831 by nat turner a black preacher.
this wood engraving entitled nat turner and his confederates in conference shows turner leaning on a pole and speaking to his companions.
384 chapter 20 this photograph shows five generations of a slave family on a south carolina plantation.
slaves often found it difficult to keep their families together.
southern laws did not recognize slave marriages or families and owners could split up families as they wished.
20 8 slave families and communities slavery made community and family life difficult.
legally slave fami lies did not exist.
no southern state recognized slave marriages.
legal control of slave children rested not with their parents but with their masters.
owners could break up slave families at any time by selling a father a mother or a child to someone else.
of all the things they endured slaves most feared being sold away from their loved ones.
most slaves grew up in families headed by a father and mother.
unable to marry legally slaves created their own weddings which often involved the tradition of jumping over a broomstick.
one slave recalled the preacher would say to the man do you take this woman to be your wife he says yes well jump the broom after he jumped the preacher would say the same to the woman.
when she jumped the preacher said i pronounce you man and wife caring for children was never easy.
booker t washingtons mother snatched a few moments for our care in the early morning before her work began and at night after the days work was done.
still parents found time to teach the lessons children would need to survive.
silence around whites was one such lesson.
elijah marrs recalled that mothers were necessarily compelled to be severe on their children to keep them from talking too much obedience was another lesson.
william webbs mother taught him not to rebel against the nen that were treating me like some dumb brute making me work and refusing to let me learn parents also taught their children other essential lessons about caring kindness pride and hope.
they taught them to respect them selves and other members of the slave community especially older slaves.
there is not to be found among any people wrote douglass a more rigid enforcement of the law of respect to elders.
these were the lessons that helped slaves under the most difficult conditions to create loving families and close communities.
in doing so they met the most basic of human needs the need for a place to feel loved respected and safe.

20 9 leisure time activities these simple words capture the constant weariness that slaves endured come day go day god send sunday.
slaves toiled all week in fields that seemed to stretch from one end of the earth to the other but on saturday night and sunday their time was their own.
saturday nights were a time for social events like corn husking or pea shelling parties.
these social events combined work and fun.
one slave recalled ive seen many a corn huskin at ole majors farm when the corn would he piled as high as the house.
two sets of men would start huskin from opposite sides of the heap.
it would keep one man busy just getting the husks out of the way and the corn would be thrown over the huskers head and filling the air like birds.
the women usually had a quilting at those times so they were pert and happy.
in this painting black house servants are shown celebrating a wedding party in the kitchen.
dancing singing and telling tales allowed slaves to temporarily forgettheir harsh conditions.
a quilting bee was one of the rare times when slave women could gather to work and talk.
in those few precious hours they were free to express themselves with needle and cloth.
the quilts they created were not only beautiful but also very much needed as bedding for their families.
after the sewing men joined the party for a quilting feast and dancing.
slaves made music out of almost anything.
stretch cowhides over cheese boxes and you had tambourines one former slave recalled.
saw bones from off a cow knock them together and call it a drum.
or use broom straws on fiddle strings and you had your entire orchestra.
sunday was a day for religion and recreation.
slaves spent their sundays going to church eating hunting fishing dancing singing telling tales naming babies playing games and visiting with friends.
in new orleans hundreds of slaves gathered on sunday afternoons in public spaces to dance sing and talk.
all of these activities helped african americans forget the sorrows of slavery.
386 chapter 20 biblical stories were frequently illustrated on quilts made by slaves.
this is one of the two surviving quilts created by harriet powers.
20 10 slave churches many slaveholders encouraged their slaves to attend church on sunday.
some read the bible to their workers and prayed with them.
owners and white ministers preached the same message if you disobey your earthly master you offend your heavenly master not surprisingly this was not a popular lesson among slaves.
dat ole white preacher just was telling us slaves to be good to our marsters recalled cornelius garner.
we aint kerrd a bit bout dat stuff he was telling us cause we wanted to sing pray and serve god in our own way instead slaves created their own invisible church that brought together african roots and american needs.
this invisible church met in slave quarters or secret forest clearings known as hush arbors.
one slave reported that when slaves go round singing steal away to jesus that mean there going to be a religious meeting that night.
the masters didn t like them religious meetings so us naturally slips off at night down in the bottoms or somewheres.
sometimes us sing and pray all night.
rather than teach about obedience black preachers told the story of moses leading his people out of slavery in egypt.
black worshipers sang spirituals that expressed their desire for freedom and faith in a better world to come.
one black preacher wrote the singing was accompanied by a certain ecstasy of motion clapping of hands tossing of heads which would continue wit out cessation stopping about half an hour.
the ol ou partook of their ecstasy it rang with their jubilant shouts an shook in all its joints.
whites sometimes criticized the enthusiasm of black wo p saying they lacked true religious feeling.
many slaves however believed it was their masters who lacked such feeling.

dances songs quilts and folk stories all reflected african traditions as well as the new life slaves faced in america.
oppression the feeling of being weighed down or held back by severe and unfair force 20 11 african american culture africans arrived in the united states speaking many languages and following many cultural traditions.
to survive they had to learn a new language english and adopt a new way of life.
yet they did not forget their african roots.
across the south slaves combined their old traditions and new realities to create a distinctive african american culture.
this combining of cultures is evident in harriet powerss story quilt.
in square after square powers used animals from africa and america to illustrate bible stories that she learned as a slave on a georgia plantation.
the doves in her quilt are symbols of a slaves yearning for freedom.
as one spiritual expressed had i the wings of a dove id fly away and be at rest you can also hear this combining of cultures in the songs and spirituals sung by slaves.
these songs throb with the rhythms and harmonies africa but speak about the realities of slavery.
slaves sang about faith love work and the kindness and cruelty of masters.
they also expressed their oppression as in this song recorded by frederick douglass we raise the wheat dey gib they give us the corn we bake the bread dey gib us the cruss we sif the meal dey gib us the skin and dat s the way dey takes us in.
slave dances were based on african traditions as well.
dancing helped slaves to put aside their cares express their feelings and refresh their spirits.
according to one former slave good dancers could play a tune with their feet dancing largely to an inward music a music that was felt but not heard.
388 chapter 20 african legends and folktales survived in the stories and jokes told by slaves.
for example brer rabbit the sly hero of many slave tales was based on the african trickster shulo the hare.
in these stories the small but clever brother rabbit always managed to outwit larger but duller brother bear or brother fox just as slaves hoped to outwit their more powerful masters.
chapter summary in this chapter you learned what life was like for african americans during the 1800s.
north and south slave and free african americans had a great impact on the development of american life.
the souths economy was built on slave labor.
some blacks lived in freedom in the north and south but nowhere could they escape racism and discrimination.
the economics of slavery most white southerners did not own slaves.
whether they owned slaves or not whites understood that the souths economy depended on cotton and the slave labor needed to grow it.
working and living conditions of slaves all slaves worked constantly in the fields as house servants or at skilled trades.
most slaves lived in simple dirt floor cabins.
controlling slaves and resistance to slavery some slave owners used harsh punishments to control slaves.
most slaves resisted slavery using quiet acts of rebellion while some fought back openly.
at great risk many tried to run away.
some slaveholders would rather kill runaways than allow them to escape.
slave families leisure and churches enslaved african americans created families and communities under the most difficult conditions.
slaves spent saturday nights at social events and worshiped in their own churches on sundays.
they prayed and sang spirituals to help themselves find joy and hope in their hard lives.
african american culture africans brought many languages and cultural traditions to the united states.
the combination of old and new cultural traditions was expressed through their quilts songs dances and folktales.
f these cards show scenes of slavery in the united states.
fr k e african americans in the mid 1800s reading further before the civil war harriet tubman helped hundreds of people escape slavery in the south.
because of her wits and bravery she is a symbol of the underground railroad.
harriet tubman moses of the underground railroad no one did more to help enslaved african americans escape slavery than harriet tubman.
people began to call her moses for her role in guiding people to freedom in the north.
but first she had to get there herself.
in the fall of 1849 harriet tubman decided to escape her life as a slave.
she had been born into slavery in eastern maryland sometime around 1820.
when she heard that she would be sold to a new owner farther south she decided to flee.
it was not an easy decision.
she would have to leave her family behind including her husband who refused to go.
she also knew that women rarely managed to escape on their own.
if she were caught she would be severely punished and perhaps killed.
but she felt she had no choice.
i had reasoned this out in my mind she later recalled.
there was one of two things i had a right to liberty or death if i could not have one i would have the other like most slaves tubman had led a hard life.
she had been whipped repeatedly and forced to labor in the fields.
she once suffered a near fatal injury when an overseer struck her in the head with a lead weight.
for the rest of her life she would periodically and unexpectedly fall into a deep sleep.
but her experiences also gave her strength and taught her how to survive.
she would need that strength on her flight north.
tubman left at night under cover of darkness.
she had no idea wncic lu go uw rorrunately there were people to help her.
they wer part of the underground railroad the name people gave to a netwc of safe houses and escape routes leading to the north.
the safe hous were known as stations and the people who ran them as stationmasters these men and women and sometimes children put th lives at risk to help slaves escape to freedom.
not wanting to endanger those who helped her tubman never r vealed the details of her escape.
but she probably took a route headi northeast to delaware and then to pennsylvania.
it was a journey si would take many times later when she had become the most famou conductor on the underground railroad.
wwmvii i tubmans first stop was the home of a sympathetic white woman1 lived nearby.
this woman told her how to find the nearest safe hoi tubman walked through the night to get there.
when she arrived woman opened the door handed her a broom and told her to swc the yard.
this puzzled tubman until she realized that playing the of a black servant would help avoid suspicion.
390 chapter 20 when the womans husband came home that evening he hid tubman in his wagon drove her out of town and dropped her off with directions to the next safe house.
for the rest of her journey tubman went from one station to the next at night and hid during the day.
most of the time she traveled on foot staying out of sight.
slave catchers were a real danger so she avoided roads and listened for the sound of bloodhounds on her trail.
she knew that one careless mistake could lead to her capture.
she left maryland and crossed into delaware.
but she was still not safe.
although delaware was a free state slave catchers worked there and many people would turn over a fugitive for the reward money.
finally after two or three weeks on the run tubman crossed the pennsylvania border a dividing line between north and south.
now she was truly free.
years later she recalled that moment hooked at my hands to see if i was the same person.
there was such a glory over everything.
the sun came like gold through the trees and over the fields and i felt like i was in heaven.
refuge in philadelphia tubman went to philadelphia which was then home to thousands of african americans including many escaped slaves.
the city had a strong abolitionist community and was a center of the underground railroad.
tubman soon found work and settled into her new life.
but she would not remain at rest for long.
she missed her family in maryland and could not bear the idea that they were still living in slavery.
i was free she said and they should be free.
escaping slaves fled slavery any way they could.
in this painting conductors help men women and children from boats and into wagons that would take them farther north.
gra 9ev born free in new jersey abolitionist william still played a central role in the underground railroad.
he interviewed every escaping slave he met.
the detailed records he kept are an invaluable source of information today.
new york rem ttie subscriber oi jromao bout or riding the liberty lines by the fall of 1850 tubman decided to act.
she had learned that one of her sisters daughters a niece named kizzy was going to be sold south.
kizzy had two children and tubman was determined to rescue all three of them.
no one knows exactly how she did it but harriet managed to slip into maryland and bring all of them north.
the following spring she made another trip this time to get one of her brothers.
a few months later she brought back a second brother along with ten other people.
eventually she would rescue most of her family including her elderly parents.
she took most of them to canada where they could not be seized by slave catchers and returned to their owners.
tubman could not have made these trips without the help of the underground railroad.
she followed routes known as liberty lines and made use of underground railroad safe houses.
some of these houses had tunnels and secret closets where fugitives could hide.
she also relied on agents such as thomas garrett and william still.
garrett was a white stationmaster in wilmington delaware who helped more than 2 500 slaves escape from the south.
still an african american was an important leader of the antislavery movement in philadelphia.
these and other members of the underground railroad were critical to tubmans success over the years.
another secret to her success was her methods.
she usually made her trips in the fall and winter when the nights were long and people tended to stay indoors.
she always set out on a saturday night.
sunday was usually a slaves only day off so slave owners might not miss absent slaves until monday morning.
when nearing a hiding place where fugitives were waiting tubman would sing a special song.
these songs were a kind of code to signal her presence or to provide instructions.
sometimes she wore disguises such as mens clothing.
once when she ran into a former owner she pulled her hat over her face and pretended to read a newspaper.
the man who assumed his former slave could not read never realized who she was.
one admirer recalled she could elude patrols and pursuers with as much ease and unconcern as an eagle would soar through the heavens she was.
also fearless.
when she developed a bad toothache tea during one escape she used a pistol to knock her ins to tceth ut and ease pain.
and left a dark fwmkc bad other thdlurx if taken dollar if token out ci 6 owners put up wanted posters for the return of runaway slaves.
agents forthe underground railroad sometimes tore the posters down to help slaves escape.
392 chapter 20 the rescue of joe bailey between 1852 and 1860 tubman made one or more trips a year into the south.
blacks soon began calling her moses the leader who guided her people to freedom.
as mosess reputation grew slave owners demanded the capture of this mysterious person who was leading their slaves away.
but they did not know who moses was or even that she was a woman.
on one trip in november 1856 tubman brought five people north including a man named joe bailey.
bailey was highly valued by his owner who offered 1 500 for his return.
a 12 000 bounty was also placed on the head of moses after a risky escape from maryland tubman and her party reached the outskirts of wilmington.
there thomas garrett hid them under a wagonload of hay and helped them get through the city.
from there they went to philadelphia and new york on their way to canada.
bailey got a shock in new york however.
there a man identified him from a poster advertising a reward for his capture.
fortunately the man was an abolitionist.
nonetheless bailey was plunged into gloom fearing he would never make it out of the country without getting caught.
he failed to cheer up for the rest of the journey even refusing to look as he passed by niagara falls and crossed into canada.
at that point tubman shook him saying joe youre free bailey looked up saw where he was and burst into tears.
then he began to sing glory to god and jesus too one more soul is safe.
oh go and carry the news one more soul got safe.
in 1978 the u s.
postal service honored harriet tubman with a stamp.
to former slaves like the men and women in the photograph below tubman far left was a hero in her own time.
tubman s legacy it is said that harriet tubman made almost 20 trips on the underground railroad and freed more than 300 people.
in all of her journeys she said i never ran my train off the track and i never lost a passenger.
she made her last trip shortly before the outbreak of the civil war in 1861.
during the war she joined the union cause as a nurse and a spy.
on one raid into south carolina she helped free several hundred slaves from captivity.
after the war tubman became a strong voice in the fight for womens rights and racial justice.
but it was her daring work with the underground railroad that made her a great hero and liberator of her people.

in this unit you will learn why this crisis developed and how congress handled it.
you will also learn about events after 1850 that further divided the north and south and turned the dispute over slavery into war.
as the map on the opposite page shows some states allowed slavery.
notice however that the same number of states banned it.
this balance gave the slave states and the free states an equal number of votes in the u s senate.
however as the map on this page shows that equality did not exist in the house of representatives where each state s votes are based on its population.
the constitution requires that the house and senate agree on new laws.
southerners believed that as long as the senate remained balanced congress could not pass laws to affect slavery.
then in 1849 california asked to become a state.
california s new constitution however banned slavery.
admitting california as a free state many southerners warned would upset the equal balance between slave states and free states making the slave states a minority.
the 1850s were one of the most troubled decades in u s history.
yet they were mild compared to the 1860s a time of war bitterness and the repair of a broken nation.
as you explore the topics in this unit picture what it must have been like to live during such difficult times.
the era s events drew the american people into a deadly struggle over slavery freedom and the very survival of the nation.
the union challenged 399.
400 chapter 21 chapter 21 a dividing nation which events of the mid 1800s kept the nation together and which events pulled it apart.
21 1 introduction in 1860 after one of the strangest elections in the nation s history a tall plainspoken illinois lawyer named abraham lincoln was elected president.
on learning of his victory lincoln said to the reporters covering the campaign well boys your troubles are over mine have just begun within a few weeks it became clear just how heavy those troubles would be.
by the time lincoln took office the nation had split apart over the issue of states rights regarding slavery and was preparing for civil war.
the survival of the united states of america and the fate of 4 million slaves rested in lincolns hands.
the troubles lincoln faced were not new.
the issues dividing the nation could be traced back to 1619 when the first slave ship arrived in virginia.
since that time slavery had ended in half of the united states.
the question was could the nation continue half slave and half free.
for decades americans tried to avoid that question.
many hoped slavery would simply die out on its own.
instead slavery began to expand into new territories and the question could no longer be ignored.
between 1820 and 1860 americans tried to fashion several compromises on the issue of slavery.
each compromise however created new problems and new divisions.
lincoln understood why.
slavery was not simply a political issue to be worked out through compromise.
it was a deeply moral issue.
as lincoln wrote in a letter to a friend if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong in this chapter you will learn how americans tried to keep the united states united despite their deep divisions over slavery.
some events during this period kept the nation together while others pulled h apart.
you will also find out how americans finally answered the question of whether a nation founded on the idea of freedom could endure half slave and half free.
this portrait of abraham lincoln was taken before he won the presidential election of 1860.
by the time he took office just a few months later the nation had divided over the issue of slavery.
in 1850 u s senators debated the issue of whether california should enter the union as a free state or a slave state.
a dividing nation 40 union the united states as one nation united under a single government.
during the civil war the union came to mean the government and armies of the north.
in 1819 the number of slave and free states stood at 11 each.
this balance was threatened when missouri applied for statehood as a slave state.
21 2 confronting the issue of slavery a traveler heading west across the appalachians after the war of 1812 wrote old america seems to be breaking up and moving westward it was true.
by 1819 settlers had formed seven new states west of the appalachians.
in the northwest ordinance of 1787 congress had established a process for forming new states.
besides outlining the steps leading to statehood this law also banned slavery north of the ohio river.
as a result the three western states that were formed north of the river ohio indiana and illinois were free states.
the four states that were formed south of the ohio river kentucky tennessee louisiana and mississippi permitted slavery.
in 1819 alabama and missouri applied to congress for statehood as slave states.
no one in congress questioned admitting alabama as a slave state.
alabama was located far south of the ohio river and was surrounded by other slave states.
congress had another reason for admitting alabama with no debate.
for years there had been an unspoken agreement in congress to keep the number of slave states and free states equal.
the admission of illinois as a free state in 1818 had upset this balance.
by accepting alabama with slavery congress was able to restore the balance between slave and free states.
missouri however was another matter.
questions about missouri some northerners in congress questioned whether missouri should be admitted as a slave state.
most of missouri they observed lay north of the point where the ohio river flows into the mississippi.
on the eastern side of the mississippi slavery was banned north of that point.
should this ban not also be applied west of the mississippi.
this question led to another one.
if missouri were allowed to enter the union as a slave state some asked what would keep slavery from spreading across all of the louisiana territory.
the vision of a block of new slave states stretching from the mississippi to the rocky mountains was enough to give some northerners nightmares.
the tallmadge amendment when the bill to make missouri a state came before congress representative james tallmadge of new york proposed an amendment to the bill.
the amendment said that missouri could join the union but only as a free state.
southerners in congress protested tallmadges amendment.
what right they asked did congress have to decide whether a new state should be slave or free.
according to the theory of states rights favored by many southerners congress had no power to impose its will on a state old or new.
402 chapter 21 instead the people of each state should decide whether to permit slavery.
the fight over slavery thus involved a basic question about the powers of the federal and state governments under the constitution.
a deadlocked congress southerners protests were based on their view that if congress were allowed to end slavery in missouri it might try to end slavery elsewhere.
the north already had more votes in the house of representatives than the south.
only in the senate did the two sections have equal voting power.
as long as the number of free states and slave states remained equal southern senators could defeat any attempt to interfere with slavery.
but if missouri entered the union as a free state the south would lose its power to block antislavery bills in the senate.
if that happened southerners warned it would mean disaster for the south.
in the north the tallmadge amendment awakened strong feelings against slavery.
many towns sent petitions to congress condemning slavery as immoral and unconstitutional.
arguing in favor of the amendment new hampshire representative arthur livermore spoke for many northerners when he said this illustration shows african americans being sold at a slave auction in the south in 1861.
scenes like this added to the moral outrage many people felt toward slavery.
an opportunity is now presented to prevent the growth of a sin which sits heavy on the soul of every one of us.
by embracing this opportunity we may retrieve the national character and in some degree our own.
the house voted to approve the tallmadge amendment.
in the senate however southerners were able to defeat it.
the two houses were now deadlocked over the issue of slavery in missouri.
they would remain so as the 1819 session of congress drew to a close.
a dividing nation 4 missouri compromise an agreement made by congress in 1820 under which missouri was admitted to the union as a slave state and maine was admitted as a free state 21 3 the missouri compromise when congress returned to washington in 1820 it took up the question of missouri statehood once again.
by then the situation had changed for maine was now asking to enter the union as a free state.
for weeks congress struggled to find a way out of its deadlock over missouri.
as the debate dragged on and tempers wore thin southerners began using such dreaded words as secession and civil war.
if you persist thomas cobb of georgia warned supporters of the tallmadge amendment the union will be dissolved.
you have kindled a fire which a sea of blood can only extinguish if disunion must take place let it be so thundered tallmadge in reply.
if civil war must come i can only say let it come a compromise is reached rather than risk the breakup of the union congress finally agreed to a compromise crafted by representative henry clay of kentucky.
the missouri compromise of 1820 admitted missouri to the union as a slave state and maine as a free state.
in this way it maintained the balance of power between slave and free states.
at the same time congress drew an imaginary line across the louisiana purchase at latitude 3630.
north of this line slavery was to be banned forever except in missouri.
south of the line slaveholding was permitted.
reactions to the compromise the missouri compromise kept the union together but it pleased few people.
in the north congressmen who voted to accept missouri as a slave state were called traitors.
in the south slaveholders deeply resented the ban on slavery in territories that might later become states.
underthe missouri compromise missouri entered the union as a slave state while maine entered as a free state.
north of the 3630 parallel slavery was prohibited except for in missouri.
south of this parallel slavery would be allowed.

i have favored this missouri compromise believing it to be all that could be effected accomplished under the present constitution and from extreme unwillingness to put the union at hazard risk wrote adams in his diary.
if the union must be dissolved slavery is precisely the question on which it ought to break.
for the present however the contest is laid asleep 21 4 the missouri compromise unravels as john quincy adams predicted for a time the contest over slavery was settled.
but a powerful force was building that soon pushed the issue into the open again the second great awakening.
leaders of the religious revival of the 1820s and 1830s promised that god would bless those who did the lords work.
for some americans the lord s work was the abolition of slavery.
the gag rule during the 1830s abolitionists flooded congress with antislavery petitions.
congress they were told had no power to interfere with slavery in the states.
then what about the district of columbia.
asked the abolitionists.
surely congress had the power to ban slavery in the nations capital.
rather than confront that question congress voted in 1836 to table or set aside indefinitely all antislavery petitions.
outraged abolitionists called this action the gag rule because it gagged or silenced all congressional debate over slavery.
in 1839 the gag rule prevented consideration of an antislavery proposal by john quincy adams who was now a member of congress.
knowing that the country would not agree on abolishing slavery altogether adams proposed a constitutional amendment saying that no one could be born into slavery after 1845.
congress however refused to consider his proposal.

the seven cuts following are selected from thirteen which may be found in the anti slavery almanac for 1810.
they represent well authenticated facts and illustrate in various ways the cruelties daily inflicted upon three millions of native born americans by their fellow countrymen.
a brief explanation follows each cut.
many northern periodicals and newspapers detailed the horrors of slavery.
southern fears abolitionists were far from silenced by the re fusal of congress to debate slavery.
they continued to attack slavery in books in newspapers and at public meetings.
white southerners deeply resented the abolitionists attacks as an assault on their way of life.
after nat turners slave rebellion in 1831 resentment turned to fear.
southern states adopted strict new a control the movement of slaves.
many states tried to keep abolition ist writings from reaching slaves.
mississippi even offere a re 5 000 for the arrest and conviction of any person who shall utter publish or circulate abolitionist ideas.
a dividing nation 405 fugitive slaves nat turners rebellion was the last large scale slave revolt.
but individual slaves continued to rebel by running away to freedom in the north.
these fugitives from slavery were often helped in their escape by sympathetic people in the north.
to slaveholders these northerners were no better than bank robbers.
they saw a slave as a valuable piece of property.
every time a slave escaped it was like seeing their land vanish into thin air.
slaveholders demanded that congress pass a fugitive slave law to help them recapture their property.
in this painting northerners help a group of fugitive slaves make their escape.
the assistance northerners gave to escaped slaves angered many southern slaveholders.
slavery in the territories the gag rule kept the slavery issue out of congress for ten years.
then in 1846 president james polk sent a bill to congress asking for funds for the war with mexico.
pennsylvania representative david wilmot added an amendment to the bill known as the wilmot proviso.
a proviso is a condition added to an agreement.
the wilmot proviso stated that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of the territory that might be acquired from mexico as a result of the mexican american war.
southerners in congress strongly opposed wilmots amendment.
they maintained that congress had no right to decide where slaveholders could take their property.
the wilmot proviso passed the house but it was rejected by the senate.
statehood for california for the next three years congress debated what to do about slavery in the territory gained from mexico.
southerners wanted all of the mexican cession open to slavery.
northerners wanted all of it closed.
as a compromise southerners proposed a bill that would extend the missouri compromise line all the way to the pacific.
slavery would be banned north of that line and allowed south of it.
northerners in congress rejected this proposal.
fugitive a person who flees or tries to escape for example from slavery wilmot proviso a proposal made in 1846 to prohibit slavery in the territory added to the united states as a result of the mexican american war then late in 1849 california applied for admission to the union a free state.
northerners in congress welcomed california with oper arms.
southerners however rejected californias request.
making california a free state they warned would upset the balance betwee slave and free states.
the result would be unequal representation of slave states and free states in congress.
the year ended with congress deadlocked over californias requc for statehood.
once again southerners spoke openly of withdrawin from the union.
and once again angry northerners denounced slave as a crime against humanity.
406 chapter 21 21 5 the compromise of 1850 on january 21 1850 henry clay now a senator from kentucky trudged through a washington snowstorm to pay an unexpected cation senator daniel webster of massachusetts.
clay the creator of the missouri compromise had come up with a plan to end the deadlock over california.
but to get his plan through congress he needed websters support.
something for everyone clays new compromise had something to please just about everyone.
it began by admitting california to the union as a free state.
that would please the north.
meanwhile it allowed the new mexico and utah territories to decide whether to allow slavery which would please the south.
in addition clays plan ended the slave trade in washington d c.
although slaveholders in washington would be able to keep their slaves human beings would no longer be bought and sold in the nations capital.
clay and webster agreed that this compromise would win support from abolitionists without threatening the rights of slaveholders.
finally clays plan called for passage of a strong fugitive slave law.
slaveholders had long wanted such a law which would make it easier to find and reclaim runaway slaves.
compromise of 1850 the agreements made in order to admit california into the union as a free state.
these agreements included allowing the new mexico and utah territories to decide whether to allow slavery outlawing the slave trade in washington d c and creating a stronger fugitive slave law.
the compromise is accepted hoping that clays compromise would end the crisis webster agreed to help it get passed in congress.
but despite websters support congress debated the compromise of 1850 for nine frustrating months.
as tempers frayed southerners the compromise of 1850 admitted california as a free state and allowed the southwestern territories to be set up without restriction on slavery.
talked of simply leaving the union peacefully.
webster dismissed such talk as foolish.
peaceable secession he exclaimed.
your eyes and mine are never destined to see that miracle.
i see it as plainly as i see the sun in heaven i see that secession must produce such a war as i will not describe a war over slavery was something few americans wanted to face.
in september 1850 congress finally adopted clays plan.
most americans were happy to see the crisis end.
some southerners however remained wary of the compromise.
the compromise of 1850 ibis.

in fact it satisfied almost no one and the debate grew louder each year.

the fugitive slave act people in the north and the south were unhappy with the fugitive slave act though for different reasons.
northerners did not want to enforce the act.
southerners felt the act did not do enough to ensure the return of their escaped property.
under the fugitive slave act a person arrested as a runaway slave had almost no legal rights.
many runaways fled all the way to canada rather than risk being caught and sent back to their owners.
others decided to stand and fight.
reverend jarmain loguen a former slave living in new york said boldly i dont respect this law i dont fear it i wont obey it.
i will not live as a slave and if force is employed to re enslave me i shall make preparations to meet the crisis as becomes a man the fugitive slave act also said that any person who helped a slave escape or even refused to aid slave catchers could be jailed.
this provision complained new england poet ralph waldo emerson made slave catchers of us all opposition to the act was widespread in the north.
when slave catchers came to boston they were hounded by crowds of angry citizens shouting slave hunters there go the slave hunters after a few days of this treatment most slave catchers decided to leave.
northerners refusal to support the act infuriated slaveholders.
it also made enforcement of the act almost impossible.
of the tens of thousands of fugitives living in the north during the 1850s only 299 were captured and returned to their owners during this time.
the fugitive slave act was passed as part of the compromise of 1850.
this 1851 poster warned free african americans in boston to watch outfor slave catchers looking for escaped slaves.
even people who helped escaped slaves could be jailed.
uncle tom s cabin nothing brought the horrors of slavery home to northerners more than uncle toms cabin a novel by harriet beecher stowe.
the novel grew out of a vision stowe had while sitting in church on a wintry sunday morning in 1851.
the vision began with a saintly slave known as uncle tom and his cruel master.
in a furious rage the master simon legree had the old slave whipped to death.
just before uncle toms soul slipped out of his body he opened his eyes and whispered to legree ye poor miserable critter.
there aint no more ye can do.
i forgive ye with all my soul 408 chapter 21 racing home stowe scribbled down what she had imagined.
her vision of uncle toms death became part of a much longer story that was first published in installments in an abolitionist newspaper.
in one issue readers held their breath as the slave eliza chose to risk death rather than be sold away from her young son.
chased by slave hunters and their dogs eliza dashed to freedom across the ice choked ohio river clutching her child in her arms.
in a later issue stowes readers wept as they read her account of how the character of uncle tom died at the hands of simon legree.
in 1852 uncle tom s cabin was published as a novel.
plays based on the book toured the country thrilling audiences with elizas dramatic escape to freedom.
no other work had ever aroused such powerful emotions about slavery.
in the south the novel and its author were scorned and cursed.
in the north uncle tom s cabin made millions of people even more angry about the cruelties of slavery.
the ostend manifesto and the kansas nebraska act northerners who were al ready horrified by slavery were roused to fury by two events in 1854 the publication of the so called ostend manifesto and the kansas nebraska act.
the document known as the ostend manifesto was a message sent to the secretary of state by three american diplomats who were meeting in ostend belgium.
president franklin pierce who had taken office in 1853 had been trying to purchase the island of cuba from spain but spain had refused the offer.
the message from the diplomats urged the u s government to seize cuba by force if spain continued to refuse to sell the island.
when the message was leaked to the public angry northerners charged that pierces administration wanted to buy cuba in order to add another slave state to the union.
early that same year senator stephen a douglas of illinois introduced a bill in congress that aroused an uproar.
douglas wanted to get a railroad built to california.
he thought the project was more likely to happen if congress organized the great plains into the nebraska territory and opened the region to settlers.
this territory lay north of the missouri compromise and douglass bill said nothing about slavery.
but southerners in congress agreed to support the bill only if douglas made a few changes and those changes had far reaching consequences.
few other novels in american history have had the political impact of uncle tom s cabin.
written by harriet beecher stowe and published in 1852 the novel helped fuel the antislavery movement.
a dividing nation the kansas nebraska act 1854 free state slave state free territory slave territory territory open to slavery i the kansas nebraska act outraged northerners because it abolished the missouri compromise.
underthe terms of the act the question of slavery would be decided by settlers in the newly organized territories of kansas and nebraska.
douglass final version of the bill known as the kansas nebraska act created two new territories kansas and nebraska.
it also abolished the missouri compromise by leaving it up to the settlers themselves to vote on whether to permit slavery in the two territories.
douglas called this policy popular sovereignty or rule by the people.
the kansas nebraska act was passed in 1854.
the kansas nebraska act hit the north like a thunderbolt.
once again northerners were haunted by visions of slavery marching across the plains.
douglas tried to calm their fears by saying that the climates of kansas and nebraska were not suited to slave labor.
but when northerners studied maps they were not so sure.
newspaper editor horace greeley charged in the new york tribune the pretense of douglas co that not even kansas is to be made a slave state by his bill is a gag joke.
ask any missourian what he thinks about it.
the kansas territory.
is bounded in its entire length by missouri with a whole tier of slave counties leaning against it.
wont be a slave state.
don t lie any more.
kansas nebraska act an act passed in 1854 that created the kansas and nebraska territories and abolished the missouri compromise by allowing settlers to determine whether slavery would be allowed in the new territories bloodshed in kansas after the kansas nebraska act was passed in 1854 settlers poured into kansas.
most were peaceful farmers looking for good farmland.
some settlers however moved to kansas either to support or to oppose slavery.
in the south towns took up collections to send their young men to kansas.
in the north abolitionists raised money to send weapons to antislavery settlers.
before long kansas had two competing governments in the territory one for slavery and one against it.
the struggle over slavery soon turned violent.
on may 21 1856 proslavery settlers and so called border ruffians from missouri invaded lawrence kansas the home of the antislavery government.
armed invaders burned a hotel looted several homes and tossed the printing presses of two abolitionist newspapers into the kaw river.
as the invaders left lawrence one of them boasted gentlemen this is the happiest day of my life 410 chapter 21 the raid on lawrence provoked a wave of outrage in the north.
people raised money to replace the destroyed presses.
and more free soilers as antislavery settlers were called prepared to move to kansas.
meanwhile a fiery abolitionist named john brown plotted his own revenge.
two days after the lawrence raid brown and seven followers including four of browns sons and his son in law invaded the proslavery town of pottawatomie kansas.
there they dragged five men they suspected of supporting slavery from their homes and hacked them to death with swords.
violence in congress the violence in kansas greatly disturbed senator charles sumner of massachusetts.
to sumner it was proof of what he had long suspected that senator stephen douglas had plotted with southerners to make kansas a slave state.
in 1856 sumner voiced his suspicions in a passionate speech called the crime against kansas in harsh shocking language sumner described the crime against kansas as a violent assault on an innocent territory compelling it to the hateful embrace of slavery he dismissed douglas as a noisome offensive squat and nameless animal sumner also heaped abuse on many southerners including senator andrew p butler of south carolina.
just what sumner hoped to accomplish was not clear.
however copies of his speech were quickly printed up for distribution in the north.
after reading it new england poet henry wadsworth longfellow congratulated sumner on the brave and noble speech you made never to die out in the memories of men.
certainly it was not about to die out in the memories of enraged southerners.
two days after the speech senator butler s nephew south carolina representative preston brooks attacked sumner in the senate beating him with his metal tipped cane until it broke in half.
by the time other senators could pull brooks away sumner had collapsed bloody and unconscious.
reactions to the attack on sumner showed how divided the country had become.
many southerners applauded brooks for defending the honor of his family and the south.
from across the south supporters sent brooks new canes to replace the one he had broken on sumners head.
preston brooks savagely beat charles sumner on the senate floor in retaliation for sumner s speech against the raid on lawrence kansas.
ittook sumner over three years to recover.
a dividing natioj most northerners viewed the beating as another example of southern brutality.
in their eyes brooks was no better than the proslavery bullies who had attacked the people of lawrence.
one connecticut student was so upset that she wrote to sumner about going to war.
i dont think it is of very much use to stay any longer in the high school she wrote.
the boys would be better learning to hold muskets and the girls to make bullets 21 7 the dred scott decision in 1857 the slavery controversy shifted from congress to the supreme court.
the court was about to decide a case concerning a missouri slave named dred scott.
years earlier scott had traveled with his owner to wisconsin where slavery was banned by the missouri compromise.
when he returned to missouri scott went to court to win his freedom.
he argued that his stay in wisconsin had made him a free man.
dred scott sued for his freedom in the supreme court.
the court ruled that african americans had no right to sue in federal courts.
the court also struck down the missouri compromise making slavery legal in all the territories.
questions of the case there were nine justices on the supreme court in 1857.
five including chief justice roger taney were from the south.
four were from the north.
the justices had two key questions to decide.
first as a slave was dred scott a citizen who had the right to bring a case before a federal court.
second did his time in wisconsin make him a free man.
chief justice taney hoped to use the scott case to settle the slavery controversy once and for all.
so he asked the court to consider two more questions did congress have the power to make any laws at all concerning slavery in the territories.
and if so was the missouri compromise a constitutional use of that power.
nearly 80 years old taney had long been opposed to slavery.
as a young maryland lawyer he had publicly declared that slavery is a blot upon our national character and every lover of freedom confidently hopes that it will be wiped away taney had gone on to free his own slaves.
many observers wondered whether he and his fellow justices would now free dred scott as well.
dred scott decision a supreme court decision in 1857 that held that african americans could never be citizens of the united states and that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional iwu uuaiciai bombshells on march 6 1857 chief justice i delivered the dred scott decision.
the chief justice began by rev the facts of dred scotts case.
then he dropped the first of two ju bombshells.
by a vote of five to four the court had decided that sc could not sue for his freedom in a federal court because he was n a citizen.
nor said taney could scott become a citizen.
no africa american whether slave or free was an american citizen or cc ever become one.
second taney declared that the court had rejected scott s argi that his stay in wisconsin had made him a free man.
the reason simple.
the missouri compromise was unconstitutional.

taneys argument went something like this.
slaves are property.
the fifth amendment to the constitution says that property cannot be taken from people without due process of law that is a proper court hearing.
taney reasoned that banning slavery in a territory is the same as taking property from slaveholders who would like to bring their slaves into that territory.
and that is unconstitutional.
rather than banning slavery he said congress has a constitutional responsibility to protect the property rights of slaveholders in a territory.
the dred scott decision delighted slaveholders.
they hoped that at lng last the issue of slavery in the territories had been settled and in their favor.
many northerners however were stunned and enraged by the courts ruling.
the new york tribune called the decision a wicked and false judgment the new york independent expressed outrage in a bold headline as a result of the dred scott decision slavery was allowed in all territories.
the decision of the supreme court is the moral assassination of a race and cannot be obeyed.
a dividing nation 41 abraham lincoln addresses an audience during one of the lincoln douglas debates.
stephen douglas is directly behind lincoln on the platform.
21 8 from compromise to crisis during the controversy over the kansas nebraska act antislavery activists formed a new political organization the republican party.
the republicans were united by their beliefs that no man can own another man.
that slavery must be prohibited in the territories that all new states must be free states.
that the rights of our colored citizen must be protected.
in 1858 republicans in illinois nominated abraham lincoln to run for the senate.
in his acceptance speech lincoln pointed out that all attempts to reach compromise on the slavery issue had failed.
quoting from the bible he warned a house divided against itself cannot stand lincoln went on i believe this government cannot endure permanently halfslave and half free.
i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided.
it will become all one thing or all the other the lincoln douglas debates lincolns opponent in the senate race was senator stephen douglas.
the illinois senator saw no reason why the nation could not go on halfslave and half free.
when lincoln challenged him to debate the slavery issue douglas agreed.
during the lincoln douglas debates douglas argued that the dred scott decision had put the slavery issue to rest.
lincoln disagreed.
in his eyes slavery was a moral not a legal issue.
he declared the real issue in this controversy is the sentiment of one class group that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong lincoln lost the election.
but the debates were widely reported and they helped make him a national figure.
his argument with oug as also brought the moral issue of slavery into sharp focus.
compromises over slavery were becoming impossible.

lincoln douglas debates a series of political debates between abraham lincoln and stephen douglas who were candidates in the illinois race for u s senator in which slavery was the main issue 414 chapter 21 brown launched his raid in 1859.
it was an insane scheme.
all of browns men were killed or captured during the raid.
brown himself was convicted of treason and sentenced to die.
on the day of his hanging he left a note that read i john brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood such words filled white southerners with fear.
if a slave rebellion did begin it was southern blood that would be spilled.
the fact that many northerners viewed brown as a hero also left white southerners uneasy.
in this eyewitness drawing u s marines are shown storming the arsenal at harpers ferry that was raided by john brown and his men.
brown was charged with treason convicted and then executed by hanging.
21 9 the election of 1860 and secession the 1860 presidential race showed just how divided the nation had become.
the republicans were united behind lincoln.
the democrats however had split between northern and southern factions.
northern democrats nominated stephen douglas for president.
southern democrats supported john c breckinridge of kentucky.
the election became even more confusing when a group called the constitutional union party nominated john bell of tennessee.
abraham lincoln is elected president with his opposition divided three ways lincoln sailed to victory.
but it was an odd victory.
lincoln won the presidential election with just 40 percent of the votes all of them cast in the north.
in ten southern states he was not even n the ballot.
for white southerners the election of 1860 delivered an unmistakable message.
the south was now in the minority.
it no longer had the power to shape national events or policies.
sooner or later southerners feared congress would try to abolish slavery.

1 1 union nissocub.
this broadside printed in december 1860 boldly announces the secession of south carolina from the union.
the south secedes from the union in the weeks following the election talk of secession filled the air.
alarmed senators formed a committee to search for yet another compromise that might hold the nation together.
they knew that finding one would not be easy.
still they had to do something to stop the rush toward disunion and disaster.
the senate committee held its first meeting on december 20 1860.
just as the senators began their work events in two distant cities dashed their hopes for a settlement.
in springfield illinois a reporter called on president elect abraham lincoln.
when asked whether he could support a compromise on slavery lincolns answer was clear.
he would not interfere with slavery in the south.
and he would support enforcement of the fugitive slave act.
but lincoln drew the line at letting slavery extend into the territories.
on this question he declared let there be no compromise meanwhile in charleston south carolina delegates attending a state convention voted that same day december 20 1860 to leave the union.
the city went wild.
church bells rang.
crowds filled the streets roaring their approval.
a south carolina newspaper boldly proclaimed the union is dissolved six more states soon followed south carolinas lead.
in february 1861 those states joined together as the confederate states of america.
the opening shots of the civil war were fired at fort sumter on april 12 1861.
no one was killed in the 33 hour bombardment.
it was a bloodless opening to the bloodiest war in u s history.
the civil war begins on march 4 1861 lincoln became president of the not so united united states.
in his inaugural address lincoln stated his belief that secession was both wrong and unconstitutional.
he then appealed to the rebellious states to return in peace.
in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine he said is the momentous issue of civil war a month later confederates in charleston south carolina forced the issue.
on april 12 1861 they opened fire on fort sumter a federal fort in charleston harbor.
after 33 hours of heavy shelling the defenders of the fort hauled down the stars and stripes and replaced it with the white flag of surrender.
the news that the confederates had fired on the american flag unleashed a wave of patriotic fury in the north.
all the doubts that people had about using force to save the union vanished.
a new york newspaper reported excitedly there is no more thought of bribing or coaxing the traitors who have dared to aim their cannon balls at the flag of the union fort sumter is temporarily lost but the country is saved the time for compromise was over.
the issues that had divided the nation for so many years would now be decided by a civil war.
chapter summary in this chapter you learned how a series of compromises failed to keep the united states from splitting in two over the issue of slavery.
confronting the issue of slavery the issue of granting missouri statehood threatened to upset the balance of free and slave states.
northerners were concerned that if missouri entered the union as a slave state other territories would also be admitted as slave states.
southerners worried that if congress banned slavery in missouri it would try to end slavery elsewhere.
the missouri compromise in 1820 the missouri compromise resolved the issue by admitting missouri as a slave state and maine as a free state.
it also drew a line across the louisiana territory.
in the future slavery would be permitted only south of that line.
the compromise of 1850 the furor over slavery in new territories erupted again after the mexican american war.
the compromise of 1850 admitted california as a free state and allowed the new mexico and utah territories to decide whether to allow slavery.
it also ended the slave trade in washington d c and included a stronger fugitive slave law.
attitudes on both sides were hardened by harriet beecher stowes novel uncle toms cabin and the kansas nebraska act.
the dred scott decision in 1857 the supreme court issued a decision in the dred scott case african americans were not citizens and the missouri compromise was unconstitutional.
from compromise to crisis antislavery activists formed a new political party the republican party.
the party nominated abraham lincoln for the illinois senate.
slavery was the focus of debates between lincoln and opponent stephen douglas.
lincoln lost the e ection but the debates brought slavery into sharp focus.

living as a free man in boston burns was arrested tried and sent backto slavery under the fugitive slave act.
a l lli m8btiav ti the granger collection new york slavery divides boston boston was a magnet for people who opposed slavery.
the american anti slavery society was based in boston as was the abolitionist newspaper the liberator.
but the issue of slavery divided even the people of boston.
tensions in boston increased as they did in other places.
boston like the nation was splitting apart.
on june 2 1854 about 50 000 people lined the streets of boston.
hundreds more gathered on rooftops.
businesses closed.
people looked out of the windows and doorways of the buildings where they usually worked.
women dangled black shawls out of second and third story windows.
by the citys harbor black fabric covered the commonwealth building.
from its upper windows hung six american flags all draped in black.
samuel may who was born during the american revolution hung two u s flags upside down from his hardware store as a protest.
at ground level a black coffin displayed the word liberty.
then anthony burns emerged from the courthouse.
surrounded by federal marshals he was walking to the docks where he would board a ship to virginia.
burns an escaped slave was being returned to his owner.
burns had escaped from slavery in virginia by hiding in the cargo hold of a ship.
he had settled in boston just a few months earlier believing that people in the free state of massachusetts would welcome him.
now many bostonians were outraged that burns was being forced back into slavery.
massachusetts had outlawed the institution decades earlier.
many escaped slaves lived as free people in the state.
burns s three block walk to the pier was dramatic.
bostons mayor had called on the military to keep order fearing that angry crowds would use force to free burns.
each guard who walked with burns held a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other.
one woman described watching the procession from an upstairs cc ng ru e from the courthouse to the pier.
she reported e and her companions called out shame and shame in our.

418 chapter 21 the fugitive slave act according to massachusetts law anthony burns had been a free man for the months he lived in boston.
nonetheless because of the federal fugitive slave act he was still a fugitive from slavery.
passed by the u s congress in 1850 the fugitive slave act said that slave owners could retrieve their runaway slaves.
burnss master had come to boston to reclaim his property he did so with the full power of the law behind him.
the outrage that greeted him in boston was a symptom of the divisions tearing apart the country.
burns was not the only one affected.
many slaves had fled to northern states where they lived in freedom.
the new law meant that they were no longer safe in their northern homes.
they could be captured and returned to their owners at any time.
with the new law in place many former slaves saw that their only chance for real safety was to get out of the country entirely.
william and ellen craft escaped slavery in macon georgia in 1848.
they went first to philadelphia and then farther north to boston.
even there they werent safe.
under the fugitive slave act slave catchers pursued them.
william locked himself in his clothing store while abolitionist friends hid ellen somewhere else.
when the immediate danger had passed bostons activists arranged for the couple to go to liverpool england.
there they could live in freedom unthreatened by slave catchers or their status as fugitive slaves.
the fugitive slave act affected northern abolitionists as well as escaped slaves.
the law now involved northerners in the slave system that many of them hated.
no matter how much the people of boston opposed slavery federal law overruled them.
meant to ease tensions between north and south the fugitive slave act only heightened them.
and so crowds of sad and angry bostonians watched helplessly as anthony burns left their haven in the north.
outraged by the injustice they watched unfolding before them they vowed to keep up the fight to end slavery.
boston abolitionists were outraged by the fate of anthony burns.
boston officials feared violence as burns was marched to the ship that would take him backto virginia.
a dividing nation 41 not everyone in boston was against slavery.
in 1835 an angry mob tried to lynch william lloyd garrison after one of his antislavery lectures.
the cradle of liberty meets the evil of slavery boston had long been a symbol of freedom sometimes called the cradle of liberty it was in boston after all that the colonists first rebelled against british rule.
and massachusetts was one of the first states to outlaw slavery.
bostonians in particular had a long commitment to abolition.
how had that commitment led to the terrible day in 1854 when anthony burns boarded the boat to return to virginia and become once again a slave.
no one could have foreseen that day back in 1829 when david walker an african american living in boston published a pamphlet called walkers appeal to the coloured citizens of the world.
in the pamphlet walker urged black americans to resist slavery.
he even suggested that violence might be necessary.
walker also warned white americans that god would punish them for the crime of slavery.
many others spoke out against the evils of slavery.
william lloyd garrison was one of them.
in his newspaper the liberator he made some radical claims.
he said that slaves must be freed immediately.
many abolitionists at the time said it would be best to end slavery gradually.
he said that african americans should not start colonies in africa as some reformers believed.
instead they should live as free people in the united states.
and perhaps most radical of all he said that blacks should not only be free but that they should have all the same rights as whites.
of course bostonians who opposed abolition disliked garrison and his ideas.
in 1835 a mob nearly killed him.
garrison later described how a few men carried him to safety.
he hated the hypocrisy of accepting slavery in the land of the free.
i was thus conducted carried.

what a scandalous and revolting contrast.

maria weston warren boston female anti slavery society it took courage to oppose slavery.
some sources estimate that only about 1 percent of northerners were active abolitionists.
their numbers may have been small but boston abolitionists fought on.
they took strong steps to protect the free blacks who lived in the city.
in 1842 a fugitive slave named george lattimer went to jail in boston.
he had to wait there while his owner traveled to virginia to get the papers that would prove that lattimer was a slave.
angry abolitionists filed legal claims on lattimers behalf.
their efforts failed.
kb slavbr mi inn in jili i lattimer did not become free until black bostonians paid his owner 400.
free blacks realized how shaky their freedom was.
slave catchers could return them south.
so they took the lead in distributing a petition calling for a state law to protect massachusetts citizens.
those who signed the petition did so desiring to free this commonwealth and themselves from all connection with domestic slavery and to secure the citizens of this state from the danger of enslavement.
as a result of their efforts the state passed the personal liberty law in 1843.
the law said that state the managers of the officials and facilities could not be used to capture and return fugitive slaves.
but the fugitive slave act overruled the state s personal liberty law.
it put federal not state officials in charge of returning fugitive slaves.
and so anthony burns had to return to virginia as a slave.
eventually bostons activists bought his freedom.
but the experience highlighted the fact that the north and south were bound to clash again until slavery was abolished.
