and culture before the civil war 323 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north factories come to america britain wanted to keep its technological innovations or new technologies secret.
it did not want rival nations to copy the new machines.
therefore the british parliament passed a law forbidding anyone to take plans of the new machinery out of the country.
slater breaks the law samuel slater soon proved that this law could not be enforced.
slater was a skilled mechanic in a british textile mill.
when he heard that americans were offering large rewards for plans of british factories he decided to leave britain.
in 1789 slater boarded a ship bound for new york city.
he knew that british officials searched the baggage of passengers sailing to the united states.
to avoid getting caught he memorized the design of the machines in the mill.
the first american mill slater soon visited moses brown a quaker capitalist who had a mill in pawtucket rhode island.
the mill was not doing well because its machinery constantly broke down.
slater set to work on improving the machinery.
by 1793 in pawtucket he built what became the first successful textile mill in the united states that was powered by water.
slater s wife hannah slater contributed to the success of the samuel slater had to memorize plans for the design of water powered factories in order to bring the plans to america without being stopped by british officials.
she discovered how to make thread stronger so that it would not snap on the spindles.
slaters factory was a huge success.
before long other american manufacturers began using his ideas.
interchangeable parts american manufacturers also benefited from the pioneering work of american inventor eli whitney.
earlier skilled workers made goods by hand.
for example gunsmiths spent days making the barrel stock and trigger for a single musket.
because the parts were handmade each musket differed a bit from every other musket.
if a part broke a gunsmith had to make a new part to fit that particular gun.
whitney wanted to speed up the making of guns by having machines manufacture each part.
all machine made parts would be alike for example one trigger would be identical to another.
identical parts would fit together with all other parts and gunsmiths would not have build each gun from scratch.
interchangeable parts would save time and money.
because the government bought many guns whitney went to washington d c to try to sell his idea.
at first officials laughed at his plan.
carefully whitney sorted parts for 10 muskets into separate piles.
he then asked an official to choose one part from each pile.
in minutes the first musket was assembled.
whitney repeated the process until 10 muskets were complete.
the idea of interchangeable parts spread rapidly.
inventors designed machines to produce interchangeable parts for clocks locks and many other goods.
with such machines small workshops grew into factories.
the spread of factories the war of 1812 provided a boost to american industries.
the british blockade cut americans off from their supply of foreign goods.
as a result they had to produce more goods themselves.
american merchants and bankers sought new ways to meet the increased demand.
to profit from the efficiency provided by manufacturing they built more factories.
as american investors took advantage of new technologies and built more factories the american economy grew.
where factories were built the first factories were built where physical characteristics of the environment favored them.
in pennsylvania factories used charcoal which could be made from abundant local timber for power.
these factories turned iron ore which was mined and smelted locally into machines tools and guns.
interactive 3 d model society and culture before the civil war 324 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north in new england textile factories were built alongside the hilly regions numerous falling streams which provided power for mills.
investors modified the physical environment by building dams and canals to power the mills.
these modifications spurred economic growth.
local wool and cotton from the south provided the raw materials for thread yarn and fabric.
in lynn massachusetts businesses systematized shoemaking starting shoe factories in the early 19th century.
the large factories attracted new workers to the town and the economy grew rapidly.
new england became the first region in the united states to develop manufacturing on a wide scale.
free enterprise and the industrial revolution in the united states the industrial revolution took place in a period marked by the growth of free enterprise.
british restrictions on trade had been lifted.
hamiltons reforms had strengthened the banking system and banks were able to lend more money.
new access to credit or borrowed money allowed people to start mills and factories in cities and in rural places where swift streams provided power.
these and other businesses operated for the most part without much government control.
nor did the government own factories or intervene heavily in the market.
the government however protected contracts and property.
people could buy sell or use property as they saw fit.
most americans wanted the freedom to try new things.
they believed in competition which encouraged new inventions.
in 1792 a group of 24 investors started the new york stock exchange.
this stock market raised private capital to pay for new ventures.
success meant profits and brought new wealth to investors.
profits led to new investment and further economic growth.
low taxes allowed businesses to hold onto large amounts of capital and use it to expand and create even more wealth.
the desire for profit and accumulated wealth sparked new ventures under new investors.
the role of market forces investors looked to the market to decide where to invest or what businesses to start.
in the free enterprise system goods are bought and sold and wages are determined by the market.
if a product is in high demand and the supply is limited the price will be high.
entrepreneurs started businesses to supply high priced or high demand products.
they abandoned businesses where the demand and price were low.
workers faced the same market forces.
people with skills that were in demand in factories could expect on may 17 1792 under a buttonwood tree at 68 wall street in new york city investors signed the buttonwood agreement that started the new york stock exchange as shown in this model.
higher wages than those whose skills had less value in the market.
u recall how did the british attempt to keep their technological innovations secret.
daily life in factory towns slater and whitneys innovations were just the first steps in americas industrial revolution.
during the early 1800s entire cities began to emerge around factories.
the lowell mills during the war of 1812 francis cabot lowell a boston merchant found a way to improve on british textile mills.
in britain one factory spun thread and a second factory wove it into cloth.
why not lowell wondered combine spinning and weaving under one roof.
the new mill that he built in waltham massachusetts had all the machines needed to turn raw cotton into finished cloth.
after lowells death his partners took on a more ambitious project.
they built an entire factory town society and culture before the civil war 325 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north and named it after him.
in 1821 lowell massachusetts was a village of five farm families.
by 1836 it boasted more than 10 000 people.
visitors to lowell described it as a model community composed of small wooden houses painted white with green blinds very neat very snug very nicely carpeted lowell girls to work in their new mills the company hired young women from nearby farms.
the lowell girls as they came to be called usually worked for a few years in the mills before returning home to marry.
these young women and women like them in other mill towns made an important economic contribution to american society by providing labor for the industrial revolution.
most sent their wages home to their families.
at first parents hesitated to let their daughters work in the mills.
to reassure parents the company built boardinghouses or buildings with many shared bedrooms and a kitch that served meals.
the company also made rules to protect the young women.
although factory work was often tedious hard and dangerous many women valued the economic freedom they got from working in the mills.
one worker wrote her sister sarah back on a farm in new hampshire organized child labor was common during the industrial revolution.
many american children worked in factories like the english factory shown here.
draw conclusions why did reformers begin to speak out against child labor.
since i have wrote you another pay day has come around.
i earned 14 dollars and a half.
i like it well as ever and sarah dont i feel independent of everyone.
from lowell offering writings by new england mill women in lowell and elsewhere mill owners hired mostly women and children.
they did this because they could pay women and children half of what they would have had to pay men.
child labor boys and girls as young as seven worked in factories.
small children were especially useful in textile mills because they could squeeze around the large machines to change spindles.
today most americans look upon child labor as cruel.
yet in the 1800s farm children also worked hard.
most people did not see much difference between children working in a factory or on a farm.
often a childs wages were needed to help support the family.
long hours working hours in the mills were long 12 hours a day 6 days a week.
true farmers also put in long hours.
however farmers worked shorter hours in winter.
mill workers in contrast worked nearly the same hours all year round.
in the early 1800s conditions in american mills were generally much better than in most factories in europe.
as industries grew however competition increased and employers took less interest in the welfare of their workers.
this eventually led to worse working conditions.
changes in home life the industrial revolution had a great impact on home life.
as the factory system spread more family members left the home to earn a living.
these changes affected ideas about the role of women.
in poorer families women often had to go out to work.
in wealthier families husbands supported the family while wives stayed at home.
for many husbands having a wife who stayed at home became a sign of success.
fcl draw conclusions how did competition change working conditions in american mills.
society and culture before the civil war 326 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north urban growth industrialization growth of urban areas nthe north 43 children of native born parents 57 immigrants and children of immigrants y source national bureau of economic research united states 1820 manufacturing 1040 employment 351 296 787 393 1 265 251 source historical statistics of the united states analyze graphs based on the information in the graphs what factor best explains the rapid rate of urbanization in northern cities during the mid 1800s.
cities expand in 1800 the vast majority of americans lived in rural areas.
during the industrial revolution many people left farms for cities attracted by the job opportunities to be found in factories.
as investors found that factories produced a profit they invested those profits in building more factories which attracted still more workers from farms.
older cities expanded rapidly while new cities sprang up around factories.
this movement of the population from rural areas to cities is called urbanization.
urbanization increased as industry grew.
urbanization was a steady but gradual process.
in 1800 only 6 percent of the nations population lived in urban areas.
by 1850 the number had risen to 15 percent.
not until 1920 did more americans live in cities than in rural areas.
by todays standards these early cities were small.
a person could walk from one end of any american city to the other in as little as 30 minutes.
buildings were only a few stories tall.
as the factory system spread the nations cities grew.
hazards of urbanization growing cities had many problems.
many of these were negative consequences human modification of the environment.
dirt and piavel streets turned into mud holes when it rained.
cities had no sewers and people threw garbage into the streets.
a visitor to new york reported that the streets are filthy and the stranger is not a little surprised to meet the hogs walking about in them for the purpose of devouring the vegetables and trash thrown into the gutter untreated sewage and garbage often seeped into wells or flowed into streams and rivers polluting the water.
the contaminated water spread disease.
epidemics of influenza and cholera kahl ur uh raged through cities killing thousands.
at about the same time coal became an important source of industrial and home heating power.
the smoke and soot from burning coal seriously modified the environment polluting the air and dirtying cities.
it also caused health problems.
attractions cities had attractions besides work opportunities.
theaters museums and circuses created an air of excitement.
in cities people could shop in fine stores that sold the latest fashions from europe.
some offered modern ready to wear clothing.
while most women continued to sew their own clothes many enjoyed visiting hat shops china shops shoe stores and fancy goods stores.
q describe what were some drawbacks of urbanization.
society and culture before the civil war 327 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north new technological innovations northern industry grew steadily in the mid 1800s.
most northerners still lived on farms.
however more and more of the northern economy began to depend on manufacturing and trade.
the 1800s brought a flood of new inventions in the north.
in massachusetts and connecticut a european visitor exclaimed there is not a laborer who has not invented a machine or a tool americans of the period were a practical people.
americans and especially northerners looked to science for new and useful applications that could be put to work at once.
they expected technology to bring economic development and to change the way people lived.
technology refers to ways of doing things sometimes involving advanced scientific knowledge or tools that make use of advanced knowledge.
innovation is coming up with new ways of making or doing things.
scientific and technological innovations during the colonial period such as franklin s lightning rod had brought limited and modest changes to daily life in america.
by comparison the scientific and technological innovations of the 1800s transformed how americans lived and worked.
singers treadle sewing machine was powered by foot and allowed the seamstress or tailor to sew quickly and evenly.
interactive timel ine in 1834 philo stewart developed a cast iron stove small enough for use in an average kitchen.
his factory built wood burning stove was a great success.
about 90 000 were sold.
the cast iron stove was only one sign of the way northern factories were changing the lives of ordinary people.
joseph henry a new yorker showed that electric current could be sent through a wire over long distances to ring a bell.
his work paved the way for later inventions.
thomas davenport a blacksmith invented a type of electric motor in 1834.
both inventions were adapted and marketed.
competition among inventors brought about more innovation.
in 1846 elias howe patented a sewing machine.
a few years later isaac singer improved on howes machine.
soon clothing makers bought hundreds of the new sewing machines.
workers could now make dozens of shirts in the time it took a tailor to sew one by hand.
farm machines some new inventions made work easier for farmers.
in 1825 jethro wood began the manufacture of an iron plow with replaceable parts.
john deere improved on the idea when he invented a lightweight steel plow.
earlier plows made of heavy iron or wood had to be pulled by slow moving oxen.
a horse could pull a steel plow through a field more quickly.
in 1847 cyrus mccormick opened a factory in chicago that produced mechanical reapers.
the reaper was a horse drawn machine that mowed wheat and other grains.
mccormicks reaper could do the work of five people using hand tools.
other farm machines followed.
there was a mechanical drill to plant grain a threshing machine to beat grain from its husk and a horse drawn hay rake.
these machines helped farmers raise more grain with fewer hands.
as a result thousands of farmworkers left the countryside.
some went west to start farms of their own.
others found jobs in new factories in northern cities.
a new communications system the telegraph samuel f b morse received a patent for a talking wire or telegraph in 1844.
the telegraph was a device that sent electrical signals along a wire.
it was a new technology that was made possible by scientific discoveries about electricity.
the signals were based on a code of dots dashes and spaces.
the dots stood for short tones the dashes for long tones.
later this system of dots and dashes became known as the morse code.
congress gave morse funds to run wire from washington d c to baltimore.
on may 24 1844 morse j 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north z society and culture before the civil war j set up his telegraph in the supreme court chamber in washington.
as a crowd of onlookers watched morse tapped out a short message.
what hath god wrought a few seconds later the operator in baltimore tapped back the same message.
the telegraph worked.
morses invention was an instant success.
telegraph companies sprang up everywhere.
thousands of miles of wire soon stretched across the country.
as a result of the telegraph news could now travel long distances in a matter of minutes.
the telegraph helped many businesses to thrive.
merchants and farmers could have quick access to information about supply demand and prices of goods in different areas of the country.
for example western farmers might learn of a wheat shortage in new york and ship their grain east to meet the demand.
the availability of instant information about markets changed the way goods were marketed across the country and contributed to the development of a nationwide market.
the quick and widespread use of the telegraph connected the nation in a completely new way.
almost every american town eventually had a telegraph providing nearly instant communication from coast to coast.
by the late 1850s a telegraph cable connected the united states with europe.
just as the telegraph transformed national marketing it also helped change the way goods were marketed internationally.
not only commerce and industry benefited from the telegraph but ordinary people could communicate quickly with distant family and friends.
the presence of telegraph offices in cities and towns was yet another of the many attractions that helped drive urbanization.
the telegraph is an example of how scientific discoveries influenced daily life during the 1800s.
h infer how did the invention of new farm machines contribute to urbanization in the north.
the age of steam power at first railroads were used to provide transportation to canals.
in time however the railroad became a more practical means of transportation than canals.
the first railroads were built in the early 1800s.
horses or mules pulled cars along wooden rails covered with strips iron.
then in 1829 an english family developed a steam powered locomotive engine to pull rail cars.
the engine called the rocket barreled along at 30 uuiles per hour.
this engraving shows an early steam powered locomotive.
the steam powered locomotive was the main way to travel and ship goods across america by the mid 1800s.
interactive gallery early difficulties not all americans welcomed the new railroads.
workers who moved freight on horse drawn wagons feared that they would lose their jobs.
people who had invested in canals worried that competition from the railroads might cause them to lose their investments.
there were problems with the early railroads.
they were not always safe or reliable.
soft roadbeds and weak bridges often led to accidents.
locomotives often broke down.
even when they worked their smokestacks belched thick black smoke and hot embers.
the embers sometimes burned holes in passengers clothing or set nearby buildings on fire.
part of the problem was the way in which railroads were built.
often instead of two tracks being laid one for each direction only one was set.
signals to control traffic on a single track did not yet exist.
this increased the likelihood of a collision.
another problem with early railroads was that there was no standard gauge or distance between the rails.
as a result different railroads often used different gauges.
to transfer from one railroad line to another people and goods had to be moved off one train and then loaded onto another.
society and culture before the civil war 329.
the industrial revolution and life in the north a railroad boom gradually railroad builders overcame problems and removed obstacles.
engineers learned to build sturdier bridges and solid roadbeds.
they replaced wooden rails with iron rails.
railroads developed signaling systems and agreed on a standard gauge.
such improvements made railroad travel safer and faster.
by the 1850s railroads crisscrossed the nation.
the major lines were concentrated in the north and west.
new york chicago and cincinnati became major rail centers.
the south had much less track than the north.
railroads played an important role in urban growth.
cities with good rail connections attracted factories and other businesses.
railroads also made it possible for people to migrate more easily to new cities increasing urban populations.
yankee clippers railroads increased commerce within the united states.
at the same time trade also increased between the united states and other nations.
at seaports in the northeast captains loaded their ships with cotton fur wheat lumber and tobacco.
then they sailed to other parts of the world.
speed was the key to successful trade at sea.
in 1845 an american named john griffiths launched the rainbow the first of the clipper ships.
these sleek vessels had tall masts and huge sails that caught every gust of wind.
their narrow hulls clipped swiftly through the water.
these technological innovations gave up cargo space for speed which gave american merchants an advantage.
in the 1840s american clipper ships broke every speed record.
one clipper ship sped from new york to hong kong in 81 days flying past older ships that took many months to reach china.
the speed of the clippers helped the united states win a large share of the worlds sea trade in the 1840s and 1850s.
the golden age of clipper ships was brief.
in the 1850s britain launched the first oceangoing iron steamships.
these sturdy vessels carried more cargo and traveled even faster than clippers.
the effects of technological and scientific innovations in the late 1700s and early 1800s scientists and inventors had found ways to harness heat in the form of steam to power machines.
by the 1830s factories began to use steam power instead of water power.
machines that were driven by steam were powerful and cheap to run.
also factories that used steam power could be built almost anywhere not just along the banks of swift flowing rivers.
as a result american industry expanded rapidly.
at the same time new machines made it possible to produce more goods at a lower cost.
these more affordable goods attracted eager buyers.
families no longer had to make clothing and other goods in their homes.
instead they could buy factory made products.
society and culture before the civil war 330 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north the impact of railroads railroads allowed factory owners to transport large amounts of raw materials and finished goods cheaply and quickly also as railroads stretched across the nation they linked distant towns with cities and factories.
these towns became new markets for factory goods.
railroads greatly increased the size of the american marketplace and fueled even more factory production.
the growth of railroads also affected northern farming.
railroads brought cheap grain and other foods from the west to new england.
new england farmers could not compete with this new source of cheap foods.
many left their farms to find new jobs in towns and cities as factory workers store clerks and sailors.
the benefits of free enterprise the early rise of industrialization in the united states under the free enterprise system brought striking economic and social benefits.
mass producation lowered prices and raised americans purchasing power and standard of living.
wages increased for average workers.
food canned in factories improved peoples year round diets.
the use of stoves improved meals and home heating.
factory made clothing was cheaper than homemade.
great numbers of newspapers and magazines reported regularly about the new inventions and advertised the new products.
along with these changes though there were also challenges.
draw conclusions what was the principal advantage of steam power over water power.
workers respond to challenges factories of the 1840s and 1850s were very different from the mills of the early 1800s.
as industrialization grew life changed for workers.
the factories were larger and they used steam powered machines.
laborers worked longer hours for lower wages.
usually workers lived in dark dingy houses in the shadow of the factory.
changing roles the emphasis on mass production changed the way workers felt about their jobs.
before the growth of factories skilled workers or artisans were proud of the goods they made.
the factory owner however was more interested in how much could be produced than in how well it was made.
workers could not be creative.
furthermore unlike the artisan who could have his or her own business the factory worker was not likely to rise to a management position.
the broad sail area of clipper ships like the one shown here made them the fastest ships available for ocean transport until the development of steam powered oceangoing ships in the 1850s.
with the emphasis on mass production in the midnineteenth century workers like the ones in this rubber processing factory worked long hours for low wages.
society and culture before the civil war 331 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north families in factories as the need for workers increased entire families labored in factories.
in some cases a family agreed to work for one year.
if even one family member broke the contract the entire family might be fired.
the factory day began when a whistle sounded at 4 a m.
the entire family father mother and children headed off to work.
many factories at that time employed young children.
the workday did not end until 7 30 p m when a final whistle sent the workers home.
hazards at work factory workers faced discomfort and danger.
few factories had windows or heating systems.
in summer the heat and humidity inside the factory were stifling.
in winter the extreme cold contributed to frequent sickness.
factory machines had no safety devices and accidents were common.
there were no laws regulating factory conditions and injured workers often lost their jobs.
trade unions and strikes poor working conditions and low wages led workers to organize into groups to improve their conditions.
the first workers to organize as working conditions in factories worsened during the 1800s workers such as this group of women and their supporters in lynn massachusetts demanded reduced working hours and better pay.
were artisans.
in the 1820s and 1830s artisans in each trade united to form trade unions.
trade unions were part of a labor reform movement.
the concentration of workers in cities helped the formation of unions by allowing people working in the same industry for different companies to organize together.
their trade unions called for a shorter workday higher wages and better working conditions.
sometimes unions went on strike to gain their demands.
in a strike union workers refuse to do their jobs until managers agree to address their concerns.
in the early 1800s strikes were illegal in many parts of the united states.
strikers faced fines or jail sentences.
employers often fired strike leaders.
employers were politically opposed to workers organizing.
progress for artisans slowly however the labor reform movement made progress.
in 1840 president van buren approved a ten hour workday for government employees.
workers celebrated another victory in 1842 when a massachusetts court declared that they had the right to strike.
artisans won better pay because factory owners needed their skills.
unskilled workers however were unable to bargain for better wages since their jobs required little or no training.
because these workers were easy to replace employers did not listen to their demands.
during the industrial revolution a new awareness of class differences began to emerge.
as a farming people americans had long viewed labor with deep respect.
the changing conditions of factory labor and the gaps between the wages of unskilled workers managers and business owners led to a sense of people grouped in classes with shared interests.
the interests of these classes were often different.
by bringing together workers and managers in the same factories and cities urbanization led to a rise in conflicts resulting from differences in social class.
women workers organize the success of trade unions encouraged other workers to organize.
workers in new england textile mills were especially eager to protest cuts in wages and unfair work rules.
many of these workers were women.
women workers faced special problems.
first they had always earned less money than men did.
second most union leaders did not want women in their ranks.
like many people at the time they believed that women should not work outside the home.
in fact the goal of many unions was to raise mens wages so that their wives could leave their factory jobs.
despite these problems women workers organized.
they staged several strikes at lowell massachusetts society and culture before the civil war 332 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north in the 1830s.
in the 1840s sarah bagley organized the lowell female labor reform association.
the group petitioned the state legislature for a ten hour workday b draw conclusions why could artisans command higher wages while other workers could not.
ethnic minorities in the north by the late 1840s many factory workers in the north were immigrants.
an immigrant is a person who enters a new country in order to settle there.
in the 1840s and 1850s about 4 million immigrants arrived in the united states.
they were attracted in large part by the opportunities for farming the land or working in the cities.
among them were immigrants from britain who came to earn higher wages.
there was a greater demand in the united states for skilled machinists carpenters and miners.
from ireland and germany in the 1840s a disease destroyed the potato crop in ireland which was the mam food of the poor people.
other crops such as wheat and oats were not affected.
at the time ireland was under british rule and most irish crops were exported to england.
when a large part of the potato crop was lost to disease british landowners continued to ship the wheat and oats to england.
there was little left for the irish to eat.
this situation caused a famine or severe food shortage.
thousands of people died of starvation.
nearly as many died from disease.
between 1845 and 1860 over 1 5 million irish fled to the united states seeking freedom from hunger and british rule.
meanwhile many germans were also arriving in the united states.
harsh weather conditions from 1829 to 1830 resulted in severe food shortages in germany.
by 1832 more than 10 000 germans were coming to the united states in a single year seeking fertile land to farm and a better life.
in 1848 revolutions had broken out in several parts of germany.
the rebels fought for democratic reforms.
when the revolts failed thousands had to flee.
attracted by its democratic political system many came to the united states.
many other german immigrants came simply to make a better life for themselves.
between 1848 and f86o nearly one million germans arrived in the united states.
enriching the nation immigrants supplied much f the labor that helped the nations economy grow.
this scene shows immigrants landing in new york city in the 1850s.
many immigrants had little money when they first arrived in the united states and had to remain in the cities where they disembarked.
although most of the irish immigrants had been farmers few had money to buy farmland.
many settled in the northern cities where low paying factory jobs were available.
other irish workers transformed the environment by helping to build many new canals and railroads.
irish women often worked as servants in private homes.
immigrants from germany often had enough money to move west and buy good farmland.
these immigrants transfomed the environment by turning prairie into farmland.
others were artisans and merchants.
cities of the midwest such as st louis milwaukee and cincinnati had german grocers butchers and bakers.
a small minority of the immigrants from germany were jewish.
german jews began immigrating to the united states in the 1820s.
by the early 1860s there were about 150 communities in the united states with substantial jewish populations.
most irish immigrants and many german immigrants were catholic.
by contrast most americans in the early 1800s were protestant.
because many immigrants especially from ireland were drawn to americas growing cities the process of urbanization led to an increase in both ethnic and religious diversity.
society and culture before the civil war 333 7 1 the industrial revolution and life in the north a reaction against immigrants not everyone welcomed the flood of immigrants.
one group of americans called nativists wanted to preserve the country for native born white citizens.
using the slogan americans must rule america they called for laws to limit immigration.
they also wanted to keep immigrants from voting until they had lived in the united states for 21 years.
at the time newcomers could vote after only 5 years in the country.
some nativists protested that newcomers stole jobs from native born americans because they worked for lower pay.
furthermore when workers went out on strike factory owners often hired immigrant workers to replace them.
many distrusted the different language customs and dress of the immigrants.
others blamed immigrants for the rise in crime in the growing cities.
still others mistrusted irish newcomers because many of them were catholics.
until the 1840s the majority of immigrants from europe had been protestants.
as american cities attracted catholic immigrants these cities became centers of conflicts over religion.
by the 1850s hostility to immigrants was so strong that nativists formed a new political party.
members of the party were anti catholic and anti immigrant.
many meetings and rituals of the party were kept secret.
it was called the know nothing party because members answered i know nothing when asked about the the african meeting house on beacon hill in boston is the oldest standing black church in the united states.
the message of the party did gain supporters but its support was limited to the north where most immigrants settled.
in 1856 millard fillmore the know nothing candidate for president won 21 percent of the popular vote.
soon after however the party died out.
in time conflicts between ethnic groups were resolved as immigrants or their children became part of american society.
also different ethnic groups became incorporated into the nations political fabric as political parties particularly the democratic party began to speak for their interests.
african americans face discrimination during the nations early years slavery was legal in the north.
by the early 1800s however all of the northern states had passed laws to bring an end to slavery.
in some states only the children of slaves gained freedom at first.
many did not completely abolish slavery until the mid 1800s.
still thousands of free african americans lived in the north and their number grew steadily during the early 1800s.
free african americans in the north faced discrimination.
discrimination is a policy or an attitude that denies equal rights to certain groups of people.
as one writer pointed out african americans were denied the ballot box the jury box the halls of the legislature the army the public lands the school and the church even skilled african americans had trouble finding good jobs.
one black woodworker was turned away by every furniture maker in cincinnati.
at last a shop owner hired him.
however when he entered the shop the other woodworkers dropped their tools.
either he must leave or they would they declared.
similar experiences occurred throughout the north.
in addition african americans faced competition from immigrants who settled in northern cities.
yet some find success despite such obstacles free blacks in north had some choice over where they lived and worked unlike enslaved blacks in the south.
in fact some northern african americans achieved notable success in business.

it was so profitable southerners did not even feel a need to invest in factories.
even though southerners grew other crops cotton remained the regions leading export.

textile mills in the north and in britain needed more and more cotton to make cloth.
at first southern planters could not meet the demand.
they could grow plenty of cotton because the souths soil and climate were ideal.
however removing the seeds from the cotton by hand was a slow process.
planters needed a better way to clean cotton.

he was going to be a tutor on a plantation.
at that time there were few public schools in the south.
when whitney learned of the planters problem he decided to build a machine to clean cotton.
in only 10 days whitney came up with a model.
his cotton engine or gin had two rollers with thin wire teeth.
when cotton was swept between the rollers the teeth separated the seeds from the fibers.

this technological innovation had an enormous effect on the southern economy.
a single worker using a cotton gin could do work of 50 people cleaning cotton by hand.
because of the gin planters 336 r 1 could now grow cotton at a huge profit.
as a result this technological innovation brought economic growth.
cotton kingdom and slavery the cotton gin led to a boom or swift growth in cotton production.
in 1792 planters grew only 6 000 bales of cotton a year.
by 1850 the figure was over 2 million bales.
there was not enough farmland suitable for growing cotton in the original southern states along the atlantic coast to meet the demand.
cotton farmers needed new land to cultivate or prepare for planting.
after the war of 1812 cotton planters began to move west.
they brought enslaved african americans with them.
the huge demand for cotton the efficiency offered by cotton gins and southern planters reliance on slave labor led to the growth of large plantations each with many enslaved workers.
by the 1850s there were cotton plantations extending in a belt from south carolina to texas.
this area of the south became known as the cotton kingdom.
physical aspects of the environment in this part of the south including rich soils warm temperatures and abundant rainfall encouraged an economy focused on cotton farming.
tragically as the cotton kingdom spread so did slavery.
even though cotton could now be cleaned by machine it still had to be planted and picked by hand.
the result was a cruel cycle in which slave labor brought profits to planters who then used the profits to buy more land and more enslaved workers.
id generate explanations how did the invention of the cotton gin lead to an increase in slavery in the south.
with the top of this cotton gin folded down workers would feed cotton balls through the gins teeth and the barbed roller.
these metal parts separated the fibers from the seeds in a cotton ball and straightened the cotton fibers.
with the gin workers could produce much more cotton in a day.
predict consequences how would this invention affect the demand for slaves.
reliance on agriculture cotton was the souths most profitable cash crop.
however the best soils and climate for growing cotton could be found mostly in a belt stretching across inland south carolina georgia alabama mississippi louisiana and texas.
in other areas of the south rice sugar cane and tobacco were major crops.
in addition southerners raised much of the nations livestock.
physical characteristics of the environment in different regions of the south influenced what farmers in those regions produced.
rice was an important crop along the coasts of south carolina and georgia.
sugar cane was important in louisiana and texas.
growing rice and sugar cane required expensive irrigation and drainage systems end a warm moist climate all found mainly along the coasts.
interactive 3 d model this print from the 1800s shows the intense physical abor involved in harvesting sugar cane.
society and culture before the civil war 337 7 2 king cotton and life in the south cane growers also needed costly machinery to grind their harvest.
small scale farmers could not afford such expensive equipment however.
as a result rice and sugar farmers relied on the plantation system just as cotton farmers did.
tobacco had been an export of the south since 1619 and it continued to be planted in virginia north carolina tennessee and kentucky.
however in the early 1800s the large tobacco plantations of colonial days had given way to small tobacco farms.
on these farms a few field hands tended five or six acres of tobacco.
in addition to the major cash crops of cotton rice sugar and tobacco the south also led the nation in livestock production.
southern livestock owners profited from hogs oxen horses mules and beef cattle.
much of this livestock was raised in areas that were unsuitable for growing crops such as the pine woods of north carolina and hilly regions of georgia western virginia kentucky tennessee and arkansas.
kentucky developed a rural economy that included the breeding of horses.
limited southern industry because the south relied on agriculture most of the industry in the south remained small and existed only to meet the needs of a farming society.
this contrasted with the north with its increasingly urban society and large and diverse industries.
agricultural tools such as cotton gins planters and plows were manufactured.
factories also made goods such as ironware hoes and jute or hemp cloth which was used to make bags for holding bales of cotton.
cheap cotton cloth was made for use in enslaved workers clothing.
some southerners wanted to encourage the growth of industry in the south.
william gregg for example modeled his cotton mill in south carolina on the mills in lowell massachusetts.
gregg built houses and gardens for his paid workers and schools for their children.
the south also developed a few other successful industries.
in richmond virginia for example the tredegar iron works turned out railroad equipment machinery tools and cannons.
flour milling was another important southern industry.
even so the south lagged behind the north in manufacturing.
this difference had several causes.
rich planters invested their money in land and in purchasing enslaved african americans rather than in factories.
slavery also reduced the need for southern industry.
in the north most people had enough money to buy factory goods.
in the south however millions of enslaved african americans could not buy anything.

society and culture before the civil war 338 7 2 king cotton and life in the south agriculture in the south 1860 analyze maps based on the information in the map what would you expect to be true about the economies of major southern cities.
as a result the demand for manufactured goods in the south was not as great as it was in the north.
southern cities although the south was mainly rural there were some cities.
the major ones were new orleans louisiana charleston south carolina and richmond virginia.
these cities had the same problems as northern cities including poor housing and poor sanitation.
fewer than 8 percent of white southerners lived in towns of more than 4 000 people.
however many free african americans lived in towns and cities.
economically dependent the souths lack of industry had a number of effects on the south.
because there were few industrial jobs small farmers in the south had few ways to escape the poverty of life on a small farm whereas northern farmers could move to cities and take factory jobs.
with little industry f its own the south also came to depend more and we on the north and on europe.
southern planters ften borrowed money from northern banks in order to expand their plantations.
they also purchased much of their furniture farm tools and machines from northern or european factories.
many southerners resented this situation.
one southerner described a burial to show how the south upended on the north for many goods in the 1850s.
the grave was dug through solid marble but the marble headstone came from vermont.
it was in a pine wilderness but the pine coffin came from cincinnati.
an iron mountain overshadowed it but the coffin nails and the screws and the shovel came from pittsburgh.
a hickory grove grew nearby but the pick and shovel handles came from new york.
that country so rich in underdeveloped resources furnished nothing for the funeral except the corpse and the hole in the ground.
henry grady speech to the bay street club boston 1883 still most southerners were proud of the booming cotton economy in their region.
as long as cotton remained king southerners believed they could look to the future with confidence.
b draw conclusions why was the south dependent on the north and europe for non agricultural goods.
society and culture before the civil war 339 king cotton and life in the south southern whites the old south is often pictured as a land of vast plantations worked by hundreds of enslaved african americans.
such grand estates did exist in the south.
however most white southerners were not rich planters.
in fact most whites owned no enslaved african americans at all.
the cottonocracy a planter was someone who owned at least 20 enslaved workers.
in 1860 only one white southerner in 30 belonged to a planter family.
an even smaller number less than 1 percent owned 50 or more enslaved workers.
these wealthy families were called the cottonocracy because they made huge amounts of money from cotton.
these rich planters lived mainly in the cotton belt of the lowland south and in coastal areas of south carolina georgia and louisiana.
though few in number their views and way of life dominated the south.
the richest planters built elegant homes and filled them with expensive furniture from europe.
they entertained lavishly.
they tried to dress and behave like european nobility.
because of their wealth and influence many planters became political leaders.
planters hired white overseers to run day to day affairs on their plantations and to manage the work of enslaved african americans.
wealthy white southerners lived in elegant homes on plantations like this plantation home in mississippi.
ll interactive chart small farmers about 75 percent of southern whites were small farmers.
these plain folk owned the land they farmed.
they might also own one or two enslaved african americans.
unlike planters plain folk worked with their enslaved workers in the fields.
small farmers could be found in most parts of the south but their numbers were fewer in the cotton belt and in coastal regions where plantation agriculture was dominant.
among small farmers helping one another was an important duty.
people who lived miles apart counted themselves as neighbors wrote a farmer in mississippi.
and in case of sorrow or sickness there was no limit to the service neighbors provided.
poor whites lower on the social ladder were poor whites.
these whites did not own enslaved african americans.
many did not own the land they farmed.
instead they rented it often paying the owner with part of their crop.
many barely made a living.
poor whites often lived in the hilly wooded areas of the upland south north and west of the cotton belt.
they planted crops such as corn potatoes and other vegetables.
they also herded cattle and pigs.
poor whites had hard lives but they enjoyed rights that were denied to all black people enslaved or free.
comparing northern and southern whites like northern whites most southern whites were farmers.
most white farmers in both regions were small farmers.
however there were important differences in the white populations of the two regions.
in the south the wealthiest whites were planters who made their money from the work of enslaved african americans.
in the north the wealthiest whites were capitalists who made their money from investing in industry.
there were many white industrial workers and middle class people living in cities in the north.
relatively few southerners of any class lived in cities.
u recall who made up the cottonocracy in the old south.
southern african americans both free and enslaved african americans lived in the south.
their legal and political conditions were different.
although free under the law and with certain legal rights free african americans faced harsh discrimination.
enslaved african americans had no rights at all.
society and culture before the civil war 340 7 2 king cotton and life in the south free african americans most free african americans were descendants of enslaved people who were freed during and after the american revolution.
others had bought their freedom.
in 1860 over 200 000 free blacks lived in the south.
most lived in maryland and delaware where slavery was in decline.
others lived in cities such as new orleans richmond and charleston.
many free african americans reached an impressive level of success.
working as farmers laborers and artisans such as blacksmiths carpenters and cobblers they contributed to and influenced southern life.
some owned and operated businesses such as inns and barbershops.
a few became large plantation owners growing cotton and owning enslaved workers.
white slave owners did not like free african americans living in the south.
they feared that free african americans set a dangerous example encouraging enslaved african americans to rebel.
also slave owners justified slavery by claiming that african americans could not take care of themselves.
free african americans proved this idea wrong.
to discourage free african americans southern states passed laws that made life even harder for them.
free african americans were not allowed to vote or travel.
in some southern states they had to move out of the state or risk the chance of being kidnapped and enslaved.
despite these limits free african americans were able to make a life for themselves and make valuable contributions to southern life.
for example norbert rillieux rihl yoo invented a machine that revolutionized the way sugar was refined.
another inventor henry blair patented a seed planter.
enslaved african americans by 1860 enslaved african americans made up one third of the souths population.
most worked as field hands on cotton plantations.
both men and women cleared new land and planted and harvested crops.
children helped by pulling weeds collecting wood and carrying water to the field hands.
by the time they were teenagers they worked between 12 and 14 hours a day.
daily labor in the fields bound enslaved workers into a community of people who tried to help and protect one another.
on large plantations some enslaved african americans had better positions.
they might work as household servants or as skilled artisans such as carpenters and blacksmiths.
such jobs might entitle workers to better food or clothing than field hands.
a few enslaved people worked in cities.
their earnings however belonged to their owners.
unlike free african americans enslaved african americans could not easily start businesses of their own.
these reconstructed slave cabins in louisiana which would have housed up to two families of enslaved african americans each appear as they would have on mid nineteenth century plantations.
another major difference between the social circumstances of free and enslaved african americans was that enslaved african american families could be broken up by their owners with family members sold separately.
while they faced discriminations free african american families were not forced to separate.
compare and contrast how was life in the south similar and different for free and enslaved african americans.
slavery in the south the life of enslaved african americans was determined by strict laws and the practices of individual slave owners.
conditions varied from plantation to plantation.
some owners made sure their enslaved workers had clean cabins decent food and warm clothes.
other planters spent as little as possible on their enslaved workers.
slave codes southern states passed laws known as slave codes to keep enslaved african americans from either running away or rebelling.
these codes applied to enslaved blacks but not to free blacks.
under the society and culture before the civil war 341 7 2 king cotton and life in the south codes enslaved african americans were forbidden to gather in groups of more than three.
they could not leave their owners land without a written pass from their owner.
they were not allowed to own guns.
slave codes also made it a crime for enslaved african americans to learn how to read and write.
owners hoped that this law would make it hard for african americans to escape slavery.
they reasoned that uneducated enslaved african americans who escaped their owners would not be able to use maps or read train schedules.
they would not be able to find their way north.
some laws were meant to protect enslaved african americans but only from the worst forms of abuse.
however enslaved african americans did not have the right to testify in court.
as a result they were not able to bring charges against owners who abused them.
enslaved african americans had only one real protection against mistreatment.
owners looked on their enslaved workers as valuable property.
most slave owners wanted to keep this human property healthy and productive.
hard work even the kindest owners insisted that their enslaved workers work long hard days.
enslaved slave owners expected enslaved children to work alongside their parents such as these children working on a cotton field in georgia.
african americans worked from can see to cant see or from dawn to dusk up to 16 hours a day.
frederick douglass who escaped slavery recalled his life under one harsh master we were worked in all weathers.
it was never too hot or too cold it could never rain blow hail or snow too hard for us to work in the field.
work work work.
the longest days were too short for him and the shortest nights too long for him.
frederick douglass ncinative.
ot i tie life of frederick douglass an american slave family life it was hard for enslaved african americans to keep their families together.
southern laws did not recognize slave marriages or slave families.
as a result owners could sell a husband and wife to different buyers.
children were often taken from their parents and sold.
on large plantations many enslaved families did manage to stay together.
for those african americans the family was a source of strength pride and love.
grandparents parents children aunts uncles and cousins formed a close knit group.
this idea of an extended family had its roots in africa.
enslaved african americans preserved other traditions as well.
parents taught their children traditional african stories and songs.
they used folk tales to pass on african history and moral beliefs.
religion offers hope by the 1800s many enslaved african americans were devout christians.
planters often allowed white ministers to preach to their slaves.
african americans also had their own preachers and beliefs.
religion helped african americans cope with the harshness of slave life.
bible stories about how the ancient hebrews had escaped from slavery inspired a new type of religious song called a spiritual.
as they worked in the fields enslaved workers would often sing about a coming day of freedom.
enslaved african americans had to be cautious even in their religious practice.
while they sang of freedom in spirituals the words of the spirituals suggested that this freedom would come after death so as not to alarm slave owners.
fell recall why was it difficult for enslaved african americans to keep their families together.
interactive chart society and culture before the civil war 342 7 2 king cotton and life in the south resisting slavery enslaved african americans struck back against the system that denied them both freedom and wages.
some broke tools destroyed crops and stole food.
many enslaved african americans tried to escape to the north.
because the journey was long and dangerous very few made it to freedom.
every county had slave patrols and sheriffs ready to question an unknown black person.
in the north as you will learn african americans were able to fight slavery with peaceful means.
because southern laws offered no means to resist slavery a few african americans turned to violence to resist the brutal slave system.
denmark vesey a free african american planned a revolt in 1822.
vesey was betrayed before the revolt began.
he and 35 other people were executed.
in 1831 an african american preacher named nat turner led a major revolt.
an enslaved worker on a plantation in southampton county virginia turner believed his mission was to take revenge on plantation owners.
turner led his followers through virginia killing more than 57 whites.
for nearly two months terrified whites hunted the countryside looking for turner.
they killed many innocent african americans before catching and hanging him.
nat turners revolt increased southern fears of an uprising of enslaved african americans.
revolts were rare however.
since southern whites were well armed and kept careful track of african americans a revolt by african americans had almost no chance of success.
h draw conclusions what do the actions of denmark vesey and nat turner reveal about the conditions under which enslaved africans were forced to live.

society and culture before the civil war 343 7 2 king cotton and life in the south the period between 1815 and 1860 is sometimes known as the reform era in the united states because there were so many movements for social reform during this period.
social reform is an organized attempt to improve what is unjust or imperfect in society.
the impulse toward social reform had political social and religious causes.
j i 1 a 23 d 23 e 24 b 25 b reform movements which people would attain salvation after death.
this belief led many people to worry that they could do nothing to be saved.
during the 1700s protestant thinkers in england and the colonies began to argue that salvation depended on a persons actions in this life.
its leaders stressed free will rather than predestination.
they taught that individuals could choose to save their souls by their own actions.
in the early 1800s a dynamic religious movement known as the second great awakening swept the nation.
arguments by religious thinkers were the main cause of this movement.
another cause was the democratic spirit of the jacksonian era which encouraged people to think independently and not blindly obey established religious authorities.
to stir religious feelings preachers held revivals huge outdoor meetings.
revivals might last for days and attract thousands of people.
a witness recalled the excitement of a revival at cane ridge kentucky the vast sea of human beings seemed to be agitated as if by storm.
i counted seven ministers all preaching at once.
some of the people were singing others praying some crying for mercy.
one of the most vigorous social reformers was dorothea dix a boston schoolteacher whose strong religious beliefs spurred her to care for those less fortunate.
she turned her attention to what one minister called the outsiders in society criminals and the mentally ill reforming care of the disabled in 1841 dix visited a jail for women near boston.
she was outraged to discover that some of the prisoners were not criminals but mentally ill dix demanded to know why these women were locked in small dark unheated cells.

still some critics said american society was not democratic enough.
they pointed to the promise of liberty and equality expressed in the declaration of independence.
a true democracy they argued would not allow slavery.
others asked why women had fewer rights than men.
by changing such injustices reformers hoped to move the nation closer to its political ideals.
social conditions call for reform as you have learned the industrial revolution was changing the american economy and working conditions especially in the north and cities were growing rapidly.
crowded cities created new challenges for social well being.
at the same time there was a growing need for an educated workforce.
as american society changed it required new institutions to meet its changing needs.
one leader of the second great awakening was a minister named charles grandison finney.
a powerful speaker finney taught that individual salvation was the first step toward the complete reformation of the whole world such teachings had effects that changed the country inspiring a number of new social reform movements.
by working to reshape american society these religiously inspired reformers contributed the idea of improving society to the american national identity.

the impact of prison reform dix also joined a growing movement to improve conditions in prisons.
men women and children were often crammed together in cold damp rooms.
when food supplies were low prisoners went hungry unless they had money to buy meals from jailers.
five out of six people in northern jails were debtors or people who could not pay money they owed.
while behind bars debtors had no way to earn money to pay back their debts.
as a result many debtors remained in prison for years.
dix and others called for changes in the prison system.
as a result some states built prisons with only one or two inmates to a cell.
cruel punishments were banned and people convicted of minor crimes received analyze political cartoons this cartoon shows a tree growing fruits with labels such as goodness knowledge morality and patience how did these fruits reflect reformers hopes for the temperance movement.

the impact of the temperance movement alcohol abuse was widespread in the early 1800s.
at political rallies weddings and funerals men women and sometimes even children drank heavily.
men could buy whiskey in candy stores or barbershops.
the temperance movement a campaign against alcohol abuse took shape in the late 1820s.
women often took a leading role in the battle.
they knew that demon rum could lead to the physical abuse of wives and children and the breakup of families.
some temperance groups urged people to drink less.
others sought to end drinking altogether.
they won a major victory in 1851 when maine banned the sale of alcohol.
eight other states passed maine laws.

massachusetts was the only state that required free public schools supported by the community.
teachers were poorly trained and ill paid.
students of all ages crowded together in a single room.
as more men won the right to vote reformers acted to improve education.
they argued that a republic required educated citizens.
education reform gives rise to public schools horace mann became head of the massachusetts board of education in 1837.
a unitarian inspired by the second great awakening mann believed that education would help citizens become better christians.
he hounded legislators to provide more money for education.
under his leadership massachusetts built new schools extended the school year and raised teachers pay.
the state also opened three colleges to train teachers.
other states followed the lead of massachusetts.
by the 1850s most northern states had set up free tax supported elementary schools.
schools in the south improved more slowly.
in both the north and the south schooling usually ended in the eighth grade.
there were few public high schools.

however these schools received less money than schools for white students did.
in the north african american men and women often opened their own schools to educate their children.
some attempts to educate african americans met with hostility.
in the 1830s prudence crandall a connecticut quaker began a school for african american girls.
crandall continued to teach even as rocks smashed through the window.
finally a mob broke in one night and destroyed the school.
despite such obstacles some african americans went on to attend private colleges such as harvard dartmouth and oberlin.
in 1854 pennsylvania chartered the first college for african american men.

why do you think these regulations became necessary.
a conflict over states rights the conflict over states rights divided the country along regional lines.
the united states at the time was made up of three regions.
the north included the new england and middle atlantic states.
manufacturing and trade were very important to the economy of the north.
the west was the region we now know as the midwest.
its economy was based mainly on farming to raise livestock and food crops.
finally the south consisted of todays southeast and south central states.
the souths people relied heavily on farming to produce cash crops for export such as cotton and tobacco.
politically northerners generally favored a strong federal government which they saw as necessary to promote manufacturing and trade.
southerners feared the domination of the north and national policies that could hurt southern interests.
consequently southerners tended to support stronger states rights.
these differences often made it hard for people from the north and south to agree on political issues.
westerners sometimes sided with the north and sometimes with the south.
for example westerners wanted internal improvements for transportation which most northerners supported.
westerners also wanted to be free to move into new territories which southerners also objectives explain the issues of nullification and states rights.

some westerners supported slavery while others did not.
in general westerners agreed with northerners about tariffs.
anger over tariffs in 1828 with the support of then president john quincy adams congress passed the highest tariff in the history of the nation.
southerners called it the tariff of abominations.
an abomination is something that is wrong and evil.
just like earlier tariffs the new law which was passed before andrew jacksons first term protected manufacturers from foreign competition.
most manufacturers lived in the north and were helped by the tariff.
southern planters however were hurt by it.
southerners sold much of their cotton to britain and bought british manufactured goods in return.
a high tariff would mean that southerners had to pay more for those british goods.
worse still they feared that if the united states imposed a tariff on british manufactures britain could respond by imposing a tariff on american cotton.
many southerners thought the tariff was unconstitutional.
debate over nullification a leader in the south s fight against the tariff was vice president john calhoun whose home state was south carolina.
he claimed that a state had the right to nullify or cancel a federal law trading ships brought southern cotton to england and finished goods back to the united states.
interactive map that the state considered to be unconstitutional.
this idea is called nullification.
calhoun believed that the states rights gave them power over the provisions of the constitution.
he argued that states could reject federal laws that they thought violated the constitution because the states had joined together to form the federal government based on their understanding of the constitution.
daniel webster a senator from massachusetts disagreed.
he made a speech in 1830 to the senate attacking the idea of nullification.
the constitution he said united the american people not just the states as a nation.
if states had the right to nullify federal laws the nation would fall apart.
the u s supreme court had also ruled against earlier attempts at nullification arguing that the provisions of article iii of the u s constitution gave federal courts not states the right to decide on the constitutionality of federal laws.
president jackson agreed with the views of webster and the supreme court.
because calhoun strongly disagreed with jackson he resigned from the office of vice president.
he was then elected as a senator from south carolina.
the debate over nullification would continue for years.
the nullification act leads to crisis anger against the tariff increased in the south.
congress passed a new law in 1832 that lowered the tariff slightly.
south carolina was not satisfied.
it passed the nullification act declaring the new tariff illegal.
it also threatened to secede or withdraw from the union if challenged.
jackson was furious.
he knew that nullification could lead to civil war.
to defuse the crisis henry clay now a senator from kentucky proposed a lower compromise tariff which president jackson supported.
jackson also asked congress to pass the force bill which allowed him to use the army if necessary to enforce the tariff.
daniel webster sided with jackson on the force bill but opposed clays compromise tariff.
however congress passed both the compromise tariff and the force bill.
faced with jacksons firm stand no other state chose to support south carolina.
calhoun supported the compromise tariff that clay had proposed.
south carolina repealed its nullification act and the nullification crisis passed.
national identity had proven stronger than the claim of a single state.
however tensions between the north and south would lead to increased sectionalism in the years ahead.

analyze charts how was the bank involved in the nations economy.
interactive chart the bank war another political battle president jackson waged during his first term as president was one against the second bank of the united states.
like many westerners he thought that the bank was too powerful and needed to be eliminated.
jacksons democratic party opposed the bank.
the whig party however supported the bank.
whigs believed that the bank was needed to regulate state banks lending to prevent a buildup of debts that could not be repaid.
a controversial bank the bank of the united states had been a subject of dispute since its early days.
the bank had great power over the nations banking system because it controlled loans made by state banks.
when the banks directors thought that state banks were making too many loans they limited the amount these banks could lend.
the cutbacks angered farmers and merchants who borrowed money to buy land or finance hew businesses.
president jackson and other leading democrats saw the bank as undemocratic.
although congress created the bank it was run by private bankers.
jackson condemned these men as agents of special privilege who grew rich with public funds.
he especially disliked nicholas biddle president of the bank since 1823.
biddle came from a wealthy philadelphia family.
he was well qualified to run the bank.
under biddle the u s economy had experienced stability and prosperity.
however biddle was arrogant and vain.
jackson felt that biddle used the bank to benefit the rich.
he also resented biddles influence over certain members of congress.
the bank applies for renewal biddle and other whigs worried that the president might try to destroy the bank.
two whig senators henry clay and daniel webster thought of a way to save the bank and defeat jackson in the upcoming election at the same time.
the banks charter was not due for renewal by congress until 1836.
however clay and webster wanted to make the bank an issue in the 1832 election.
they persuaded biddle to apply for renewal early.
however clay and webster wanted to make the bank an issue in the 1832 election.
they persuaded biddle to apply for renewal early.
the whigs believed that most americans appreciated the role of the bank in the nations prosperity.
if jackson vetoed the bill to renew the charter they felt sure that he would anger voters and lose the election.
clay pushed the charter renewal bill through congress in 1832.
jackson was sick in bed when he heard that congress had renewed the banks charter.
the bank is trying to kill me jackson fumed but i will kill it jackson cuts off the bank in an angry message to congress jackson vetoed the bank bill.
he gave two reasons for his veto.
first he said that the bank was unconstitutional even though in mcculloch v maryland the supreme court had ruled in the banks favor.
like other democrats jackson believed that the federal government could not charter a bank because the constitution did not explicitly give it the power to do so.
however the supreme court had ruled that the constitution implicitly gave the federal government this right in the necessary and proper clause this clause states that the federal government has the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the.
powers already described and all other powers vested by this constitution the supreme court had decided that the necessary and proper clause gave the government the power to charter a national bank.
jackson believed that only states had the right to charter banks.
jackson also felt that the bank helped aristocrats at the expense of the common people.
he warned when the laws undertake to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful the humble members of the society the farmers mechanics and laborers who have neither the time nor the means of getting like favors for themselves.
have a right to complain of the injustices of their government.
andrew jackson veto message july 10 1832 as planned the whigs made the bank a major issue in the election of 1832.
they chose henry clay as their candidate to run against andrew jackson.
when the votes were counted however they showed that jackson had won a stunning election victory.
the common people had surprised the whigs by supporting jackson and rejecting the bank of the united states.
the bank loses its national role without a new charter the bank would have to close in 1836.
jackson refused to wait.
he ordered secretary of the treasury roger taney to stop putting government money in the bank.
instead taney deposited federal money in state banks.
they became known as pet banks because taney and his friends controlled many of them.
the loss of federal money crippled the bank of the united states.
its elimination as a national bank was another effect of jacksons presidency.
the end of the bank s role in regulating lending contributed to an economic crisis that would have to be faced by the next president of the united states.
without a national bank to regulate the countrys financial system responsibility for regulating banks fell to individual states.
the period from the late 1830s until the 1860s is known as the state banking era.
during this time each state set its own rules for banks.
many banks issued loans in the form of paper money and promised to redeem it with silver or gold.
because federal law defined the value of dollars in terms of silver and gold state banks sometimes failed when they did not have enough silver or gold on hand to redeem the paper money they had issued.
fel recall what did jackson do with the governments money after he ordered that it should no longer be deposited in the second national bank.

jid westward expansion 276 6 2 presidential policies and political conflict economic crisis and political changes following tradition andrew jackson left office after two terms.
americans then elected martin van buren as president.
although van buren did not have jacksons popularity he was clever and intelligent.
as president however van buren needed more than sharp political instincts.
the panic of 1837 two months after taking office van buren faced the worst economic crisis the nation had known.
after the bank of the united states closed state banks could lend money without limit.
to meet the demand for loans state banks printed more and more paper money.
often they did not have enough gold or silver to back their paper money.
before leaving office jackson was alarmed at wild speculation or risky investment in land.
speculators were borrowing more and more money to buy land and driving land prices up.
to slow this process down he ordered that anyone buying public land had to pay for it with gold or silver.
speculators and others rushed to state banks to exchange their paper money for gold and silver.
many banks had lent too much money.
they did not have enough gold and silver and were forced to close.
the nation soon plunged into a deep economic depression a period when the economy shrinks and many people lose their jobs.
the depression lasted five years.
during the worst period 90 percent of the nations factories were closed.
unemployment was widespread.
hundreds of thousands of people were out of work.
many americans blamed van buren and his policies for the economic depression.
van buren believed in laissez faire economics the idea that government should play as small a role as possible in the economy.
as the depression wore on van buren became increasingly unpopular.
his opponents called him martin van ruin party caucuses and conventions by the time the next election for president occurred in 1840 whigs and democrats had developed more democratic ways to choose candidates for president.
in the past powerful members of each party held a caucus or private meeting.
there they choose their candidate.
critics called the caucus system undemocratic because only a few powerful people were able to take part in it.
in the 1830s each party began to hold a nominating convention where delegates from all the states chose hie party s candidate for president.
party leaders might during the state banking era americans relied on currency issued by state or private banks.
money from banks with poor reputations might not be accepted by other banks or merchants.
there were thousands of different kinds of money in circulation.

also state nominating conventions encouraged citizen participation in elections.
once citizens learned about the events of the convention they would work for their partys choices.
today the major political parties still hold conventions.
democrats lose the election of 1840 although van buren had lost support the democrats chose him to run for reelection in 1840.
the whigs chose william henry harrison of ohio as their presidential candidate and john tyler of virginia as their vice presidential candidate.
harrison was known as the hero of the battle of tippecanoe which was fought between the american military and a shawnee led alliance in 1811.
to appeal to voters the whigs focused on harrisons war record.
tippecanoe and tyler too became their campaign slogan.
the whigs created an image for harrison as a man of the people from the western frontier.
they presented him as a humble farmer and boasted that he had been born in a log cabin.
in fact the whigs candidate harrison was a wealthy educated man who at the time of the campaign lived in a large mansion.
age of jackson and westward expansion 277 6 2 presidential policies and political conflict the whigs policies included creating a new bank of the united states improving roads and canals and demanding a high tariff.
however whig hopes were dashed when soon after taking office president harrison died of pneumonia.
john tyler then became president.
president tyler failed to live up to whig expectations.
he opposed many whig policies.
in response the whigs threw tyler out of their party just months after he took office.
u recall how did president jackson attempt to slow the land speculation that led to the panic of 1837.

the decision in the first suit went against the cherokees.
in cherokee nation v georgia 1831 the court refused to stop georgia from enforcing its law.

chief justice john marshall wrote the courts majority opinion in worcester v georgia.
he quoted treaties that the united states had signed guaranteeing certain territory to native americans.

in the early 1800s the promise of new farmland and other work opportunities brought a flood of new migrants to the lands west of the appalachian mountains.
westward movement entire families gathered up all their possessions including furniture and livestock and made the long journey westward in their quest for a better life on the frontier.
heading into the west settlers took a number of routes west.
people from important regions and places like new england new york and pennsylvania pushed into a region northwest of the ohio river called the northwest territory.
some traveled west from albany new york along the mohawk river through the appalachians and then west along the plains south of lake ontario.
many then sailed across lake erie into ohio.
another well traveled path was the great valley road that ran southward from philadelphia pennsylvania through maryland and western virginia.
some settlers would then continue south and west along the trail opened by daniel boone before the revolution.
known as the wilderness road it led through the cumberland gap into kentucky.
other settlers pushed west across the appalachians to pittsburgh pennsylvania.
there they loaded their animals and wagons onto flatboats or flat bottomed boats and journeyed down the ohio river into ohio kentucky indiana and illinois.
flatboats were well suited to the shallow waters of the ohio which became known as the gateway to the west even when carrying heavy cargoes these barges rode high in the water.

b compare how was travel during the early 1800s similar to and different from travel today.
building better roads settlers faced difficult journeys as they traveled to the west.
many roads were narrow dirt trails barely wide enough for a single wagon.
trails often plunged through muddy swamps.
tree stumps stuck up in the road and often broke the wagon axles of careless travelers.
the nation badly needed better roads.
paying tolls in the united states as in europe private companies built gravel and stone roads.
to pay for these roads the companies collected tolls from travelers.
at various points along the road a pike or pole blocked the road.
after a wagon driver had paid a toll the pike keeper turned the pole aside to let the wagon pass.
as a result these toll roads were called turnpikes.
probably the best road in the united states was the lancaster turnpike.
built in the 1790s by a private company the road linked philadelphia and lancaster pennsylvania.
because the road was set on a bed of gravel water drained off quickly.
for a smooth ride the road was topped with flat stones.
other roads were more primitive.
in swampy areas roads were made of logs.
these roads were known as corduroy roads because the lines of logs looked like corduroy cloth.
corduroy roads kept wagons from sinking into the mud but they made for a very noisy and bumpy ride.
the first national road some states set aside money to improve roads or build new ones.
meanwhile in 1806 congress approved funds for the first national road building project.
the national road was to run from cumberland maryland to wheeling on the ohio river in western virginia.
work on the national road began in 1811.
because of the war of 1812 it was not completed until 1818.

the age of steam whenever possible travelers and freight haulers used river transportation.
floating downstream on a flatboat was both faster and more comfortable than bumping along rutted roads.
it also cost a lot less.
yet river travel had its own problems.
moving upstream was difficult.
people used paddles or long poles to push boats against the current.
sometimes they hauled boats along the shore with ropes.
both methods were extremely slow.
a boat could travel downstream from pittsburgh to new orleans in about six weeks.
however the return trip upstream took at least 17 weeks.
steamboats arrive technology and innovations slowly began to effect transportation by making travel faster and cheaper.
a new invention the steam engine started a new era in river travel.
in 1787 john fitch showed members of the constitutional convention how a steam engine could power a boat.
he then opened a ferry service on the delaware river.
however few people used the ferry and fitch eventually went out of business.
inventor robert fulton may have seen fitchs steamboat while in philadelphia.
in 1807 fulton launched his own steamboat the clermont on the hudson river.
on its first run the clermont carried passengers from new york city to albany and back.
the 300 mile trip took just 62 hours a record at the time.
a travel revolution fultons success ushered in the of steamboats.
soon steamboats were ferrying passengers up and down the atlantic coast.
more important steamboats revolutionized travel in the west.
besides carrying people river steamboats gave farmers and merchants a cheap means of moving poods.
because western rivers were too shallow for farger boats henry shreve designed a flat bottomed steamboat.
it could carry heavy loads without getting stuck on sandbars.
still steamboat travel could be dangerous.
sparks from smokestacks could cause fires.
high pressure boilers sometimes exploded as steamboat captains raced each other in an effort to get to their destination many pike keepers lived by the gate they tended and could be awakened in the middle of the night by travelers seeking to pay the toll and pass through.

canals connect the country steamboats and better roads brought many improvements to transportation.
but they did not help western farmers get their goods directly to markets in the east.
to meet this need americans needed to modify the physical environment in a whole new way they dug canals.
a canal is an artificial channel filled with water that allows boats to cross a stretch of land.
the earliest american canals were no more than a few miles long.
some canals provided routes around waterfalls on a river.
others linked rivers to nearby lakes.
by the early 1800s however americans were building longer canals.
the erie canal in 1805 some new yorkers developed a bold idea.
they wanted to build a canal linking the great lakes to the mohawk and hudson rivers.
later known as the erie canal this artificial waterway would let western farmers ship their goods to the port of new york.
it would also bring business to towns along the route.
to many people the idea of such a canal seemed far fetched.
when thomas jefferson heard of the plan he exclaimed why sir you talk of making a canal 350 miles through the wilderness it is little short of madness to think of it at this day.
thomas jefferson to joshua forman of new york 1809 new york s governor dewitt clinton ignored such criticism.
he persuaded state lawmakers to provide money for the erie canal.
critics referred to the project as clintons ditch work on the erie canal began in 1817.
at first thousands of workers dug the waterway using hand tools.
to speed up progress inventors developed new equipment.
one machine a stump puller could pull out nearly 40 tree stumps a day.
in two places the canal had to cross over rivers.
workers built stone bridges to carry the canal over the rivers.
steamboats became more powerful when their engines were used to turn paddle wheels.
these wheels allowed larger boats to be built that could carry more passengers and cargo.
interactive gallery and westward expansion 288 6 4 westward movement an instant success by 1825 the immense job was finished.
on opening day of the erie canal a cannon fired in buffalo new york.
when the sound got to the next town along the route that town fired a cannon.
town after town fired cannons all the way to new york city.
the thunderous salute took 80 minutes to complete.
the erie canal was an instant success.
the cost of shipping goods dropped to about one tenth of what it had been before the canal was built.
the canal also helped make new york city a center of commerce.
the success of the erie canal led other states to build canals.
these canals created vital links between western farms and eastern cities advancing the economic development of the united states.
these links encouraged more growth as people moved to the new cities in search of work.

after winning independence they nicknamed their new nation the lone star republic.
a constitution was written using the united states constitution as a model.
in september 1836 voters elected sam houston president of the republic of texas.
the new country faced several serious problems however.
first the government of mexico refused to accept the treaty that santa anna had signed.
mexicans insisted that texas was still part of mexico.
second texas was nearly bankrupt.
third comanche and other indian groups threatened to attack small texan communities.
most texans thought that the best way to solve these problems was to become part of the united states.
in the united states people were divided about whether to annex or add on texas to the union.
the arguments reflected sectional divisions in the country.
white southerners generally favored the idea.
many northerners opposed it.
the main issue was slavery.
by the 1830s antislavery feeling was growing in the north.
because many texans owned slaves northerners feared that texas would join the union as a slave owning state strengthening support for slavery in the u s government.
in addition president andrew jackson worried that annexing texas would lead to war with mexico.
as a result congress refused to annex the republic of texas.
for the next nine years leaders of the republic of texas worked to attract new settlers.
the new texas government encouraged immigration by offering settlers free land.
during the panic of 1837 thousands of americans moved to texas where land was less expensive than in the united states.
settlers also arrived from germany and switzerland.

hoping to speed up growth the government took land from the missions and gave it to wealthy individuals.
these new landowners set up huge cattle ranches in california.
native americans did most of the work on the ranches as well tending cattle and other animals.

every year however more americans began moving west.
there were many economic social and political causes for this westward expansion.
on several occasions the united states government offered to buy california from mexico.
some officials were eager to gain control of the ports at san francisco and san diego.
soon westward expansion became a major priority for the nation.
the roots of manifest destiny there was another reason for wanting to purchase california.
many americans saw their nation and its democratic government as the best in the world.
in the 1840s a newspaper created the term manifest destiny to mean that the united states had the right to spread across the continent.
manifest means clear or obvious.
destiny means something that is fated to happen.
the social roots of manifest destiny lay in the belief that americans had the right and the duty of westward expansion to spread their culture across the continent all the way to the pacific ocean.
americans who believed in manifest destiny thought that westward expansion would also open new opportunities for the united states economy.
to many americans the fertile farmland and natural resources in the west were prime opportunities for economic growth.
manifest destiny and westward expansion had some negative effects however.
many white americans believed that they were superior to native americans and mexicans.
they used this belief to justify taking roots of manifest destiny social belief in america as an exceptional nation desire to spread american democracy and ideals belief that it was god s will for america to expand.

polk and westward expansion the political roots of manifest destiny and westward expansion took hold during the election of 1844.
the whigs nominated the well known national leader henry clay for president.
clay had opposed the annexation of texas.
the democrats choose james polk a little known candidate from tennessee who wanted to add texas and oregon country to the union.
on election day americans showed their support for westward expansion by electing polk president.
he took office in march 1845 on a wave of support for expansion.
acting on his campaign promise he took steps to gain control of oregon country.
that move brought the possibility of war with britain.
polk did not really want to fight britain however.
instead in 1846 he agreed to a compromise.
oregon country was divided at latitude 49n.
britain got the lands north of the line and the united states got the lands south of the line.
the united states named its lands the oregon territory.
later the states of oregon 1859 washington 1889 and idaho 1890 were carved out of the oregon territory.
texas proved a more difficult problem.
the united states at first had refused to annex texas.
then in 1844 texan president sam houston signed a treaty of annexation with the united states.
however the senate again refused to ratify the treaty.
senators feared that annexing texas would cause a war with mexico.

this set the stage f conflict with mexico.
recall why did u s senators refuse to ratify the treaty to annex texas.
the u s mexican war the annexation of texas outraged mexicans.
they had not accepted texan independence much less annexation.
they also worried that americans might encourage rebellions in california and new mexico as they had in texas.
at the same time americans resented mexico.
they were annoyed when mexico rejected president polks offer of 30 million to buy california and new mexico.
many americans felt that mexico stood in the way of the manifest destiny of the united states.
the clash begins a border dispute finally caused a war.
both the united states and mexico claimed control over the land between the rio grande and oiicicu zsacnary taylor to set up posts in the disputed area.
polk knew that the move might lead to war.
in april 1846 mexican troops crossed the rio grande and clashed with the americans.
at polks urging congress declared war on mexico.
americans were divided over the conflict.
many people in the south and west were eager to fight hoping to win new lands.
some northerners however opposed the war.
they saw it as a southern plot to add slave states to the union.
still the war was generally popular.
when the army called for volunteers thousands of young recruits flocked to the cause.
un several rronts at once.
president polk hoped that this strategy would win a quick victory.
general taylor crossed the rio grande into northern mexico.
in february 1847 he met mexican general santa anna at the battle of buena vista.
the americans were outnumbered more than two to one but they were better armed and better led.
after fierce fighting and intense artillery fire they forced santa anna to retreat.

the rebels declared california an independent republic on june 14 1846.
they nicknamed their new nation the bear flag republic.
led by a young american officer john c fremont free mont rebel forces then drove the mexican troops out of northern california.
by 1847 the united states controlled all of new mexico and california.
general scott meanwhile pushed closer to mexico city.
blocking his way was the mexican army in a well protected position.
at the battle of cerro gordo american troops went around this position to surprise the mexican army.
the mexican army suffered heavy losses as it was forced to retreat.
at the edge of mexico city scotts forces faced one last obstacle.
teenage mexican cadets or soldiers in training made a heroic stand at chapultepec chahpool tuh pehk a fort just outside the capital.
today mexicans honor those young cadets as heroes.
at the battles end however the capital city was overtaken by the american forces mexicans today remember the six young cadets who stood against u s forces by visiting this monument in chapultepec park mexico city.
when the american army captured mexico city the war was essentially over.
scotts mexico city campaign remains one of the most successful in u s military history.
the war was a crushing defeat for mexico.
an outnumbered american army had caused significantly more casualties than it had suffered.
the war ends the mexican government moved to make peace with the united states.
in 1848 mexico signed the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo gwah duh loop ay ih dahl goh.
mexico suffered the effects of losing the war.
it had to cede or give up all of california and new mexico to the united states.
these lands were called the mexican cession.
in return the united states paid mexico 15 million and agreed to respect the rights of spanish speaking people in the mexican cession.
the war impacted the united states positively due to this new land.
however even more land was acquired later.
in 1853 the united states paid mexico an additional 10 million for a strip of land in present day arizona and new mexico.
the americans needed the land to complete a railroad.
the land was called the gadsden purchase.
with the gadsden purchase many americans felt that their dream of manifest destiny had been fulfilled.

settling the mexican cession winning the u s mexican war had positive effects on westward expansion of the united states which ushered in a whole new era of growth.
new mexico territory now the southwestern part of the united states came to be known as the southwest.
after 1848 english speaking settlers flocked to the southwest.
as the population of the country increased and affordable land in the east became scarce more people decided to move.
americans migrated west for many reasons from religious freedom to economic opportunities.
the largest group of settlers to move into the mexican cession was the mormons.
the mormons move west mormons belonged to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints.

the mormons moved west and in the 1840s built a community called nauvoo on the banks of the mississippi river in illinois.
once again the mormons and their neighbors clashed.
in 1844 an angry mob killed joseph smith and brigham young was chosen as their new leader.
a new home in utah young sought a place where mormons would be safe from persecution.
he had read about a valley between the rocky mountains and the great salt lake in utah.
he hoped that this isolated valley might make a good home for the mormons.
in 1847 young led an advance party into the valley of the great salt lake.
soon waves of mormon families j followed.
for several years mormon wagon trains i juggled across the plains and over the rockies to utah.
once there they had to learn how to survive in i the desert climate.
human geographic factors played an important role in this adaptation.
young planned an ligation system to bring water to farms.
he also drew up plans for a large city called salt lake city to be built in the desert.
the mormon wlements in utah grew quickly.
congress recognized brigham young as governor of the utah territory in 1850.

in 1848 john sutter was having a sawmill built on the american river north of sacramento california.
sutter had hired james marshall to supervise the job.
early on january 24 marshall set out to inspect a ditch his crew was digging.

as a result of the industrial revolution this situation slowly changed.
machines replaced hand tools.
new sources of power such as steam replaced human and animal power.
while most americans continued to farm for a living the economy began a gradual shift toward manufacturing.
technological innovations the industrial revolution started in britain in the mid 1700s.
british inventors developed new machines that transformed the textile industry.
since the middle ages workers had used spinning wheels to make thread.
a spinning wheel however could spin only one thread at a time.
in 1764 james hargreaves developed the spinning jenny a machine that could spin several threads at once.
other inventions speeded up the process of weaving thread into cloth.
in the 1780s edmund cartwright built a loom powered by water.
it allowed a worker to produce a great deal more cloth in a day than was possible pearson 1 realize access your digital lesson.
322 before.
these technological innovations would change how goods were made not only in britain but also in america and around the world.
the factory system new inventions led to a new system of producing goods.
before the industrial revolution most spinning and weaving took place in the home.
industrial production involved large machines however and these had to be housed in large mills near rivers.
water flowing downstream or over a waterfall turned a wheel that captured the power to run the machines.
to set up and operate a spinning mill required large amounts of capital or invested money.
capitalists supplied this money.
a capitalist is a person who invests in a business in order to make a profit or the difference between the cost of a good and its selling price.
capitalists built factories and hired workers to run the machines.
the new factory system brought workers and machinery together in one place to produce goods.
factory workers earned daily or weekly wages.
they had to work a set number of hours each day.
in britain investors saw an opportunity.
because a single worker could produce much more with a machine than by hand the cost of goods made by machine was much lower.
as a result more of those goods could be sold.
if an investor built a factory that could produce cloth more cheaply the investor could make a profit.
investors desire to make a profit brought about rapid industrialization.
during the industrial revolution the demand for factory made products grew.
in economics demand is the readiness of people to purchase goods or services.
the supply or amount of goods available to sell depended in part on the natural resources factories could get.
to make products factories needed raw materials power and laborers to run machinery.
some resources such as cotton and iron were in short supply this scarcity or limited supply resulted in high prices.
in response to high prices farmers began to grow more cotton to supply spinning mills.
miners and others searched for new sources of iron and other materials used in machinery.
the growing demand for products and for the supplies needed to make them led to a great change in standards of living.

5 1 washingtons presidency he proposed showed his leadership qualities as an appointed political leader.
hamilton called for the government to repay both federal and state debts.
one of his first acts in government was to ask congress to pass a tariff or tax on imports to pay for the government.
congress passed this tariff in 1789.
hamilton wanted the government to buy up all the bonds issued by both the national and state governments before 1789.
he then planned to issue new bonds to pay off the old debts.
as the economy improved and income from the tariff increased the government would then be able to pay off the new bonds.
many people including bankers and investors welcomed hamiltons plan.
others attacked it.
arguments for and against hamiltons plan james madison led the opposition.
madison argued that hamilton s plan would reward speculators.
a speculator is someone who invests in a risky venture in the hope of making a large profit.
during the revolution the government had issued bonds to soldiers and citizens who supplied goods.
many of these bondholders needed cash to survive.
so they sold their bonds to speculators.
speculators bought bonds worth one dollar for only 10 or 15 cents.
if the government paid off the old bonds in full speculators stood to make fortunes.
madison thought that speculators did not deserve to make such profits.
hamilton replied that the united states must repay its debts in full.
otherwise he said it risked losing the trust of investors in the future.
the support of investors he argued was crucial to building the new nation s economy.
after much debate congress approved full repayment of the national debt.
as a southerner madison also led the fight against the other part of hamiltons plan the repaying of state debts.
by 1789 most southern states had paid off their debts from the revolution.
they thought that other states should do the same.
the new england states for example still owed a lot.
thus some northern states stood to gain more than others from the plan.
as a result the southern states bitterly opposed hamiltons plan.
this fight over how to use scarce capital resources fairly was only one of many in the early republic the period from washingtons presidency until 1824.
a compromise is reached in the end hamilton proposed a compromise.
many southerners wanted the nations capital to be located in the south.
hamilton offered to support that goal if southerners agreed to his plan to repay state debts.
madison and others accepted the compromise.
in july 1790 congress voted to repay state debts and to build a new capital city.
the new capital would not be part of any state.
instead it would be built on land along the potomac river on land given up by two state debt assumed by the new federal government 1790 state assumed debt in dollars state assumed debt in dollars new hampshire 300 000 delaware 200 000 massachusetts 4 000 000 maryland 800 000 rhode island 200 000 virginia 3 500 000 connecticut 1 600 000 north carolina 2 400 000 new york 1 200 000 south carolina 4 000 000 new jersey 800 000 georgia 300 000 pennsylvania 2 200 000 source library of congress analyze data considering the differences among the states debt levels why might some states have objected to the federal government taking over every states debts.

meanwhile the nations capital was moved from new york to philadelphia.
brecall why were federal and state debts so high.
creating a stable economy hamiltons next challenge was to strengthen the faltering national economy.
his economic plan was designed to help both agriculture and industry.
hamilton called on congress to set up a national bank.
in 1791 congress created the first bank of the united states.
the government deposited money from taxes in the bank.
in turn the bank issued paper money to pay the governments bills and to make loans to farmers and businesses.
through these loans the bank encouraged economic growth and the development of a free enterprise economic system.
to help american manufacturers hamilton asked congress to pass a new tariff or tax on foreign goods brought into the country.
he wanted a high tariff to make imported goods more expensive than american made goods.
a tariff meant to protect local industry from foreign competition is called a protective tariff.
hamiltons plan sparked arguments over taxation.
in the north where there were more and more factories many people supported hamiltons plan.
southern farmers however bought many imported goods.
they opposed a protective tariff that would make imports more expensive.
in the end congress did pass a tariff but it was much lower than the protective tariff hamilton wanted.
the tariff was also lower than american manufacturers would have liked in order to protect them from foreign competition.
however the tariff did help to pay oil government debt a central point in hamiltons economic plan.
the government needed to find a form of taxation that allowed it to pay off lenders because attracting lenders is key to financing government in a fee enterprise system.

taxation sparks the whiskey rebellion to help reduce the national debt congress approved a tax on all liquor made and sold in the united states.
hamilton wanted this tax to raise money for the treasury.
instead the new tax sparked a rebellion that tested the strength of the new government.
this tax was the first implemented by congress under its new constitutional authority.
hamilton believed that reasonable taxes on alcohol would help to moderate consumption.
he also hoped to gain a rich source of revenue for the federal government to pay its debts.
however the new law varied the tax rate and often left smaller liquor manufacturers paying more than larger ones.
furthermore the tax had to be paid in cash.
this was often difficult for small distilleries.
large liquor enterprises in the east had less trouble with the tax than those on the frontier or in small towns.
hamilton though himself a man of humble origins did not fully appreciate the economic concerns of americans who lived on farms or in small towns.
a large number of them opposed the new tax.

the xyz affair ignited war fever in the united states.
despite strong pressure adams refused to ask congress to declare war on 222 france.

war would also force the nation to build its military forces.

although adams was a federalist he resisted hamiltons pressure for war.
their disagreement created a split in the federalist party.
over hamiltons opposition adams again sent diplomats to france.
when they arrived they found an ambitious young army officer napoleon bonaparte in charge.
napoleon was planning for war against several european powers.
thus he had no time for a war with the united states.
he signed an agreement to stop seizing american ships.
like washington adams kept the nation out of war.

the alien and sedition acts in 1798 during the crisis with france federalists pushed several laws through congress.
these laws were known as the alien and sedition acts under the alien act the president could expel any alien or foreigner thought to be dangerous to the country.
another law made it harder for immigrants to become citizens.
before 1798 white immigrants could become citizens after living in the united states for five years.
the new law made immigrants wait 14 years.

the first amendment they argued protected freedom of speech and of the press.
jefferson warned that the new laws threatened american liberties they have brought into the lower house a sedition bill which.
undertakes to make printing certain matters criminal.
indeed this bill the alien bill both are so against the constitution as to show they mean to pay no respect to it.
the writings of thomas jefferson 1798 states challenge the federal government vice president jefferson bitterly opposed the alien and sedition acts.
he could not ask the courts for help because the federalists controlled them.
so he urged the states to take strong action against the acts.
he argued that the states had the right to nullify or cancel a law passed by the federal government.
in this way states could resist the power of the federal government.
with help from jefferson and madison kentucky and virginia passed resolutions in 1798 and 1799.
the kentucky and virginia resolutions claimed that each state has an equal right to judge for itself whether a law is constitutional.
if a state decides a law is unconstitutional said the resolutions it has the power to nullify that law within its borders.
the kentucky and virginia resolutions raised the issue of states rights.
did the federal government have only those powers that were listed in the constitution.
if so did the states possess all other powers for example the power to declare a federal law unconstitutional.

an important presidential election by 1800 the war cry against france was fading.
as the election neared democratic republicans focused on two issues.
first they attacked the federalists for raising taxes to prepare for war.

political power goes to a different party in the race for the presidency democratic republicans won the popular vote.

at the time the electoral college did not vote separately for president and vice president.

when thomas jefferson took office as the third president some federalists were worried about his political beliefs.
they knew that he supported the french revolution and they feared that he might bring revolutionary change to the united states.
they were also afraid that he might punish federalists who had used the alien and sedition acts to jail democratic republicans.
jeffersons presidency jeffersons leadership redefines government in his inaugural address jefferson tried to calm federalists fears.
he promised that although the democratic republicans were in the majority he would not treat the federalists harshly.
the minority possess their egual rights which equal laws must protect he told the nation.
he called for an end to the political disputes of the past few years.
we are all republicans we are all federalists the president concluded.
jefferson had no plan to punish federalists.
he did however want to change their policies.
in his view the federalists had made the national government too large and too powerful.
promoting a free enterprise system one way jefferson wanted to lessen government power was by reducing the federal budget.
such budget cuts would also keep the federal debt low.
his secretary of the treasury albert gallatin gal uh tin helped him achieve this goal.
a financial wizard gallatin reduced government spending through careful management.
226 jefferson believed in an economic idea known as laissez faire les ay fayr a french term meaning let do meaning letting people do as they please.
the idea of laissez faire was promoted by the scottish economist adam smith.
in his book the wealth of nations smith argued in favor of a free enterprise system where goods and services are exchanged with minimal government intrusion or as little government interference as possible.
free competition smith said would benefit everyone not just the wealthy.
laissez faire economists believed that government should play as small a role as possible in economic affairs.
laissez faire was very different from the federalist idea of government.
alexander hamilton you recall wanted government to promote trade and manufacturing.
jefferson minimizes government intrusion jefferson believed that the government should protect the rights of its citizens.
beyond that he wanted the federal government to take a less active role in governing the nation.
in addition to cutting the federal budget he decreased the size of government departments.
with the approval of congress he reduced the size of the army and navy.
he also asked congress to repeal the unpopular whiskey tax.
the sedition act expired the day before jefferson took office.
jefferson hated the law and he pardoned those who were in jail because of it.
he also asked congress to restore the law allowing foreign born white people to become citizens after only a five year waiting period.

landmark supreme court cases the election of 1800 gave democratic republicans control of congress.
federalists however remained powerful in the courts.
several months passed between jeffersons election and his inauguration.
in that time federalists in the old congress passed the judiciary act of 1801 increasing the number of federal judges.
president adams then appointed federalists to fill these new judicial positions.

jefferson s first actions as president analyze information how do jeffersons first actions as president reflect his political views.
interactive chart the early republic 227 5 4 jeffersons presidency one of the judges that adams appointed was john marshall the chief justice of the united states.
like jefferson marshall was a rich virginia planter with a brilliant mind.
unlike jefferson however marshall was a staunch federalist.
he wanted to make the federal government stronger.
the framers of the constitution expected the courts to balance the powers of the president and congress.
however john marshall found the courts to be much weaker than the other branches of government.
in his view it was not clear what powers the federal courts had.
the issues behind marbury v madison in 1803 john marshall showed his leadership qualities as an appointed leader by deciding a case that increased the power of the supreme court.
the case involved william marbury one of the judges appointed by adams.
adams made the appointment on his last night as president.
the republicans refused to accept this midnight judge they accused federalists of using unfair tactics to keep control of the courts.
jefferson ordered secretary of state james madison not to deliver the official papers confirming marburys appointment.
marbury sued madison.
according to the judiciary act of 1789 only the supreme court could decide a case these bronze doors lead into the supreme court chambers.
the carved panels show important moments in legal history including john marshall discussing marbury v madison.
that was brought against a federal official.
therefore the case of marbury v madison was tried before the supreme court.
the significance of the marbury v madison decision the supreme court ruled against marbury.
chief justice marshall wrote the decision stating that the judiciary act was unconstitutional.
the constitution marshall argued did not give the supreme court the right to decide cases brought against federal officials.
therefore congress could not give the court that power simply by passing the judiciary act.
as a result of marbury v madison congress had to amend or change the judiciary act to respond to the supreme courts objections.
the part of the judiciary act of 1789 that the supreme court rejected could no longer be law.
the supreme courts decision in marbury v madison set an important precedent.
it gave the supreme court the power to decide whether laws passed by congress were constitutional and to reject laws that it considered to be unconstitutional.
this power of the court is called judicial review.
presidential and congressional responses jefferson was displeased with the decision.
true marshall had ruled against marbury the federalist judge.
but marshalls decision gave more power to the supreme court where federalists were still strong.
jefferson also argued that the decision upset the balance of power among the three branches of government the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not not only for themselves.
but for the legislature and executive also.
would make the judiciary a tyrannical branch.
thomas jefferson letter to abigail adams 1804 jefferson did not want the judiciary to gain power over the executive branch.
he refused the courts order to testify at an important trial saying it would upset the equality of the branches.
he also used executive privilege to decide which government papers to show the court and which to withhold.
in the end the president and congress accepted the right of the court to overturn laws.
today judicial the early republic 5 4 jeffersons presidency review remains one of the most important powers of the supreme court.
b identify main ideas why is the supreme court case marbury v madison significant.
the louisiana purchase the united states overcame a number of challenges in its early years including creating a stable economic system setting up the courts and defining the authority of the central government.
as the economy continued to grow americans needed to protect their economic interests.
the louisiana territory became a key part of this effort.
geography shapes domestic and foreign policy a new development caused president jefferson to pursue buying new orleans in order to control this important port.
by 1800 almost one million americans lived between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river.
most were farmers.
with few roads west of the appalachians western farmers relied on the mississippi river to ship their wheat and corn.
first they sent their produce down the river to the city of new orleans.
from there oceangoing ships carried the produce across the gulf of mexico around florida and up to ports along the atlantic coast.
spain which controlled new orleans sometimes threatened to close the port to americans.
in 1795 president washington sent thomas pinckney to find a way to keep the vital port open.
in the pinckney treaty spain agreed to let americans ship their goods down the mississippi and store them in new orleans.
for a time americans shipped their goods through new orleans peacefully.
in 1800 however spain signed a new treaty giving louisiana back to the french.
president jefferson was alarmed.
he knew that the french ruler napoleon bonaparte had already set out to conquer europe.
would he now try to build an empire in north america.
jefferson had reason to worry.
napoleon wanted to siow food in louisiana and ship it to french islands in the west indies.
however events in haiti a french colony in the caribbean soon ruined napoleons plan.
inspired by the french revolution enslaved africans in haiti decided to fight for their liberty.
toussaint louverture too san loo vehr tyoor led the revolt.
by wtt toussaint and his followers had nearly forced the fench out of haiti.
napoleon sent troops to retake haiti.
although french captured toussaint they did not regain cntrol of the island.
in 1804 haitians declared their independence.
the louisiana purchase included the port of new orleans which controlled access to the north american west.
as shown in this print from the mid 1800s new orleans became a busy american port.
toussaint louverture led a revolt by enslaved africans to win independence from france for haiti.
the early republic 229 5 4 jeffersons presidency negotiations for louisiana jefferson sent robert livingston and james monroe to buy new orleans and west florida from napoleon.
jefferson said they could offer as much as 10 million.
livingston and monroe negotiated with charles maurice de talleyrand the french foreign minister.
at first talleyrand showed little interest in their offer.
however losing haiti caused napoleon to give up his plan for an empire in the americas.
he also needed money to pay for his costly wars in europe.
suddenly talleyrand asked livingston if the united states wanted to buy all of louisiana not just new orleans.
the question surprised livingston.
he offered 4 million.
too low replied talleyrand.
reflect and see me tomorrow livingston and monroe carefully debated the matter.
they had no authority to buy all of louisiana.
however they knew that jefferson wanted control of the mississippi.
they agreed to pay the french 15 million for louisiana.
this is the noblest work of our whole lives declared livingston when he signed the treaty.
from this day the united states take their place among the powers of the first rank the louisiana purchase of 1803 jefferson hailed the news from france.
still he was not sure whether the president had the power to purchase louisiana.
he had always insisted that the federal government had only those powers spelled out in the constitution.
the document said nothing about a president having the power to buy land.
in the end jefferson decided that he did have the authority to buy louisiana.
the constitution he reasoned allowed the president to make treaties and buying the louisiana territory was part of a treaty.
federalists opposed the purchase as unconstitutional and feared it would weaken the other states.
but the democratic republicans supported it and the senate approved the treaty.
the louisiana purchase went into effect.
in 1803 the united states took control of the vast lands west of the mississippi.
with one stroke the size of the nation had almost doubled.
id recall why was the port of new orleans important to many americans.

in 1803 congress provided money for a team of explorers to study the new lands.

he also told them to study the geography of the territory including.
climate as characterized by the thermometer by the proportion of rainy cloudy and clear days by lightning hail snow ice.
the dates at which particular plants put forth or lose their flower or leaf times of appearance of particular birds reptiles or insects.
thomas jefferson letter to meriwether lewis 1803 jefferson also instructed lewis and clark to learn about the native american nations who lived in the louisiana purchase.
these native americans carried on a busy trade with english french and spanish rnerchants.
jefferson hoped that the indians might trade with american merchants instead.
therefore he wed lewis and clark to tell the indians of our wish to le neighborly friendly and useful to them the expedition begins dozens of adventurous young men eagerly competed to join the expedition.
lewis and clark judged volunteers on the basis of their character strength hunting skills and ability to survive in the wilderness.
in the end about 50 men made up the corps of discovery.
in may 1804 lewis and clark started up the missouri river from st louis.
at first the expeditions boats made slow progress against the missouris swift current.
one night the current tore away the riverbank where they were camping.
the party had to scramble into the boats to avoid being swept downstream.
lewis and clark cross the plains eventually the expedition reached the plains of the midwest.
lewis and clark marveled at the broad grassy plains that stretched as far as the eye can reach everywhere they saw immense herds of buffalo deer elk and antelope as they traveled across the plains the expedition met people of various native american nations.
lewis and clark had brought many gifts for native americans such as peace medals stamped with the united states seal.
they also brought mirrors beads knives blankets and thousands of sewing needles and fishhooks.
the early republic 231 5 4 jeffersons presidency not only did lewis and clark record their observations in words they also drew maps and illustrations of the new things they encountered.
this painting shows sacajawea interpreting for lewis and clark.
her help made communication much easier for the expedition.
during the first winter lewis and clark stayed with the mandans in present day north dakota.
the explorers planned to continue up the missouri in the spring.
the members of the expedition built a fort to live in over the winter.
they took the opportunity to repair equipment in preparation for springs new challenges.
the mandans lived along the upper missouri river.
they grew corn beans and squash and hunted buffalo.
during the winter they helped the explorers find food and hunt buffalo.
they also in exchange fo traded with the expedition members.
staying with the mandans was a woman named sacajawea sak uh juh wee uh.
sacajawea belonged to the shoshone shoh shoh nee people who lived in the rockies.
she and her french canadian husband agreed to accompany lewis and clark as translators.
sacajawea carried her baby with her on the journey.
exploring the rocky mountains in early spring the party set out again.
in the foothills of the rockies the landscape and wildlife changed.
bighorn sheep ran along the high hills.
the thorns of prickly pear cactus jabbed the explorers moccasins.
once a grizzly bear chased lewis while he was exploring alone.
crossing the rocky mountains meant crossing the continental divide.
a continental divide is a ridge that separates river systems flowing toward opposite sides of a continent.
in north america some rivers flow east from the crest of the rockies into the mississippi which drains into the gulf of mexico.
other rivers flow west from the rockies and empty into the pacific ocean.
past the rockies lewis and clark would be able to travel by river toward the pacific.
but to cross the continental divide they needed horses.
they began looking for the shoshone who had been using horses since europeans brought them in the 1600s.
finally lewis and clark met some shoshones.
one of them was sacajaweas brother whom she had not seen for many years.
upon seeing her own people wrote clark she began to dance and show every mark of the most extravagant joy the shoshones supplied the expedition with the food and horses lewis and clark needed.
they also advised them about the best route to take over the rockies.
lewis and clark reach the pacific after building canoes lewis and clarks party floated toward the columbia river into the pacific northwest.
finally on november 7 1805 clark wrote in his journal great joy in camp.

the return trip to st louis took another year.
in 1806 americans celebrated the return of lewis and clark.
their journey had been difficult.
clark described some of the storms and high winds he faced as the most disagreeable time i have experienced but the explorers brought back much useful information about the louisiana territory the land now part of the united states.
pikes expedition before lewis and clark returned another explorer set out from st louis.
from 1805 to 1807 zebulon pike explored the upper mississippi river the arkansas river and parts of present day colorado and new mexico.
in november 1806 pike viewed a mountain peak rising above the colorado plains.
today this mountain is known as pikes peak.
continuing southward pike entered spanish territory.
spanish troops soon arrested pike and his men and took them into present day mexico.
the americans were later escorted through texas back into the united states.
the spanish took pikes maps and journals but he was able to hide one map in the barrel of his gun.
his report on the expedition greatly expanded americans knowledge about the southwest.
the journeys of pike and lewis and clark excited americans.
however settlers did not move into the rugged western lands for a number of years.
as you will read they first settled the region closest to the mississippi river.
soon the territory around new orleans had a large enough population of american citizens for the settlers to apply for statehood.
in 1812 this territory entered the union as the state of louisiana.

american shipping faces challenges after the revolution american overseas trade grew rapidly.
ships sailed from new england on voyages that sometimes lasted three years.
president jeffersons foreign policy during this time centered around protecting american shipping.
an era of trade wherever they went yankee captains kept a sharp lookout for new goods and new markets.
clever traders sawed winter ice from new england ponds into blocks packed it in sawdust and the early republic 233 5 4 jeffersons presidency carried it to india.
there they traded the ice for silk and spices.
in 1784 the empress of china became the first american ship to trade with china.
new england merchants quickly built up a profitable china trade.
more than 10 years before lewis and clark yankee merchants sailed up the pacific coast of north america.
so many traders from boston visited the pacific northwest that native americans there called every white man boston traders bought furs from native americans and sold them for large profits in china.
jefferson protects trade abroad traders ran great risks especially in the mediterranean sea.
pirates from the barbary states countries along the coast of north africa attacked passing vessels.
to protect american ships the united states paid a yearly tribute or bribe to rulers of the barbary states such as tripoli.
in 1801 tripoli increased its demands.
when jefferson refused to pay tripoli declared war on the united states.
jefferson then ordered the navy to blockade the port of tripoli.
during the blockade the american ship philadelphia ran aground near tripoli.
pirates boarded the ship and hauled the crew off to prison.
the pirates planned to use the philadelphia to attack other ships.
to prevent this american naval officer stephen decatur and his crew quietly sailed into tripoli harbor by night.
they then set the captured american ship on fire.
in the meantime american marines landed on the coast of north africa marched 500 miles and successfully captured with the help of allies the port of derna.

a painful embargo jefferson knew that the small american fleet was no match for the powerful british navy.
like washington and adams he sought a foreign policy that would avoid war.
an embargo on foreign trade jefferson hoped that an american embargo or ban on trade would hurt france and britain by cutting off needed supplies.
our trade is the most powerful weapon we can use in our defense one democractic republican newspaper wrote.
in 1807 jefferson persuaded congress to impose a total embargo on foreign trade.
this meant that american traders could not receive goods from european traders and american traders could not ship their goods to europe.
the embargo act did hurt britain and france.
but it hurt americans even more.
supplies of imports such as sugar tea and molasses were cut off.
exports dropped by more than 80 million in one year.
docks in the south were piled high with cotton and tobacco.
the embargo act hurt new england merchants most of all.
merchants protested loudly against the embargo.
some turned to smuggling importing or exporting goods in violation of trade laws.
jefferson began using the navy and federal troops to enforce the embargo.
on the border between new york and canada some smugglers engaged in skirmishes with federal troops.
the two political parties had different points of view on the embargo.
democratic republicans mostly supported the embargo as a way to protect the country and punish france and britain.
most federalists apposed the embargo as damaging to the economy.

federalists favored maintaining closer relations with britain.
they wanted to build ties with britain because britain was the main trading partner of the united states and the powerful british navy could protect american merchants.
although the embargo was the most unpopular measure of jeffersons presidency the democratic republicans still remained strong.

the early republic 236 5 4 jeffersons presidency s about 900 000 white settlers moved west of the appalachians between 1790 and 1810.
some native american groups resented these newcomers who built farms on indian lands and hunted the animals indians needed for food.
the settlers ignored treaties that the united states had signed with native american nations of the region.
madison and the war of 1812 conflict in ohio fighting often broke out between these native american groups and the settlers.
isolated acts of violence led to larger acts of revenge.
as both sides killed innocent people warfare spread.
in ohio little turtle of the miamis and blue jacket of the shawnees organized a resistance movement in 1791.
armed with british muskets and gunpowder the miamis and shawnees drove white settlers from the area.
president washington had sent general anthony wayne into ohio in 1794.
forces from the delaware miami iroqouis wabash and others gathered at a place called fallen timbers.
they thought that wayne would have trouble fighting there because fallen trees covered the land.

congress then authorized president madison to make a tantalizing offer.
if either the british or french stopped seizing american ships the united states would reopen trade with that nation.
napoleon quickly announced that france would respect american neutrality.
britain did not respond to the offer.
as promised the united states resumed trade with france but continued to ban all shipments to or from britain.
the war hawks push for war while madison did not want war other americans were not as cautious.
in new england antiwar feelings ran strong.
however members of congress from the south and the west called for war.
they were known as war hawks.
war hawks were stirred by a strong sense of nationalism or devotion to one s country.
war hawks felt that britain was treating the united states as if it were still a british colony.
they were willing to fight a war to defend american rights.
the most outspoken war hawk was henry clay of kentucky.
clay wanted to punish britain for seizing american ships.
he also hoped to conquer canada.

others threatened to leave the union.
then while the delegates debated what to do news of the peace treaty arrived.
the hartford convention ended guickly.
with the war over the protest was meaningless.
in the end the threat of secession further weakened the dying federalist party.
the varied effects of the war a peace treaty was signed in the city of ghent in present day belgium on december 24 1814.
john quincy adams son of john adams and one of the american delegates summed up the treaty of ghent in one sentence nothing was adjusted nothing was settled britain and the united states agreed to restore prewar conditions.
the treaty said nothing about impressment or neutrality.
these issues had faded due to the end of the wars in europe.
other issues were settled later.
in 1818 for example the two nations settled a dispute over the border between canada and the united states.
looking back some americans felt that the war of 1812 had been a mistake.
others argued that europe would now treat the young republic with more respect.
the victories of heroes like oliver hazard perry william henry harrison and andrew jackson gave americans new pride in their country.

in 1816 the democratic republican candidate for president james monroe easily defeated the federalist senator rufus king of new york.
the election showed how seriously the federalist party had declined in popularity.
many federalists had joined the democratic republican party and voted for monroe.
president james monroe faced little opposition as a democratic republican.
what does the lack of opposition imply about the the federalist party at this time.

he was almost 60 years old when he took office and he had old fashioned manners.
americans were fond of his old fashioned ways.
in 1817 he made a goodwill tour of the country.
in boston crowds cheered monroe enthusiastically.
boston newspapers expressed surprise at this warm welcome for a democratic republican from virginia.
after all boston had long been a federalist stronghold.
an era of good feelings monroe hoped to create a new sense of national unity.
one newspaper wrote that the united states was entering an era of good feelings by the time monroe ran for a second term in 1820 no candidate opposed him.
the federalist party had disappeared.
while conflict between political parties declined disputes between different sections of the nation sharpened.
these disputes we a result of sectionalism or loyalty to ones state or section rather than to the nation as a whole.

calhoun stands for the south against federal power john c calhoun spoke for the south.
he had grown up on a frontier farm in south carolina.
calhoun s immense energy and striking features earned him the nickname young hercules he was slim and handsome with deep set eyes and a high forehead.
his way of speaking was so intense that it sometimes made people uncomfortable to be in his presence.
calhoun had supported the war of 1812.
like many southerners he was a firm defender of slavery.
in general he opposed policies that would strengthen the power of the federal government.
webster speaks for the north against slavery and war daniel webster of new hampshire was perhaps the most skillful public speaker of his time.
with eyes flashing and shoulders thrown back webster was an impressive sight when he stood up to speak in congress.
an observer described him as a great cannon loaded to the lips like many new englanders webster had opposed the war of 1812.

clay speaks for the west in favor of active i government henry clay spoke for the west.
you j have already met clay as a leader of the war hawks who pushed for war against britain in 1812.
clay was born in virginia but moved to kentucky when he was 20.
as a young lawyer he was once fined for brawling with an opponent.
usually however he charmed both friends and rivals.
supporters called him t gallant harry of the west like webster clay strongly favored a more active role for the central government in promoting the countrys growth.
h recall which position did webster share with clay.
creating a stable economy after the war after the war of 1812 leaders such as calhoun webster and clay had to deal with serious economic issues.
despite the nations great physical growth and the soaring spirits of its people the united states economy faced severe problems.
this was due in part to the lack of a national bank.

analyze charts as cotton production soared what other features of the american economy also grew.
the charter that had set up the first bank of the united states ran out in 1811.
without the bank to lend money and regulate the nation s money supply the economy suffered.
state banks made loans and issued money.
however they often put too much money into circulation.
with so much money available to spend prices rose rapidly in the nations early years democratic republicans such as jefferson and madison had opposed a national bank because they saw it as unconstitutional.
they thought that the constitution did not give the federal government the right to charter corporations such as a national bank.
by 1816 however many democratic republicans believed that a bank was needed.
they supported a law to charter the second bank of the united states.
by lending money and restoring order to the nation s money supply the bank helped american businesses grow.
policies protect against foreign competition another economic problem facing the nation was foreign competition especially from britain.
in the oarly 1800s the embargo act and then the war of 1812 kept most british goods out of the united states.
in response ambitious american business leaders such as francis cabot lowell established their own mills and factories.
as a result american industry grew quickly until 1815.
domestic problems caused by foreign goods with the end of the war of 1812 british goods again poured into the united states.
because the british had a head start in industrializing they could make and sell goods more cheaply than americans could.
most british factory buildings and machines were older and had already been paid for.
in contrast americans still had to pay for their new factory buildings.
sometimes british manufacturers sold cloth in the united states for less than it cost to make so that they could capture the market.
british manufacturers hoped to put american rivals out of business.
then the british planned to raise prices.
the regional impacts of tariffs this british strategy caused dozens of new england businesses to fail.
angry owners asked congress to place a protective tariff on all goods imported from europe.
as you have read the purpose of a protective tariff is to protect a country s industries from foreign competition.
congress responded by passing the tariff of 1816.
it greatly raised tariffs on imports.
this increase made imported goods far more expensive than similar american made goods.
the early republic 246 5 6 monroes presidency the early republic 247 5 6 monroes presidency daniel webster supported a tariff to help northern industry.
a slow freight wagon and a fast mail coach make their way down the national road built with federal support.
congress spent little on such roads however.
the tariff of 1816 impacted the north west and south differently because each region had a different economy.
the north was the base of americas manufacturing.
it therefore benefited the most.
higher prices on foreign goods made american goods more competitive.
american factories sold more products and businesses grew.
the economies of the south and west relied heavily on farming.
they were not as financially invested in manufacturing and therefore did not experience the same benefits as the north.
goods like cloth and iron became more expensive to southern and western consumers.
northerners gained income as a result.
higher tariffs led to angry protests.
lacking factories southerners did not benefit from the tariff.
also southerners bought many british goods.
the new tariff drove up the price of british made goods.
southerners complained that the tariff made northern manufacturers rich at the expense of the south.
henry clay combats sectionalism the bitter dispute over tariffs contributed to the growth of sectionalism.
americans identified themselves as southerners northerners or westerners.
in congress representatives from different sections often clashed.
henry clay wanted to promote economic growth for all sections.
his program known as the american system called for high tariffs on imports which would help northern factories.
with wealth from industry clay believed northerners would have the money to buy farm products from the west and the south.
high tariffs would also reduce american dependence on foreign goods.
clay also urged congress to use money from tariffs to build roads bridges and canals.
a better transportation system he believed would make it easier and cheaper for farmers in the west and the south to ship goods to city markets.
clays american system never fully went into effect.
while tariffs remained high congress spent little on internal improvements new roads bridges and canals.
southerners in particular disliked clays plan.
the south had many fine rivers on which to transport goods.
many southerners opposed paying for roads and canals that brought them no direct benefits.
some americans also thought clay s plan for developing transportation with federal support was unconstitutional.
they did not believe the federal government had the authority to build such projects.
they believed that by regulating industry and building the early republic 248 5 6 monroes presidency roads and canals the federal government would gain too much power.
check understanding why did many states in the south and west oppose the tariff of 1816.
supreme court decisions expand federal power under chief justice john marshall the supreme court strengthened the power of the federal government.
the court gave the federal government the power to regulate the economy.
a broad definition of necessary and proper after congress chartered the second bank of the united states maryland tried to tax the bank in order to drive it out of the state.
james mcculloch the bank cashier refused to pay the tax.
in the case of mcculloch v maryland 1819 the court ruled that states had no right to interfere with federal institutions within their borders.
the ruling strengthened federal power.
it also allowed the bank of the united states to continue which helped the economy to expand.
the court decision addressed the issue of the meaning of the necessary and proper clause of the u s constitution.
it ruled that the federal government had the power to charter the bank of the united states under the clause.
this clause states that the congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying out functions outlined elsewhere in the constitution.
since the constitution gave the federal government the power to tax and borrow money and to regulate business the court stated that creating a bank could be considered necessary and proper to carrying out these powers.
the supreme court took a loose constructionist view of the constitution believing that the necessary and proper clause should be interpreted loosely as circumstances changed.
many americans disagreed with the court.
those who disagreed took a strict constructionist view that the necessary and proper clause permitted only actions absolutely necessary for performing the governments constitutional duties.
strict constructionists generally agreed that the bank of the united states was not truly necessary for the government to function.
broad powers over interstate trade in another case gibbons v ogden 1824 the supreme court of all the capitols in the united states the maryland state capitol building built in 1784 has spent the most years in operation.
interactive gallery upheld the power of the federal government to regulate trade between states.
the court struck down a new york law that tried to control steamboat travel between new york and new jersey.
the court ruled that a state could regulate trade only within its own borders.
only the federal government had the power to regulate interstate commerce or trade between different states.
this decision helped the national economy by making it easier for the government to regulate trade.
these rulings not only affected the government.
they also changed daily life for people in the united states.
the new york law had given a monopoly or exclusive rights to robert fultons steamboat company to run ferries to new jersey.
fultons company was the only one allowed to run ferries between the two states.
when the supreme court struck down this new york law fultons monopoly on steamboat traffic ended.
as a result his company could not compete with companies that charged a lower fare and people working for fulton lost their jobs.
however the increased competition was good for consumers because it led to lower fares.
many people also liked this ruling because it created a single national market for goods and services regulated by the federal government.
having clear the early republic 249 5 6 monroes presidency national laws to follow made it easier for people to do business and move goods and services nationwide.
bcheck understanding how did the decision in mcculloch v maryland increase federal power.
latin america wins independence by 1810 many people in spains colonies in the americas were eager for independence.
they had many reasons to be unhappy.
most people even wealthy creoles had little or no say in government.
in latin america the term creole described people born to spanish parents there.
they demanded a role in government.

mexico gains independence a mexican priest named miguel hidalgo mee gel ee dahl goh called on mexicans to fight for independence from spain in 1810.
many mexicans answered his call.
rebel forces won control of several provinces before father hidalgo was captured.
in 1811 hidalgo was executed.
another priest jose morelos hoh say moh raylohs took up the fight.
because he called for a program to give land to peasants wealthy creoles opposed him.

the best known revolutionary leader was simon bolivar see mohn boh lee vahr.
he became known as the liberator for his role in the latin american wars of independence.
bolivar came from a wealthy creole family in venezuela.

bolivar promised i will never allow my hands to be idle nor my soul to rest until i have broken the shackles which chain us to spain bolivar rose to become a leader of the rebel forces.

the portuguese colony of brazil won independence peacefully.
when brazilian revolutionaries demanded independence prince pedro son of the portuguese king joined their cause.
he became emperor of the new independent nation of brazil in 1822.
the new republics spains former colonies modeled their constitutions on that of the united states.
yet their experience after independence was very different frni that of their neighbor to the north.
unlike the people of the 13 british colonies the peoples of latin america did not unite into a single country.
in part geography made unity difficult.
latin america covered a much larger area than the british colonies.
thick rain forests and mountains such as the high rugged andes acted as barriers to travel and communication.
also the spanish colonies were spread out over a huge area.
therefore several separate republics formed.
the new republics had a hard time setting up stable governments.
under spanish rule the colonists had gained little or no experience in self government.
powerful leaders took advantage of the turmoil to seize control.
as a result the new nations were often unable to achieve democratic rule.
b identify central ideas what characteristics of physical geography made it more difficult for latin american colonies to unite than it had been for the united states.
gaining florida spain lost another one of its colonies florida not to independence but to the united states.
many americans wanted to gain possession of florida.
white southerners were especially worried about disturbances across the border.
creeks and seminoles in florida sometimes raided settlements in georgia.
the early republic 251 5 6 monroes presidency also florida was a refuge for many africans and african americans who escaped slavery.
jackson invades spanish florida since the 1700s spanish officials had protected enslaved africans who had fled from plantations in georgia and south carolina.
seminoles allowed africans to live near their villages.
in return these black seminoles gave the seminoles a share of the crops they raised.
the black seminoles adopted many seminole customs.
one settlement on the apalachicola river known as the negro fort contained about 1 000 black seminoles.
general andrew jackson demanded that spain demolish the negro fort.
when the spanish governor refused the united states invaded florida and destroyed the fort.
adams buys florida in 1818 jackson again headed to florida with a force of more than 3 000 soldiers.
spain protested but did little else.
it was busy fighting rebels in latin america and could not risk war with the united states.
in the end spain agreed to peace talks.
secretary of state john quincy adams worked out a treaty with spains foreign minister luis de onis loo ess day oh nees.
in it spain agreed to give florida to the united in this political cartoon uncle sam brandishes a big stick labeled monroe doctrine as a warning to european nations not to attempt to re colonize territory in the americas.

the adams onis treaty took effect in 1821.
e2 describe what was the result of the adams onis treaty.
the monroe doctrine americans cheered as latin american nations won independence.
the actions of european powers however worried secretary of state adams and president monroe.
in 1815 prussia france russia and austria formed an alliance aimed at crushing any revolution that sprang up in europe.
they seemed ready to help spain regain its colonies in latin america.
in addition russia claimed lands on the pacific coast of north america.
the british too worried about other european nations meddling in the western hemisphere.
they feared that their profitable trade with the newly independent countries would be hurt if spain regained control of its former colonies.
thus they suggested that the united states and britain issue a joint statement guaranteeing the freedom of the new nations of latin america.
monroe decided to act independently of britain.
in a message to congress in 1823 he made a bold foreign policy statement known as the monroe doctrine.
monroe declared that the united states would not interfere in the affairs of european nations or existing colonies of the european nations.
at the same time he warned european nations not to attempt to regain control of the newly independent nations of latin america.
the monroe doctrine stated that the united states would oppose any attempt to reclaim old colonies or build new colonies in the americas.
monroe s message showed that the united states was determined to keep european powers out of the western hemisphere.
the united states did not have the military power to enforce the monroe doctrine.
britain however supported the statement.
with its strong navy it could stop europeans from building new colonies in the americas.
as the united states became stronger the monroe doctrine grew in importance.
on several occasions the united states successfully challenged european intervention or direct involvement in latin america.
in the 1900s presidents also used the monroe doctrine to justify sending troops to caribbean nations.

the main cause stemmed from the influence of andrew jackson.
he was an american politician during this time who supported expanding democratic rights.
from the time of his first campaign for president in 1824 until his death in 1845 he dominated american politics.
jackson s policies had a significant effect on issues such as voting rights and the ways in which government functions.
this period is often known as the age of jackson.

explain the origin and development of new political parties under john quincy adams.
describe the causes and effects of jacksonian democracy and the impact of the election of andrew jackson.
explain the spoils system.
the age of jackson increased suffrage during the 1820s or the early years of the age of jackson more americans gained suffrage or the right to vote.
others however were denied full participation in the growing democracy.
the united states was growing rapidly.
new states were joining the union and there were many citizens eager to participate in elections.
some of the first states to give voting privileges to white males who did not own property were in the west.
in these states any white man over age 21 could vote.
reformers in the east worked to expand suffrage in that region.
by the 1830s most eastern states had dropped the requirement that voters had to own land.
in this way many craft workers and shopkeepers won the right to vote.
throughout the country growing numbers of americans exercised their newly acquired right to vote.
before 1828 the turnout of eligible voters was never more than 27 percent.
that low percentage rose to nearly 58 percent in the election of 1828.
by 1840 voter turnout was nearly 80 percent.
limits on suffrage despite the nations growing democratic spirit a great many americans did not have the right to vote.
they included women native americans and the vast majority of african americans.
slaves had no political rights at all.
meanwhile the few states that still required white men to own property to vote failed to remove that barrier during jacksons presidency.
although most white men had won suffrage free african americans had lost it.
in the early years of the nation most northern states and a few southern states allowed free african american men to vote.
by the 1820s however many of these states had taken away that right.
by 1830 only a few new england states permitted free african american men to vote on equal terms with white men.
in new york african american men had to own property in order to vote while white men did not.
no state allowed enslaved african americans to vote.
bi recall how did democracy expand during the age of jackson.
the election of 1824 leads to a bargain there were four candidates for president in 1824.
all four were members of the old republican party.
however each had support in different parts of the country.
john quincy adams was strong in new england.
henry clay and andrew jackson had support in the west.
william h crawford was favored in the south but became too ill to campaign.
the candidates john quincy adams of massachusetts was the son of abigail and john adams the second president.
a graduate of harvard university the younger adams had served as secretary key terms andrew jackson alexis de tocqueville suffrage john quincy adams henry clay majority whig party democratic party spoils system democracy expands alexis de tocqueville most americans did not feel that the rich deserved special respect.
wealthy european visitors to the united states were surprised that american servants expected to be treated as equals.
others were amazed that butlers and maids refused to be summoned with bells as in europe.
a visitor from france alexis de tocqueville became especially well known for his observations on american democracy.
he arrived in the united states in 1831.
the french government had sent him to study the american prison system.
for several months tocqueville toured much of the united states.
however he observed much more than prisons.
he observed a society that was becoming more and more democratic.
after his return to france tocqueville recorded his experiences and observations in a book titled democracy in america.
in it he admired the american democratic spirit and the american goals of equality and freedom.
he found that the results of the social revolution taking place in america while still far from coming to an end were already incomparably greater than anything which has taken place in the world before class in america and europe question who had voting rights.

266 the age of jackson and westward expansion 267 6 1 the age of jackson of state and helped end the war of 1812.
people admired adams for his intelligence and high morals.
adams however was uncomfortable campaigning among the common people.
in fact to most people he seemed hard and cold.
a kentuckian henry clay was a shrewd politician who became speaker of the house of representatives.
in congress clay was a skillful negotiator who had worked out several important compromises.
despite his abilities clay was less popular than the other candidate from the west andrew jackson.
william h crawford had served as treasury secretary war secretary ambassador to france after the war of 1812 and as a senator from georgia.
crawfords support was concentrated in the southeast.
to many americans especially on the western frontier andrew jackson was a hero.
a general during the war of 1812 he had defeated the british and a group of creek indians who were allied with the british.
he had gone on to defeat the seminoles and the spanish in florida gaining that territory for the united states.
he was known as the hero of new orleans for his victory in the war of 1812.
he also earned the nickname old hickory after a soldier said he was tough as hickory jacksons fame as a general helped him launch a political career.
although he was a landowner and a slave owner many saw him as a man of the people.
jackson had been born in a log cabin and his parents had been poor farmers.
he was admired by small farmers and others who felt left out of the growing economy in the united states.
the expansion of the vote to white men without property helped account for jacksons political popularity.
the corrupt bargain no clear winner emerged from the election of 1824.
jackson won the popular vote but no candidate won a majority or more than half of the electoral votes.
as a result under the provisions of the constitution the house of representatives had to choose the president from among the top three candidates.
because he had finished fourth clay was out of the running.
as speaker of the house though he played an important role in influencing the results and reaching a compromise to settle the conflict.
clay urged members of the house to vote for adams.
clays support was enough for adams to win the vote in the house.
after he became president adams named clay his secretary of state.
in the past secretaries of state had gone on to become president.
jackson and his backers were furious.
they accused adams and clay of making a corrupt bargain and stealing the election from jackson.
in fact the election was decided based on provisions of the constitution.
still the anger the election of 1824 candidate home state main positions popular vote 41 4 henry clay kentucky supports tariffs and spending on roads and canals to promote business compromise between north and south 47 531 the popular vote does not accurately measure candidates popular support because in several electors were chosen by state legislatures.

compare which two candidates positions were most similar and how were they similar.
37 not on ballot states there was no popular vote and tf jackson and westward expansion 268 6 1 the age of jackson of jackson and his supporters seriously hampered president adamss efforts to unify the nation.
check understanding why did some people refer to the 1824 election result as a corrupt bargain.
the presidency of john quincy adams adams knew that the outcome of the election had angered many americans.
to bring the whole people together he pushed for a program of economic growth through internal improvements.
his plan backfired however and opposition to him grew.
promoting economic growth like alexander hamilton and henry clay adams thought that the federal government should promote economic growth.
he called for the government to pay for new roads and canals.
these internal improvements would help farmers to transport goods to market.
adams also favored projects to promote the arts and the sciences.
he suggested building a national university and an observatory from which astronomers could study the stars.
most americans objected to spending money on such programs.
they feared that the federal government would become too powerful.
congress approved money for a national road and some canals but turned down most of adamss other programs.
origin of new political parties during the 1820s nearly all politicians were members of jeffersons democratic republican party.
in the 1830s however new political parties took shape.
these parties grew out of the conflict between john quincy adams and andrew jackson.
the whig party democratic republicans who supported adams and his programs for national growth called themselves national republicans.
in 1834 many of them joined a new party organized by henry clay and known as the whig party.
whigs had very specific points of view.
whigs wanted the federal government to promote business by paying for roads and canals.
whigs believed that the federal government should oversee banks.
they believed that a stable banking system would encourage business.
whigs also wanted higher tariffs.
the whigs had their strongest support the northeast with some support in cities and towns in the south and west.
people from these places backed the whigs because these places relied on manufacturing john quincy adams the sixth president of the united states thought that the federal government should adopt policies and pay for projects that would help the economy.
and commerce and whig policies aimed to help those parts of the economy.
tariffs are taxes or fees placed on imported goods.
by making imports more expensive they help domestic producers.
however they may prompt foreign governments to impose tariffs in response.
so tariffs can threaten exporters.
those who supported the whigs included eastern factory owners and other businessmen some southern planters and many former federalists.
whigs were often divided into factions and not all of the partys members always followed the partys direction.
the democratic party jackson and other democratic republicans who supported him began to call themselves the democratic party.
todays democratic party traces its roots to andrew jacksons time.
like the whig party democrats also had a point of view.
they called for more political power for ordinary white men and opposed privileges for the wealthy or educated.
democrats were opposed to tariffs and a federal government role in the economy.
democrats opposed high tariffs because farmers counted on being able to sell their goods overseas and did not want to risk retaliatory tariffs.
they also did not want to pay more for imported goods.
