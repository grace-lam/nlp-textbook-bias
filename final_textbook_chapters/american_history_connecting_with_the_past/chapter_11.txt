before, but only about 2 percent of the value of the raw cotton exported that year.
To the degree that the South developed a nonfarm commercial sector, it was largely to serve the needs of the plantation economy. Particularly important were the brokers, or "factors,” who marketed the planters’ crops. These merchants tended to live in such towns as New Orleans, Charleston, Mobile, and Savannah, where they worked to find buyers for cotton and
other crops and where they purchased goods for the planters they served. The South had only a very rudimentary financial system, and the factors often also served the planters as bankers, providing them with credit. Planters frequently accumulated substantial debts, particularly during periods when cotton prices were in decline; and the southern merchant-bankers thus became figures of considerable influence and importance in the region. There were also substantial groups of professional

These two maps show the remarkable spread of cotton cultivation in the South in the decades before the Civil War. Both maps show the areas of cotton cultivation (the green-colored areas) as well as areas with large slave populations (the brown-dotted areas). Note how in the top map, which represents 1820, cotton production is concentrated largely in the East, with a few areas scattered among Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Slavery is most concentrated along the Georgia and South Carolina coast, areas in which long-staple cotton was grown, with only a few other areas of highly dense slave populations. By 1860, the South had changed dramatically. Cotton production had spread throughout the lower South, from Texas to northern Florida, and slavery had moved with it. Slavery was also much denser in the tobacco-growing regions of Virginia and North Carolina, which had also grown. * How did this economic shift affect the white South's commitment to slavery?

people in the South-lawyers, editors, doctors, and others. In most parts of the region, however, they too were closely tied to and dependent on the plantation economy. However important manufacturers, merchants, and professionals might have been to southern society, they were relatively unimportant in comparison with the manufacturers, merchants, and professionals of the North, on whom southerners were coming more and more (and increasingly unhappily) to depend.
The primitive character of the region’s banking system matched a lack of development in other basic services and structures necessary for industrial development. Perhaps most notable was the South’s inadequate transportation system. In the North in the antebellum period, enormous sums were invested in roads, canals,
and above all railroads to knit the region together into an integrated market. In the South there were no such investments. Canals were almost nonexistent; most roads were crude and unsuitable for heavy transport; and railroads, although they expanded substantially in the 1840s and 1850s,

failed to tie the region together effectively. Such towns as Charleston, Atlanta, Savannah, and Norfolk had direct connections with Memphis, and thus with the Northwest; and Richmond was connected, via the Virginia Central, with the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. In addition, several independent lines furnished a continuous connection between the Ohio River and New Orleans. Most of the South, however, remained unconnected to the national railroad system. Most lines in the region were short and local. The principal means of transportation was water. Planters generally shipped their crops to market along rivers or by sea; most manufacturing was in or near port towns.
Perceptive southerners recognized the economic subordination of their region to the North. "From the rattle with which the nurse tickles the ear of the child born in the South to the shroud that covers the cold form of the dead, everything comes to us from the North.” the Arkansas journalist Albert Pike lamented. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of southern economic independence was James B. D. De Bow, a resident of New Orleans. He published a magazine advocating

De Bow’s Review
southern commercial and agricultural expansion, De Bow’s Review, which survived from its founding in 1846 until 1880.
De Bow made his journal into a tireless advocate of southern economic independence from the North, warning constantly
of the dangers of the "colonial” relationship between the sections. One writer noted in the pages of his magazine: "I think it would be safe to estimate the amount which is lost to us annually by our vassalage to the North at $100,000,000. Great God!” Yet De Bow’s Review was itself evidence of the dependency of the South on the North. It was printed in New York, because no New Orleans printer had facilities adequate for the task; it was filled with advertisements from northern manufacturing firms; and its circulation was always modest in comparison with those of northern publications. In Charleston, for example, it sold an average of 173 copies per issue; Harper’s Magazine of New York, in contrast, regularly sold 1,500 copies to South Carolinians.
Reasons for Colonial Dependency
Sources of Southern Difference
Despite this growing concern about the region's "colonial dependency,” the South made few serious efforts to build an economy that might challenge its dependency. An important question about antebellum southern history, therefore, is why the region did so little to develop a larger industrial and commercial economy of its own. Why did it remain so different from the North?
Part of the reason was the great profitability of the South's agricultural system, particularly of cotton production. In the Northeast, many people had turned to manufacturing as the agricultural economy of the region declined. In the South, the agricultural economy was booming, and ambitious people eager to profit from the emerging capitalist economy had little incentive to look beyond it. Another
reason was that wealthy southerners had so much capital invested in their land and, particularly, their slaves, they had little left for other investments. Some historians have suggested that the southern climate-with its long, hot, steamy summers-was less suitable for industrial development than the climate of the North. Still others have claimed that southern work habits (perhaps a reflection of the debilitating effects of the climate) impeded industrialization; some white southerners appeared-at least to many northern observers-not to work very hard, to lack the strong work ethic that fueled northern economic development.
But the southern failure to create a flourishing commercial or industrial economy was also in part the result of a set of values distinctive to the South that discouraged the growth of cities and industry. Many white southerners liked to think of them-
The Cavalier selves as rePresentatives of a special way of Image	based on traditional values of chivalry,
leisure, and elegance. White southerners were, they argued, "cavaliers'-people happily free from the base, acquisitive instincts of the ^yankees” to their north. Southern
white people were, they believed, more concerned with a refined and gracious way of life than with rapid growth and development. Appealing as the "cavalier” image was to southern whites, however, it conformed to the reality of southern society in very limited ways.
WHITE SOCIETY
IN THE SOUTH
Only a small minority of southern whites owned slaves. In 1850, when the total white population of the South was over 6 million, the number of slaveholders was only 347,525. In 1860, when the white population was just above 8 million, the number of slaveholders had risen to only 383,637. These figures are somewhat misleading, since each slaveholder was normally the head of a family averaging five members. But even with all members of slaveowning families included in the figures, those owning slaves still amounted to perhaps no more than one-quarter of the white population. And of the minority of whites holding slaves, only a small proportion owned them in substantial numbers.
The Planter Class
Planter
Aristocracy
How, then, did the South come to be seen-both by the outside world and by many southerners themselves-as a society dominated by great plantations and wealthy landowning planters? In large part, it was because the planter aristocracy-the cotton
magnates, the sugar, rice, and tobacco nabobs, the whites who owned at least forty or fifty slaves and 800 or more acres-exercised power and influence far in excess of their numbers. They stood at the apex of society, determining the political, economic, and even social life of their region. Enriched by vast annual incomes, dwelling in palatial homes, surrounded by broad acres and many black servants, they became a class to which all other southerners deferred. The wealthiest planters also maintained homes in towns or cities and spent several months of the year there, engaged in a glittering social life. Others traveled widely, especially to Europe, as an antidote to the isolation of plantation life. And many used their plantations to host opulent social events.
White southerners liked to compare their planter class to the old upper classes of England and Europe: true aristocracies, long entrenched. In fact, however, the southern upper class was in most cases not at all similar to the landed aristocracies of the Old World. In some areas of the upper South-the Tidewater region of Virginia, for example-some of the great aristocrats were indeed people whose families had occupied positions of wealth and power for generations. In most of the South, however, a long-standing landed aristocracy, although central to the "cavalier” image, was largely a myth. Even the most important planters in the cotton-growing areas of the South were, typically, new to their wealth and power. As late as
COTTON, SLAVERY, AND THE OLD SOUTH
• 299 the 1850s, many of the great landowners in the lower South were still first-generation settlers, who had arrived with only modest resources, struggled for years to clear land and develop a plantation in what was at first a rugged wilderness, and only recently had started to live in the comfort and luxury for which they became famous. Large areas of the "Old South” (as Americans later called the South of the pre-Civil War era) had been settled and cultivated for less than two decades at the time of the Civil War.
Nor was the world of the planter nearly as leisured and genteel as the "cavalier” myth would suggest. Growing staple crops was a business that was in its own way just as competitive and just as risky as the industrial enterprises of the North.
Plantation Planters had to supervise their operations
Management carefully if they hoped to make a profit.
They were, in many respects, just as much competitive capitalists as the industrialists of the North whose lifestyles they claimed to hold in contempt. Even many affluent planters lived modestly, their wealth so heavily invested in
land and slaves that there was little left for personal comfort. And white planters, even some substantial ones, tended to move frequently as new and presumably more-productive areas opened up to cultivation.
Indeed, it may have been the very newness and precariousness of the plantation way of life, and the differences between the reality of that life and the image of it, that made many southern planters determined to portray themselves as genteel aristocrats. Having struggled so hard to reach and maintain their positions, they were all the more determined to defend them. Perhaps that was why the defense of slavery and of the South's 'Tights” was stronger in the new, booming regions of the lower South and weaker in the more established and less flourishing areas of the Tidewater.
Wealthy southern whites sustained their image of themselves as aristocrats in many ways. They avoided such "coarse” occupations as trade and commerce; those who did not become planters often gravitated toward the military, a "suitable” career

for men raised in a culture in which medieval knights (as portrayed in the novels of Walter Scott) were a powerful and popular image. The aristocratic ideal also found reflection in the definition of a special role for southern white women.
"Honor"
Above all, perhaps, white males adopted an elaborate code of chivalry, which obligated them to defend their "honor,” often through dueling-which survived in the South long after it had largely vanished in the North. Southern white males placed enormous stock in conventional forms of courtesy and respect in their dealings with one another-perhaps to distance themselves from the cruelty and disrespect that were so fundamental to the slave system they controlled. Violations of such forms often brought what seemed to outsiders a disproportionately heated and even violent response.
The idea of honor in the South was only partly connected to the idea of ethical behavior and bravery. It was also tied to the importance among white males of the public appearance of dignity and authority-of saving face in the presence of others. Anything that seemed to challenge the dignity, social station, or "manhood” of a white southern male might be the occasion
for a challenge to duel, or at least for a stern public rebuke When the South Carolina congressman Preston Brooks strode into the chamber of the United States Senate and savagely beat Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts with a cane to retaliate for what he considered an insult to a relative, he was acting wholly in accord with the idea of southern honor. In the North, he was reviled as a savage. In the South, he became a popular hero. But Brooks was only the most public example of a code of behavior that many white southern men fol-
Cult of
Honor lowed. Avenging insults was a social necessity in many parts of southern society, and avenging insults to white southern women was perhaps the most
important obligation of a white southern "gentleman.”
The "Southern Lady"
In some respects, affluent white women in the South occupied roles very similar to those of middle-class white women in the North. Their lives generally centered in the home, where they served as companions to and hostesses for their husbands and as nurturing mothers for their children. Even less frequently than in the North did "genteel” southern white women engage in public activities or find income-producing employment.

But the life of the "southern lady” was also in many ways very different from that of her northern counterpart. For one thing, the cult of honor in the region meant in theory that southern white men gave particular importance to the "defense”
Subordinate °‘ W0l™n-In Police, this generally meant
Status of	w“lte men were even more dominant
Women an<^ white women even more subordinate in southern culture than they were in the
North. George Fitzhugh, one of the South’s most important social theorists, wrote in the 1850s: 'Women, like children, have but one right, and that is the right to protection. The right to protection involves the obligation to obey.”
More important in determining the role of southern white women, however, were the social and economic realities in which they lived. The vast majority of females in the region lived on farms, isolated from people outside their own families, with virtually no access to the "public world” and thus few opportunities to look beyond their roles as wives and mothers. Because the family was the principal economic unit on most farms, the dominance of husbands and fathers over wives and children was even greater than in those northern families in which income-producing activities had moved out of the home and into the factory or office. For many white women, living on farms of modest size meant a fuller engagement in the economic life of the family than was becoming typical for middle-class women in the North. These women engaged in spinning, weaving, and other production; they participated in agricultural tasks; they helped supervise the slave workforce. On some of the larger plantations, however, even these limited roles were sometimes considered unsuitable for white women; and the "plantation mistress” became, in some cases, more an ornament for her husband than an active part of the economy or the society.
CLEAR STARCHING IN LOUISIANA
This 1837 etching by Auguste Hervieu offers a strikingly unromanticized view of plantation women in the South. The white plantation mis soberly dressed, speaks harshly to two black household servants, presumably criticizing the way they are doing the laundry. The slaves cower, carefully hiding whatever resentment t ey might feel behind a submissive pose. Nothing in this picture suggests anything like the k’ ease and luxury often associated with plantation life in popular mythology at the time since, [The Life and Adventures of Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw, by Frances Trollope, 1836} Southern white women also had less access to education than their northern counterparts. Nearly a quarter of all white women over twenty were completely illiterate; relatively few women had more than a rudimentary exposure to schooling. Even wealthy planters were not interested in extensive schooling for their daughters. The few female "academies” in the South trained women primarily to be suitable wives.
Southern white women had other special burdens as well. The southern white birth rate remained nearly 20 percent ~	higher than that of the nation as a whole, and
Burdens infant mortality in the region remained higher than elsewhere; nearly half the children born in the South in 1860 died before they reached five years of age. The slave-labor system had a mixed impact on white women. It helped spare many of them from certain kinds of arduous labor, but it also threatened their relationships with their husbands. Male slaveowners had frequent sexual relationships with the female slaves on their plantations; the children of those unions became part of the plantation labor force and served as a constant reminder to white women of their husbands’ infidelity. Black women (and men) were obviously the most important
victims of such practices. But white women suffered too.
A few southern white women rebelled against their roles and against the prevailing assumptions of their region. Some became outspoken abolitionists and joined northerners in the crusade to abolish slavery. Some agitated for other reforms within the South itself. Most white women, however, found few outlets for whatever discontent they may have felt with their lives. Instead, they generally convinced themselves of the benefits of their position and-even more fervently than southern white men-defended the special virtues of the southern way of life. Upper-class white women in the South were particularly energetic in defending the class lines that separated them from poorer whites.
The Plain Folk
The typical white southerner was not a great planter and slaveholder, but a modest yeoman farmer. Some of these "plain folk,” as they have become known, owned a few slaves, with whom they worked and lived far more closely than did the larger planters. Most (in fact, three-quarters of all white families) owned no slaves. Some plain folk, most of whom owned their own land, devoted themselves largely to subsistence farming; others grew cotton or other crops for the market, but usually could not produce enough to allow them to expand their operations or even get out of debt. During the 1850s, the number of nonslaveholding landowners increased much faster than the number of slaveholding landowners. While there were occasional examples of poor farmers moving into the ranks of the planter class, such cases were rare. Most yeomen knew that they had little prospect of substantially bettering their lot.
One reason was the southern educational system, which provided poor whites with few opportunities to learn and thus limited their chances of advancement. For the sons of wealthy planters, the region provided ample opportunities to gain an
302 » CHAPTER 11
education. In 1860 there were 260 southern colleges and universities, public and private, with 25,000 students enrolled in them, or more than half the total number of
Educational students in the United States. But universi-
Opportunities ties were within the reach of only the upper class. The elementary and secondary schools of the South were not only fewer but also inferior to those of the Northeast (although not much worse than the crude schools of the Northwest), and a higher proportion of whites
were illiterate than in other parts of the country.
That a majority of the South’s white population consisted of
modest farmers largely excluded from the dominant plantation society raises another important question about the antebellum South. Why did the plain folk have so little power in the public world of the Old South? Why did they not oppose the aristocratic social system in which they shared so little? Why did they not resent the system of slavery, from which they generally did not benefit?
Some nonslaveowning whites did oppose the planter elite, but for the most part in limited ways and in a relatively few, isolated areas. These were southern highlanders, the "hill
Hill People PeoP^e^ w^° lived in the Appalachian ranges east of the Mississippi, in the Ozarks to the west of the river, and in other "hill country” or "backcountry” areas cut off from the commercial world of the plantation system. Of all southern whites, they were the most isolated from the mainstream of the region’s life. They practiced a simple form of subsistence agriculture, owned practically no slaves, and had a proud sense of seclusion. They were, in most respects, unconnected to the new commercial economy that dominated the great cotton-planting region of the South. They produced almost no surplus for the market, had little access to money, and
often bartered for the goods they could not grow themselves.
To such men and women, slavery was unattractive for many of the same reasons it was unappealing to workers and small farmers in the North: because it threatened their sense of their own independence. Hill country farmers lived in a society defined by individual personal freedom and unusual isolation from modern notions of property. They also held to older political ideals, which for many included the ideal of fervent loyalty to the nation.
Such whites frequently expressed animosity toward the planter aristocracy of the other regions of the South. The mountain region was the only part of the South to defy the trend toward sectional conformity, and the only part to resist the movement toward secession when it finally developed. Even during the Civil War, many hill country southerners refused to support the Confederacy; some even fought for the Union.
Far greater in number, however, were the nonslaveowning whites who lived in the midst of the plantation system. Many, perhaps most of them, accepted that system because they were tied to it in important ways. Small farmers depended on the local plantation aristocracy for many things: access to cotton gins, markets for
their modest crops and their livestock, credit or other financial assistance. In many areas, there were also extensive kinship
Close Relations with THE Plantation Aristocracy
networks linking lower- and upper-class whites. The poorest resident of a county might be a cousin of the richest aristocrat. Together, these mutual ties helped mute what might otherwise have been pronounced class tensions.
Small farmers felt tied to the plantation society in other ways as well. For white men, at least, the South was an unusually democratic society, in that participation in politics—both through voting and through attending campaign meetings and barbecues-was even more widespread than in the North, where participation was also high. Just as political participation gave workers in the North a sense of connection to the social order, so it did for farmers in the South-although officeholders in the South, even more than in the North, were almost always members of the region’s elites. In the 1850s, moreover, the boom in the cotton economy allowed many small farmers to improve their economic fortunes. Some bought more land, became slaveowners, and moved into at least the fringes of plantation society. Others simply felt more secure in their positions as independent yeomen and hence more likely to embrace the fierce regional loyalty that was spreading throughout the white South in these years.
Small farmers, even more than great planters, were also committed to a traditional, male-dominated family structure. Their household-centered economies required the participation of all family members and, they believed, a stable system
Commitment of gender relarions to ensure order and sta' TO	bility. Men were the unquestioned masters
Paternalism of their homes; women and children, who were both family and workforce, were firmly under the master’s control. As the northern attack on slavery increased in the 1840s and 1850s, it was easy for such farmers to believe-and easy for ministers, politicians, and other propagandists for slavery to persuade them-that an assault on one hierarchical system (slavery) would open the way to an
assault on another such system (patriarchy).
There were other white southerners, however, who did not
share in the plantation economy in even limited ways and yet continued to accept its premises. These were the members of a particularly degraded class-numbering perhaps a half million in 1850-known to other classes variously and demeaningly as "crackers,” "sand hillers,” or "poor white trash” (a phrase used as a chapter title in Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom's Cabin). Occupying the infertile lands of the pine barrens, the red hills, and the swamps, they lived in miserable cabins amid genuine destitution. Many owned no land (or owned land on which nothing could be grown) and supported themselves by foraging or hunting. Others worked as common laborers for their neighbors, although the slave system limited their opportunities. Their degradation resulted partly from dietary deficiencies and disease. Some resorted at times to eating clay (hence the tendency of affluent whites to refer to them disparagingly as clay eaters ); and they suffered from pellagra, hookworm, and malaria. Planters and small farmers alike held them in contempt They formed a true underclass. In some material respects, their plight was worse than that of the African American slaves (who themselves often looked down on the poor whites).
COTTON, SLAVERY, AND THE OLD SOUTH - 303
Yet, even among these southerners-the true outcasts of white society in the region—there was no real opposition to Limited Class	Plantati°n system or slavery. In part,
Conflict undoubtedly, this was because these men and women were so benumbed by poverty that they had little strength to protest. But their relative passivity resulted also from perhaps the single greatest unifying factor among the southern white population, the one force that was most responsible for reducing tensions among the various classes: their perception of race. However poor and miserable these white southerners were, they could still consider themselves members of a ruling race; they could still look down on the black population of the region and feel a bond with their fellow whites born of a determination to maintain their racial supremacy. As Frederick Law Olmsted, a northerner who visited the South and chronicled southern society in the 1850s, wrote: "From childhood, the one thing in their condition which has made life valuable to the mass of whites
has been that the niggers are yet their inferiors/'
SLAVERY: THE “PECULIAR
INSTITUTION”
White southerners often referred to slavery as the "peculiar institution.” By that they meant not that the institution was odd, but that it was distinctive, special. The description was apt, for American slavery was indeed distinctive. The South in the mid-nineteenth century was the only area in the Western world-except for Brazil, Cuba, and Puerto Rico-where slavery still existed. Slavery, more than any other single factor, isolated the South from the rest of American society. And as that isolation increased, so did the commitment of southerners to defend the institution.
Within the South itself, the institution of slavery had paradoxical results. On the one hand, it isolated blacks from whites, drawing a sharp and inviolable racial line dividing one group of southerners from another. As a result, African Americans under slavery began to develop a society and culture of their own, one unrelated to the white civilization around them. On the other hand, slavery created a unique bond between blacks and whites-masters and slaves-in the South. The two groups may have maintained separate spheres, but each sphere was deeply influenced by, indeed dependent on, the other.
Varieties of Slavery
Slavery was an institution established and regulated in detail by law. The slave codes of the southern states forbade slaves to hold property, to leave their masters’ premises without permission, to be out after dark, to congregate with other slaves except at church, to carry firearms, or to strike a white person, even in self-defense. The codes of some states prohib ited whites from teaching slaves to read
Legal Basis of or write and denied slaves the right to Slavery	testify in cQurc against white people. The
laws contained no provisions to legalize slave marriages or divorces. If an owner killed a slave while punishing him, the act was generally not considered a crime. Slaves, however, faced the death penalty for killing or even resisting a white person and for inciting revolt. The codes also contained extraordinarily rigid provisions for defining a person’s race. Anyone with even a trace of African ancestry was defined as black. And anyone even rumored to possess any such trace was presumed to be black unless he or she could prove otherwise-which was, of course, almost impossible to do.
These and dozens of other restrictions might seem to suggest that slaves lived under a uniformly harsh and dismal regime. Had the laws been rigidly enforced, that might have been the case. In fact, however, enforcement was spotty and uneven. Some slaves did acquire property, did learn to read and write, and did assemble with other slaves, in spite of laws to the contrary. Although the major slave offenses generally fell under the jurisdiction of the courts (and thus of the slave codes), white owners handled most transgressions and in-
flicted widely varying punishments. In
Reality of	,	,	,	,	. .,
Slavery	other words, despite the rigid provisions
of law, there was in reality considerable variety within the slave system. Some blacks lived in almost prisonlike conditions, rigidly and harshly controlled by their masters. Many (probably most) others enjoyed some flexibility and (at least in comparison to the regimen prescribed by law) a significant degree of autonomy.
Most masters possessed very few slaves, and their experience with (and image of) slavery was a reflection of the special nature of slavery on the small farm. White farmers with few slaves generally supervised their workers directly and often worked closely alongside them. On such farms, blacks and whites developed a form of intimacy unknown on larger plantations. The paternal relationship between such masters and their slaves could, like relationships between fathers and children, be warm and affectionate. It could also be tyrannical and cruel. In either case, it was a relationship based on the relative powerlessness of the slaves.
Although the majority of slaveowners were small farmers, the majority of slaves lived on plantations of medium or large size, with sizable slave workforces. Substantial planters often hired overseers and even assistant overseers to represent them. "Head drivers,” trusted and responsible slaves often assisted by several subdrivers, acted under the overseer as foremen.
Larger planters generally used one of two methods of assigning slave labor. One was the task system (most common in
_	rice culture), under which slaves were as-
Task and .	.	.	.	. .	.	r
Gang Systems signed a particular task in the morning, for
example, hoeing one acre; after completing the job, they were free for the rest of the day. The other, far more common, was the gang system (employed on the cotton, sugar, and tobacco plantations), under which slaves were simply divided into groups, each of them directed by a driver, and compelled to work for as many hours as the overseer considered a reasonable workday.

WAVING FROM THE SHORE

Slaves generally received at least enough necessities to enable them to live and work. Their masters usually furnished them with an adequate, if mostly coarse, diet, consisting mainly of cornmeal, salt pork, molasses, and on special occasions fresh meat or poultry. Many slaves cultivated gardens for their own use. They received cheap clothing and shoes. They lived in crude cabins, called slave quarters, usually clustered in a complex near the master’s house. The plantation mistress or a doctor retained by the owner provided some medical care; but slave women themselves—as "healers” and midwives, or simply as mothers-were the more important source.
Slaves worked hard, beginning with light tasks as children. Their workdays were longest at harvest time. Slave women worked particularly hard. They generally labored in the fields with the men, and they assumed as well the crucial chores traditionally reserved for women-cooking,
Special Position of Women
cleaning, and child rearing. Because slave families were often divided, with husbands and fathers frequently living on neighboring plantations (or, at times, sold to plantation owners far away), black women often found themselves acting in effect as single parents. Within the slave family, therefore, women had special burdens but also a special authority.
Slaves were, as a group, much less healthy than southern whites. After 1808, when the international slave trade became High Slave iHegal in America, the proportion of blacks Mortality t0 whites steadily declined. In 1820, there Rates	was one African American to every four
whites; in 1840, one to every five. The slower increase of the black population was a result of its comparatively high death rate. Slave mothers had large families, but the enforced poverty in which virtually all African Americans lived ensured that fewer of their children would survive to adulthood than the children of white parents. Even those who did survive typically died at a younger age than the

• 305 Even so, according to some scholars, the actual material conditions of slavery may have been better than those of some northern factory workers and better than those of both peasants and industrial workers in much of nineteenth-century Europe. The conditions of American slaves were certainly less severe than those of slaves in the Caribbean and South America crops, which required more arduous labor. Sugar production in the Caribbean islands, in particular, involved extraordinarily backbreaking work and a high risk of fatal tropical diseases. Caribbean and South American planters continued to use the African slave trade well into the nineteenth century to replenish their labor supply, so they had less incentive than American planters (who no longer had access to that trade) to protect their existing laborers. Growing cotton, the principal activity for most slaves in the United States, was much less debilitating than growing sugar; and planters had strong economic incentives to maintain a healthy slave population. One result of this was that America became the only country where a slave population actually increased through natural reproduction (although it grew much more slowly than the white population).
Most masters did make some effort to preserve the health-and thus the usefulness-of their slaves. One example was the frequent practice of protecting slave children from hard work until early adolescence. Masters believed that doing so would

make young slaves more loyal and would also ensure better health as adults. Another example was the use of hired labor, when available, for the most unhealthy or dangerous tasks. A traveler in Louisiana noted, for example, that Irishmen were employed to clear malarial swamps and to handle cotton bales at the bottom of chutes extending from the river bluff down to a boat landing. If an Irish worker died of disease or in an accident, a master could hire another for a dollar a day or less. But a master would lose an investment of perhaps $1,000 or more if a prime field hand died. Still, cruel masters might forget their pocketbooks in the heat of anger. Slaves were often left to the discipline of overseers, who had less of an economic stake in their well-being; overseers were paid in proportion to the amount of work they could get out of the slaves they supervised.
Household servants had a somewhat easier life-physically at least-than did field hands. On a small plantation, the same slaves might do both field work and housework. But on a
House Slaves large estate-there would generallY be a seP' arate domestic staff: nursemaids, housemaids, cooks, butlers, coachmen. These people lived close to the master and his family, eating the leftovers from the family table and in some cases even sleeping in the "big house/'
Between the blacks and whites of such households affectionate, almost familial relationships might sometimes develop. More often, however, house servants resented their isolation from their fellow slaves and the lack of privacy that came with living in such close proximity to the master’s family. Among other things, that proximity meant that their transgressions were more visible than those of field hands, and so they received punishments more often than did other slaves. When emancipation came after the Civil War, it was often the house servants who were the first to leave the plantations of their former owners.
Female household servants were especially vulnerable to sexual abuse by their masters and white overseers, who sometimes pressured them into supposedly consensual sexual relationships and
sometimes raped them. In addition to unwanted sexual attention from white men, female slaves often received vindictive treatment from white women. Plantation mistresses naturally resented the sexual liaisons between their husbands and female slaves. Punishing their husbands was not usually possible, so they often punished the slaves instead-with arbitrary beatings, increased workloads, and various forms of psychological torment.
Sexual Abuse
Slavery in the Cities
The conditions of slavery in the cities differed significantly from those in the countryside. On relatively isolated plantations, slaves had little contact with free blacks and lower-class whites, and masters maintained direct and effective control; a deep and seemingly unbridgeable chasm yawned between slavery and freedom. In the city, however, a master often could not supervise his slaves closely and at the same time use them
DEBATING THE PAST
io
The Character of Slavery
KT A
'ssue 'n American history has produced a richer literature or a more spirited debate than JAI U the nature of American slavery. The debate began even before the Civil War, when abolitionists strove to expose slavery to the world as a brutal, dehumanizing institution, while southern defenders of slavery tried to depict it as a benevolent, paternalistic system. But by the late nineteenth century, as historian David Blight noted in Race and Reunion (2002), with white Americans eager for sectional conciliation, both northern and southern chroniclers of slavery began to accept a romanticized and unthreatening picture of the Old South and its "peculiar institution." The first major scholarly examination of slavery was Ulrich B. Phillips's American Negro Slavery (1918), which portrayed slavery as an essentially benign institution in which kindly masters looked after submissive, childlike, and generally contented African Americans. Phillips's apologia for slavery remained the authoritative work on the subject for nearly thirty years.
Challenges to Phillips began to emerge in the 1940s, as concern about racial injustice increasingly engaged the attention of white Americans. In 1941, Melville J. Herskovits challenged Phillips's contention that black Americans retained little of their African cultural inheritance, In 1943, Herbert Aptheker published a chronicle of slave revolts as a way of refuting Phillips's claim that blacks were submissive and content.
A somewhat different challenge to Phillips emerged in the 1950s from historians who emphasized the brutality of the institution. Kenneth Stampp's The Peculiar Institution (1956) and Stanley Elkins’s Slavery (1959) described a labor system that did serious physical and psychological damage to its victims. Stampp, and especially Elkins, portrayed slavery as something like a prison, in which men and
women had no space in which to develop their own social and cultural lives.
In the 1970s, new scholarship on slavery focused on slaves' striking success in building a culture of their own despite their enslavement. John Blassingame in 1973 argued that "the most remarkable aspect of the whole process of enslavement is the extent to which the American-born slaves were able to retain their ancestors' culture." Herbert Gutman, in The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), challenged the prevailing belief that slavery had weakened and even destroyed the African American family. On the contrary, he argued, the black family survived slavery with impressive strength, Eugene Genovese's Roll, Jordan, fto//(1974) and other works revealed how African Americans manipulated the paternalist assumptions at the heart of slavery to build a large cultural space of their own within the system where they could develop their own family life, social traditions, and religious patterns. That same year, Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman published their
profitably. Even if they slept at night in carefully watched backyard barracks, slaves moved about during the day alone, performing errands of various kinds. Thus urban slaves gained numerous opportunities to mingle with free blacks and with whites. In the cities, the line between slavery and freedom became increasingly indistinct.
There was a considerable market in the South for common laborers, particularly since, unlike in the North, there were few
Autonomy of EuroPean immigrants to perform menial
Urban Slaves chores. Even the poorest whites tended to prefer working on farms to doing ordinary labor, and so masters often hired out slaves for such tasks. Slaves on contract worked in mining and lumbering (often far from cities); but others worked on the docks and on construction sites, drove wagons, and performed other unskilled jobs in cities and towns. Slave women and children worked in the region’s few textile mills. Particularly skilled workers such as
blacksmiths or carpenters were also often hired out.
Many white southerners considered slavery to be incom-
patible with city life, and as southern cities grew the number of slaves in them declined, relatively if not absolutely. Fearing conspiracies and insurrections, many urban slaveowners sold off much of their male property to the countryside. The remaining black women outnumbered black men. The same
cities also had more white men than women a situation that helped account for the birth of many mulattoes. Even while slavery in the cities was declining, the forced segregation of urban blacks, both free and slave, from white society increased. Segregation was a means of social control intended to make up for the loosening of the discipline of slavery in urban areas.
Free African Americans
There were about 250,000 free African Americans in the slaveholding states by the start of the Civil War, more than half of them in Virginia and Maryland. In some cases, they were slaves who had somehow earned money with which they managed to buy their own and their families’ freedom, usually by developing a skill they could market independently of their masters. It was usually urban blacks, with their greater freedom of movement and activity, who could take that route. One example was Elizabeth Keckley, a slave woman who bought freedom for herself and her son with proceeds from sewing. She later became a seamstress, personal servant, and companion to Mary Todd Lincoln in the White House. But few masters had any incentive, or inclination, to give up their slaves, so this route was open to relatively few people.

defined by their dual roles as members of the plantation workforce and anchors of the black family.
Recent works by Walter Johnson and Ira Berlin mark at least a partial return to the "damage" thesis. In Soul by Soul (2000), a study of the New Orleans slave market, Johnson contends that for whites, purchasing slaves was a way of fulfilling the middle-class fantasy of success and independence, but for the slaves themselves the trade was destructive and dehumanizing. Ira Berlin’s Many Thousands Gone (2000), Generation of Captivity (2003), and The Making of African America (2010) similarly emphasize the dehumanizing character of the slave market and argue that slavery was less a social system than a commodification of human beings. •

Slave workers, they argued, were better treated and lived in greater comfort than most northern industrial workers of the same era.
Other scholarship on slavery has focused on the role of women within it. Elizabeth Fox-Genovese's Within the Plantation Household (1988) examined the lives of both white and black women on the plantation. Rejecting the claims of some feminist historians that black and white women shared a common female identity born of their shared subordination to men, she portrayed slave women as

Tightened
Restrictions on Free Blacks
Some slaves were sometimes set free by a master who had moral qualms about slavery, or by a master's will after his death-for example, the more than 400 slaves belonging to John Randolph of Roanoke, freed in 1833. From the 1830s on, however, state laws governing slavery became more rigid. That was in part a response to the fears Nat Turner’s revolt (see p. 310) created among white southerners: free blacks, removed from close supervision by whites, might generate more violence and rebellion than slaves. It was also in part
because the community of free blacks in southern cities was becoming larger and, to whites, more threatening—a dangerous example to blacks still in slavery. The rise of abolitionist agitation in the North-and the fear that it would inspire slaves to rebel-also persuaded southern whites to tighten their system. The new laws made it more and more difficult, and in some cases practically impossible, for owners to set free (or manumit”) their slaves; all southern states forbade free African Americans from entering. Arkansas even forced the freed slaves living there to leave.
A few free blacks (generally those on the northern fringes of the slaveholding regions) attained wealth and promi nence. Some owned slaves themselves, usually relatives whom they had bought in order to ensure their ultimate
emancipation. In a few cities-New Orleans, Natchez, Charleston-free black communities managed to flourish relatively unmolested by whites and with some economic stability. Most free blacks, however, lived in abject poverty, under conditions worse than those of African Americans in the North. Law or custom closed many occupations to them, forbade them to assemble without white supervision, and placed numerous other restraints on them. They were only quasi-free, but they had all the burdens of freedom: the necessity to support themselves, to find housing, to pay taxes. Yet, great as were the hardships of freedom, these blacks preferred them to slavery.
The Slave Trade
The transfer of enslaved people from one part of the South to another was one of the most important and terrible consequences of slavery. Sometimes slaves moved to the new cotton

THE BUSINESS OF SLAVERY
The offices of slave dealers were familiar sights on the streets of pre-Civil War southern cities and towns. They provide testimony to the way in which slavery was not just a social system, but a business, deeply woven into the fabric of southern economic life. (The Library of Congress) conveyed slaves via river or ocean steamers. Central slave markets included Natchez, New Orleans, Charleston, and Mobile. In the 1840s and 1850s, healthy young field hands could fetch
between $500 and $1,700, depending on the fluctuations in the market.
The domestic slave trade, essential to the growth and prosperity of the system, was one of its most horrible aspects. The trade dehumanized all who were involved in it. It separated children from their parents and parents from each other. Even families who had long been together might be broken up by new owners in the division of the estate after an old master's death. Planters might deplore the trade, but they eased their consciences by holding traders in contempt.
The foreign slave trade was usually badly conducted, resulting in many people dying along the way. Although federal law had prohibited the importation of slaves from 1808 on, some continued to be smuggled into the United States as late
as the 1850s when the supply of slaves had become inadequate. At the annual southern commercial conventions, planters began to discuss the legal reopening of the trade. "If it is right to buy slaves in Virginia and carry them to New Orleans," William L. Yancey of Alabama asked his fellow delegates in 1858, "why is it not right to buy them in Cuba, Brazil, or Africa?" The convention that year voted to repeal all the laws against slave imports, but the government never acted on its proposal.
The continued smuggling was not without resistance from the slaves themselves. In 1839, a group of fifty-three slaves in Cuba took charge of the ship Amistad that was transporting

them to another part of Cuba. Their goal was to sail back to their homeland in Africa. The slaves had no experience with sailing, and they tried to compel the crew to steer them across the Atlantic. Instead, the ship sailed up the Atlantic coast until it was captured by a ship of the United States Revenue Service. Many Americans, including President Van Buren, thought the slaves should be returned to Cuba. But at the request of a group of abolitionists, former president John Quincy Adams went before the Supreme Court to argue that they should be freed. Adams argued that the foreign slave trade was illegal and thus the Amistad rebels could not be returned to slavery. The Court accepted his argument in 1841, and most of the former slaves were returned to Africa, with funding from American abolitionists.
Two years later, in 1841, another group of slaves revolted on board a ship and took control of it-this time an American vessel bound from Norfolk, Virginia, to New Orleans-and steered it (and its 135 slaves) to the British Bahamas, where slavery was illegal and the slaves were given sanctuary. Such shipboard revolts were rare, but they were symbols of the continued efforts by Africans to resist slavery.
COTTON, SLAVERY, AND THE OLD SOUTH
• 309 Slave Resistance
Few issues have sparked as much debate among historians as the effects of slavery on the blacks themselves. (See "Debating the Past/ pp. 306-307.) Slaveowners, and many white Americans after emancipation, liked to argue that the slaves were generally content, "happy with their lot.” That may have been true in some cases. But it is clear that the vast majority of southern blacks were not content with being slaves, that they yearned for freedom even though most realized there was little they could do to secure it. Evidence for that conclusion can be found, if nowhere else, from the reaction of slaves when emancipation finally came. Virtually all reacted to freedom with joy and celebration; few chose to remain in the service of the whites who had owned them before the Civil War (although most African Americans remained for many years subservient to whites in one way or another).
Rather than contented acceptance, the dominant response of blacks to slavery was a complex one: a combination of adaptation and resistance. At the extremes, slavery could produce two very different reactions, each serving as the basis for a powerful stereotype in white society. One extreme was

The Slaves' Music
O
African Americans living as slaves on southern plantations, there was little leisure t J I time—and little opportunity for the kinds of cultural activities that were beginning to appeal to other groups of Americans, But slaves managed nevertheless to create a culture of their own. And among its most distinctive and pervasive features was music, Indeed, to white observers at least, nothing was more striking about slave life than the role music played within it. African Americans sang frequently, sometimes alone, more often in groups. They sang while they worked together in the fields, as they shucked corn, slaughtered hogs, or repaired fences. They sang whenever they had social gatherings—on Sundays or on the rare other holidays from work. They sang when they gathered for chores in the evenings. They sang during their religious services. And they sang with a passion, at times even an ecstasy, that was completely unfamiliar to whites—and sometimes troubling to them.
Their songs were rarely written down and often seemed entirely spontaneous; but much slave music was really derived from African and Caribbean traditions passed on through generations and from snatches of other songs the performers had heard before and from which they improvised variations. In its emotionalism, its pulsing rhythms, and its lack of conventional formal structure, it resembled nothing its white listeners had ever heard before.
Slaves sang whether or not there were any musical instruments to accompany them, but they often created instruments for themselves out of whatever materials were at hand. "Us take pieces of sheep's rib or cow's jaw or a piece of iron, with an old kettle or a hollow gourd and some horsehair to make the drum," one former slave recalled years later. "They'd take the buffalo horn and scrape it out to make the flute." When they could, they would build banjos, an instrument that had originated in Africa. Their masters sometimes gave them violins and guitars, When the setting permitted it, African Americans danced to their music—dances very different from and much more spontaneous than the formal steps that nineteenth-century whites generally learned. They also used music to accompany
one of their other important cultural traditions: storytelling. Black music on the plantations took a number of forms. The most common was religious songs, the precursors of modern gospel music, which expressed—in terms that their white masters, who usually did not listen to the words very carefully, found acceptable-a faith in their eventual freedom and salvation and often spoke of Africans as a chosen people waiting for redemption. At other times, the songs would express a bitterness toward white slaveholders. The great black abolitionist Frederick Douglass remembered one:
We raise de wheat, Dey gib us de corn; We bake de bread, Dey gib us de crust; We sif the meal,
Dey gib us de huss; We peel de meat, Dey gib us de skin; And dat’s de way Dey take us in;
We skim de pot,
Dey gib us de liquor,
what became known as the "Sambo”the shuffling, grinning, head-scratching, deferential slave who acted out the role that he recognized the white world expected of him. More often than not, the "Sambo” pattern of behavior was a charade, a facade assumed in the presence of whites. The other extreme was the slave rebel-the African American who could not bring himself or herself to either acceptance or accommodation but remained forever rebellious. Actual slave revolts were extremely rare, but the knowledge that they were possible struck terror into the hearts of white southerners everywhere. In 1800, Gabriel Prosser gathered 1,000 rebellious slaves outside Richmond; but two Africans gave the plot away, and the Virginia militia stymied the uprising before it could begin. Prosser and thirty-five others were executed. In 1822, the Charleston free black Denmark Vesey and his followers-ru-mored to total 9,000-made preparations for revolt; but again word leaked out, and suppression and retribution followed. In 1831, Nat Turner, a slave preacher, led a band of African Americans who armed themselves with
guns and axes and, on a summer night, went from house to house in Southampton County, Virginia. They killed sixty white men, women, and children before being overpowered
Prosser and Turner Rebellions
by state and federal troops. More than a hundred blacks were executed in the aftermath. Nat Turner’s was the only large-scale slave insurrection in the nineteenth-century South, but fear of slave conspiracies and renewed violence pervaded the section as long as slavery lasted.
For the most part, however, resistance to slavery took less drastic forms such as running away. A small number of slaves managed to escape to the North or to Canada, especially after sympathetic whites began organizing the so-called underground railroad to assist them in flight. But the odds against a successful escape, particularly from the Deep South, were almost impossibly high. The hazards of distance and the slaves’ ignorance of geography were serious obstacles. So were the white "slave patrols,” which stopped wandering blacks on sight throughout the South demanding to see travel permits. Without such a permit, slaves were presumed to be runaways and were taken captive. Slave patrols often employed bloodhounds to track African Americans who attempted to escape through the woods. Despite all the obstacles to success, however, blacks continued to run away from their masters in large numbers. Some did so repeatedly, undeterred by the whippings and other penalties inflicted on them when captured.

The powerful music that emerged from slavery helped shape the lives of African Americans on the plantations. It also helped lay the foundations for music that almost all Americans later embraced: gospel, blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, rock, and rap. •

To African Americans, music was a treasured avenue of escape from the hardships of slavery. It was also a vehicle through which they could express anger, resentment, and hope. Their masters generally tolerated their slaves' music—and even valued it, both because they often enjoyed listening

3.	What more recent musical forms continue the tradition of the slaves' religious songs or spirituals? In what way do these more recent forms serve purposes similar to the purpose of the slaves' religious songs? Does music continue to shape a distinct African American culture?
But perhaps the most important method of resistance was simply a pattern of everyday behavior by which blacks defied their masters. That whites so often considered blacks to be lazy and shiftless suggests one means of resistance: refusal to work hard.
Some slaves stole from their masters or from neighboring whites. Some performed isolated acts of sabotage: losing or Slave	breaking tools (southern planters gradually

subtle methods of rebellion.
THE CULTURE OF SLAVERY
Resistance was only part of the slave response to slavery. Another was an elaborate process of adaptation. The process did not imply contentment with bondage. It represented a recognition that there was no realistic alternative. One of the ways blacks adapted was by developing their own, separate culture, one that enabled them to sustain a sense of racial pride and unity.
Language and Music
In many areas, slaves retained a language of their own, sometimes incorporating African speech patterns into English. Having arrived in America speaking many different African languages, the first generations of slaves had as much difficulty communicating with one another as they did with white people. To overcome these barriers, they learned a simple, com-Pidgin	mon lan£ua£e (known to linguists as
"pidgin”). It retained some African words, but it drew primarily, if selectively, from English. And while slave language grew more sophisticated as blacks spent more time in America-and as new generations grew up never having known African tongues-some features of this early pidgin survived in black speech for many generations.
Music was especially important in slave society. In some ways, it was as important to African Americans as language.
Most important were voices and song. Field workers often used songs to pass the time in the fields; since they sang them in the presence of whites, they usually attached
relatively innocuous words to them. But African Americans also created emotionally rich and politically challenging music
Importance of Slave Spirituals
311
312 ® CHAPTER 11
in the relative privacy of their religious services. It was there that the tradition of the spiritual emerged in the early nineteenth century.
African American Religion
A separate slave religion was not supposed to exist. Almost all African Americans were Christians by the early nineteenth century. Some had converted voluntarily, and some were coerced by their masters and by the Protestant missionaries who evangelized among them. Masters expected their slaves to worship under the supervision of white ministers. Indeed, autonomous black churches were banned by law; and many slaves became members of the same denominations as their owners-usually Baptist or Methodist. In the 1840s and 1850s, as slavery expanded in the South, missionary efforts increased. Vast numbers of African Americans became members of Protestant churches in those years.
Nevertheless, blacks throughout the South developed their own version of Christianity, at times incorporating into it such practices as voodoo or other polytheistic religious traditions of Africa. Or they simply bent religion to the special circumstances of bondage. Natural leaders emerging within the slave community rose to the rank of preacher.
African American religion was often more emotional than that of its white counterparts and reflected the influence of African customs and practices. Slave prayer meetings routinely involved fervent chanting, spontaneous exclamations from the congregation, and ecstatic conversion experiences. Black religion was also more joyful and affirming than that of many white denominations. And above all, African American religion emphasized the dream of freedom and deliverance. In their prayers and songs and sermons, black Christians talked and sang of the day when the Lord would "call us home,” "deliver us to freedom,” "take us to the Promised Land.” And while their white masters generally chose to interpret such language merely as the expression of hopes for life after death, many
_	African Americans themselves used the im-

Christian images, and biblical injunctions, were central to Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, and others who planned or engaged in open resistance to slavery.
In cities and towns in the South, some African Americans had their own churches, where free blacks occasionally worshiped alongside slaves. In the countryside, however, slaves usually attended the same churches as their masters-sometimes a chapel on the plantation itself, sometimes a church serving a larger farm community. Seating in such churches was usually segregated. Slaves sat in the rear or in balconies. They held their own services later, often in secret, usually at night.
The Slave Family
The slave family was the other crucial institution of black culture in the South. Like religion, it suffered from certain legal
restrictions-most notably the lack of legal marriage. Nevertheless, what we now call the "nuclear family consistently emerged as the dominant kinship model among African Americans.
Such families did not always operate according to white customs. Black women generally began bearing children et younger ages than most white women, often as early as age fourteen or fifteen. Slave communities did not condemn pre-
marital pregnancy in the way white society did, and African American couples would often begin liv-
Marriages ing t0Sether before marrying. It was cus-tomary, however, for couples to marry-in a ceremony involving formal vows—soon after conceiving a child. Often, marriages occurred between slaves living on neighboring plantations. Husbands and wives sometimes visited each other with the permission of their masters, but often such visits had to be in secret, at night. Family ties were no less strong than those of whites, and many slave marriages
lasted throughout the course of long lifetimes.
When marriages did not survive, it was often because of circumstances over which blacks had no control. Up to a third of all black families were broken apart by the slave trade; an average slave might expect during a lifetime to see ten or more relatives sold. And that accounted for some of the other distinctive characteristics of the black family, which adapted itself to the cruel realities of its own uncertain future. Extended kinship networks- which grew to in-Importance	elude not only spouses and their children,
of Kinship	but a^so aunts, uncles, grandparents, even
Networks distant cousins-were strong and important and often helped compensate for the breakup of nuclear families. A slave forced suddenly to move to a new area, far from his or her family, might create fictional kinship ties and become "adopted” by a family in the new community. Even so, the impulse to maintain contact with a spouse and children remained strong long after the breakup of a family. One of the most frequent causes of flight from the plantation was a slave's desire to find a husband, wife, or
child who had been sent elsewhere.
It was not only by breaking up families through sale that whites intruded on black family life. Black women, usually powerless to resist the sexual advances of their masters, often bore the children of whites-children whom the whites almost never recognized as their own and who were consigned to slavery from birth.
In addition to establishing social and cultural institutions of their own, slaves adapted themselves to slavery by forming complex relationships with their masters. However much blacks resented their lack of freedom, they often found it difficult to maintain an entirely hostile attitude toward their owners. Not only were they dependent on whites for the ma-
Paternal serial means of existence food, clothing,
Nature of and shelter; they also often derived from
Slavery their masters a sense of security and protection. There was, in short, a paternal relationship between slave and master- sometimes harsh, sometimes kindly, but almost invariably important. Paternalism,
COTTON, SLAVERY, AND THE OLD SOUTH - 313
in fact, became (even if not always consciously) a vital instrument of white control. By creating a sense of mutual dependence, whites helped reduce resistance to an institution that, in essence, served only the interests of the ruling race.
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
LOOKING BACK
While the North was creating a complex and rapidly developing commercial-industrial economy, the South was expanding its agrarian economy without making many fundamental changes in its character. Great migrations took many southern whites, and even more African American slaves, into new agricultural areas in the Deep South, where they created a booming "cotton kingdom” that raised crops for export around the world. The cotton economy created many great fortunes and some modest ones. It also entrenched the planter class as the dominant force within southern society-both as owners of vast numbers of slaves, and as patrons, creditors, landlords, and marketers for the large number of poor whites who lived on the edge of the planter world.
The differences between the North and the South were a result of differences in natural resources, social structure, climate, and culture. Above all, they were the result of the existence within the South of an unfree labor system that prevented the kind of social fluidity that an industrializing society usually requires and that kept a large proportion of the southern population in debilitating bondage.

GIRLS’ EVENING SCHOOL (C. 1840), ANONYMOUS
Schooling for women, which expanded significantly in the mid-nineteenth century, included training in domestic arts (as indicated by the sewing table at right), as well as in reading, writing, and other basic skills. (fe The Granger Collection, New York) SETTING THE STAGE
THE UNITED STATES IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY
was a rapidly changing y growing in size, population, and economic complexity. Many Americans were excited by the new possibilities these changes produced. Others, however, were painfully aware of the challenges to traditional values and institutions, the social instability, the increasing inequality, and the uncertainty about the future that accompanied change.
One result of these conflicting attitudes was the emergence of a broad array of movements intended to reform the nation. These reform efforts generally reflected one of two basic impulses. The first was an optimistic faith in human nature, a belief that within every individual resided a spirit that was basically good and that society should attempt to unleash. A second impulse was a desire for order and control. With their traditional values and institutions under assault and often eroding, many Americans yearned above all for a restoration of stability and discipline to their nation. Often, this impulse embodied a conservative nostalgia for better, simpler times. But it also inspired forward-looking efforts to create new institutions of social control, suited to the realities of the new age.
The reforms that flowed from these two impulses came in many guises and mobilized many different groups. In the course of the 1840s, however, one issue—slavery—came to overshadow all others. And one group of reformers the abolitionists—became the most visible of all, At that point, the reform impulse, which at first had been a force that tended to unify the sections, became another wedge between the North and the South.
THE ROMANTIC IMPULSE

Aspirations
"In the four quarters of the globe/’ wrote the English wit Sydney Smith in 1820, "who reads an American book? or goes to an American play? or looks at an American picture or statue?” The answer, he assumed, was obvious: no one. American intellectuals were fully aware of the low regard in which Europeans held their artistic and intellectual life. In the middle decades of the nineteenth century, they continued to work for both an elevation and a liberation of their nation’s culture-for the
creation of an American artistic world independent of Europe, one that would express their nation’s special virtues.
At the same time, however, some of the nation’s cultural leaders were beginning to strive for another kind of liberation, one that would eventually overshadow their self-conscious nationalism. That impulse-which was, ironically, largely an import from Europe-was the spirit of romanticism. In literature, philosophy, art, even in politics and economics, American intellectuals were committing themselves to the liberation of the human spirit.
Nationalism and Romanticism in American Painting
When Sydney Smith asked in 1820 who looked at an American painting, he was expressing the belief among European artists that they-and they alone-stood at the center of the world of art. But in the United States, many people were looking at American paintings in the antebellum era-and they were doing so not because the paintings introduced them to the great traditions of Europe, but because they believed Americans were creating important new artistic traditions.
The most important and popular American paintings of the first half of the nineteenth century set out to evoke the wonder of the nation’s landscape. Unlike their European counterparts, American painters did not favor gentle scenes of carefully cultivated countrysides. They sought instead to capture the undiluted power of nature by portraying some of the nation’s wildest and most spectacular areas-to evoke what many nineteenth-century people called the 'sublime,” the feeling of awe and wonderment and even fear of the grandeur of nature The first great school of American painters emerged in New York. Frederic ChurcK Thomas Cole, Thomas Doughty, and Asher Durand-known, along with others, as the Hudson Rtver School-pamted the spectacular
