The Great War
World War I, 1914–1918
 On May 7, 1915, Ernest Cowper was chatting with a friend aboard the Lusitania, a British passenger ship traveling from New York to the British Isles, as it passed the lush, green coast of Ireland. Looking into the water, Cowper suddenly felt a stab of terror when he spotted a German torpedo just seconds before it hit the ship. Peering through the periscope the German submarine captain watched hundreds of people jumping into the water in a desperate attempt to reach empty lifeboats. The ship sank within 18 minutes, killing 1,198 passengers, including 128 Americans. Cowper, a Toronto newsman whose vivid recollections soon appeared in American newspapers, was one of the lucky survivors. The sinking of the Lusitania was a defining moment for the United States during World War I, often also called the Great War. The nation had remained neutral when the war began nine months earlier in August 1914, refusing to chose sides among the European powers involved, led by Great Britain, France, and Russia (the Allies) on one side and Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers) on the other. When, however, the war spread to the high seas and American business initiated a lucrative arms trade with Britain and France, Americans increasingly found themselves in the line of fire. American newspapers highlighted the tragic deaths of innocent women and children on the Lusitania, stirring outrage against Germany. One U.S. news report described the corpse of a mother embracing her three-month old baby, noting that “her face wears a half smile. Her baby’s head rests against her breast. No one has tried to separate them.” This description inspired the first American war-era propaganda poster, pictured here. The image, by Fred Spear, showed a mother and her baby sinking into the depths of the sea accompanied by one word—“Enlist.” Not all Americans, however, blamed Germany for the attack. German Americans claimed that the Lusitania was secretly transporting munitions from New York to Britain. Rural Americans castigated Northeast business interests for trading primarily with the Allies, fearful that favoring Britain and its allies would draw America into the war. President Woodrow Wilson offered a competing vision of the Lusitania’s importance. Through increasingly strident diplomacy Wilson decided to defend the rights of neutrals to travel wherever they liked. This stance put the United States on a collision course with Germany that resulted in America entering the war two years later. Once America declared war, Wilson gave the country a larger purpose than defeating Germany. Introducing a new, and controversial, vision of American global leadership, he promised to achieve a lasting peace by spreading democracy worldwide. To mobilize the nation’s resources to fight the grim trench warfare underway along the Western Front, the government unfurled a far-reaching propaganda campaign, offered unprecedented support to labor unions, and raised a mass army through conscription. Americans suffered severe casualties in a short time, and their war effort helped the Allies defeat Germany by November 1918. The nation expected a peace treaty that embodied Wilson’s promise to make this conflict “the war to end all wars.” Americans held conflicting visions, however, over how to achieve this goal.

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

The Decision for War
 In the summer of 1914, Europe ignited as war swept across the continent (20.1). Instead of the easy victory that many Europeans expected, the war turned into a prolonged global struggle that took the lives of millions of men. World War I pitted the Allies, initially composed of Britain, France, Belgium, Serbia, and Russia, and eventually totaling 18 nations including Japan, Italy, and the United States, against the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary, who were joined by the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Most Europeans rushed into battle without considering what a general war would mean. Americans, however, followed a completely different road to war, openly debating whether this was their war to fight. It took two and a half years for the United States to enter the war. By then few illusions remained about the horror of modern warfare. Unlike Europeans in 1914 Americans knew they were committing to total war—and that winning would require the complete economic and psychological mobilization of the home front.

The War in Europe
 On June 28, 1914, a 19-year-old Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip arrived in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, as part of a terrorist band that intended to assassinate the heir to the AustroHungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was also visiting the city. Princip belonged to the Black Hand, a Slavic nationalist group based in the neighboring Kingdom of Serbia that longed to unite Bosnia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with Serbia. The group’s first attempt to assassinate the archduke failed when the bomb that one of Princip’s coconspirators threw at the archduke’s motorcade bounced off the side of his car, injuring two Austrian officers instead. Eluding the police Princip disappeared into the crowd. Later in the day the archduke made a fateful decision to visit his injured staff members. On the way to the hospital, the driver made a wrong turn down a narrow street and slowed down to put the car in reverse. Standing at the end of the street was Princip, who could barely believe his good fortune as he saw the archduke and his wife coming toward him. Seizing the opportunity he stepped forward, pulled a pistol from his pocket, and fired, killing them both. World War I began with these two deaths and ended four years later with over nine million more. In responding to the assassination, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Germany tried to leverage the crisis to fulfill longstanding territorial ambitions. These events are summarized on the timeline, “Countdown to War, 1914” (20.2).

 What role did nationalism and imperialism play in bringing about World War I?

 “Mr. Mayor, it is perfectly outrageous! We have come to Sarajevo on a visit and have had a bomb thrown at us.” ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND after surviving the Black Hand’s first assassination attempt

 Austria-Hungary and Russia vied for control of the Balkans, which offered ready access to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Germany hoped to become the dominant power in Europe and had recently challenged the world dominance of France and Britain by building a strong navy, acquiring colonies, and defeating France in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible for the assassination and demanded that the Serbian government make amends. In response Serbia chose appeasement over confrontation. Serbia accepted all of Austria-Hungary’s demands except the one insisting that Austro-Hungarian judges and police participate in the investigation and trials of any Black Hand terrorists captured in Serbia. In early July, German Kaiser Wilhelm II encouraged AustriaHungary to quickly invade and punish Serbia. But on July 28, when the Kaiser finally read the Serbian response, he jotted in the margins: “a great moral victory for Vienna; but with it every reason for war

 is removed.” His comments came too late. An hour later, on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. As Austro-Hungarian warships on the Danube River bombarded Belgrade, Serbia’s capital city, Russia resolved to stand by Serbia and defend its own interests in the Balkans. Tsar Nicolas II ordered a general mobilization of his army on July 30, 1914. It was a momentous decision. Germany viewed Russia’s mobilization as a direct threat. Ever since the 1894 alliance between Russia and France, Germany had worried about fighting a two-front war. In 1905, the German Chief of Staff Alfred von Schlieffen developed a plan that called for Germany, in the event of war, to attack and quickly defeat France in the west, while the cumbersome Russian army mobilized in the east. The Schlieffen Plan avoided the well-defended border between France and Germany and instead sent German troops on a northward arc. Passing quickly through Belgium, German troops would enter France through its unfortified northern border and capture Paris within six weeks. Germany could then turn its full forces against the much larger Russian army. For the Schlieffen Plan to work, Germany needed to strike first. With Russia refusing to halt its mobilization, Germany declared war on Russia on August 1, 1914, and put a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan into motion. Two days later Germany declared war on France. When German troops crossed into Belgium on August 4, Britain declared war on Germany, fulfilling its 1839 pledge to guarantee Belgium independence and neutrality. The Schlieffen Plan quickly unraveled. The Germans encountered unexpected resistance from the Belgians and had difficulty resupplying a mass army on the move, giving the French and British time to mobilize. In the east Russia attacked with its partly mobilized army sooner than Germany expected, prompting German Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke to divert troops from France to defend East Prussia. At the Marne River, 35 miles northeast of Paris, the French and British successfully stopped the German drive toward Paris. Instead of defeating France quickly, Germany’s attack ignited a general European war. As each army dug defensive trenches in France and Belgium, the trench deadlock of the Western Front took shape. For nearly four years men would live and die in the complex system of earthworks that ran for 460 miles from the North Sea to Switzerland. To bolster their forces, Britain,

 What miscalculations stymied German expectations of a short war?

 France, and Germany began immediately enlisting men and resources from their colonies. When the Ottoman Empire (which ruled Turkey and most of the Middle East) joined the Central Powers and Japan and Italy joined the Allies, the conflict became a true world war. American society contained many first- and second-generation immigrants from both the Central Powers and the Allied nations who disagreed over which nation had started the war. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson believed that all belligerents shared collective responsibility for the war. Wanting both to stay out of the war and prevent bitter divisions from ripping America apart, Wilson proclaimed the United States neutral.

The Perils of Neutrality
 As war engulfed Europe Wilson advised Americans to avoid “passionately taking sides” and to “remain impartial in thought, as well as action.” Neutrality, however, turned out to be a difficult concept for Americans to define and maintain. Did it mean trading with both sides selectively, or with no one? Did Americans have the right as members of a neutral nation to travel wherever they liked without coming under attack? The conflicting visions that emerged as Americans confronted these questions created strident debate as the war wore on. The dilemma was how to remain neutral without inflicting serious damage on the American economy. Since the 1890s, American foreign policy had focused on protecting American business interests abroad (see Chapter 19). Cutting off trade completely with Europe would have had severe consequences for Americans. At first Wilson tried to limit America’s financial involvement in the war by banning private American bank loans to the belligerent nations. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan believed the ban would “hasten a conclusion to the war” by making it impossible for the warring countries to buy what they needed to continue fighting. Wilson, however, lifted the ban in 1915. The Allies were running short of cash, and Wilson feared a widespread U.S. recession if these nations stopped buying American goods. Trading with or loaning money to both sides was another possible way to stay neutral. In theory American manufacturers and banks were free to do business with both the Allies and Germany. In practice, however, the chart of U.S. Exports to Europe, 1914– 1917 (20.3) reveals that they chose primarily to help the Allies. By 1917, American banks were loaning

 Britain an average of $10 million a day. In contrast American trade with Germany had dropped to less than one percent of what it had been in 1914. Even if American manufacturers and banks had wanted to help Germany, trade became nearly impossible when Britain used its navy to blockade Germany and cut the international cable between the United States and Germany. America’s financial elite, however, had no desire to trade with both sides. Many upper-class Americans revered British culture and had warm feelings toward the French. Widespread publicity of German atrocities against Belgian civilians also fanned anti-German sentiment. Newspapers published vivid accounts of German soldiers burning homes, ransacking museums, and executing Belgian civilians in retaliation for guerilla attacks against the German army. The press embellished these stories with fabricated tales of German soldiers cutting off women’s breasts and children’s hands. Some Americans saw such reports as little more than British propaganda. America’s disproportionate aid to the Allies alarmed the sizable German American and Irish American communities (the latter hated British rule of Ireland). Midwesterners and Southerners accused Eastern banks of violating the principle of neutrality, thereby pulling the nation slowly into a war most Americans did not want to fight. These critics embraced a strict vision of neutrality and wanted the government to announce an arms embargo that would prevent American companies from trading with nations at war. When the war spread to the high seas, these conflicting visions provoked heated debate over America’s role in the war. Facing a trench stalemate

 on the Western Front, Britain used its superior navy to establish a blockade around the Central Powers that included mining the North Sea. The blockade immediately affected American trade. American ships could not sail through the North Sea to Germany without first allowing the British to search their cargo for contraband, merchandise such as guns or ammunition that Britain wanted to stop from entering Germany. Britain soon violated international law by adding cotton and food to the contraband list. In March 1915, Wilson formally protested British blockading practices. The British eventually agreed to buy enough American cotton to offset the loss of the German market. The president proved less accommodating when Germany declared the waters around Britain a war zone and threatened to attack any ship that entered the area. To combat the British blockade, Germany turned to a new weapon, its U-boat, or submarine, to launch surprise torpedo attacks against Allied merchant and naval ships. International law recognized a naval blockade as a legal weapon of war, but required that the attacking ship give the merchant vessel’s crew time to evacuate, and if necessary, take them aboard before sinking the ship and cargo. These prewar rules rendered the U-boat useless, removing the element of surprise that made it so effective. Once spotted, armed merchant vessels did not hesitate to attack fragile U-boats. On May 7, 1915, a German U-boat sunk the Lusitania, a British passenger ship sailing off the coast of Ireland. Calls for war swept through the press. “Germany must surely have gone mad,” surmised one Richmond newspaper. Wilson sent a

STONE to President Wilson, 1916 20.4 German Warning to Travelers in the War Zone When Wilson criticized Germany for sinking the Lusitania, German Americans pointed out that the German government had published warnings like this ahead of time urging Americans to stay off ships headed to the war zone.

 series of notes demanding that Germany pay reparations and accept the right of Americans to travel on any ship they wished. The Germans defended the sinking, pointing out that they had published warnings to passengers in American newspapers (20.4) and claiming that the Lusitania was carrying munitions as part of its cargo. The Lusitania sinking was an ideological turning point for the United States. In reaction to the crisis, Wilson redefined the meaning of neutrality, thus putting the United States on a collision course with Germany. The president moved away from his initial definition of neutrality as remaining “impartial in thought, as well as action.” He now embraced neutrality as a concept that first and foremost gave neutral nations the indisputable right to trade and travel wherever they liked. Secretary of State Bryan urged Wilson to ban Americans from traveling on ships headed to the U-boat–patrolled waters around Great Britain. Wilson refused. Convinced that the president’s preoccupation with the rights of neutrals would lead to war, Bryan resigned in protest.

 Why was the sinking of the Lusitania a turning point in the neutrality debate?

 “I cannot consent to any abridgement of the rights of American citizens in any respect. The honor and self-respect of the nation is involved.” WILSON’S reply

 As the United States and Germany argued over the Lusitania, a German U-boat sunk another British passenger ship, the Arabic, in August 1915, leaving two Americans among the dead. Worried about further provoking the United States, on September 1, 1915, Germany issued the Arabic Pledge, promising not to sink passenger ships without warning. Germany renounced surprise attacks on merchant ships in May 1916 following another controversial torpedoing. For the moment these pledges averted war with the United States. The debate deepened when prominent pro-Ally political, business, and financial leaders formed the National Security League and began lobbying for universal military training to instruct all men of fighting age in drilling and marksmanship. In response Progressive reformers formed the American Union Against Militarism to denounce preparations for war. The appeal of the pacifist vision made the 1916 song “I Didn’t Raise My Son to be a Soldier” a hit. Taking stock of the preparedness versus peace debate, Congress authorized only a modest, but still controversial, expansion of the peacetime army. Recognizing the potency of antiwar sentiment, Wilson ran for reelection in 1916 on the slogan “He Kept Us Out of War.” The banners covering a Wilson reelection campaign truck (20.5) revealed the strong connections that he drew between domestic and foreign issues. Wilson reminded voters of his Progressive reform agenda, which included a Federal Reserve System that “broke the money trust” and passage of an eight-hour day for railroad workers (see Chapter 18). The slogan “Peace with Honor” referred to his success in securing pledges from Germany that respected America’s right to trade with the Allies. This overseas commerce created the prosperity that Democrats boasted about on the same sign. During the campaign Wilson noted that twice he had sent his trusted advisor

 Europe to negotiate a peace settlement, lamenting that House had returned empty-handed each time. Wilson also campaigned on the slogan of preparedness to underscore his commitment to defending the country if necessary. In contrast Wilson’s Republican challenger, former Supreme Court Justice Charles Evan Hughes, never developed an effective slogan or theme. The Hughes campaign believed that Woodrow Wilson had won the presidency in 1912 because progressive Republicans had supported Theodore Roosevelt’s run as a thirdparty Progressive candidate over the incumbent Republican President William Howard Taft (see Chapter 18). With the conservative and progressive factions of the Republican Party now reunited, Hughes tried to avoid controversy with vague calls “for law and liberty” and “undiluted Americanism.” On election night, with returns from California still uncounted, Wilson went to bed certain that he had lost. He awoke to discover that he had carried California and won reelection by only 23 electoral votes, 277–254. Foreign affairs now dominated Wilson’s thoughts. Throughout 1914–1917, German spies spent nearly $12 million to support rebel factions in Mexico, who resented the U.S. government’s intervention in Mexican domestic politics. In 1916, Francisco “Pancho” Villa raided American border towns, hoping to draw U.S. troops into Mexico and destabilize the new U.S.-backed constitutional government headed by Venustiano Carranza. Much as Villa anticipated, Wilson sent a 12,000-troop punitive expedition under the command of Brigadier General John J. Pershing into Mexico to arrest Villa. Carranza denounced the American expedition as an invasion of Mexico. Tensions between the two countries escalated dramatically after a deadly clash in Carrizal on June 21, 1916. Wilson began planning for war with Mexico until he learned that American

 troops had attacked first at Carrizal. After months of talks between U.S. and Mexican negotiators, American troops left Mexico in January 1917. That same month Wilson tried again to negotiate a European peace settlement. On January 22, 1917, he outlined a plan for “peace without victory” based on “American principles, American policies.” Democracy, freedom of the seas, no entangling alliances, and equality of rights among nations were, Wilson asserted, “the principles and policies of forward-looking men and women everywhere, of every modern nation, of every enlightened community.” Wilson’s desire to export democracy overseas while simultaneously protecting American access to foreign markets promised to greatly expand America’s imperial reach. No longer limiting American intervention to its Pacific colonies or nearby Latin American countries (see Chapter 19), Wilson proposed remaking Europe in the image of America. His words had little effect on European leaders. Unbeknownst to the president, Germany had

 CHAPTER 20

THE GREAT WAR: WORLD WAR I, 1914–1918

The War at Home
 America could not mobilize, supply, and feed an army without granting new powers to the federal government. The federal government used a mix of incentives, threats, and patriotic appeals to negotiate the preexisting class, gender, and racial conflicts that threatened to make wartime cooperation difficult. Official propaganda urged unity, but Americans retained conflicting visions about regulating big business, unionizing, female suffrage, and racial equality.

Gearing Up for War


20.7 “Little
Americans Do
Your Bit!”
 This propaganda poster showing a three-year-old saluting a bowl of corn-based porridge underscored the total mobilization of American society.

 Wilson’s democratic rhetoric convinced many Progressive reformers that they could count on the president to use his wartime powers to rein in big business (see Chapter 18). The president, however, feared that the war would make corporations more powerful than ever. “We shall be dependent upon the steel, oil, and financial magnates,” Wilson privately worried. “They will run the nation.” His concerns were well-founded. Increased wages and federal protections for unions improved the lives of many workers, but the resurgent power of big business prevented Progressives from making these wartime reforms permanent. In the winter of 1917, gridlock paralyzed the railroad system. Blizzards, fuel shortages, and poor coordination among private railway companies prevented trains from delivering tons of war-related freight. Labor unrest also created havoc as skilled railway workers left in droves for better-paying factory jobs, and railway unions prepared to strike. To sort out this mess, the federal government took over management of the railroads for the

 duration of the war. The Railroad Administration met union demands for high wages, standardized equipment, and coordinated the use of tracks. To improve the flow of needed materials, the new War Industries Board (WIB) ranked industries, so that those most critical to the war effort received raw materials ahead of nonessential wartime businesses. Steel, for example, went first to manufacturers producing guns and ships, while factories making civilian cars, freezers, and corsets (they needed steel for the inner stays) had to wait. The government paid railroad companies handsomely for wartime use of their trains and track to mute their objections to government management of the railroads. When private companies regained control of railroad lines in 1920, the nation’s railroad network lay in shambles, a victim of heavy wartime traffic and the government’s failure to maintain the lines. Food Administration Director Herbert Hoover chose a different path to ensure that the country produced enough to feed civilians at home, soldiers, and refugees overseas. Congress had given the president near dictatorial powers to regulate the food and fuel industries in the 1917 Lever Food and Fuel Act. Hoover, however, opted to use high prices and patriotic appeals to control the nation’s food supply rather than rationing. To stimulate production, he had the American and Allied governments pay high prices for agricultural goods. To curb civilian demand, Hoover organized a massive propaganda campaign around the slogan “food will win the war.” Citizens signed pledge cards vowing to observe wheatless Mondays, meatless Tuesdays, and porkless Saturdays. Urging Americans to conserve wheat for shipment overseas, the Food Administration plastered the country with posters that tried to popularize cornmeal, which did not transport well, as a tasty substitute for wheat flour. The agency offered housewives cornmeal recipes and cooking classes, and even tried to enlist the cooperation of finicky toddlers (20.7) by urging them to eat cornmeal instead of oatmeal.
